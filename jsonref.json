Experts say this may be because buses and trains can be crowded, making social distancing near-impossible. Coronavirus cases in the US officially surpassed 2million last night - the equivalent of two in every seven confirmed infections worldwide. Every state has relaxed some lockdown restrictions imposed in the peak of the crisis, despite the illness continuing to spread across the nation.  Health experts also fear a spike in Covid cases after protests against police brutality inflicted upon African Americans following the killing of George Floyd. Germany\u0027s transport use suddenly began to plummet on March 11, two days after the first coronavirus deaths were recorded in North Rhine-Westphalia.Rates for all forms of travel continued to drop sharply until March 21, the day before the government banned gatherings of more than two people.  Apple data shows the navigation requests remained at a level rate until the first week of April, when driving and walking levels started to rise again.  Public transport usage has still yet to pick up. Data for June shows it was at 87.8 - or 12.2 per cent below levels recorded on January 13. However, walking and driving rates were 115.1 and 112.6, respectively. Both have been above 100 since May 28, according to the figures.Driving requests have also increased over the past month in Russia, France and Italy - and rates are now higher in Sweden than they were before Covid-19. Apple data also shows navigation requests are also rapidly increasing in Brazil, which is at the centre of the rapidly escalating outbreak in South America. The tech giant uses its Apple Maps app to measure how people use different means of transport. It does not take into account actual travel, and all the recorded data is anonymised to ease privacy concerns.  "},{"url":null,"title":"New York City enters phase one coronavrius lockdown reopening","story":"Share this article   The threshold for hospitalizations per day in order to continue reopening lies at under 200 a day and there were just 48 hospitalizations on Wednesday. ICU patients are also below the threshold. There are now 354 patients in ICU in the city.  The rate of those testing positive for coronavirus in New York City has now dropped to three percent, well below the 15 percent threshold.This is the lowest rate of positive tests seen in the city since the start of the pandemic, de Blasio added. ICU space, hospitalizations and positive test rates were three of the main factors holding back the city\u0027s reopening. As of Saturday there were 203,400 confirmed cases of coronavirus in New York City. There were also more than 17,000 confirmed coronavirus deaths and a further 4,702 deaths that are thought probable to have been linked to the disease.  The news of NYC\u0027s latest time frame for phase two came after Governor Andrew Cuomo announced Wednesday that restaurants in the seven regions of the state that have already entered phase two of reopening can reopen for outdoor dining from Thursday.Restaurants that reopen must follow social distancing guidelines, including placing outdoor tables six feet apart, all staff must wear face masks, and customers must also wear face masks when not seated.\u0027We are continuously evaluating activities that can be safely reopened, and today we are adding outdoor seating at restaurants to phase two,\u0027 said Cuomo.The latest easing of coronavirus lockdown restrictions applies to the seven regions that have entered the second phase of the four-step reopening plan, which includes the Capital Region, Central New York, the Finger Lakes, the Mohawk Valley, the North Country, the Southern Tier and Western New York.The areas that will have to wait longer for outdoor dining include Long Island and the mid-Hudson Valley, which entered the first phase of reopening last week, and New York City. As the virus epicenter of the world not long ago, New York City trails behind the other regions in the states in the reopening phases. Restaurants and bars were some of the first businesses shuttered in the state back on March 16 to help slow the spread of coronavirus. Many stayed open for takeout and delivery service but this has not been enough to limit the widespread job losses across the industry.  Nationwide, the restaurant and bar industry has been hardest hit by the pandemic, with stark data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and collated by the National Restaurant Association revealing that a staggering six million US restaurant workers have lost their jobs during the pandemic.        New York City reopens under Phase One on MondayNew York City Begins Reopening After 3 Months of Outbreak and Hardship - The New York Times"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5886eb7f5e8ddaf92411d00b8a6342d57253b466/0_1714_4504_2702/master/4504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2474aa4c1774e02a818a717de5779d0e","title":"overnight weve all had to completely change how we work how one london school is preparing to reopen","story":"Andrea Parker, headteacher of Bonneville primary school in south London, tells Rosie Mullender about the extensive work behind the scenes to keep pupils and staff safe as the school reopens its doorsThe air outside Bonneville primary school in Clapham, south London, is filled with the smell of freshly sprayed paint. Bright-yellow stripes are being applied to the pavement at now-familiar two-metre intervals outside the school’s three sets of gates, and over the next few days, these markers will appear in classrooms, too. In between, dedicated routes will be laid out to take children safely from the school gates to their classroom doors.These plans, orchestrated by Bonneville’s headteacher, Andrea Parker, were being rolled out as the school prepared to reopen its doors to reception, year 1 and year 6 pupils in line with the latest government guidelines. Schools, colleges and nurseries across England welcomed more children and students from 1 June onwards – and headteachers like Parker are busy preparing to embrace a new way of learning.“For every headteacher, keeping children safe is going to be at the top of their priorities”, says Parker, who is also the lead headteacher for Jessop primary and Stockwell primary schools. “We began our preparations by sending out a survey to check the pulse of how teachers and parents were feeling about returning to school. From there, we were able to start modelling what we need to do to support our families, and help them to feel more confident in sending their children back.”Since lockdown, the school has continued to take in around 25 of its 420 pupils each day, split into smaller groups for safety – the children of key workers, those from vulnerable families, or with education, health and care plans in place. “We’ve been open every day during lockdown,” says Parker. “Staff members even volunteered to work through the holidays, which has been fantastic.”Meanwhile, those teachers who have remained at home have been working on providing the online resources parents need for home schooling. “Overnight, we’ve all had to completely change how we work on a day-to-day basis with no training and no transition period, and teachers have been working incredibly hard to achieve that,” she says.At the same time, Parker believes temporary home schooling can’t replace the benefits of schools-based education, especially when it comes to the transitions experienced by those children who will begin returning to school from 1 June.“Reception, year 1 and year 6 are all key milestones,” she says. “Younger children are in the early stages of their education, and we want to be there for them as they develop their reading and friendship groups, and simply learn how to learn.“At the other end of the spectrum, year 6 are about to go to secondary school. It’s a time when they celebrate their SATs and everything they’ve achieved and worked hard for.”The Bonneville school building, which dates back to 1905, is large and welcoming. When I visit, days before reopening, crafted cardboard models of sea animals hang from the ceilings, and children’s work covers every inch of spare space on the walls.With only a fraction of the school’s 420 pupils in attendance – including Parker’s own six-year-old daughter, who is in school as the child of a key worker – the sound of children’s laughter, which usually fills these hallways, can only faintly be heard drifting in from the playground.“Our teachers are very excited and as desperate to see the children as I am,” she says. “They’re anxious, too, but going through our risk assessments with them has helped a lot.“With fewer children coming back to start with, we don’t need everybody to be here, which means those who are very anxious can be asked to come back later on. Hopefully they’ll see how things are working and their confidence will build – some people just need that, much like the parents who need to have a choice.”Home schooling for those children who remain at home will continue to be supported by teachers, but to reassure those who do send their children in, a raft of safety measures has been put in place.At the school gates, parents are required to socially distance from each other (guided by those painted stripes) during staggered drop-offs. “Bubbles” of up to 15 children will be dropped off together, with an allocated “bubble lead” – the class teacher – taking students into the building in shifts.Before entering their classroom, they sanitise their hands before being allocated a desk each for taking lessons, watching pre-recorded assemblies, and eating lunch, which will be delivered at the door. Outside space will be utilised for lessons as much as possible, while playtime and PE will be enjoyed within the children’s inidual groups.“Although younger children will be in smaller groups, it’s not just about the size of each bubble – it’s about dynamics as well,” says Parker. “Children are people with their own personalities and their own way of being, so we have to make sure each one is a manageable group and dynamic.”Extra hygiene measures include specific play and sports equipment allocated to each bubble, regular handwashing, staggered bathroom breaks followed by janitor cleaning, and early closing on Friday afternoons for deep-cleaning sessions. The early Friday closure will also be used to facilitate statutory planning and preparation time for teachers. The school has also drawn up sets of principles that parents, teachers and children will be asked to adhere to.For staff, these include having an awareness of each other – for example, no more than two teachers in the staffroom at a time. For children, the principles include reinforcing the NHS’s Catch it, Bin it, Kill it messaging. For parents, coming to collect children as quickly as possible if they fall ill.Bonneville has also worked to tailor specific solutions to the erse community the school serves. “In terms of the country Lambeth is hugely erse”, says Parker, citing the borough’s significant Caribbean, African and Asian communities, as well as pupils from Spanish-, French- and Portuguese-speaking backgrounds.“We know that the BAME community have surfaced as being prone to having a higher rate of infection”, says Parker, explaining that the school’s risk assessment process is being developed with the heightened vulnerability of BAME students, staff and their wider community in mind.Communicating to children why their schools have changed is a crucial part of helping them adapt to their new regimes, so Parker plans to share a virtual tour of the new school layout with pupils, and plug lessons about the roles of key workers into the curriculum.Parker’s plans have focused on building confidence among children, staff and parents, and communicating with them every step of the way. “It’s about trying to adapt, even though we don’t know how long we’re going to be adapting for,” she says.Check with your Local Authority for the latest news on schools opening in your area.This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Here’s our roundup of\u0026nbspyour comments and photos\u0026nbspfrom the last week.Because things are as they are, Waskindleuser\u0026nbsphas just started rereading Ralph Ellison’s Invisible Man:This book is beyond description. I first read it for my university course and with the current situation in America, I felt the time was right. The book is a masterpiece.And RickLondon has just “devoured” Toni Morrison’s The Bluest Eye:This is an excellent novel about African American life in 1940s Ohio. It’s a short book, but Morrison packs so much in about class, injustice and race, written in beautifully vivid prose. I’d highly recommend it.Elsewhere, storm46\u0026nbsphas just finished Below Deck by Sophie Hardcastle, an Australian writer:I really liked this book, mainly because the writing was beautifully lyrical, and the characters engaging. It is not giving anything away to say that there is a rape in the story but Hardcastle depicts the ambiguities, the blurry nature sometimes of such an event. A brave move.\u0026nbsp The novel deals with Oli’s introduction to the sea and her love of it until the event which traumatises her, and leads to the difficulties she faces coming to terms with it. I think Hardcastle did a brilliant job of that and I would recommend the book.The Black Echo by Michael Connelly has impressed dylan37:My first trip underground through the darker corners of the LA night with Detective Harry Bosch. A compelling tale of tunnelling into bank vaults, corrupt cops, incompetent investigators, black coffee and cigarettes.\u0026nbspBosch ticks all the right noir boxes - sleepless Vietnam vet, chequered back story, and some smooth one-liners. Throw in a femme fatale, late nights and a bug on the telephone, and I’m hooked.\u0026nbspA moving appreciation of Marilynne Robinson from conedison:How someone so decent, so ultimately beautiful can actually thrive amidst a race up to its hairline in savagery is a kind of miracle. I think Robinson literally stuns her readers into a contemplation that saddens with the acute awareness of how painfully unique a writer she is. Robinson’s work is a gentle laser that cuts cleanly through all artifice. I’m grateful that I share my brief blink of an eye on this planet with her. She enriches my life.Can anybody think of any novel besides Lonesome Dove (which I’ve just finished rereading) in which the main protagonist dies before the so-to-speak final act?Coleridge: Early Visions by Richard Holmes has surprised vermontlogger:Raced through the first volume of this lauded biography. The reputation is deserved. Truly you see Coleridge the man – the astonishing Cambridge drop-out, enlisted dragoon, versatile journalist, 30-mile-a-day fell-walker, and restless husband, who dazzled the Wordsworths, Lamb, Hazlitt, Davy and everyone else with his immense reading and impetuous brilliance. I had a general idea of his magnetic conversation but no notion he could throw off a Unitarian sermon at will.Once There Was A War, a collection of John Steinbeck’s reports in 1943 as a Second World War correspondent based in the UK, North Africa and Italy has transported greenmill:Steinbeck’s non-fiction writing shares the lack of artifice apparent in his best novels, and has a level of immediacy and intimacy that transports the reader to the time and place of the action wonderfully well. The pieces here make no attempt either to demonise the soldiers and civilians on the other side, or to paint “our” boys as gung-ho heroes, choosing instead to highlight the anxieties and vulnerabilities of all the participants many of whom, on both sides, have been unwillingly cast in their wartime roles… A truly great writer.Perhaps the bleak cynicism about the materiality of modern life struck a chord with me I was also struck by the Professor’s mid-life crisis and his having to learn to “live without delight”. I enjoyed the almost dreamlike quality of the central section with Tom Outland and the lost city in the mesa - somewhere I’d like to escape to during lockdown.One of the characters has just popped into the Oxfam bookshop on Morningside Road in Edinburgh to pick up a book written by another character. So next time I get to visit wonderful Edinburgh I will donate my copy to the Oxfam bookshop on Morningside Road. Hopefully it will still be there.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag\u0026nbsp#Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

Germany reported a record plunge in industrial production in April this morning and China released disappointing trade data over the weekend.Several UK companies have announced major losses today, including BP, which is cutting its global workforce by 10,000 (reportedly about 2,000 in the UK). In the UK, the 14-day quarantine has come into effect. The bosses of Ryanair and easyJet have expressed confidence that the new rules will either be struck down by the courts, or withdrawn by the UK government by the end of the month.Good-bye – we’ll be back tomorrow.Here is our story on the BP cutbacks, which come as global demand for oil has plunged as the Covid-19 pandemic forced countries around the world to go into lockdown.Chief executive Bernard Looney told employees about the cuts, which come in response to the coronavirus crisis, on a global online call. He said:We will now begin a process that will see close to 10,000 people leaving BP – most by the end of this year.All of the major European stock indices have reversed earlier declines and are now trading higher again, following last week’s rally on economic optimism. They ended the week at three-month highs after much better-than-expected US jobs data.More job losses... BP intends to cut 2,000 jobs in the UK as part wider cutbacks, Reuters reports, citing a spokesman. Bank has opened its first drive-thru branch in Wales to offer customers contact-free banking – in Cardiff on Newport Road. It is the bank’s fifth drive-thru in the UK. The others are in England – Slough, Luton, Merry Hill and Southall.Airline stocks easyJet and BA owner IAG are the two biggest risers on the FTSE 100 index. The bosses of EasyJet and Ryanair said they were confident of succeeding in their legal action to overturn the UK government’s 14-day quarantine for air passengers arriving from abroad. The quarantine comes into effect today. There are more comments from Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary on Reuters – he says that while Brits’ bookings abroad are strong, the only notable weakness is inbound bookings into UK. O’Leary also reckons that the three airlines’ legal action against the UK government over the quarantine has a high likelihood of success. He expects the courts to strike the quarantine down unless the government quietly announces its withdrawal before the end of June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ac15e9017213249b6784183dfd50d0b068843d0/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c61ca296cc8eff07b3988004af2928b","title":"i cant breathe george floyds words reverberate oppression","story":"These few words should become the mantra of oppression – and spark the real change our world so desperately needsNever in my lifetime has the case of such visible injustice moved white and black people, moved them as human beings. There have been protests all across America. But there have been huge protests in Britain, in Spain, in Nigeria, in fact all across the world. Why has the killing of George Floyd struck such a profound chord in us? Maybe it was that phrase: “I can’t breathe.”The consonance of the phrase with the very root of our pandemic fears is uncanny.\u0026nbspThe phrase linked the coronavirus with the ubiquitous and implacable nature of institutional racism. “I can’t breathe” – yet people were prepared to risk being afflicted with coronavirus just so they could express their protest at the chokehold killing of a black man.There have been many times when black people have been gagged, strangled and choked by the police in the US, and even in Britain. The names of those who have died unjustly at the hands of the police are legion. And the police officers have mostly always gotten off entirely free. What happened to George Floyd isn’t new. “I can’t breathe” was uttered by another police victim, Eric Garner, less than a decade ago. But now there has been a crossover protest on a universal scale. This time is different. This time it is epochal. Language taps into primal fears.We don’t really empathise when we understand. People understand racism. It isn’t difficult to understand. But still people don’t behave as if they understand. Perhaps we empathise best when we can enter into the condition. “I can’t breathe” suddenly equates racism with the deprivation of air, which is what it always was. Previously we saw racism, if we saw it all, as a diminishment of a person’s humanity. But that was always too vague. “I can’t breathe” goes beyond saying that you are depriving me of freedom, of humanity, of respect. It says: “You are depriving me of the right to air itself.”“I can’t breathe”: we need a new language to express the fundamental clarity of what happens when people are demonised, excluded, deprived, oppressed, and killed because of the colour of their skin. We need a new language, a phrase for that condition.Only an extreme, and terminal agony could have expressed the very heart of what racism does as when George Floyd said, almost in a whisper: “I can’t breathe.” Not even William Shakespeare, Walt Whitman, James Baldwin or Toni Morrison at their most eloquent came out with anything as simple in the genius of its truth as: “I can’t breathe.”Maybe it should be the phrase that people who are oppressed should use. It should become the mantra of oppression. Maybe every time the police stop you in your car for no other reason than that you are a black man or woman, you should say: “I can’t breathe.” Maybe every time people cross the road in the evenings when they see you, one should hold up a placard that says: “I can’t breathe.” Maybe when jobs are denied you, deserved promotions elude you, or when the police come to deport you, like the Windrush victims, one should record the moment on one’s phone while saying: “I can’t breathe.” Maybe the true response to all the subtle and deadly forms that racial discrimination takes should now have a new code: “I can’t breathe.”The truth is that “I can’t breathe” hints at the apocalypse of human values. When George Floyd said “I can’t breathe” and still the police officer applied the chokehold to his windpipe, it was declared in that moment that a human life means nothing in that country. That’s where the apocalypse begins.\u0026nbsp“I can’t breathe” will become the condition of the world. We ignore the deadly warnings of climate catastrophe. It took the worldwide outcry of the #MeToo movement to signal to the world that millions of women are in situations where they can’t breathe. Boris Johnson had oxygen support, delivered through a tube under his nose, lingering for days between life and death – perhaps he knew the meaning of “I can’t breathe”? Across the world right now we are asking ourselves what it means to be human.Maybe the real trouble is colour deficiency. We know what racism is. It is, finally, the reduction of the human race to the validity of one race. Put another way, it is saying that there is a hierarchy of being human, that some are more human than others, or that some are less. The moment you can think, even unconsciously, that one race is superior to another, that is the beginning of murder. It is the beginning of genocide. By small degrees what is innocently thought of as minor variations of a hierarchy of being human slowly becomes degenerates into allowing one set of people to suffer and endure conditions that another set of people would not tolerate, for a second, for themselves.Racism is a human thing. It is a human problem. It can be solved. All it takes is facing the truth that many of us have been lied to about history and about other people’s humanity. All it takes is realising that to passively sanction the diminishment of anyone’s humanity on any ground is to begin to sanction your own diminishment too. This really isn’t rocket science. Racism is a failure of humanity. It is a failure to be human. This lack of empathy is part of the problem that is destroying the world. The lack of empathy extends not just to humans but to other species, and even to the planet as a whole.\u0026nbspThat police officer who pressed his knee on George Floyd’s neck snuffed out one life, but lit a universal fire. It is deeply moving that the world has responded not to the death of a great man or woman, but to the killing of one of the Earth’s poor and seemingly insignificant people.\u0026nbspWe know what to do. We must tear out the unconscious racism in our spirit. We must insist on the human rights of all peoples. We let people live their freedom, and their possibilities, within the law. This is a great moment in the life of humanity and it is rich with the possibilities for change.Maybe “I can’t breathe” will begin the real change that our world so desperately needs. Let’s all breathe. Freedom.• Ben Okri is a Nigerian novelist and poet.

It has universal healthcare delivered through a single, joined-up system, a historically strong public health community and outstanding government scientists and scientific advisers. Instead we lead the world in the worst league tables: Covid-19 cases and deaths. The initial response from the UK government was too late, but eventually action came. Boris Johnson’s address on 23 March was a strong and clear call to unite and take action together to tackle the epidemic. The whole country visibly got behind the efforts, and by early April there were clear signs the epidemic was slowing.However, the lack of a clear long-term strategy soon became obvious. Government policies have been reactive, based on short-term tactics aimed at media concerns and on short-term visible gains. This lack of strategy is clear to see. The devastating impact on care homes was entirely predictable, yet still there is no clear strategy of mitigation and future protection. On testing, the much-vaunted targets of 100,000 or 200,000 daily tests will achieve nothing on their own. Testing needs to be an integral part of strategic efforts to control the epidemic. Whole sections of the NHS ground to a halt with no attempt at strategic planning, and general practice, which should and could have been at the forefront of efforts to control the pandemic, has been largely ignored and left to its own devices.In the face of a global pandemic, the government has pursued its policies in isolation. Travel policies are out of line with neighbouring countries, Britain failed to be part of successful EU efforts to secure PPE supplies, and instead of using an internationally tried and tested tracing app, it wasted time and resources trying to develop its own. Most recently we have seen a lifting of lockdown measures while new infections are estimated to be 8,000 per day and with no effective case-finding system in place – patently a decision taken against scientific advice.Public confidence is critical to beating this epidemic because the key tools – social distancing, contact-tracing and self-isolation – only work if people fully engage. Two factors have massively dented public confidence, threatening control efforts. First, the obvious lack of a clear long-term strategy, which creates the impression of a government that is not in control. Second, a series of political mishaps. The health secretary blaming PPE shortages on NHS staff. The prime minister’s confused address to the nation on 10 May. And a top government adviser – Dominic Cummings – breaking the very spirit of collective action needed to defeat the epidemic.If we are to control this epidemic, we need the whole country to be united in a collective effort. To achieve this we need to restore trust in the government. A starting point would be an unequivocal apology for the mistakes made so far. For each major error we need a clear plan in place for how the negative impact will be mitigated. We then need a clear long-term strategy for minimising the future impact of the epidemic, covering the possibilities of us getting an effective or partially effective vaccine, or no vaccine at all. This strategy needs to be explained to the whole population, and as new measures are announced, they must be presented as part of this overall strategy.First, the government needs to be transparently guided by the scientific advice. When policy goes against that advice, as it appears to have done with recent relaxations in the lockdown, we need a clear justification. As a scientist I accept that there will be times when wider political or economic considerations mean the chosen policy goes against the science. But we need to know the rationale to build and maintain public trust.Second, we need a strategic, systematic approach to testing for Covid-19 with all results linked to people’s NHS health records. This would allow us to understand how the virus is circulating in the community, in institutions, schools and workplaces, and what measures are needed to control it. Third, we need much clearer international cooperation with our partners in Europe and beyond. Fourth, we need a clear plan to minimise future damage and suffering in the care sector. And, finally, we need a clear plan to restart the currently paused functions of the NHS and engage general practice in the fight against the virus, for example as an integral part of the crucial contact-tracing initiative.Only with a clear strategy will we be able to unite the nation in a collective shared response to the epidemic, with everyone accepting that there will be hardship and discomfort, but that together we can beat this. The alternative could leave us facing years of continued devastation.

It is now becoming clear that this shift may last at least into the new academic year and likely longer. As lecturers, this is not necessarily something to be afraid of: it’s an unparalleled opportunity to rethink teaching and to refocus on relationships with students.In the early days of teaching online, the focus was on recreating the familiar set-up of the physical classroom with the professor positioned at the centre – often referred to as the “sage on the stage”. The overall message was that nothing had changed, and the lecturer was still in charge.But us lecturers aren’t feeling so in charge anymore. Our experience of online teaching has been destabilising, but also levelling and humanising. Behind students as well as ourselves, we see kitchen tables and the occasional unmade bed. There is a lack of polish that feels more direct and more human.\u0026nbspAnd this, in turn, prompts us to work in fresh ways with familiar material and precious expertise and experiences.That’s why standard lecture approaches often fare poorly online, leaving both students and lecturers feeling disconnected. This poses a challenge for higher education: how to build the connections which are key to student success and one of the joys of teaching. The relationships between students and staff affects everything from student satisfaction to their capacity to take risks and excel, to a sense of personal efficacy and sustained curiosity.\u0026nbspRecent research on student engagement in online learning has underscored the need to focus on the quality and variety of such relationships. Online, it is important to establish a strong teacher presence to motivate students and ensure they feel cared for. Hearteningly, the research also found that students did not see online platforms as the main barrier to meaningful interaction.Building relationships online will require lecturers to have closer contact with students through more small-group tutorials and fewer extended lectures. This involves more regular email communications, concise and actionable feedback, and staff participation in online chats. It’s also about bringing oneself into the classroom. During this crisis, we have spoken more personally about how we are faring, relaxing the barriers between students and lecturers.\u0026nbsp All of this is especially critical to reach more marginalised students.In our own experience, so far we have made time for an informal closing debrief. At University College London, we have free-flowing Friday online meet ups – where, most importantly, staff are participants, not just observers. At Oxford, we are convening a regular series of conversations to connect MBA students and early career scientists with founders, funders, and lecturers. One added benefit of Zoom lectures may be the possibility to ersify the classroom. This might be through bringing in new voices from underrepresented geographies to the conversation, increasing a sense of belonging for a more erse range of students. It might also be through widening access to new and underserved students both in the UK and internationally.\u0026nbspUniversities expecting plug-and-play efficiency from online learning will be disappointed. Online teaching requires even more effort from lecturers than face-to-face. Establishing and maintaining these relationships takes demanding emotional labour. And while many departments shifted online with impressive speed, streaming a lecture is not the same as designing, building, and delivering it for online. That requires new skills, as well as investment in new technology and support, from universities already under financial strain.As educators, we need to be willing to experiment: this will be unsettling for both staff and students, who have become comfortable in their respective roles. But staff must now think seriously about relationships and, perhaps, be more open and vulnerable.\u0026nbspIn the early moments, it will be glitchy and awkward and imperfect.\u0026nbspIt’s going to take sustained work in new ways, but these changes may in fact revitalise university education, and make it a better reflection of lived experience."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e8ff2c9649a74d83026a4fcd85a101291f9228d/0_128_3800_2280/master/3800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcab8fb12527cec2733368fd763bed3e","title":"lockdown graduates students on finishing their degrees at home","story":"The Covid-19 pandemic has altered graduation plans, with ceremonies postponed or replaced by virtual eventsAt this time of year, it’s the custom for final year students at the University of Birmingham to have their picture taken holding their dissertation in front of Old Joe, the red brick clock tower in the centre of campus. But Nathan Clarke, who recently finished his history degree, missed the photo opportunity when the coronavirus lockdown began. “Campus was shut before I was able to hand in,” he says. “I had to hand in my thesis online and was robbed of an Instagram post.”Like many of the class of 2020, Clarke’s graduation ceremony has been cancelled and replaced by a virtual event. “The end of university has been anticlimactic,” he says. “Not being able to celebrate is a great shame – particularly for my mum, who had already picked out her dress.”As term draws to a close, graduation ceremonies across the UK have been cancelled or postponed to the disappointment of students’ families. “I was the first person in my family to attend university and it was a big deal for my grandma, in particular, to see me in my gown,” says Kelly Williamson, who studies at Edinburgh Napier University.“We’d already paid for a hotel, so that added stress to the situation. My family members have some long-term health conditions so I don’t know if they will be well enough to attend the next ceremonies that go ahead.”Ruth, who studies Chinese at the School of Oriental and African Studies, regrets losing the chance to say goodbye to her friends. “My ceremony has been postponed, but there will be a virtual ceremony this year. The gown hire company offered to post a cap and gown to my address to ‘celebrate your achievement at home’ –\u0026nbspbut my mum wants to attend an actual ceremony, so I’ll wait. I wouldn’t have minded missing it because it’s expensive, but it would be amazing to see all my classmates one last time – especially the international students who had to fly home.”Some students are still isolating on campus. Ruby Forrester, an English literature and religious studies student at Cardiff University, has stayed in the city with her housemates because she suffers from asthma and her parents work for the NHS. “Two of my housemates also stayed in Cardiff with me, which was a saving grace. We celebrated my housemate’s 21st by turning our bedrooms into fake bars and going on a bar crawl through the house.”The lockdown has also disrupted assessments, with students forced to write dissertations away from libraries and to sit exams online. Bill Bowkett, who studies politics at the University of Kent, says his exams have been rearranged into 48-hour open-book essays to ensure students graduate on time.But Bowkett says the system is flawed. “I see why they have done them, but when exams are open-book, they are no longer exams. The level playing field has been lost. I am never guaranteed a quiet space at home, with seven people in total. My siblings are out of school and my parents are working from home. Not everyone has access to a reliable internet connection or technology that will enable them to access online resources. It will be those who are the most economically disadvantaged who will suffer the most.”For students like Ashling Sugrue, whose film and television degree at the London College of Communication includes practical work, the transition has been more complicated. “The crowning achievement of our course’s graduates is a short film. The lockdown hit on the exact week we were supposed to fly out to Spain for the shoot. Now nobody in the year has that calling card that the short film was supposed to be, so we’re all anxious about how we’re going to find work once the lockdown has ended. I’ve pictured my graduation so often and strove to get the best grades so I could really relish the feeling. Now I guess I’m getting my diploma in the mail instead.”Among the biggest concerns for this year’s cohort are their future job prospects the Bank of England’s chief economist has warned of a significant increase in unemployment as a result of the Covid-19 crisis. Conor O’Brien, a history and American studies student at the University of Manchester, is worried by the impact of the pandemic on his ability to find work after graduating. “I feel the inequalities of the job market will only be exacerbated,” O’Brien says. “The pandemic has shown the cracks within British society and only a radical overhaul will prevent millions of young people like me from becoming victims of a different type.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56653e852cc91a34184ee8a228f33812e9ba8c2a/0_69_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a1f01f0f42cd20224474fda9a8c5876","title":"universities face 460m loss from expected drop in east asian students coronavirus","story":"British Council says pandemic could see 14,000 fewer students from region coming to UK this yearUK universities have been told to expect a sharp fall in the number of new international students coming next year, including a loss of up to £460m in income from students from east Asia.A new survey of international students by the British Council has found that nearly 14,000 fewer students from eight countries – including China, Singapore and Malaysia – are likely to come to the UK in 202021 in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.“Prospective international students are facing a lot of uncertainty, but many are clearly trying to find a way to keep their overseas study plans,” said Matt Durnin, the author of a report for the British Council.“There is a window of opportunity over the next two months to create a greater sense of certainty about the upcoming academic year.\u0026nbspIf responses are clear and quickly communicated to prospective students, UK higher education will face a much more manageable scenario.”Michelle Donelan, the higher education minister, told a British Council summit on Friday that the UK government was “working very hard to ensure that international students do not have to jump through hoops to come here” and promised that immigration regulations would be “as flexible as they can be”.Donelan announced that Sir Steve Smith, the retiring vice-chancellor of Exeter University, would become the government’s international education champion, with a brief to boost the numbers of international students as well as tackle what the Department for Education described as “concerns” over the global recognition of British degrees.The University and College Union (UCU) said the British Council’s findings were further evidence that the government needs to provide universities with urgent financial help. A\u0026nbspreport for UCU\u0026nbspin April warned that universities face a £2.5bn hole in their funding if both international and domestic students stay away in large numbers.“The current wait-and-see approach from ministers is exacerbating the crisis for prospective students and putting tens of thousands of jobs at universities and in the wider economy at risk,” said Jo Grady, the UCU’s general secretary.“Universities are focusing their efforts on trying to get as many students through their doors in September, yet they are refusing to listen to students in the UK and abroad who say they are worried about what their education will look like and even if their chosen institution can ride out the crisis.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a5188de5aed068e2f78fc5e031151400ba0520e/0_330_5213_3127/master/5213.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d373237b445803565670f97ffc5e6ffe","title":"blue sky thinking how cities can keep air clean after coronavirus","story":"Many urban dwellers have gazed in awe at their newly clean cities over the last few months. But three – Copenhagen, Oakland and Mexico City – are leading the way in making such transformations permanent. How?For those not directly affected, the ability to breathe more easily and see further has perhaps been the greatest consolation amid the trauma of the coronavirus pandemic.As city after city begins to emerge from lockdown, urban planners and environmental campaigners are grappling with how to keep the clean air and blue skies that have transformed our view of the world. “Citizens around the world can see change is possible,” says Zoe Chafe, an air quality specialist with the C40 group of global megacities. “Just put yourself on the rooftop and imagine seeing mountains for the first time, and thinking how amazing it feels to realise this is possible.”That rooftop could be in Kathmandu (where residents were astonished to make out Mount Everest for the first time in decades), Manila (where the Sierra Madre became visible again) or dozens of other cities across the world.Not everywhere has seen air quality improvements in recent months. In some Asian cities, such as Hanoi and Jakarta, pollution has become worse. But, for the most part, people across the world are experiencing a healthier alternative to the smoke and smog that are responsible for an estimated 3 million deaths a year.Having seen the shroud lift, there is a growing clamour not to let it fall again. Cities across the world are exploring ways to permanently reduce pollution. Chafe says there is no quick, one-case-fits-all solution, but there are lessons – on environmental justice, community activism, urban design, climate ambition, technological innovation and municipal leadership – that can be learned from the cities and states that were making progress even before the lockdown. Here are three.Copenhagen has the world’s most ambitious plan to cut emissions: carbon neutral by 2025. This is pushing the Danish capital to go beyond the existing model of smart, clean urban design and cycle-centred transport that has turned it into one of the cleanest cities in the world.Grassroots activism, pragmatic government and high taxes have been the drivers for change. Old photographs prove the city had as much of a car culture as any European city in the 1970s, when more than 100,000 citizens demonstrated in Rådhuspladsen (City Hall Square) to demand their streets back. Since then, town planners have steadily reduced parking spaces and widened areas for pedestrians and bicycles.Jeppe Juul, of the Danish Eco Council, says it is a question of priorities. “It feels good to walk around Copenhagen,” he says. “Pedestrians have more space than bikes, and bikes have more space than cars.” The city now vies with Amsterdam for being the most bicycle-friendly city in the world.\u0026nbspThis means traffic lights with resting bars that riders can hang on to without touching the ground, take-away coffee containers designed for bikes, and groups that organise parent’s shifts for schools runs on “minibus-like” bicycles that can take up to six children at a time.Copenhagen’s 2025 target depends largely on replacing coal-fired heating with biomass, wind and geothermal energy. A new district-heating infrastructure will allow neighbourhoods to scrap home boilers. Urban planners aim to use carbon capture and storage technology to trap emissions from the main municipal waste incinerator.These shifts will create up to 35,000 jobs, with most of the money coming from public coffers. Residents already pay some of the highest rates of tax in the world, but this is seen as an investment in health and quality of life. The city’s wastewater plant was also expensive, but now that it is operational, residents can swim in the harbour – something unthinkable in urban waterways elsewhere. Danes are consistently ranked among the world’s healthiest and happiest people.The municipality also wants to completely phase out combustion engines by electrifying the bus fleet and banning petrol and diesel cars within five years. After that plan ran into opposition from the national government, local environmental NGOs lobbied for a revolutionary new traffic management scheme that hugely decreases the convenience of car use. The “distribution plan”, which was pioneered in the Belgian town of Ghent, ides the urban centre into a handful of zones and prohibits drivers from going directly from one to another. Instead, they have to go via the suburbs. “It means there is no such thing as a short drive to the bakery or wherever in this system,” says Jens Müller, the air quality manager of the Transport \u0026amp Environment NGO. As a result, walking, cycling and public transport become more appealing. “It’s the most radical thing you can do apart from creating a no-car zone,” says Juul.Copenhagen is in a group of European cities, including Amsterdam, Paris, London and Oslo, that are trying to set the global pace for air quality improvements. Müller says London is a leader on ultra-low emission zones, Oslo on promoting use of electric cars, while Paris is exploring radical plans for “a city of 15 minutes” that aims to ensure every resident can get the shops and services they want within a short walk or bicycle ride. Cities in Germany are pioneering pop-up infrastructure and tactical urbanism that allow communities to block roads at certain times for certain events. In Brussels, residents now have a say in when to close roads for children’s parties and barbecues. Müller says this reduces pollution because people spend more time outside their homes.The foundation, he says, is community activism by previous and current generations. Amsterdam may now be aiming for zero-carbon boats and yet more bikes, but – like Copenhagen – the origins of its strong air-quality ambition was the parents’ movement in the 1970s, which campaigned against the number of road traffic accidents with banners demanding: “Stop murdering our children.” More recently, Madrid has seen a fierce political contest for control of the streets, with 20,000 people rallying last year to oppose plans by the ruling rightwing coalition to reopen the city centre to cars. The “Madrid Central” zone in the Spanish capital had achieved more nitrogen dioxide reductions than any city in Europe. So far, people power has kept the cars out.The importance of grassroots activism has recently been enshrined into law in California, where campaigners have persuaded the government that if it wants to improve air quality it needs to empower low-income BAME neighbourhoods, which are worst affected because they often live closest to pollution sources.California has made impressive strides since the 1980s, when Los Angeles, Oakland and San Jose were notorious for a toxic haze that blanketed the city for more than 200 days of the year. These days, thanks to tighter regulations, higher petrol standards and less reliance on coal, there are usually fewer pollutants in the air and about 60 more days of blue skies a year. Several cities have also launched “green new deals”. Even the car capital of the world, Los Angeles, is trying to nudge commuters on to an upgraded public transport system.But perhaps the most impressive work is being done at the community level by local activists in hotspots of pollution. The leading light in this initiative is Margaret Gordon, who has spent almost 30 years campaigning for environmental health and social justice in her West Oakland neighbourhood, a part of the San Francisco Bay Area that sits between two highways, a busy port, factories and the proposed site of a coal terminal.She first realised how badly her mostly black and Latino community was affected in 1992 when she started working part-time at a local school where she saw shoeboxes full of asthma inhalers, each with the name tag of a different child. “That was the start,” she recalls in a Zoom chat interrupted by her coughing. “After that, I went to a local meeting to express my righteous outrage about the conditions in the neighbourhood.”Gordon began monitoring the numbers of trucks that passed through on their way to the port. She later received training and funding to measure levels of fine particulate matter known as PM2.5 that can enter the bloodstream and cause respiratory disease. Even inside her home, the readings were unhealthily high.She founded the West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project, and worked with scientists, who collected data to prove what she had long believed – that low-income minority communities are far more likely to suffer the ill effects of air pollution (later including higher vulnerability to Covid-19) than other sectors of society.Her biggest achievement, however, may have been to help draft state law AB617, which passed in 2017 and put local communities at the centre of emissions reductions planning. West Oakland is now one of three Californian neighbourhoods that have drafted their own action plan for dealing with pollution sources. Air quality activists hope this will also address the tendency for wealthy white communities to go low carbon by offloading pollution towards poorer black and Latino areas. Of the two north-south highways in Oakland, it is no coincidence that trucks are banned only on the 580, which passes through a more affluent part of the city. Gordon says the goal is environmental equality.Among air quality wonks and urban planners, perhaps the greatest buzz of excitement is about Mexico City. The Central American megalopolis was named the world’s most polluted capital in 1992, but it has since managed to improve air quality despite the pressures of an extra 5 million inhabitants.Today it has perhaps the most environmentally savvy mayor in the world. Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo, the first woman to hold the office, is an energy scientist who won the Nobel peace prize in 2007 for her work on the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.Sheinbaum wants to go further by raising emissions standards for new vehicles, promoting use of hybrid and electric vehicles and investing more in the metro system, cleaner buses, light railways and cable cars so that people no longer have to rely on informal – and often dirty and overcrowded – minivans. Campaigners say a more important step would be to end fuel subsidies. Without that, the cycling scheme, known as EcoBici, will always seem like an afterthought and the Via Verde – a project to plant vertical gardens on the pillars of elevated roads – will inevitably be dismissed as window dressing.“Mexico City is a stunning example of air quality improvements,” says Chafe. “They are dealing with it in a holistic way. They know they have many sources and realise it has a huge impact on life expectancy and quality of life. The situation is not perfect, but they have made really impressive progress.”Building on that – here and elsewhere – will be the key after lockdown, she says. “We have seen an improvement in air quality in the past few months. It has been happening for the wrong reasons and in a sad situation. I hope we can now find a way to achieve the same results in a socially fair and feasible way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a2f3e0684679110890b24981398d39433d40f2a/0_128_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae51b454ee94ce9fa46e91fa8c1aa27e","title":"only two thirds uk bathing waters rated excellent eu survey wild swimming","story":"Latest data puts Britain near bottom of Europe’s league table for bathing water qualitySwimmers itching to take advantage of the easing of lockdown to have their first sea bathes or wild swims of the summer should pick their spot wisely: only two-thirds of the UK’s bathing waters are of excellent quality, according to the latest data, putting Britain near the bottom of Europe’s league table for bathing water quality.Most of the rest of the UK’s beaches were of good or sufficient quality last year, with fewer than one in 20 judged to be poor, in the annual survey by the European Environment Agency.Earlier this year, UK campaigners called for communities to apply for bathing water status for their swimming spots, which forces water companies and the Environment Agency to clean up the water if it does not meet requirements. In many areas, water companies are legally allowed to discharge untreated sewage into waterways, but having rivers designated as bathing areas means these outflows can be curtailed.Swimmers are also warned that the EEA data is from last year and so does not take into account the impacts of an unusually wet winter followed by an exceptionally dry spring. Bathers are advised to check before setting out and to heed the government’s rules on physical distancing, as well as any local restrictions in force.The EU’s environment commissioner said countries should not take high quality water for granted. “Clean bathing water is usually taken as something that is gifted, but it’s actually one of the European collective achievements,” said Virginijus Sinkevičius. “It’s the result of hard work by many people over many years. This year’s report once again confirms that European citizens can continue to enjoy very high quality standards when bathing in European waters and all measures must be taken to continue along this path.”Before the UK was forced by EU regulations to clean up beaches and inland waterways, many were unfit for swimming and heavily polluted with sewage or other effluent. Campaigners are concerned that the UK could water down some of its environmental commitments after Brexit without firm EU directives to follow on measures such as water and air quality.After Brexit the UK can still submit to monitoring by the EEA, which as part of its remit reports on several other European or neighbouring states that are not EU members, including Iceland, Greenland, Norway and Turkey.“Regular monitoring and assessment of bathing water are essential for ensuring that we maintain the already very high quality across Europe and, where needed, we take effective measures to address water pollution,” said Hans Bruyninckx, the executive director of the EEA. “Cleaner bathing waters do not only benefit our own health and wellbeing, but also the health of the environment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48e3b180db2b474f55305d6d1768fa825f7bb595/0_324_4928_2956/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e19de03cf95b7d84eedd1029635dcb82","title":"fashion shows weeks catwalk runways digital","story":"As catwalks go digital for who-knows-how-long, our fashion critic looks back on two decades of attending fashion weeks Fashion people love to exaggerate, but I have been to a lot of fashion shows – about 3,000, by according to my back-of-envelope maths. Mostly in London, Paris, Milan and New York, but also Tokyo and Rio de Janeiro, Berlin and Edinburgh, Marrakech and Reykjavik. Twenty years of pret-a-porter and haute-couture collections – two of each every year, give or take two maternity leave gaps, a bout of appendicitis and the time I messed up my US visa – adds up to a lot of catwalk time.But now, suddenly, the fashion show is over. No more impossibly beautiful people in ridiculously gorgeous (or just ridiculous) clothes. No more seating squabbles, no more front-row gossip, no more writing copy in the back of a minicab between shows. There are no real-life catwalks this season, with the first all-digital London fashion week kicking off on Friday, and online-only events scheduled for Paris and Milan next month. Most probably no physical shows for the rest of the year, with September’s fashion weeks looking unlikely. And after that, who knows? Will social distancing and recession kill the catwalk for ever?The squash and squeeze of fashion week makes watching football from my seat in the west stand at the Emirates look like a Glyndebourne picnic, and is at odds with new protocols about how we navigate each other. But long before the pandemic it was clear that fashion shows were out of control. Fashion weeks in cities throughout the world, brands presenting six or eight collections a year rather than two, with lavish production and international travel added up to an indefensibly large carbon footprint. If the combined impact of social distancing, travel restrictions and recession is that the fashion week is reinvented as a virtual moment, there will be much to celebrate in that.But I will really, really miss fashion shows. They have brought me so much joy. My entry to fashion week coincided with the moment the catwalk was evolving from its second half of the 20th-century form – a chic but rule-bound, elite, inward-focused parade that served a clique of editors and buyers – into a stadium-sized pop cultural carnival.The first fashion week I attended, as this paper’s new deputy fashion editor, was New York in September 1999. My trusty pre-Google paperback Dictionary of Fashion and Fashion Designers in no way prepared me to report on what I found. I remember Donatella Versace’s Versus show, where Madonna sat next to Rupert Everett on the front row – both in cowboy hats, I think – applauding Kate Moss as she strutted past us in white hot pants and gold boots. At Calvin Klein, Trish Goff wore a pencil skirt and plain fine-knit sweater with the sleeves pushed up and I had the feeling (one I have had many times since) of finally knowing exactly how I wanted to dress thereafter. Watching Naomi Campbell at Marc Jacobs, and that season’s new face – Gisele Bündchen – in a zebra-print bikini at Michael Kors, I was knocked out by the visceral power of the supermodel, goddess-made-flesh. And then there was a hurricane, and shows started getting cancelled. But the Alexander McQueen event went ahead, even though it took place on a pier in the Hudson.Around the time of the millennium, McQueen was at the forefront of reinventing fashion as theatre. His rival for fashion’s attention was John Galliano, who had begun turning Christian Dior Paris catwalks into psychedelic costume parades. McQueen and Galliano had very different aesthetics – Galliano vibrant and supersized, McQueen dark and lean – but both loved to shock their audiences.That night in New York, the models walked through a catwalk submerged in water. (Nothing to do with the hurricane, that was just the way that McQueen, with his uncanny instinct for the zeitgeist and apparently the weather, had planned the show.) After the model finale, a field of iron spikes rose up from the ground, their points skywards, and a troupe of dancers in burqa-like coverings pirouetted above them, suspended by silk ropes – an allusion to western fear of Islam that was made all the more unsettling when McQueen took his bow and dropped his baggy jeans on the catwalk to display stars-and-stripes boxer shorts. It was my first taste of the appetite-jolting salty-sweet lick of beauty and bombshell that a fashion week can be, and I was blown away. I suspect my reports were hopelessly breathless. I remember being halfway through reading one down the phone to the office in London, when the copytaker interrupted me, not unkindly, to ask: “Is there much more, love?” before sighing and audibly lighting another cigarette.Fashion shows are as much about drama as they are about clothes. I have admired hundreds of perfect bouclé\u0026nbsptweed suits, but the Chanel shows I will never forget are those staged in a giant supermarket where Rihanna pushed Cara Delevingne down the soft-drink aisle in a shopping trolley, the one where a space rocket launched during the finale – and the one where a voice informed us just before the show that M Lagerfeld was indisposed, and would not be attending that morning. He was 85, and had never missed one of his own shows before that a month later, he was dead.There is a special thrill in the expectant wait for a debut show to begin – Raf Simons at Dior, where the atelier was wallpapered with thousands of fresh blooms Nicolas Ghesquière at Louis Vuitton, where an earnest note from the designer was on every seat Lindsay Lohan at Emanuel Ungaro – of which, well, the less said the better. There is the camp, Strictly-final emotion of a farewell show. (After two decades of these I can tell you that nobody blinks back tears as prettily, in immaculate black tie and with a poignant half smile, as Tom Ford.)On stage at Sadler’s Wells in 2000, Hussein Chalayan transformed chairs into dresses and a coffee table into a hooped skirt. When Marc Jacobs was at Louis Vuitton, a courtyard of the Louvre was decked out as a belle époque railway station, and we sat on benches waiting for the show to begin. Then a real train trundled down the tracks and the models got out of it. That was eight years ago, and I still wonder how they did it.In 2007, Prince got up out of his front row seat at Matthew Williamson and did a set on the catwalk. In 2018, the actual Queen turned up at London fashion week. And yet for all the hoopla, some of the most perfect fashion moments have been those shows that are pure, old-school chic. Christian Lacroix’s catwalk shows in Paris, when a red rose was left on every seat and his seamstresses cheered from the back rows. Yves Saint Laurent’s final shows before his retirement, the audience squished on to tiny benches but thrilled to be there, the elegance austere and intoxicating as cold vodka. In recent seasons, The Row have conjured that same chic mood at their sublime New York fashion shows.There are cultural issues with fashion shows that run deeper than the logistics of social distancing and are as problematic, in their own way, as the events’ carbon footprint. Whether you look on the catwalk or the front row, or at the Instagram influencers, the world view of fashion weeks skews sharply towards skinny white women. There is still a huge amount of work to be done on ersity, not just on model casting but in ensuring that people of colour are represented within brands’ creative teams, and in audiences. There are still too few women at decision-making level within the fashion business. However, it is not true that fashion shows have nothing interesting to say. Jean Paul Gaultier was challenging gender stereotypes on the haute-couture catwalk back in 2002. Raf Simons used his debut at Calvin Klein in February 2017 to challenge Trump culture with a homage to an alternative vision of Americana. Maria Grazia Chiuri’s Christian Dior shows have consistently placed feminism at the forefront of fashion-week conversation. Vivienne Westwood has made London fashion week a platform for climate activism. At New York fashion week, Pyer Moss designer Kerby Jean-Raymond has shown the power of being both an activist and a designer. In 2016, his collection was accompanied by the screening of a powerful film about police brutality against people of colour.Just as even a top-flight sports match is not the same when played without fans, fashion week will be very different without a live audience. The synchronised intake of breath that would sweep around the Tennis Club in Paris during a Phoebe Philo Celine show on first view of a particularly delicious polo neck. The camaraderie and hysteria that builds over the course of a month on the road. The time Anna Wintour jumped up and led a standing ovation for McQueen’s They Shoot Horses Don’t They? The backstage scrum to get close to a designer for a quote, which is usually mumbled or Delphic or both. (One season, I thought Miuccia Prada said her collection was about moccasins and another broadsheet fashion editor thought she had said it was about democracy either was equally believable.) I will even miss people unfathomably bursting into tears at Comme des Garçons. All of this has been, frankly, a blast.But fashion must move with the times, Otherwise it’s not fashion. The catwalk has reinvented itself a hundred times over, swapping ballgowns for streetwear, ditching stuffy salon shows in favour of popcorny clickbait. Digital is how we live now – so that’s where the fashion show needs to live, too. The catwalk has a fabulous history, but fashion is about the future. So I’ll be binge-watching the next season of fashion from here, at home on my laptop. And I can’t wait."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f920ea611660e773704e228acd04b4dc55b0db79/0_0_3856_2312/master/3856.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70b39dbec16d2f001f884a38b083c110","title":"john boyega expresses thanks for black lives matter support","story":"Star Wars actor responds on social media following his impassioned speech at an anti-racism rally in London last weekStar Wars actor John Boyega has expressed his thanks for the “love and support” he received after his high-profile intervention in the Black Lives Matter protests.In a post on social media, Boyega wrote: “This is an intense time for our community, and the most important thing is for us to maintain momentum and not lose sight of how critical it is to pursue long-term solutions and commitments, for the sake of our generation, and the next.”Boyega won wide praise after his impromptu speech at a Black Lives Matter rally in London on 3 June in support of the widespread protests in the US over the killing of George Floyd. “Black lives have always mattered,” Boyega said in his speech. “We have always been important. We have always meant something. We have always succeeded regardless. And now is the time. I ain’t waiting.”In his social media post Boyega added: “I know you’re all thinking, what’s next? Where do we go from here? Because I’m thinking the same shit! Conversations about black businesses, ownership and support are happening, and I will continue to have these conversations with the full intention of birthing ideas that are sustainable and tangible.”Boyega also posted a series of pictures from pre-lockdown visits to schools in the London borough of Southwark, showing him interacting with awestruck pupils. He wrote: “Connecting with our kids and motivating them towards a future that is stronger and brighter, is urgent, and necessary. In the meantime, let’s work on clearing the runway for them, so they can take off, and fly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3342bd8ccf2c08c84b6057826b6fe5b11018316/198_0_1616_970/master/1616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a55bc3e3366e6bcec80fe7eb580edb39","title":"my streaming gem why you should watch creep","story":"The latest in our series of writers highlighting under-appreciated films is a recommendation for an atmospheric found footage horror Is there anything creepier than someone who’s just a little too friendly? Think about the stranger who tries to chit-chat on the Tube, the colleague who stands too close, or the friend’s unblinking new partner who tells you about the risen Christ over a carbonara. That frightening line between sociable and sociopath is one that Creep plays with to thrilling effect throughout every second of its 80-minute runtime. It’s short but not sweet.Duplass, who also co-wrote the movie with Brice, has the comfortingly familiar face of a man you shared a house with at university but haven’t seen in 10 years and uses it to continually lull you into a false sense of security that you can’t even be sure is false. It’s a charismatic study in unpredictability. One minute he’s funny and charming, the next he’s making you film him in the bath, and the next he’s taking a practical joke too far. If there was ever a personality trait that’s an indicator of potential psychopathy, it’s an overzealous practical joker. They don’t want you to laugh, they want you to cry.\u0026nbspAaron never cries but we do share his growing unease as the drip, drip of cumulative dread gradually pools at the base of his mind, insistent but just about ignorable. It’s easy to scoff at Aaron’s apparent naivety for driving into the woods to meet a total stranger and for ignoring what seem like red flags, but when you actually think about it, you start to see how plausible his predicament really is. In real life, if you saw an axe in a tree stump outside a house in the woods, as Aaron does at the beginning, you wouldn’t immediately think a murderer lives inside. When you see a shadow you don’t assume it’s a ghost. And once you’ve met the person and established rapport, it then becomes virtually impossible, even if you have suspicions, to confront them or run away. You might be wrong and the fear of social embarrassment is sometimes a more powerful force than the urge for self-preservation. No one ever really thinks that the weirdo is actually going to kill them. And the chances are, they won’t. There’s one moment, after several more fairly major warning signs, where Josef, silhouette in the darkness, stands ominously at the top of the steep steps leading to his house and tries to persuade Aaron to come inside for “one drink”. You’re screaming at him to say no but no is a hard word to say unless you’re absolutely certain being rude is the only option.\u0026nbspMade by Blumhouse – the company that also produced Paranormal Activity – Creep has their distinctive low-budget minimalist feel that works so well for horror. A lot of genre film-makers lazily assume that violence and gore will scare people the most but it never seems to work that way. Atmosphere, dread and the power of suggestion are much more disturbing and this underseen movie deftly uses all three to palm-sweating effect. It feels grounded in reality by refusing to go over the top. Like in many of Duplass’s movies, the dialogue is in large part improvised and the authenticity this gives it really does make it uncommonly believable. One or two all too easy wrong turns and Aaron could be you. The troubling question that lingers long after the film is: how would I react? Would you really heed the supposed warning signs or would you in fact be polite and go inside for that “one drink”? After all, kindness costs nothing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b84b1de28e3c673341e07658a02391743ff91f73/422_164_2346_1408/master/2346.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cc83feeae9c55b09fe3350907914223","title":"hands off 10 deliciously selfish cupcake recipes","story":"A lavish sugar hit that you don’t have to share? No wonder cupcakes are having a moment. These easy bakes will see you through from breakfast to dessertNo, you’re not reading an article from the year 2000. According to Google Trends, cupcakes are making a comeback. Confectionery can do that, unlike other unsavoury sensations from 20 years ago such as Von Dutch truck driver\u0026nbsphats, alcopops and R Kelly. You can argue about good taste, but you can’t argue with what tastes good.The cupcake’s return makes absolute sense during the pandemic: not only are we baking more, but after nearly 11 weeks in lockdown, we’re also ready for the heady decadence of a cake that we don’t have to share, is full of heretofore elusive ingredients and offers sugar hits in spades.From\u0026nbsptraybakes\u0026nbspto\u0026nbspstorecupboard staples\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspmissing-ingredient bakes, we have been doing some pretty worthy cooking recently. Our breath of fresh air? The cupcake. Here are 10 of the best.In the UK, cupcakes are fairy cakes rebranded. Before their bigger, snazzier US counterparts invaded British shores, fairy cakes decorated children’s party tables across the land alongside iced gems and crisps. Felicity Cloake’s perfect fairy cakes capture their understated charm: a light vanilla sponge with a basic icing-sugar-and-water glaze and a smattering of hundreds and thousands.\u0026nbspThe aforementioned American invasion was the result of Sex and the City’s third series, in which\u0026nbspCarrie and Miranda discussed the former’s most recent crush over\u0026nbsppink-iced vanilla cupcakes\u0026nbspfrom the Magnolia bakery. The Bleecker St eatery became an institution, featuring in NYC’s SATC tour, and inspired the opening of equivalent bakeries across the world, such as the Hummingbird in London. And the cupcake took off.Nigella is rarely one to miss a trend, although she somehow always dodges the bandwagon.\u0026nbspShe embraced cupcake fever in 1998 when her second book, the baking bible How to Be a Domestic Goddess came out, with these chocolate cherry cupcakes\u0026nbspon the cover. They’re rich and indulgent, as a cupcake should be, elevated beyond sickly sweetness with tart cherry jam and refined still more with a ganache icing.\u0026nbspYou will never have to inidually bake for a multitude of dietary requirements again with this one-size-fits-all cake. After 17 attempts at nailing a\u0026nbspcupcake that excluded gluten, dairy and egg, the writer Susannah Booth came up with this chocolate number. And vegan cake – or any cake to accommodate intolerances – isn’t just for those who abstain from some ingredients. Meera Sodha’s zingy\u0026nbspblood orange and polenta cakes\u0026nbsp(one for winter, but you could substitute the blood orange for almost any available citrus) and\u0026nbspLily Vanilli’s ultimate vegan cake\u0026nbspare both testament.Suddenly, summer fruit is upon us.

Especially when you have preoccupations tugging at your attention. In fact, maybe “tugging” is a better word to describe the mussel task tugging the wispy beard that pokes out of the shell – like a coat stuck in a car door – the bundle of threads created by mussels in order to attach to a solid surface, a rock, a quayside, pier-leg.As a child, I remember being terrified by the clusters of mussels clinging like wild necklaces to the legs of the pier in Brittany. I would choose to swim 100m back through ink and shadows, alone, rather than climbing up and over the black-blue shells with the others. I also remember eating mussels on that holiday, opening the hinged shells to find an orange ear, being unsettled and delighted by the texture and pool of liquor, by the woman on the next table who got “a bad one” and was sick into her bag, neatly, which I thought was impressive. Even more impressive was how she left, came back to the table, dismissed any concern, and had a glass of champagne.Memories follow you, as does advice, such as that given to me by a young man collecting mussels from rocks in Puglia: “Unless you are getting them from me, play safe and get your mussels from a fishmonger – but do get them, and eat them with rice.” While they may not have the alluring flavour of wild ones, farmed mussels are still plump parcels of flavour. They are also safe, abundant and not expensive: a fish we should be eating.Like the mussel collector straddling two rocks, today’s recipe comes from the heel of Italy, Puglia, and is in the spirit of the classic tiella di riso, patate e cozze, but a simpler stovetop version of just rice and mussels. The glory of mussels is twofold: as well as the flesh, they provide briny liquor – an incomparable seasoning.The original recipe, in Le Ricette Regionali Italiane, suggests stirring a spoonful of grated pecorino into the rice and mussels before serving, which, like the Roman habit of mixing pasta, mussels and pecorino, flies in the face of the idea that cheese and fish don’t make good partners – they do, the cheese acting as a rounded seasoning and also culinary adhesion, bringing the dish together. All that said, it is best to give people a choice. Pass round grated pecorino separately also red chilli flakes, a few of which tug the dish together.1kg musselsOlive oil100ml white wine1 garlic clove300g ripe tomatoes, peeled or tinned tomatoes, without juice260g risotto rice (arborio or carnaroli)1 heaped tbsp chopped parsleyBlack pepperPecorino, gratedRed chilli flakes, to serveFirst, soak the mussels in cold water for 30 minutes, then scrub them under running water, scraping away barnacles and pulling away the hairy beards. Discard any with broken shells.Put the mussels in a large, deep frying pan or saucepan over a medium-high flame with one tablespoon of olive oil and 100ml white wine, cover and cook for a few minutes, shaking the pan every so often. Once the shells start to open, remove the lid and use a slotted spoon to lift them out and into a bowl. Strain the liquor into another bowl and add enough hot, lightly salted water to make it up to 800ml. Pick three-quarters of the mussels from their shells, but leave the rest in for show.Wipe the pan clean, put it back on the heat with four tablespoons of olive oil and a clove of garlic, and, after a minute, add the tomatoes and a pinch of salt, and cook for 10 minutes, mashing them with a potato masher or the back of a wooden spoon.Add the rice and stir, then add the mussel liquor and cook, stirring often, for 17 minutes, or until the rice is tender: add more water if it is looking dry - the consistency should be rippling, but not stiff. In the last few minutes of cooking, add the mussels (both on and off shell), parsley, a few grinds of black pepper and stir again. Serve, passing round grated pecorino or red chilli flakes for those who want them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cc36d7659be67131a159f997375bf48ff337924/0_3961_5683_3410/master/5683.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=f560afdba90f82ff17498fa8cd3ff605","title":"bayern remind leverkusen of just where they sit in the pecking order","story":"There was ammunition for Peter Bosz’s critics as Bayer Leverkusen made their own problems in the 4-2 home routThey arrived talking about the influence one young superstar might bring to bear on the champions, and they left talking about the contribution of another. It ended up being scant consolation for Bayer Leverkusen after a chastening afternoon, but it was a reminder of just where they sit in the Bundesliga pecking order, for better or for worse.\u0026nbspPeter Bosz was supposed to fit into that template. Having fallen far short of expectations at Borussia Dortmund after a lightning-fast start, he arrived at the BayArena 18 months ago with all the elements to rehabilitate his reputation – a young, energetic talented squad suited to his style, and an environment with the room to crack a few eggs without the whole kitchen being closed down. Bosz began to rebuild his stock in spectacular fashion, hauling the team from treading water in ninth into the Champions League spots in his first half-season.\u0026nbspA calling card signposting that late term acceleration had been the win over Bayern Munich in February 2019, one of the champions’ few post-Christmas hiccups. Having won again against Bayern – albeit with a large degree of fortune – at Allianz Arena back in November, Bosz was aiming for an improbable third successive win over the behemoth as Leverkusen coach on Saturday.That hope flickered brightly and briefly when Lucas Alario poked the home side into the lead but an afternoon that briefly promised to lift Bosz and his side to new heights ended up instead reinforcing the most common cliches about his teams. Bayern are, of course, irresistible, but there was no kicking down the door required here. Hansi Flick’s side were invited in and offered a three-course meal with cheeseboard to follow and as Bosz’s plans crumbled in the closing minutes of the first half, when Leon Goretzka and Serge Gnabry helped themselves to goals which swept the visitors into an unassailable 3-1 lead, Die Werkself’s coach could do little but shake his head dejectedly on the touchline.\u0026nbspThere was ammunition for Bosz’s critics as Leverkusen made their own problems – Moussa Diaby surrendering possession to set Bayern on the way to engineering Kingsley Coman’s equaliser, Aleksandar Dragovic flying out of position to create room for Goretzka to waltz through and steer in a shot that Lukas Hradecky could have done better with, or Joshua Kimmich’s straight ball that easily took out the goalkeeper’s protection and let Gnabry lob in a simple third– in an example of the soft underbelly that it is often claimed his charges have. Yet if the Dutchman can sometimes be justifiably accused of being inflexible from a philosophical standpoint, he couldn’t be held accountable for the way his side waned from their structure, shrinking in their shoes before our eyes.Some may insist Bosz is dogmatic, but he is in a rare band of coaches who seldom makes excuses. He knew that the missing Kai Havertz, their best player, coveted by Bayern and a revelation since switching to centre-forward, would probably not have made the difference on this occasion. Havertz’s nominal replacement, the very different Alario, had provided a crafty finish for the opener (a moment that seemed several years before by the time the inevitable Robert Lewandowski got his 30th Bundesliga goal of the season) and frankly, it was at the other end that Leverkusen had their difficulties.“The lineup might have looked like a brave one,” Bosz mused afterwards, with a nod to his unsuccessful deployment of Nadiem Amiri and Leon Bailey as wing-backs, “but I didn’t think we played bravely enough. You also have to be brave when you have possession of the ball.” That sort of confidence – something lacking in Diaby, the author of a very promising season but short of his best here – was something that Havertz might have provided.\u0026nbspIt was certainly present in his de facto successor. In bending a stylish consolation goal around a ing Manuel Neuer in the closing moments, substitute Florian Wirtz became the youngest goalscorer in Bundesliga history at the age of 17 years 34 days, 48 younger than Nuri Sahin when he scored for Dortmund against Nürnberg in 2005. Wirtz showed his own sang froid, barely acknowledging the moment. Bosz appreciated the goal but cared more about the teachings of a tough afternoon. “The boy had his best lesson today since he started playing,” the coach emphasised.\u0026nbspFor Bayern there is glory to come, with two wins from the last four games the maximum required to win the title for the eighth time in a row, even if they face Borussia Mönchengladbach next week minus the banned Lewandowski and Thomas Müller. They are also just 12 goals short of beating their 101-goal season record from the 1971-72 campaign. For Leverkusen there is just the dogfight for fourth place to follow – but they are led by a man more sanguine and realistic than his image would have you believe.\u0026nbsp• “I don’t think there is anything inked,” said Julian Nagelsmann after Leipzig’s disappointing home draw with bottom side Paderborn in relation to the completion of Timo Werner’s projected move to Chelsea. It’s all technicalities, of course, with the deal only dependent on the Blues paying up before the clause deadline of 15 June (Kicker even suggested a small discount on that near-€60m fee might be applied). The striker didn’t have his best afternoon, missing a great late chance to settle the game and then seeing Christian Strohdiek strike an equaliser almost immediately, having earlier created Patrik Schick’s opener.\u0026nbsp• It was a great weekend, accordingly, for Borussia Dortmund, who should have beaten in-form Hertha by more than a single Emre Can goal (and were again victims of inexplicable VAR inactivity), but pulled seven points clear of fifth-placed Leverkusen as the three teams behind them all failed to win. After Jadon Sancho’s undershirt display last week, all Bundesliga teams took a knee before kick-off in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.• Gladbach are still fourth for now, despite an infuriating defeat at Freiburg, where they’ve not won since 2002. Alessane Pléa and sporting director Max Eberl were sent off in the space of a minute after Nils Pedersen’s record 24th Bundesliga goal as a substitute (he had only been on the pitch for 63 seconds) sealed the deal for Christian Streich’s Euro chasers.\u0026nbsp• Some relief, at last, for David Wagner, as Schalke got their first point since the restart thanks to an excellent long-range goal by Everton loanee Jonjoe Kenny at Union Berlin, which changed the course of a game in which they had been a very distant second-best.• And Paderborn’s Klaus Gjasula matched the largest tally of yellow cards received in a Bundesliga season when being booked for the 16th time, taking him ahead of Steffen Effenberg and level with Tomasz Hajto. With four games to make the record his own and Steffen Baumgart’s side battling to stay up, it would take a brave punter to back against Gjasula.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12a4d83a6e734ed7effec46f25a0f080aab7e830/0_0_869_522/master/869.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f060506b1aa5b08e6ff6ba9cd9e4300","title":"how we met i told him id always been taught to keep my pants on","story":"Rachel Hirst, 46, and Andrew Knapper, 55, met on the top of Ben Lomond in Scotland in 2005. They live in Glasgow with their two boysAndrew Knapper moved to the UK from Canada in January 2005 for a temporary contract, but never expected to stay. “I was based in Stirling in Scotland for a nine-month role in management consultancy,” he says. One Sunday that summer, he and a friend decided to go for a hike up Ben Lomond. He didn’t know it at the time, but Rachel Hirst wasn’t far behind. “It was one of those rare sunny days in Scotland, so I thought I’d go for a walk before getting on with some work,” she says. When she got to the top, she found herself sitting near Andrew.\u0026nbsp“I was wearing my rain trousers that day as it had been cloudy in the morning,” he says.\u0026nbsp“But, as a Canadian, I have always called them pants. I was talking to my friend about whether I would need to wear them on the way down.” Rachel found it hilarious. “I overheard him ask his friend if he should take his pants off and I burst out laughing. I told him, as a good English girl, I’d always been taught to keep my pants on.”They soon got chatting and Rachel joined Andrew and his friend on a different route back down the mountain. “It’s funny, because up until that point I had been very happy being single. But walking down that hill, I knew there was something there,” she says. “I asked if I could stand him a pint when we got to the bottom and he found that really funny.” After drinks at the pub, they exchanged numbers. “She texted me afterwards to say how much she’d enjoyed herself. She never did make it to the office that afternoon.”\u0026nbspThe following summer, Andrew began work in Belgium, returning to see Rachel in Glasgow every weekend. “Sometimes I would go and meet him in Amsterdam or Paris or Prague. We had lots of little adventures.” They moved in together in July 2007 and got married the following month in the Yorkshire Dales, where her family lived. Their first son was born in 2008. “He was a honeymoon baby, but he came early. I spent a lot of time reminding people he was early,” says Rachel, laughing. “Our second son was born in 2010.”\u0026nbspRachel works as an ecologist and Andrew has continued his work in consulting, across the UK and abroad. He went to Australia for a project in 2016, which she says was “really hard”. One of the nice things about lockdown is that they are able to spend more time together.\u0026nbspAndrew says that, while Rachel is beautiful and intelligent, they also have shared values. “She has a strong sense of what it means to be a family, which I have always appreciated, especially when I am far away from my home,” he says. For Rachel, it is her partner’s relaxed nature that makes their relationship work so well. “He’s never fazed by anything and he’s always prepared. When I am busy flapping, he keeps me in check.”When lockdown is over, the couple plan to spend more time travelling and exploring with their boys. “We’ve taken them to see Ben Lomond before, to see where we met,” says Rachel. “They call it our mountain. I love being able to tell them our story.”Want to share your story?

This week: a tree in Burkina Faso that is the focal point of village lifeTom Skirrow discovered this magnificent mango tree on a trip to Burkina Faso in 2018. He was spending the week in the tiny village of Torem, home to 781 people, as part of his work as director of operations for Tree Aid. “If I ever wanted to find anyone, that was the tree I went to,” he says. “It was the place to have a conversation or a meeting.”\u0026nbspUnderneath its branches, villagers also prepared food and did other work.The tree provided delicious fruit, but it also gave people somewhere to escape the intense sunlight and scorching heat – temperatures could reach 40C (104F). Skirrow, 39, would often find refuge in its shade. “Imagine stepping out of a very bright, cloudless environment, where you’re almost squinting to be able to see, into a very dense-leaved tree where it’s almost too dark and you have to adjust your eyes. You’ve got this cooling feeling because you’ve been in the heat – it’s almost like stepping into a cave.”Tree Aid is a charity that supports impoverished people in Africa. It helps them to grow and protect trees for themselves and future generations. “I spend a lot of time talking to people in some of the hardest places to live on the planet about what makes their relationship with the trees and the environment around them so crucial,” says Skirrow, who is originally from Bristol.Sadly, during his visit, the mango tree wasn’t in season, so he couldn’t try its fruit. The villagers depend on the juicy mangoes it provides during March and April. “Most of their staple crops come in October after they have grown during the rainy season in September. By March and April, they don’t have many staple crops left, so the fruit from the tree is really important.”Many women in the village are involved in the production of shea butter, which is used for cooking and cosmetic purposes or sold. They often gather underneath the mango tree to make it. “They grind the oil out of the nut and churn it. A lot of women take turns to do the manual labour, which is quite intensive, and would be pretty sweaty working in the sunshine.”For Skirrow, watching the different ways the villagers used the tree was inspirational. “It has made me realise there’s so many levels of benefit something like a single tree can have. It can provide nutrition it can help people and it can bring people together. To me, that’s a special thing, and it’s quite a privilege to be part of it.”• Tell us about your favourite tree by filling in this form."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/073418603b100767a5c6d194d3831cce9e7a97c3/0_660_2854_1713/master/2854.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e39a265afa48cc4a0540b8a09f3bd4c0","title":"miles davis where to start in his back catalogue","story":"In Listener’s digest, our writers help you explore the work of great musicians. Next up: the jazz pioneer who stepped outside of genre to revolutionise music as a wholeKind of Blue (1959)Kind of Blue isn’t just the best introduction to Miles Davis, it’s the best introduction to jazz as a whole, an album that typifies the genre’s musical freedom, haunting gospel tone and restless adventure. An instant classic on release in 1959, Kind of Blue marks the moment that Davis definitively broke with the predominant hard bop style in favour of modality, moving from the chord sequences of 40s and 50s jazz to a looser melodic approach based around scales and improvisation.Davis’s revolutionary shift on Kind of Blue has incited vast swathes of critical thinking and influenced records from John Coltrane’s A Love Supreme to Pink Floyd’s The Dark Side of the Moon. But you don’t need to be a musical scholar to appreciate Kind of Blue: the record’s exquisite melodies connect on a very human level. Davis said that the album was inspired by the gospel music he used to hear walking home from church and you can hear the melancholy pull of nostalgia in the impassioned blues lines that Davis coaxes from his trumpet.Inspiration tumbles from songs such as So What and Blue in Green, but Kind of Blue never rushes or fumbles: instruments are given space to stretch their legs, as Davis’s sublime sextet (including John Coltrane on tenor saxophone) bend time around them, allowing Kind of Blue to whip past in a flash and linger for an eternity.Miles Davis went into the recording of Bitches Brew in a typically combative mood. “I wasn’t prepared to be a memory yet,” he wrote in his autobiography. “I had seen the way to the future with my music and I was going for it like I had always done.”Recorded in 1969, Bitches Brew was a response to the progressive rock music that many people believed would consign jazz to history, and after Davis’s second wife, Betty Mabry, introduced him to the work of James Brown, Sly Stone and Jimi Hendrix. Bitches Brew follows the rock tradition in bringing the band’s rhythm section to the fore, employing two bassists, three drummers, three electric piano players and a percussionist in a simmering saturnalia of percussion, while favouring rock’s straighter rhythmical pulse over the typical jazz swing.Yet Bitches Brew took music farther off into the ether than even the most experimental rock band could venture, as Davis pulled at the fabric of musical norms. In rehearsals for the album, Davis presented his group with a series of musical sketches and told them to follow their instincts, with the idea being to get away from any “prearranged shit”. The resulting recordings soar with immaculate musical freedom: from the nervous collapse of the title track, Davis’s trumpet bouncing over the mix like search lights through the New York skyline, to the rubbery Latin funk of Miles Runs the Voodoo Down, it feels as if all musical life is here.Released a year before Bitches Brew, In a Silent Way prefigures that album’s use of electric instruments and tape slice editing, with producer Teo Macero arranging the highlights of a three-hour studio session into two distinct works, Shhh  Peaceful and In a Silent Way, for the album release. Yet in mood, the two records could hardly be more different. While Bitches Brew throbs with frantic, funky energy, In a Silent Way is brooding and pensive, an eternal meditative masterpiece that marries the late-night introspection of Kind of Blue with the post-genre pulse of Davis’s more experimental records, all drones, drift and space. In 1969, Lester Bangs called In a Silent Way “the kind of album that gives you faith in the future of music” 51 years on, it is hard to disagree.Sketches of Spain (1960)Released just a year after Kind of Blue, Sketches of Spain shares that album’s rich, easily digestible musicality and airy lightness. However, its sound, inspired by the Spanish folk tradition, demonstrates the kind of bold thematic leap that Davis would make throughout his career.Sketches of Spain came about after Davis’s first wife, Frances Taylor Davis, insisted he accompany her to a performance by the flamenco dancer Roberto Iglesias. The following day, Miles called composer and arranger Gil Evans and they set about interpreting the flamenco sound for a US jazz audience. The duo took source material that dug deep into the heart of Iberia, including Joaquín Rodrigo’s Concierto de Aranjuez, Manuel de Falla’s Will o’ the Wisp and Galician folk song The Pan Piper, giving Davis a strong, distinctive melodic base to weave his spell around.That magic can be heard in the elegant scurrying of castanets that opens Concierto de Aranjuez (Adagio) and drives Will o’ the Wisp, to which Davis and Evans add jazz and classical instrumentation, creating an album that hangs tantalisingly between the Spanish sierra, the New York concert hall and the jazz club e, a wonderfully transportive work of musical inspiration.On the Corner (1972)Depending on who you talk to, On the Corner is either the inspirational motherlode, an album that birthed musical genres from trip-hop to drum’n’bass, or a sprawling mess. In truth, this fascinating 1972 release is a little bit of both the unlikely collision between Miles’ interests in Indian music, Karlheinz Stockhausen and Ornette Coleman.In his autobiography, Davis said that Stockhausen’s influence enabled him to understand music in a new way, abandoning the circular structures of modern music in favour of subtly shifting soundscapes. On the Corner, then, is less a work of song or melody and more a constantly evolving musical monolith, with Michael Henderson’s rock-solid electric bass underpinning hulking layers of keyboard, electric trumpet and percussion.In a Jazz Journal review,\u0026nbspJon Brown wrote: “It sounds merely as if the band had selected a chord and decided to worry hell out of it for three-quarters of an hour.” That description nails why On the Corner was so hated by contemporary listeners and why it is so loved by adventurous music fans today, with the album’s preference for groove and texture prefacing the tactile sprawl of modern electronic music.Miles: The AutobiographyIn his autobiography, Miles Davis (in the company of veteran journalist Quincy Troupe) writes exactly as you would expect Miles Davis to write, his intense prose peppered with wonderful turns of phrase, raw passion and an avalanche of “motherfuckers”. For all that, The Autobiography is a difficult read, full of rank misogyny, score settling and unbridled egotism, but it remains the definitive story of one of the 20th century’s most enduring cultural icons.Miles Davis: Birth of the Cool documentaryStanley Nelson’s 2019 documentary Miles Davis: Birth of the Cool offers an intoxicating, if limited, overview of Davis’s life. At times it comes too close to hagiography – there is little serious attempt to hold Davis to account for his violence towards Frances Taylor Davis, for example – but as an introduction to his life it may inspire further digging.Miles Style, by Quincy TroupeTroupe is also behind Spin magazine’s epic 1985 interview piece, which explores everything from systemic racism to what makes Davis’s trumpet playing unique. (“He plays sideways,” according to Lester Bowie, another great American trumpet player.) It’s a fascinating read, alternately dark and hilarious, that gets close to capturing Davis’s unsettling genius."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdc5f1719d5548c3168134af2e7bc749897942c2/0_17_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90277c151f14f0d7468de4532c22f989","title":"from anfield to cheltenham did major events cost lives podcast","story":"A series of high-profile sporting events went ahead as scheduled in mid-March even as Covid-19 was being declared a pandemic. ’s David Conn investigates the scientific reasoning behind the decision, while Liverpool fan Simon Renoldi reflects on the loss of his father In the hours before Liverpool faced Atlético Madrid at Anfield in a crucial Champions League match in March, the WHO declared Covid-19 a pandemic.

Rimmer is the Rugby Football League chief executive who last month dragged his sport back from the brink when he negotiated a £16m emergency loan from the government amid the onslaught of Covid-19.“Over the last 125 years we’ve demonstrated our resilience,” Rimmer says. “We’re facing exceptional circumstances but I don’t think anyone in the sport feels cowed. It’s very much a feeling of pulling together to find a solution.”Rimmer’s work in securing that financial injection has been vital in propping up a sport that relies so heavily on gate receipts. Rugby league has struggled against the odds for years, despite the central role it plays in the cultural and economic wellbeing of so many towns in the north, and the pandemic has threatened its professional future.Neil Hudgell, the owner of Hull Kingston Rovers, warned in late April that “we may not be around as a full-time elite sport come the end of the year”. Rimmer pauses when I ask if he shared that bleak perspective?“Perhaps, at one stage, I thought it would be significantly damaged. But we’ve won recognition from the government that our clubs are so important to their communities. It’s an endorsement of the sport and how important it is to the people that support it. That approval has lifted the sport above where it normally sits. I’m very grateful.”Rimmer, who was mocked unfairly as an unimaginative choice when he replaced Nigel Wood as the governing body’s chief executive two years ago, must have felt intense pressure when he began talking to the government? “Possibly, but I love the sport. I would fight for it anyway. I feel incredibly privileged to be in my position. Yet the good news has clear limits. Apart from the burning question as to whether £16m is enough, doubts about the game’s structure are obvious. Rimmer looks thoughtful when I ask if it is pragmatic to have 34 professional clubs in Britain?“They are sustainable or they are not. For those that do face insolvency in the future, that happens in all sport. That’s generally down to local management and those directors have a duty to run their own clubs. We are not a shadow director as a governing body.”The importance of the 2021 World Cup in England was accentuated by the announcement last week that the Ashes series this autumn has been cancelled. It was inevitable but the latest financial hit, estimated to be around £1m, highlights the precarious position. Rimmer’s previous answer would suggest some clubs could go under.“It’s a fear,” he says. “These days sport is a business. It’s important to whole communities but each club has a responsibility to themselves. Neither I nor the rugby football league is solely responsible for their future.”Which clubs are most in jeopardy – those in Super League, where overheads are high, or further down the ranks where income is modest? “I don’t see any Super League clubs being particularly in jeopardy right now. They’re run by smart people and will dig a way out. The government funding gives them some confidence to plan. I would be fairly confident the majority of clubs are going to be fine.”Wakefield and Salford, two Super League clubs, lose £60,000 and £70,000, respectively for each home game they cannot play. “There are bigger losses than that,” Rimmer says. “Those figures might not have that big an impact on the Premier League but in rugby league they’re vast losses.”Rimmer jokes about wearing odd socks as his lucky charm but he was persuasive and skilful in obtaining government support. He will also ensure the money is used prudently. Each club have to prove they have exhausted all other funding options. “We have the finances in place and we know all the clubs intimately. Most of the burden is prescribed to Super League clubs because their staff earn more and they’re full‑time. But we will help the majority of the sport in one way or another.”How many professional clubs are in a critical position? “I would say about 10 clubs in the first instance require help. What those clubs have to prove is that they have a business plan which ensures they’re sustainable. We would not condone putting that government fund at risk. It’s public money and a lot of responsibility comes with that, so we’ll be very cautious about how we make those loans.”Is £16m enough to help rugby league recover from a devastating crisis? “I think so. I’m lucky enough to sit down with all of our tiers of rugby league and I always start with the same words: ‘If we’re going to find a way through this the solution will not be perfect. You all have to give a bit in order to make it work.’ “We will all feel a good deal of stress but pulling together is what I’m getting from people. In so doing we will emerge out the other side. This is our 125th year and it’s not a year to go down. It’s a year to come up fighting.”The ision between Super League clubs and the rest of rugby league has lessened this year. Does the sport now need just one governing body? “Oh, that,” he says wryly. “I’m not going to get involved with that. There’s always speculation but I work regularly with Super League to promote the sport. Those conversations will continue.”Perceptions of Rimmer have shifted during the crisis as his Super League critics have relied on his nous and expertise in dealing with the government. Rimmer must have noticed the change? “Perhaps,” he says with a smile. “I’m always my own man and I have been all my life. I never get too carried away with the rare plaudits. Likewise I try not to get too downhearted about criticism. All I ever try to do is the right thing for the sport.”It must have been disheartening when his appointment was met with derision in some quarters – primarily because he had been Wood’s understudy. “Nigel is a great fellow and you’ll probably never find a more knowledgeable guy but he would be the first to acknowledge I’m very different. You’re right. I am an insider. I’m steeped in the game. Some people may use that as a negative. My underlying objective is that if anyone wants to get involved I have to find a way for them to do it – whether playing or volunteering. We’re a very inclusive sport.”Rugby league is different to most professional sports because its clubs remain rooted in their communities. “At every level,” Rimmer stresses. “Look at Super League. Warrington’s work with dementia and St Helens’ work with autism is outstanding. But lower down the ranks there are great examples of what Barrow does in the community. That’s a strong town. Its whole community is built around the rugby league club.”He rose from being a development officer for Doncaster to the chief executive of Sheffield Eagles, when they beat Wigan in the 1998 Challenge Cup final at Wembley, and a director of the Huddersfield Giants before joining the Rugby Football League. He was one of the first, when the lockdown began, to take a pay cut and his approach has been matched across the sport.“Absolutely. As an executive board, on day one, we said: ‘We’re taking a pay cut.’ That will remain. Clubs have done the same thing and it was picked up right across the communities. It’s us thinking differently about how we’re going to get through this.”Rimmer smiles when I say he sounds surprisingly buoyant. “I’m always optimistic. I get out of bed every day optimistic. I’ll never lose that.”Rimmer hopes Super League will resume in August, with other tiers of the game to follow. When that blissful moment happens, he says: “I really want us to punch the air and say: ‘We’re back!’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a0eff874972f553ec02efa5be49d28ed4be7c7e/190_11_2755_1653/master/2755.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=447572941ca4440b4e0f414e06a8b5f4","title":"talking horses racings rulers silent over switch of princess haya horse racing","story":"Racing’s powerful figures responded with silence on Sunday when questions were asked about how a valuable racehorse was transferred recently to GodolphinRacing’s powerful figures responded with silence on Sunday when questions were asked about how a valuable racehorse was transferred recently from the ownership of Princess Haya to that of Godolphin, the racing vehicle of her former husband, Sheikh Mohammed, from whom she fled last year seeking protection from the English courts.Terebellum is a valuable breeding prospect and expected to try her luck next in a Group One race after proving her class by winning the Dahlia Stakes at Newmarket on Saturday,\u0026nbspwhen\u0026nbspher jockey, Frankie Dettori, wore the royal blue of Godolphin.That was a change from last year, when Terebellum carried Princess Haya’s green and black silks, including when successful in a quality race at Deauville. But when the entries for the Newmarket race were published last week, Terebellum was listed as owned by Godolphin.Asked to explain that, Godolphin’s managing director, Hugh Anderson, replied: “No comment”. More surprisingly, the British Horseracing Authority, which regulates the sport, remained wary. Asked if it had checked with Princess Haya that she consented to the transfer, a spokesman responded: “It is the BHA’s position currently not to comment on this.” He declined to explain why.The situation echoes events of last summer, when, in the weeks before Princess Haya applied to the high court for a non-molestation order against the sheikh, several horses were swapped from her ownership to his and then back again. As was noted at the time in Private Eye, Promissory was taken out of Princess Haya’s ownership on 29 June and returned to her from Godolphin four days later, winning at Doncaster in her green colours just two days after that.Turgenev, Emblazoned, Kimblewick and Duneflower were all also switched out of Princess Haya’s ownership in the early days of July and into the Godolphin camp, only to be switched back later. Of the 16 horses that ran for her in Britain last summer, three went to the sales at the end of the year. Terebellum is the first of the remainder to race since the court ruling.The couple were in headlines around the world in March after a 34-page fact-finding ruling by Sir Andrew McFarlane, president of the family ision of the high court, which included findings that Sheikh Mohammed had orchestrated the abductions of two of his children, one from the streets of Cambridge. It was found that he had subjected Princess Haya to a campaign of intimidation, including an attempt to have her abducted by helicopter.The findings were made on the civil standard, requiring only they be proved as more probable than not. Sheikh Mohammed countered at the time with a statement: “As a head of government, I was not able to participate in the court’s fact-finding process. This has resulted in the release of a ‘fact-finding’ judgment which inevitably tells only one side of the story.”Rain-softened ground at Haydock makes for a tricky card, so my main interest will be in some races at Chelmsford, where Rock Boy Grey (12.30) is generally 5-1 after opening at 10s. The grey has found his niche in all-weather handicaps this winter and has not finished yet, judging by his score at this track in March. Mark Loughnane, who trains him, has been among the winners in Resumption Week.David Loughnane, who I believe is unrelated, has an interesting runner in Exotic Escape (3.05), who achieved little last year in three runs for a different stable that was not going well. She’s well related and will surely be winning a handicap at some point, though the market seems content to leave her on 16-1 for this reappearance.At Lingfield, there is 7-2 about Sneaky Peek (7.20) for the on-fire Andrew Balding team. Bred to need time and distance, she ran well in a couple of turf handicaps at this trip last summer and should be ready to go on again now. The market prefers a William Haggas gelding who might be in more need of this experience, stepping up in trip by half a mile."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3908f4aa8117fd9f244546499cd403eadfbb711/356_0_2536_1524/master/2536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32a6d907731951a2e2a618703f202848","title":"are you thinking of booking a holiday abroad","story":"We want to hear from people who are considering or have booked a holiday abroad for the summer holiday or later in the yearPeople arriving in the UK from abroad will have to quarantine for 14 days and provide information of where they will be staying during that time, according to new rules which come into effect today.With the summer holiday approaching and other countries easing lockdown restrictions, we want to know if you are thinking of going abroad in the near future, or have already booked a holiday.Where are you planning to travel to and why?

As such, it has been nothing short of a tragedy that we haven’t been able to watch the show in the UK while under lockdown, since it fell off the streaming services some time after season two aired.However, miracle of miracles, this error has now been rectified. As of today, both seasons of Succession – our Fleabag and Chernobyl-beating best show of last year, remember – are available to view again. If you haven’t seen it, you should close this page now and steam through every episode as a matter of urgency as there are spoilers ahead. But if you have, let me whet your appetite for a rewatch with a list of Succession’s best moments.The first season of Succession had to accomplish a lot. Not only did it have to introduce you to some of the worst, least sympathetic characters ever seen on television, but it also had to make you care about them. When the season finale managed to do this, it was like watching a magic trick. Kendall Roy – the closest thing the series has to a lead – involves himself in a fatal Chappaquiddick-style car crash. In the immediate aftermath, he finds himself being sucked back into his father’s toxic orbit, and his total helplessness in the moment is enough to smash your heart into dust.How unlikable are the Roy family? Glad you asked. We get a good idea of their complete awfulness in the first episode, when the family take a spontaneous trip to play a game of softball an operation that involves fleets of helicopters and luxury cars. But when they find themselves a player short, Kieran Culkin’s smarmy Roman approaches the young son of some onlookers and promises him a million dollars if he hits a home run. The boy fails, Roman rips up the cheque in front of him and you have a brand new worst enemy.In season two, though, Succession hardened its gaze. It wasn’t just the Roy family in its sights any more it was the entire online-content industry. One subplot involved the acquisition of Vaulter, a vaguely ViceyBuzzfeedyGawkery website that was kept afloat on an empty wave of pure clickbait. The headlines that ran on vast screens in the background were perfectly judged – “Wait, Is Every Taylor Swift Lyric Secretly Marxist?”, “This Tinder for Pedophiles App Sounds Like a Really Bad Idea”, “5 Reasons Why Drinking Milk on the Toilet Is Kind of a Game-Changer” – even if they did hit a little close to home for a man currently employed to write a listicle of TV show moments for the internet.People often call Succession Shakespearian, and nowhere was this more evident than with Boar on the Floor, a game instigated by patriarch Logan Roy in season two. The rules of the game are simple: you pick your emotionally weakest dinner guests, and force them to them crawl around on the ground making pig noises while you throw sausages at them and chant: “Boar on the floor”. It’s both a power move and a Guantanamo-level act of total humiliation. When lockdown lifts, try it with your friends.A genius move on the part of Succession was to fold in elements of Brian Cox’s life into his character. For instance, in the second season it became apparent that Logan Roy, like Cox, was Scottish. An entire episode was set in his hometown of Dundee. In most shows, this might be an attempt to humanise a monster, but not here. In one scene, Roman reveals that he has bought the Scottish football club Hearts as an ostentateous show of love and loyalty Logan responds by telling him that he actually supported Hibs, and the wedge between generations becomes even bleaker.\u0026nbspThe characters on Succession are all so broken that even romance ends up rotten and curdled. In the episode Safe Room, Roman rings his father’s counsel, Gerri, to complain about nothing in particular, and they quickly fall into a bout of excruciating phone sex. “You disgusting little pig,” she tells him as he masturbates on his bed. “You are a revolting little worm.” Just to compound the awkwardness of the scene, Roman later proposes to Gerri.This is why you hire Brian Cox. At the end of the second season’s sixth episode, Logan learns that a skin-saving multi-billion-dollar deal he has long been angling for with his rival Nan Pierce has fallen through. For most of the series, Logan is the gruff puppet master. But as the rug is pulled from beneath him and he realises that he cannot talk his way out of it, he loses control and erupts in an orgy of genuinely frightening anger. “We haven’t finished! We haven’t fucking finished!” he screams at Nan’s car as it leaves, with such intensity you assume it will end in a heart attack. The man deserves all the awards going.“Bitches be catty But the king’s my daddy  Rock all the haters while we go roll a fatty  Squiggle on the decks  Kenny on the rhymes  And Logan big ballin’ on Hamptons time  L to the OG  Dude be the OG  A-N he playin’  Playin’ like a pro”. In years to come, this will be the moment that Succession is remembered for. In the meantime, it just appeared on Spotify.Tom might be the best character on Succession, an outsider who married into the family and simply cannot keep up with all their craven behaviour. In the season two finale, set aboard a comically extravagant yacht, he finally regains a scrap of control. Scared for his job and publicly humiliated, with his marriage in tatters, Tom (played by Matthew Macfadyen) sits down next to Logan and – without saying a word – grabs a handful of his food and rams it into his mouth. “It’s so batty and odd and so\u0026nbspSuccession, that moment,” Macfadyen said after the episode. “Tom’s really at a low ebb. He thinks,\u0026nbspFuck it, you know?”Finally, here’s the moment that will vault Succession into the future. The season two finale ended with Kendall decisively breaking away from the clutches of his father, by holding a press conference where he finally told the world the truth about all of Logan’s wrongdoings. On its own, the moment was utterly explosive. But then we cut back to Logan, watching the conference from the yacht. His unknowable smile – maybe pride, maybe contempt, maybe excitement at finally having a worthy foe – could send Succession in any direction whenever it returns.• Succession is available on Sky and the streaming service Now TV"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d528d3ba499ce77d0c3af9e117c69325761ba243/0_43_2547_1528/master/2547.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99b8736f3367251d711fd9f779cf78ff","title":"isolation and contemplation nadav kanders visual response to coronavirus","story":"In the first part of our series commissioned in conjunction with the Prix Pictet, a global award in photography and sustainability, photographers who have won or been shortlisted for the award over the last decade have been asked to make a personal response to the Covid-19 crisis. The ability to move us beyond cliche is a characteristic photographers shortlisted for the Prix Pictet share, and it is important as we grapple with the reality of the world as we emerge from the Covid-19 crisis.The global lockdown has birthed new cliches wildlife cautiously exploring the unpeopled streets, or iconic monuments devoid of tourists, ignored save the occasional solitary inidual escaping their confinement.This commission asked photographers to move beyond the obvious, and present a series of images that respond to the new issues confronting us, and begin to plot a route to a new future and new ways of thinking about the world.Some occasions or occurrences in my life present themselves in a way that, if not ignored, inform me as to how I tick, what is fundamental to me. What it is I constantly strive to grasp and express. It has the effect of bringing understanding to that that is intuitive.At the point this lockdown began, I was no stranger to solitude and the effect it has on me and my practice as an artist. When we separated ourselves, I was very aware of the feelings that arose in me from the forced distancing and shocked at how quickly my surroundings, which were until that moment a safe place, became quickly alienating and unsafe to me. Another human being becoming a threat, an enemy, a carrier of a deadly disease. I began thinking about the importance of touch to non-verbal communication and how the lack of it would produce a yearning for connection. My knee-jerk reaction was to go to my studio and riff off these feelings, which I tried but then resisted knowing the knee jerk in my case always results in work of little value.\u0026nbspWeeks later I began again.\u0026nbspThis is work with the guts of solitude, melancholy and longing which bring up feelings of both beauty and terror.I think of a quote by Rilke: “Love your solitude and try to sing out with the pain it causes you.”\u0026nbspSo many feelings are at play and I was aware that in this quiet time there was a much bigger picture playing out, and it will continue to play out in our future.As a child growing up in Johannesburg, South Africa, we had no TV. I had an electric train set that was made in Germany where my father was born. It was set out on a spare dining room table. No hills or tunnels, just a figure of eight with a station.\u0026nbspThere were small human figures dotted about, who with my imagination performed many duties depending on how I saw my mini world that day.In my studio I have many items on shelves that, out of context, are odd, causing to arise a mildly uncomfortable feeling in a viewer. Animal skulls, dolls, wigs, porcelain flowers, crucifixes and small humans, some from my train driving days.These folks performed once again for me and mirrored back at me the feelings of Solitude – Quietude – Contemplation that I felt most strongly in the first days of lockdown.\u0026nbspThe feeling of the unknown.\u0026nbspIt seemed not by chance that the Royal Academy show of Leon Spilliaert was opened just before the lockdown. The painter wandering alone at night near the water’s edge in Ostend and bringing his memory into the studio to paint the feeling as much as the scene he had just experienced.This series of work I hope brings up feelings of isolation, distance and contemplation in a viewer as well as a realisation that this time in history is bigger than just this virus. That it holds potential in its invitation to consider that this event is willing us human beings collectively to move towards balancing our indiscriminate use of nature’s resources.\u0026nbspThis is not a warped reality, it is just reality, and it comes out of man being out of balance with nature.\u0026nbsp• Prix Pictet was founded in 2008\u0026nbspby the Geneva-based Pictet Group, with the mandate to use photography to move beyond cliche and deliver powerful messages about sustainability to a global audience. Its goal is to uncover photography of the highest order, applied to the social and environmental challenges we face today.• Nadav Kander, UK, was the winner of Prix Pictet Earth in 2009."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7930692899de50bde70bb185f0fc9ca41a7317f/673_453_6047_3628/master/6047.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ceb8fb77aa22d3714dfd50131cc40ac0","title":"it feels endless four women struggling to recover from covid 19 coronavirus symptoms","story":"Many people suffer effects of coronavirus for months while reporting a wider range of symptoms than NHS guidelines state Last month, the  published an interview with Paul Garner, a professor of infectious diseases, about his experience of Covid-19. The piece was shared widely and viewed nearly 1m times. Readers got in touch to say they too were suffering from lingering and often strange Covid-19 symptoms.There is evidence that the official NHS description of the virus’s symptoms – cough, fever, loss of tastesmell – is too narrow. Those who do not need acute hospital treatment and who are isolating at home report a far broader range of problems. Often these go on for longer than 14 days. An online survey of 151 medical professionals who fell ill in March found 68 are still unable to work. A further 26 went back, only to stop again when symptoms returned.It appears coronavirus may be a chronic condition. How long it persists for is unknown. The symptoms can be serious and wide-ranging, affecting the lungs, heart, brain, kidneys, stomach and nervous system. Headaches, shortness of breath, sore throat and feeling exhausted are common. So is recovery followed by frequent relapses. Here are the stories of four women who are struggling to return to normal life.Iulia Hammond, 39, junior doctor in Manchester“I went down with Covid on 19 March. I had a fever, chills and a very mild dry cough. I took to bed, feeling like I couldn’t do much of anything. After three or four days I had really severe respiratory symptoms. It felt as if there were shards of glass in my lungs. It was the most horrendous thing I have ever experienced. I was absolutely terrified.“For the past 10 weeks I have been sleeping sitting upright in bed. It’s the only way I’m able to breathe. I developed pharyngitis and at one point I thought they were going to have to intubate me. I made two trips to A\u0026ampE and had tests. I chatted to my GP who says patients look OK and yet feel the worse they have ever felt. It’s such a horrible virus. It seems quite different in each person. There’s not a standard progression.“I’ve had a slew of symptoms. I got the worst headache I have ever had, like an electric cord over my temples and the back of my head. I get an odd crawling sensation on the left side of the face, including when I brush my hair. I’ve had abdominal issues and stomach pain and sensory things like pins and needles in my arms and legs. The illness comes around in two-week cycles. This has happened four times.“Every day I am still short of breath. In week six I got a left-sided stabbing chest pain. I now have an abnormal heart rate. This is something you can get with viruses and I’m hoping it will go. You wonder why is this happening? As a physician I have been reading articles. We are learning about coronavirus in real time. The virus is completely novel, akin to HIVAids in the 1980s.“I’m now on day 74 and not at work. Essentially I go bed, kitchen, sofa. There are weeks when I feel I have ridden the wave, and others where I’m back in the wave. I would like to get back to normal life sooner rather than later. It feels very endless.”Dr Tracy Briggs, 42, clinical academic and geneticist at the University of Manchester“I got symptoms on 13 March. We had been in London on holiday for half-term and rode the tube and went to museums. I felt short of breath. My chest was tight and my heart was racing. I have very mild asthma and I thought maybe it was an attack. It was strange. The inhaler didn’t work and after a few hours I went to A\u0026ampE. I was told to go home and isolate.“I wasn’t able to get out of bed or eat. I felt absolutely rough, sweaty, with a horrible sore throat and struggling to breathe. After 10 days I started to do a little bit more. I went for a walk with the family and pottered around the house. Then I seemed to step back and struggle again. Climbing one flight of stairs would send my heart racing. I would cough and be short of breath.“It has been such a rollercoaster. You start to question yourself and your own sanity. You wonder what tomorrow is going to be. It’s quite tough. My 12-year-old son had no appetite for three weeks, a sore throat and vomiting. My husband had a sore throat for a week and a mild chicken pox-like rash. My stepson had Covid symptoms and was coughing, but not as badly as me.”“My tongue and the back of the throat are red, white and inflamed. I’ve lost quite a lot of weight. I find myself choking on food and short of breath when I eat. I’ve been taking Gaviscon and today started on a course of proton pump inhibitors. I’ve had a feeling of burning in my sternum and my throat.“I felt hot and sweaty but didn’t have a documented high temperature. I think there is a need to recognise that the clinical symptoms are much wider than cough and fever. This isn’t necessarily something which lasts seven or 14 days. Absolutely acute patients are the priority. But we need to be aware that for a number of people, even those who don’t need to go to hospital, it’s going on for a long period. We need support.”Jo Platt, 46, former Labour MP for Leigh“I lost my seat in the December election. I wasn’t going to work or down to London. The only thing I can think of is I picked up the virus while shopping. The first symptoms began on 24 March. It was like flicking a light switch. I was at my computer and felt I was going to faint. I had nausea, dizziness and a burning temperature. Then the fatigue set in. I couldn’t move and went to bed for two days.“I recovered and thought I had something really mild. For two more days I was shaky. The next day I really went down with it. I had shortness of breath, an unproductive cough. It felt like something was in my chest. I had a horrific headache. I could not get out of bed for a full week. By the Easter weekend I thought I was out of it. But that Monday the symptoms returned. I called my GP. They were very nice, but said you haven’t got the usual symptoms and should rest.“The gastro thing is really worrying me. I lost a stone in weight and could not eat. My blood tests were normal apart from a vitamin D deficiency. I couldn’t get a test. It’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. The government says if you haven’t got a cough or temperature or loss of taste it’s not Covid. That’s not true. My GP now says they’ve had numerous cases similar to mine.“This is week 10. I get back pain, like an inflammation. It’s not as severe as it’s been. I have a really strange sensation in my legs, as if I’ve been hill walking. I wake up with sore joints in my fingers. I’ve had gastrointestinal issues and acid reflux. Seeing food on TV makes me feel nauseous. This is manageable. For me the scary thing is the shortness of breath. We still don’t know how long this goes on for and that’s the frightening bit.“It started on 16 March. I had a slight cough and a terrible headache. The next morning my temperature was 38.3C. A week later, I was feeling worse and developed shortness of breath but it passed after a day or so. After another week I felt completely well. I went out for a short jog and felt fine. Normally I run 25km a week, swim and do yoga. But then later that week, after another short run, I was hit by extreme fatigue lasting four days. This happened another three to four times, after much less exertion.“Around week seven there was a big deterioration. It was my son’s birthday and I was busy, making him a cake, and we went on a short family bike ride too. A few days later, it all came back but much worse. I had lots of symptoms, including tingling on the right side of my body, and a sensation of heat on my left foot, as well as shortness of breath, chest pain and fevers. People talk about internal shaking. I had that and a feeling like my stomach was vibrating, deeply unpleasant and as if I was being poisoned.“It was very frightening to feel so unwell. Going into week nine I was exhausted. Staying in bed really helped with fatigue but in week 11, I still have low grade fevers, chills, malaise and odd neurological symptoms. I am resting a lot but my improvements have plateaued.“We don’t know what is causing prolonged Covid. Is it the ongoing initial illness, or is it an inflammatory reaction or is it a post-viral syndrome? We don’t know what the prognosis is or what the long-term consequences are. I wonder how many people are having prolonged illness and what the impact is on the workforce, for example. It’s scary to have an illness for which there isn’t any treatment and that doesn’t seem to be going away.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0e46f2d92ca12c46e9640c0673196ee1f89a26b/0_111_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efa95cdaa4bb9cfb7b9187e4c6324a26","title":"it was profoundly sad work and challenging coronavirus","story":"One doctor explains the difficult task of certifying deaths of coronavirus victims who died at home, often aloneI was one of 30 doctors who at NHS England’s request volunteered to certify deaths of people who had died “in the community” – at home – rather than in a care home or hospital. We were sent the deceased’s name, location of death and brief details of their medical history, which the ambulance service person or police officer had gathered. We then spoke to their GP, or hospital doctor, or relatives, to glean more information about them and what might have led to their death.For about 10 days at the peak of the pandemic in April, PMART doctors issued about 60 to 80 death certificates a day for people who had died at home, and in the end we had issued one for about 700 people in all. We each certified about 20, 30 or 40 deaths. Of the ones I did, everyone who died was over 40, and most were over 70. Many had other diseases like diabetes, obesity, breathing problems or high blood pressure and a few had a history of drug or alcohol misuse. It was profoundly sad work, and challenging, but at the same time not grim work.Most of us did a few cases in which people had died at home alone and lain undiscovered for some days. The longest time someone had gone before being discovered that I had was a week. Those cases were sad, especially given someone’s body had started to decompose. That made it impossible to say definitively if someone had died of Covid or something else, like a heart attack. However, we assumed that many were due to Covid, often exacerbated by underlying health problems.So that I could do this work I struck a balance between caring and enabling myself to function. I approached it as a duty to carry out as a medical professional, rather than as a friend or relative, to minimise me getting distressed as a result of feeling empathy for the deceased and their family, as that would inhibit your ability to do your job. And it helped that we did this work remotely, often from our own homes. We then passed on our findings to either the local coroner or local registrar of deaths. I suspect we will hear more about these tragic deaths of people alone at home when coroners’ inquests begin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e30a4b1410dfe56d14e0f260cd6865f6a82e6c10/0_266_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03d3e6a186eddea6eb4305434f1f30cf","title":"what is coronavirus r number and is it rising in uk","story":"Research suggests the average number of people one person infects may be increasing – but opinions differ as to why With models suggesting that R could have risen above 1 in some parts of the UK, we look at what that means and how concerned we should be:R is a measure of the average number of people one infected person will go on to infect. If R is above 1, an outbreak can grow exponentially, but if it is below 1, the outbreak shrinks.The latest official estimates – produced by a group of researchers called Spi-M and based on multiple models – put R at between 0.7 and 0.9 for the whole of the UK, and between 0.7 and 1 for England alone.However, research by Public Health England (PHE) and Cambridge\u0026nbspUniversity suggests R is on the rise. R is now at around 1 for the south-west and just over 1 for north-west England.Researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) also say the overall R may be creeping up, but put R in the south-west at 1and 0.8 in the north-west.There are a number of possibilities. One is that as lockdown measures have been eased, community transmission has risen. But speaking on BBC’s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Prof John Edmunds, an LSHTM epidemiologist, suggested another reason.“The large amount of community transmission that was occurring a couple of months ago has not come to a complete stop, but has reduced enormously,” he said. Instead, he argued, the epidemic has been concentrated in settings such as care homes and hospitals, where infections spread efficiently, meaning they are now influencing the average R to a greater degree, and hence R appears to have crept up. While spread of the virus in hospitals and care homes is of deep concern, and could seed infections in the community, Edmunds’ explanation suggests the relaxation of lockdown measures is not the main driver of the upward creep in R, and different measures may be required to tackle the trend. However, Edmunds said the key question that remains is whether transmission in the community is also rising – something he says is unclear, despite the PHECambridge team arguing that the rise in R “is probably due to increasing mobility and mixing between households and in public and workplace settings”.“They actually have that embedded in their model, that assumption,” said Edmunds, noting that the team drew on Google mobility data, which shows people moving around more. “That doesn’t necessarily mean that contact between iniduals has been going up by anywhere near the same amount.“We have been measuring people’s contact behaviour over the last two months or so and that has crept up a … very small amount, but hasn’t returned to anywhere near pre-lockdown levels.”When asked at a press briefing on Friday whether he believed R was above 1 in the community anywhere in the UK, Dr\u0026nbspPaul\u0026nbspBirrell, a co-author of the Cambridge study, said it was hard to say with certainty, “but my strong suspicion is that R is below 1 in the community, but is increasing”.The PHECambridge study reveals that while the median figure for R is 1.01 in the north-west, the full range of possible values is 0.83 to 1.18. Similar ranges are seen for the other regions.That means that it is not certain whether R is truly above or below 1 anywhere. Edmunds noted that other models give different figures: “I would stress that overall, the assessment is that it is still below 1 probably everywhere on average.” Recent lockdown relaxations are expected to be reflected in R figures over the course of the coming week.Also important to consider is the number of infections. When they are widespread across the community, an R above 1 is very concerning as it could mean a rise in cases that spreads to new areas – as happened at the start of the outbreak. Infection rates in the north-west remain high, so it is important to establish whether R in the community there is indeed above 1.However, as the overall number of infections in the community reaches low levels,\u0026nbspa large R may arise from a local outbreak or cluster of infections – a very different scenario. Prof Rowland Kao, an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh, said: “If R equals 1.1, and you have 10 infected, that is only 11 new cases, which means that ramping up efforts can easily contain it – if 1,000 are infected, that is 1,100 more, which is much harder.”If R is sustained above 1, however, the situation could rapidly deteriorate. Kao noted repeated outbreaks could also raise the risk of the infection spreading to new areas or triggering a new outbreak in a hospital or care home. In addition, experts warn, at low levels of infection, uncertainty in R increases.Dr Sebastian Funk of the LSHTM said the UK government appeared to be happy with R floating around 1, despite infections remaining relatively high. “That will come with the risk of higher number of deaths and morbidity compared to a scenario where you drive the disease to lower numbers before loosening the physical distancing measures,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/316cf2e8fa2f77c563c289398b5d014c1cfef7f1/0_360_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=213c3f484f4892b2c65c5ddab203d9f7","title":"new zealand abandons covid 19 restrictions after nation declared no cases","story":"Jacinda Ardern says she ‘did a little dance’ when she heard there were no cases of coronavirus left in the countryNew Zealand’s government will lift all Covid-19 restrictions except stringent border controls almost immediately, prime minister Jacinda Ardern has said, as the nation’s health officials declared that there were no longer any known, active cases of the coronavirus remaining.\u0026nbsp“We are ready,” said Ardern at a news conference in Wellington, adding that New Zealanders had “united in unprecedented ways to crush the virus.”Ardern has drawn global headlines and praise from the World Health Organization for her government’s approach to the virus, with a strict and cautious approach that appears to have paid off. On 25 March she locked down the country for four weeks – requiring that most New Zealanders remained at home most of the time – before gradually easing restrictions.\u0026nbspFrom midnight on Monday, Ardern said New Zealanders would live in a country “where life feels as normal as we can in the time of a global pandemic”. Physical distancing rules and limits on gathering sizes would be jettisoned, she said, allowing any parts of the economy still stalled to reopen.\u0026nbspNew Zealanders responded with jubilation on social media.“I know it’s a Monday and all, but I reckon I might pop that bottle of bubbly tonight and raise a glass to all the people of this fine country. Ka pai Aotearoa,” said James Shaw, the climate change minister, using a Māori phrase that means ‘good job, New Zealand.’“Also, wash your hands...” he added.Others looked forward to new freedoms with no restrictions in place from midnight on Monday: breakfast buffets, sitting next to each other on public transport, and being allowed to “touch my face”. Some were more cautious. “Despite zero active cases, I am employing the precautionary principle and never going back to the gym, on account of corona,” one user tweeted.New Zealand had reported just over 200 confirmed cases when the government shut down the country, and the total number of diagnosed instances of the virus never topped 1,500.\u0026nbspTwenty-two people died of Covid-19 in New Zealand, in contrast to the tens of thousands of deaths that modelling by scientists had predicted if restrictions were not imposed.New Zealanders had “massively reduced their movements”, Ardern said according to Google data, people had stayed at home more than residents in Australia, Britain and the United States had.\u0026nbsp“Our collective results I think speak for ourselves,” Ardern said. “This was what the sacrifice of our team of five million was for – to keep one another safe and to keep one another well.” She has regularly referred to New Zealanders as a “team of five million” in an effort to unite people and encourage them to follow her government’s rules to curb the virus’ spread.Worldwide, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases passed 7 million on Monday, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, who rely on official government data. The current figure stands at 7,006,436. At least 402,699 people have died in the global pandemic so far.The US is the worst-affected country, with 1,940,468 confirmed cases and more than a quarter of the world’s deaths, at 110,503. There are 15 countries with more than 100,000 confirmed cases. The true death and cases figures are likely to be higher, due to differing testing rates, definitions, time lags and suspected underreporting.Strict border controls will remain in place for New Zealand, with Ardern warning that she had no timeline for removing them as they were, she said, the country’s best line of defence. Only New Zealanders and their immediate families can enter the country currently, and must spend 14 days in government-run quarantine.\u0026nbspShe would not say that New Zealand had outright eliminated the virus, describing elimination as an ongoing effort.“We almost certainly see cases here again,” she said. “That is not a sign that we have failed it is a reality of this virus.”New Zealand is now part of a small group of countries that have declared themselves free of Covid-19, and is understood to be the first to do so among nations that have had more than 1,000 confirmed cases.\u0026nbspThe small European nation of Montenegro reported it no longer had any active cases of the virus on 25 May, Fiji followed on 5 June, and the Faroe Islands had said the same on 9 May.Taiwan, Iceland, Cambodia, and Trinidad \u0026amp Tobago each say they have fewer than 10 cases still active. A small handful of countries – including several tiny Pacific Island states – claim to have recorded no cases of Covid-19 at all.\u0026nbspFor the past 10 days, a lone woman aged in her 50s, who lived in Auckland, was the last person in New Zealand known to be suffering from Covid-19. On Monday, health officials said, she had reported 48 hours symptom-free and was now considered recovered.Ardern was asked what her reaction had been to the news. “I did a little dance,” she said.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82f9a882b186d063ddbd511b3beaf5d1af40dc3e/0_177_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12ca4b4b6107d908e36491659b1e4268","title":"pub gardens in england could reopen from 22 june reports","story":"JD Wetherspoon boss says move would be psychological boost for struggling sectorOpening beer gardens before the end of the month would give struggling pubs a psychological boost but most would still lose money, JD Wetherspoon’s founder, Tim Martin, has said.The government is reportedly ready to let pub beer gardens in England reopen from 22 June as part of plans drawn up by a group of ministers, dubbed the “Save Summer Six”, who are looking at ways to restart the hospitality industry earlier than initially planned.The proposals, first reported in the Financial Times, would allow some of the 27,000 pubs that have outdoor space to serve customers for the first time in three months.Martin, the chairman of JD Wetherspoon, said: “Few pubs will be able to make a profit using outdoor space only but partial reopening will provide a psychological boost to a beleaguered industry.“It will signal the intent of the government to make progress towards normality, which will be welcome.”Almost 700 of Wetherspoons’ 867 pubs have a beer garden, roof terrace or patio and the company has previously set out plans for a coronavirus pandemic-era pub involving bar staff wearing goggles and protective screens between tables.Easing restrictions on pubs before the end of June would mean accelerating the timetable set last month for restarting the hospitality industry.The government initially set a date of 4 July to begin the third phase of easing lockdown, saying this would be the earliest possible moment for reopening some of the UK’s 47,000 pubs, along with other bars, cafes and restaurants with outside seating areas.The British Beer \u0026amp Pubs Association, representing pub companies, has since issued a series of dire forecasts about the effect of lockdown on the industry, warning that thousands of pubs could shut for good.The trade body has lobbied hard for venues with outside space to be able to welcome drinkers by early July.The FT reported that Whitehall officials have now fixed on an even earlier date of 22 June as they search for ways to inject some life into the hospitality industry, which has been devastated by the lockdown restrictions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94de62e5a52b0519729582d6a9a7925cfa7a64db/0_593_6652_3992/master/6652.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f81b44140b7f28310adb42e7152c2783","title":"workers

establishmentsHealth authorities in Tokyo are to ask employees of host clubs and similar establishments to be regularly tested for Covid-19 after evidence that the virus is spreading among people who work in the capital’s night-time economy.The city reported 14 new infections on Sunday, six of which involved people working in clubs where employees pour drinks and talk to customers in close proximity.“We want to make sure that people do not catch or transmit the virus also in night-time entertainment districts,” Tokyo’s governor, Yuriko Koike, said on Sunday, according to the Kyodo news

cafes, pachinko parlours and commercial sex establishments.Four of the remaining cases are also thought to be connected to the city’s huge night-time economy.The number of cases traced to host clubs – where women pay to talk to male employees over drinks and snacks – and similar establishments in Tokyo has risen since Japan lifted its seven-week state of emergency at the end of May, raising fears of a second wave in the city.The economy minister, Yasutoshi Nishimura, said the government would release guidelines on containing the spread of Covid-19 in entertainment districts at the weekend.Media reports said the measures could included regular Covid-19 tests for employees at clubs where social distancing and other preventive measures are difficult to implement.They include bars and lounges where men pay to talk and drink with female employees. “What we sell here is us, ourselves,” a woman who works at a “girls’ bar” in Tokyo told the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. “So wearing a mask would show disrespect towards our customers.”Other clubs, however, say they have taken measures such as ensuring adequate ventilation, providing hand sanitiser and checking customers’ temperatures at the door. Employees must wear a face covering and maintain a distance of at least one metre from customers.Many bars and restaurants closed during the state of emergency or reduced their business hours in response to a request from Koike, who does not have the legal powers to force them to close. Others, though, have remained open, complaining that they will not be able to survive a prolonged shutdown.The number of daily infections is falling throughout Japan, with 36 reported on Sunday to being the country’s total to 17,864, while no new deaths were recorded for the first time in three months.Tokyo, which has the highest number of infections at nearly 5,400, is gradually easing restrictions on businesses, with cinemas, gyms and cram schools and other facilities reopening last Monday.But a day later, Koike issued an alert, reminding Tokyoites to avoid the “three Cs” – crowded and confined spaces, and close human contact – an approach that some experts have credited with Japan’s success at containing the outbreak.Restaurants have been urged to close at 10 pm – two hours later than during the state of emergency – but restrictions have yet to be lifted on nightclubs and live music venues."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0312fee8fec5f49824af73d16dcc12a83955835c/0_247_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=417ec99d8057fd2efea3801160d1a287","title":"five ways new zealand can keep covid 19 cases at zero","story":"Modelling shows it is very likely New Zealand has eliminated coronavirus. Keeping it that way is the next big challenge Today, for the\u0026nbspfirst time since 28 February, New Zealand has\u0026nbspno active cases\u0026nbspof Covid-19.It is also the 17th day since the last new case was reported. New Zealand has a total of\u0026nbsp1,154 confirmed cases\u0026nbsp(combined total of confirmed and probable cases is 1,504) and 22 people have died.Today’s news is an important milestone and a time to celebrate. But as we continue to rebuild the economy, there are several challenges ahead if New Zealand wants to retain its Covid-19-free status while the pandemic continues elsewhere.It remains important that good science supports the government’s risk assessment and management. Below, we recommend several ways people can protect themselves. But we also argue New Zealand needs an urgent overhaul of the health system, including the establishment of a new national public health agency for disease prevention and control.Elimination is defined as the absence of a disease at a national or regional level. Eradication refers to its global extinction (as with smallpox).Elimination requires a high-performing surveillance system to provide assurance that, should border control fail, any new cases would be quickly found. Agreed\u0026nbspdefinitions are important\u0026nbspfor public reassurance and as a basis for expanding travel links with other countries that have also achieved elimination.It is important to remind ourselves that active cases are not the ones we need to worry about. By definition, they have all been identified and placed in isolation and are very unlikely to infect others. The real target of elimination is to stop the unseen cases silently spreading in the community. This is why we need mathematical modelling to tell us that elimination is likely.New Zealand’s\u0026nbspdecisive elimination strategy\u0026nbspappears to have succeeded, but it is easy to become complacent. Many other countries pursuing a containment approach have had new outbreaks, notably\u0026nbspSingapore,\u0026nbspSouth Korea\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspAustralia.New Zealand has spent months expanding its capacities to eliminate Covid-19. But maintaining elimination will be challenging. Airports, seaports and quarantine facilities remain potential sites of transmission from overseas, particularly given the\u0026nbsppressure to increase numbers of arrivals.Just as New Zealand prepared for the pandemic, the post-elimination period requires “maximum proactivity”. Here are five key risk management approaches to achieve lasting protection for New Zealand against Covid-19 and other serious public health threats.1. Establish public use of fabric face masks in specific settingsWith the end of physical distancing, we recommend the government seriously considers making mask wearing mandatory on public transport, on aircraft and at border control and quarantine facilities. Other personal hygiene measures (staying home if sick, washing hands, coughing into elbows) are insufficient when transmission is often from people who appear well and can\u0026nbspspread the virus simply by breathing and talking.The evidence base for the effectiveness of even simple fabric face masks is now strong, according to a\u0026nbsprecent systematic review published in the Lancet. The World Health Organization has also\u0026nbspupdated its guidelines\u0026nbspto recommend that everyone wear fabric face masks in public areas where there is a risk of transmission. Establishing a culture of using face masks in specific settings in New Zealand will make it easier to expand their use if required in future outbreaks.2. Improve contact-tracing effectiveness with suitable digital toolsNew Zealand’s\u0026nbspnational system for contact tracing\u0026nbspremains a critical back-stop measure to control outbreaks, should border controls fail. But there is significant potential for new digital tools to\u0026nbspenhance current processes, albeit with appropriate privacy safeguards built in. To be effective, such digital solutions must have\u0026nbsphigh uptake and support very rapid contact tracing. Downloadable apps appear insufficient and both\u0026nbspNew Zealand and\u0026nbspSingapore\u0026nbspare investigating bluetooth-enabled devices which appear to perform better and could be distributed to all residents.3. Apply a science-based approach to border managementA cautious return to higher levels of inbound and outbound travel is important for economic and humanitarian reasons, but we need to assess the risk carefully. This opening up includes two very different processes. One is a broadening of the current categories of people permitted to enter New Zealand beyond residents, their families and a small number of others. This will typically require the continuation of\u0026nbsproutine 14-day quarantine, until improved methods are developed.The other potential expansion is quarantine-free entry, which will be safest from countries that meet similar elimination targets. This process could begin with\u0026nbspPacific Island nations\u0026nbspfree of Covid-19, notably Samoa and Tonga. It should be possible to extend this arrangement to various Australian states and other jurisdictions such as Fiji and Taiwan when they confirm their elimination status.Even before Covid-19 hit New Zealand, it was clear our national public health infrastructure was failing after decades of neglect, fragmentation and erosion. Prominent examples of system failure include the\u0026nbspHavelock North campylobacter outbreak\u0026nbspin 2016 and the\u0026nbspprolonged measles epidemic\u0026nbspin 2019. The comprehensive\u0026nbsphealth and disability system review\u0026nbspreport was delivered to the Minister of Health in March and was widely expected to recommend significant upgrading of public health capacity. This report and its recommendations should now be released.We also recommend an interim evaluation of the public health response to Covid-19 now, rather than after the pandemic. These reviews would inform the needed upgrade of New Zealand’s public health capacity to manage the ongoing pandemic response and to prepare the country for other serious health threats. A key improvement would be a dedicated national public health agency to lead disease control and prevention. Such an agency could help avoid the need for lockdowns by early detection and action in response to emerging infectious disease threats, as achieved by\u0026nbspTaiwan\u0026nbspduring the current pandemic.5. Commit to transformational change to avoid major global threatsCovid-19 is having devastating health and social impacts globally. Even if it is brought under control with a vaccine or antivirals, other major health threats remain, including\u0026nbspclimate change, loss of biological ersity and existential threats (for example, pandemics arising from developments in synthetic biology). These threats need urgent attention. The recovery from lockdown provides an opportunity for a sustained transformation of our economy that addresses wider health, environmental and social goals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ef624f5d58d1e964c31498efa82a5de528808ff/0_131_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=866e5afcbea5559f9743a89e63bcb188","title":"uk coronavirus live latest updates covid 19","story":"Follow all the latest developments in the Covid-19 pandemic response As the UK government’s easing of lockdown restrictions is gradually introduced, new quarantine regulations mean that passengers arriving in Britain from Monday will need to stay at home for 14 days. At Heathrow airport there was some confusion, however, as the first passengers subject to the new restrictions landed.Travellers were asked to fill in the online forms but evidence to prove the information was correct was not required. Some passengers were surprised by the lack of physical screening for the virus. Fiona Gathright, 59, travelled from Washington DC and will be living in Bristol with her fiance, who had flown in from Hong Kong. “They didn’t even do a temperature check at either end, not in Washington before we got on the flight and not in London when we got off the flight,” she said. “Somebody could have been on the flight with a 100-plus temperature and gotten off and gone on their merry way.”There was also some uncertainty over the exact details of the quarantine. “They told me that we could go get groceries. That’s my understanding anyway. But we had thought if we couldn’t get food we could order stuff online,” Gathright said. Others said they were told not to leave the house for food shopping unless necessary.The travellers were told to try to avoid public transport when heading to their final destination but this was not possible for many. Bernard Looney, the chief executive, told employees that the job cuts were essential to enable the company to cope with a global collapse in demand for oil owing to the coronavirus pandemic. He said BP must reinvent itself and emerge from the crisis a “leaner, faster-moving and lower carbon company”.The London-headquartered group has not said how many jobs will be lost in the UK but it is thought the figure could be close to 2,000.Looney told staff in a company-wide email on Monday: You are already aware that, beyond the clear human tragedy, there has been widespread economic fallout, along with consequences for our industry and our company.The oil price has plunged well below the level we need to turn a profit. We are spending much, much more than we make – I am talking millions of dollars, every day. And as a result, our net debt rose by $6bn in the first quarter.A further 59 people have died in hospital in England after testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the total to 27,490. The patients were aged between 34 and 100, with three aged between 54 and 68 known to have had underlying health conditions. No deaths were reported in London hospitals for the second day in a row but NHS England said a “small number” of people had died and these would be included in figures in the next few days. A further 55 people have died after contracting Covid-19 in UK, taking the country’s death toll to 40,597. The rise is the lowest daily total of newly reported deaths since 22 March, according to PA analysis, but there is often a lag in the reporting of deaths over a weekend and the government figures do not include all deaths involving Covid-19 across the UK, which is thought to have passed 50,000. A leading epidemiologist has said success in tackling Covid-19 relies on leaders being honest about their strategy. In an article for the , Liam Smeeth, dean of the Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said:Public confidence is critical to beating this epidemic because the key tools – social distancing, contact-tracing and self-isolation – only work if people fully engage. Two factors have massively dented public confidence, threatening control efforts. First, the obvious lack of a clear long-term strategy, which creates the impression of a government that is not in control.Second, a series of political mishaps. The health secretary blaming PPE shortages on NHS staff. The prime minister’s confused address to the nation on 10 May. And a top government adviser – Dominic Cummings – breaking the very spirit of collective action needed to defeat the epidemic.If we are to control this epidemic, we need the whole country to be united in a collective effort. To achieve this we need to restore trust in the government. A starting point would be an unequivocal apology for the mistakes made so far. For each major error we need a clear plan in place for how the negative impact will be mitigated. We then need a clear long-term strategy for minimising the future impact of the epidemic, covering the possibilities of us getting an effective or partially effective vaccine, or no vaccine at all. This strategy needs to be explained to the whole population, and as new measures are announced, they must be presented as part of this overall strategy.A further three people have died after testing positive for coronavirus in Wales, taking the total number of deaths in the country to 1,401. Another 42 people have tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 14,438. Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said it was “absolutely right” that exam regulator Ofqual should put in place contingency plans for next summer’s exams to account for a possible second wave of Covid-19 infections. I think it is essential that Ofqual draws up plans in the event that there can’t be exams next year because we are in a second spike. And the fact is also that young people and teachers will have lost quite a lot of teaching time so there has to be a real discussion about what those exams will look like. The students might need to have greater choice in the questions they answer. Because education has been so disrupted, it is absolutely right that Ofqual should plan for education not as normal. Bousted called on the UK government to follow the example of the devolved administrations in coming up with ways of teaching in different formats to tackle the spread of Covid-19, including the wider use of buildings to allow for physical distancing, as well as forms of long-distance learning. In an open letter to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, the British Dental Association (BDA) said that “since lockdown, support from across government for our members has been far too limited. That cannot continue”. One dentist has described the return to work as “nerve-wracking”. Roy Woodhoo, 36, at Woodford Green Dental Care, told the PA news agency he has been “frustrated” he has not been able to help patients for weeks. “We’ve had patients calling up since the beginning of lockdown and it’s been frustrating in that we have not been able to help them as much as we could,” he said. The BDA previously warned there will be no return to “business as usual” for the industry, with patients likely to see a “skeleton service” today. Chair of the BDA, Mick Armstrong, said surgeries are “operating at a fraction of their pre-pandemic capacity” and asked the health secretary to “take responsibility to avert the existential crisis facing a service struggling with sky-high costs and radically reduced patient numbers”. He added: For years, communities from Cornwall to Cumbria struggled to get appointments but were ignored. Without action from this government access problems - on an unprecedented scale - are going to be visited on millions of patients, in every part in England. A department of health and social care spokesman said: “The safety of patients and those working in dental practices will be our top priority. We are working around the clock to make sure frontline healthcare staff have the PPE they need and have made further supplies available to the dental sector via wholesalers last week.” The company, which employs 1,140 staff in the UK, is seeking to make the cuts across its entire business, from head office and retail to manufacturing and distribution.Mulberry has launched a consultation with the 470 staff whose jobs are at risk, a third of its workforce, with the aim to cut “approximately” a quarter of its global workforce. Downing Street has dismissed suggestions the system of quarantine for passengers arriving in the UK could be replaced by coronavirus checks at airports. The prime minister’s official spokesman said people needed to self-isolate for 14 days as it could be a “significant number of days” after becoming infected before they developed symptoms. They could potentially have a test at the border, that test could say that they were negative for coronavirus and then a few days later they may start to develop symptoms and by that point they might have already been spreading the virus. This is Jessica Murray, I’ve taken over the blog from Matthew for the rest of the day - please do get in touch with any questions or suggestions:Lockdowns had a dramatic impact on the spread of coronavirus in Europe with strict controls on people’s movements preventing an estimated 3.1 million deaths by the beginning of May, and 470,000 deaths averted in the UK alone, researchers say.When R is less than 1 the epidemic is in decline because, on average, each infected person transmits the infection to less than one other. As countries ease out of their lockdown, scientists are watching R closely: if it rises and remains above 1, the epidemic will grow exponentially. The Imperial team pooled data on Covid-19 deaths from 11 European countries including the UK, Italy, France, Spain and Germany, and worked backwards to calculate the extent of transmission several weeks earlier, to account for the time lag between infections and deaths. Lockdown at the end of March reduced the reproductive number of the UK epidemic from 3.8 to 0.63, they calculate.“It tells us we need to be very careful and not to release too much in one go because then you have no control,” Grandy said. “We need to tread very carefully and do things slowly, so we can backtrack should they not work.”The Downing Street lobby briefing is over. Here are some of the main lines.Second home owners in Wales may get the chance to take a holiday in their properties this summer, the Welsh first minister has said.Mark Drakeford revealed the Welsh government was discussing the possibility of people being able to use self-contained accommodation - but he said that local communities would have to support such a move.The first minister said: There is a distinction to be drawn between people who have their own kitchen and their own bathroom....That will be different, I think, to someone travelling to stay somewhere where they are sharing kitchens, showers, toilets, where inevitably the level of risk will be greater.Drakeford said that once a visitor arrived at, for example, a self-contained cottage, they would be governed by the Welsh advice not to travel more than five miles from their base.He acknowledged there had been concern from communities in parts of north-west and south-west Wales who worry that an influx of visitors could lead to a spike in Covid-19 cases. “It’s got to be with community consent,” he said.Drakeford also said the possibility that pubs and restaurants could re-open in some way if the number of cases continued to fall would be discussed this week.It will depend on whether the number of new cases in Wales continues to fall and whether that creates any additional headroom for us.Without public faith in government actions, the UK will never beat Covid-19, warns Liam Smeeth, dean of the Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical MedicinePublic confidence is critical to beating this epidemic because the key tools – social distancing, contact-tracing and self-isolation – only work if people fully engage.

Photograph: iStockHotels and B\u0026ampBs across Ireland have received an “avalanche” of reservations over the weekend following Friday’s announcement that hotels, hostels and restaurants can reopen from June 29th.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said on Friday that the re-opening of hotels, restaurants, hostels and museums would be brought forward to the end of June as part of phase two of the roadmap to reopening the country.In the Parknasilla resort in Co Kerry, the phone started ringing shortly after midday on Friday as rumours began circulating that the reopening date for hotels would be brought forward. By Monday morning, nearly all the resort’s 65 self-catering houses had been booked out for July while reservations for the hotel continued to stream in, said Carmel Flynn, head of sales for Parknasilla.“When the news hit on Friday it was like an avalanche of reservations. People know we’re located in a very open space, they’re comfortable about booking to stay in that environment.”Anxious waitParknasilla is set to lose €3 million this year but hopes to make some money back over the summer months, said Ms Flynn. Some 38 European staff members have remained on site during lockdown helping to “keep the hotel alive” but the resort hopes to be back employing 130 people by the end of July.Hotel staff are now anxiously awaiting the Government’s re-opening guidelines, says Ms Flynn. “We’re happy to open slowly, set up our systems and test them at first. We’re hoping for a one-metre social distancing rule but we can see why it would be two metres for the initial period. We just have to go with the flow.”Further south, the phone at Rolf’s Country House outside Baltimore in West Cork also started ringing off the hook on Friday afternoon.“Since last Thursday we’ve had 63 enquiries which translated into bookings, the week before there were only 11 enquiries,” said owner Johannes Haffner, adding that some people were booking for early July as soon as restrictions are lifted.All reservations are from Irish visitors so far, said Mr Haffner. However, he’s hoping to see the usual German and French tourists return in September.The rooms at Rolf’s were fully refurbished during the winter to mark the country houses’ 40th year in West Cork. “The place is looking gorgeous but no one has stayed in the new rooms yet. They were ready to go for Easter but then all the bookings were cancelled.”“I’m feeling positive about the situation now. The doors are opening and because Irish people are weary about travelling abroad, I think we’ll benefit as an island with tourism.”‘Everyone has been affected’Back in Kerry, Gary Curran who runs Greenmount House in Dingle has also been fielding a wave of reservation requests since last Friday. He says most people are holding out visiting the town until pubs re-open on July 20th.Dingle, a town which relies hugely on tourism, has suffered badly in the past three months, said Mr Curran. “We were just about to take back our staff for the summer and then lockdown happened. Everyone has been affected here, no one escaped it. We’re all in the same boat together.”Greenmount is now preparing how to serve breakfast while maintaining social distancing between customers. “Usually we have a buffet and people graze but we’ll have to bring in booking times for breakfast and it will go on for longer. Theoretically we can seat 20 people but we’ll probably only be able to allow 8-10 people at a time now.”Tim Fenn, chief executive of the Irish Hotel Federation agreed that there had been an increase in online traffic investigating Irish holiday locations and that it was “clear that people are confident that they can stay safely in Irish hotels this summer”.Mr Fenn said it was too early to calculate how many bookings were being made but “heartening” to see people making plans for holidays at home in Ireland.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4269776.1591369775!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"travel refunds up in the air as readers run out of patience","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople are confused about their rights and worried about losing money and angered at companies who – they say – are deliberately making their lives more difficult. Photograph: Getty ImagesThe Pricewatch mailbox continues to overflow with queries and complaints connected to travel, and it remains – by far – the single biggest area of concern among readers. People are confused about their rights and worried about losing money and angered at companies who – they say – are deliberately making their lives more difficult by ignoring queries or putting up spurious roadblocks in the way of resolution. Were we to feature every single complaint we have received in the last couple of months we would probably need a supplement, so large has the volume of correspondence been. Here are just some of the queries we received on a single day early last week. First up was a mail from a reader by the name of Frank Lawrence: “I decided to drop you a line because I have been waiting for an Aer Lingus voucher since April 17th,” his mail began. “I was supposed to travel to Paris from Dublin on May 2nd and to return on June 6th. Of course, this was not possible due to the Covid-19 restrictions in France and Ireland. ”Now, under EU regulations – regulations that the authorities in Ireland and across the EU have repeatedly stressed remain in force despite attempts by airlines to circumvent them – if a flight is cancelled by an airline, then a passenger has a legal right to a full refund and that refund has to be issued within seven working days of the impacted passenger seeking it. As you will most likely be aware, many airlines across the EU have sought to issue passengers with vouchers instead of cash. Our reader was actually happy with that and was not demanding his cash back.But over the last six or seven weeks he has got nothing. Our reader has followed the news at Irish and European levels regarding refunds versus vouchers. “In my case, I am happy to take a voucher. I know I’ll use it, as I travel frequently enough within Europe, both for work and pleasure. I’m contacting you because you seem to have success getting responses. How long does one have to wait for a voucher and what is reasonable? At the moment, there is no clarity and, it would appear, no deadline for Aer Lingus to deal with this.”Aer Lingus said it was processing an “unprecedented level of refund and voucher applications together with rebooking requests”. A spokeswoman said it had expanded its teams and introduced new processes in an effort to speed up the process time. “We are working around the clock to address the extraordinary increase in applications and are endeavouring to process refunds and vouchers as quickly as we can. “ RyanairThe next mail we received was from Michael Thanner, and he had a question which was similar to one many of our readers have posed in recent days. “Myself and my wife are booked on a Ryanair flight from Dublin to Memmingen, Germany on Monday, July 6th,” he began. “We have recently received notification that this flight is going ahead as scheduled. However, we live in Kerry and would be travelling to Dublin for this flight. As travel outside of our region is not permitted until 20th July we would like to postpone this flight, without incurring extra cost, until August.”The couple wrote to Ryanair and said this was their preferred option. He said the reply he received from the airline did not address the query.This is what the response said. So, what are the rules? If our health experts and the Department of Foreign Affairs say we should not travel more than 20km and warn against non-essential overseas travel, do airlines offer refunds or the opportunity to rebook even if the flights in question depart as scheduled?We got in touch with our friends at Ryanair to find out how it would be handling such matters in the weeks ahead. We received no response. However, the Commission for Aviation Regulation has clarified that if an air carrier has not cancelled a flight, there is no entitlement to re-routing or a refund under the regulations.Irish Ferries“Just what is up with Irish Ferries?” started the mail from Richard Gem. “We wanted to change our Rosslare-Pembroke ferry crossing. According to Irish Ferries website this could be done online as the booking was more than five days ahead. However when I attempted to manage my booking online I was instructed first to ‘click on edit passenger details below to update nationality and date of birth’ and ‘contact us on 0818 300 400 (ROI) or 08717 300 400 (GB) to change to another sailing’. So in fact it was not possible to change the booking online,” he said. With the online option apparently taken away from him, he did as he was told and contacted the company by phone. Or at least he tried to. “On three occasions since last Friday I have tried to speak on the phone to someone at Irish Ferries,” he wrote. “I also emailed them last Friday with, so far, no response. Today, on phoning them for the third time, I was informed by an automated voice after 35 minutes on hold, that Irish Ferries were unable to take my call at this time but that I could leave a message if I wished. This I tried to do, only to be informed that the mailbox was full and could take no more messages. So far I have wasted nearly an hour and spent over €12 phoning Irish Ferries.” We contacted Irish Ferries and received the following statement: “Irish Ferries are unable to comment on inidual customer details from a GDPR perspective, but can advise that if customers are trying to amend a booking online when the outward leg has been already travelled on, they will see an error message, and therefore need to make contact with us via one of our multiple contact channels – telephone, social media or email. “We would also acknowledge that we are currently dealing with unprecedented large volumes of customers contacts due to the current Covid-19 pandemic, which have further increased as we approach the peak summer season. Irish Ferries have added additional resource in the last week to help deal with this, and we thank our customers for their patience and understanding as we work hard to get to all enquiries.”Air CanadaCharlie Egan booked a return flight from Dublin to Vancouver which was due to leave on August 22nd and arrive back in Dublin on September 6th. He booked the flight last December and it was for a trip to celebrate his and his wife’s 40th wedding anniversary.“I have recently received notification that this route is now cancelledsuspended for 2020 and I have been rerouted via Toronto both directions ,which adds hours to our travel times both directions. I contacted Air Canada to seek a refund under EU261 rules as I do not wish to travel with this major change. We would have flown if our Government gave the okay since the Covid-19 issues.”He received a reply from Air Canada which more or less said that the airline does not come under rule EU261 and it has refused his request for a refund.He sent us the email the company sent in relation to EU261.“We realise you may disagree and view this approach as inconsistent with EU 261 regulations. However, as a Canadian carrier, we cannot be required to follow a legal regime that is in exact contradiction with its own national laws, following fundamental principles of international air law.”So, what is the law? Can an airline which flies into and out of an EU airport simply say EU regulations do not apply to it? Our understanding was no. The law seemed very clear to us. If a person books a flight with Air Canada that departs from a Canadian airport then Canadian regulations apply, but if a person books a flight with the airline that departs from an EU airport, then EU regulations apply.But just to be sure we got in touch with the European Consumer Centre which knows more about such things than we do. It said “it would appear the consumer was misinformed” and EU regulations do apply in this case. “If the matter is not resolved to the consumer’s satisfaction, they can consider making a complaint with the Commission for Aviation Regulation.” We also contacted Air Canada but received no response.Booking engineThen there was Grace O’Donoghue. “I’m sure you are inundated with queries since you began giving advice over the radio about travel plans during Covid-19, but I wonder if you could spare a minute to offer some advice, please?” her mail started. “Myself and my mother were due to fly to France on Thursday, 4th June for a family wedding. Flights were Aer Lingus but it was actually booked through a booking engine which we didn’t realise at the time. Saw it was Aer Lingus and automatically booked them but stupidly didn’t put the info together to see we booked through third party agent.”The flights were booked last October and then, on March 6th, Grace received an email from the booking engine which said that Aer Lingus had changed the flights and they would now be departing a day earlier and she needed to contact them immediately or risk losing the flights and the money. “I spent all day on March 6th trying to contact the booking engine by phone, to no avail. I then used their online contact form as it was not possible to find an email address anywhere for them. When I didn’t hear back I decided to contact Aer Lingus for advice on March 12th.” It was probably the worst of times to be contacting an airline. So Grace decided then to wait as she had been told to. “Then I received an email from them on May 26th stating that I needed to contact them due to the change in my flights. I could not get through and again used contact form to contact them. Since yesterday I have been trying to phone them to no avail. Using Aer Lingus website, they no longer recognise our booking reference. The booking engine website is at a standstill, not allowing me to query anything. They state our flights are leaving tomorrow and Aer Lingus and Dublin airport websites show no flights from Dublin to Bordeaux tomorrow or Thursday.”She wondered what more she could have done to get her money back. Aer Lingus said the flight to Bordeaux had been cancelled but stressed that only the third party booking engine could process the refund. Partially-cancelled flightsAnd still the mails came. “I got an email yesterday from Aer Lingus confirming that, as expected, my return flight from Miami later this month has been cancelled,” wrote Eddie O’Sullivan. “However, they’ve been silent so far on the status of outbound flight to Orlando on June 17th. As it stands, therefore, if I seek a refund on my home-bound flight I run the risk of being stuck in Florida with no flight home. Are Aer Lingus obliged to refund me for both flights even though only the later one has been officially cancelled?”In a statement Aer Lingus said the both our reader’s outbound and inbound flights have now been cancelled “and he will have received a notification from us to that effect. In this instance he is entitled to either a full refund, or if he would prefer he can avail of the voucher option on aerlingus.” And finally, we received an email from Yvonne Traynor who was confused about where she stood when it came to partially cancelled flights. “My mother was to fly return to Izmir in Turkey over a week ago, and this leg of the journey was cancelled. However, she would be due home on July 2nd and this part hasn’t been cancelled and it happens to be the more expensive part.”Yvonne herself is in a similar situation. “Myself, husband and three kids were to fly to Malaga on July 23rd. This was cancelled a fortnight ago. But the return flight nine days later still hasn’t been cancelled.”She said she would lose over €900 on the return flight if it is not cancelled. “What could you advise us to do in this situation? Clearly we won’t be travelling home from countries that we can’t travel to!” The European Commission clarified details of this at the end of March. In the case of two flights which are part of the same contract in the event of cancellation of the outbound flight, passengers should be offered two options, the ECC told us. “They should be either reimbursed for both flights or re-routed on another flight for the outbound flight. “In light of the above, the Regulation 261 applies to the flight to Izmir in Turkey and to Malaga in Spain, if the passenger was due to depart from an airport located in the territory of a member state of the EU and the flight in question was due to be operated by either an EU or non-EU air carrier. If both flights, outbound and return flights, are subject to a single booking and are part of the same contract, the passenger can seek reimbursement of the cost of the ticket.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4273003.1591545170!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"schools begin sending calculated leaving cert grades","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeaving Cert grades are due to be issued as close as possible to the traditional date in mid-August. Photograph: Bryan O’Brien  The  Secondary schools are due to begin sending calculated grades for more than 60,000 Leaving Cert students to the Department of Education from this week.An online portal is due to go live from midday on Monday which will allow schools to access students\u0027 subject levels and begin transmitting their grades.A special unit has been established within the department to process the data provided by each school and operate national standardisation to ensure fairness.The department will finalise grades for each student which are due to be issued as close as possible to the traditional date in mid-August.Most school principals contacted by The  report that the process has gone smoothly so far.Clive Byrne of the National Association of Principals and Deputies said the general consensus was that schools were engaging positively and professionally with the process.“We’re not getting any negative kick-back on it. No one is saying this is ideal, but there is a crisis and everyone is getting on with it,” he said.He said while there were anecdotal reports of schools being contacted or pressurised by parents over students’ grades, he was not aware that this had happened on any significant scale.Grind schoolsMr Byrne said, however, there was some worry about accessing reliable information to provide grades for students who are taking subjects outside school, such as a minority or non-curricular language.Under official rules in these circumstances, principals must obtain an expected grade from a student’s tutor outside the school, which is combined with the student’s in-school grades.If this is not possible, the department has pledged to examine these students’ grades on a case-by-case basis.Some principals have also privately complained that a few grind schools, in particular, have been providing higher than average grades for students for subjects they are taking outside school.Schools, meanwhile, are finalising the “school alignment” process where teachers work together to ensure there is a balance of accurate grades across students and classes.The next phase involves school principals signing off on the grades, which are then sent to the department.More than 60,000 Leaving Cert students have registered with a dedicated student portal to receive their grades.This is more than 98 per cent of the total of 61,029 who had been expected to sit the Leaving Cert exams in 2020.The department says it is continuing to engage with schools in an effort to establish why some students may not have registered on the portal.Independent monitoringMinister for Education Joe McHugh has said initial feedback from school management bodies and teacher unions on the operation of calculated grades has been positive, with teachers engaging in a professional manner with the process.He also announced details of an independent monitoring committee which will oversee the calculated grades process.It is chaired by Dr Áine Lawlor, former chief executive of the Teaching Council, and includes experts whose experience crosses education, governance, assessment and research.They include Dr Peter Archer, former chief executive officer of the Educational Research Centre Majella O’Shea, former deputy chief executive of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment Joe Hamill, former secretary general of the Department of Arts and chair of the New Schools Establishments Group Justin Edwards, chief executive of the Northern Ireland’s Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment and Prof Michael O’Leary, professor of assessment at DCU.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Faster cuts in methane and nitrous oxide from farming needed \u0026ndash Stop Climate ChaosOn-farm measures are key to reducing emissions -

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireSo, as of this morning, we are in phase two. But it’s not the phase two we expected. See, it’s phase two of four, not phase two of five. It’s phase two-plus. There hasn’t been five phases for days now. That was the old plan, the plan that was supposed to start on May 5th, but because we weren’t ready, started on May 18th. Now though, because we’re super-ready, we can speed it up. No, you can’t get your hair cut yet, and it’s a resounding “maybe, possibly, but probably not’’ on flying this summer. But pints might be on the horizon, so long as you’re having more than a packet of dry roasted.Confused yet? There’s been a lot of chopping and changing recently, so here is the definitive guide to what you can do this morning that you couldn’t do last night.Can I go more than 5km from home? Yes! Actually, depending on what county you live in, you can go much farther. Let’s say you live in Mitchelstown: you can happily drive to your holiday home in Allihies, almost 200km away. Most of us won’t have quite that level of freedom, but from today, travel within your county, or within 20km of your home if you’re leaving your county, is permitted.And what’s this talk of pints? Steady on. It looks like bars that can operate in a restaurant-like manner – table service and a food offering – might be able to open from June 29th. There’ll be more guidance for the sector, as well as hotels and restaurants, in the coming days. There has been a lot of discussion of it, but nothing has changed this morning. So hold your horses on the pints for now.So what can I do? A lot more retail will begin to open up this week, with some shops permitted to open from today. Initially this will be restricted to shops with street entrances, but from June 15th, shopping centres will be open. It will be a different experience – expect queues, strict social distancing, no changing rooms, no beauty concessions, and food and drink offerings to be curtailed. Not all shops will open at once, either. Expect staggered opening hours, and allocated times for elderly and vulnerable customers. Plan ahead before you shop.What about seeing my friends and family? For most of us, this is the question, after months isolated from loved ones. From today, up to six people from different households can gather, inside or outside, so long as strict social distancing can be observed. Organised outdoor exercise, sporting, cultural or social activities of up to 15 people are also permitted. The rules around funerals have been slightly relaxed, with up to 25 immediate family members and close friends permitted at funeral services.What about moving around, and should I be wearing a mask? Public transport is still curtailed – buses and the Dart will run a pre-Covid “Monday to Friday” schedule but, to facilitate social distancing, capacity will be restricted. Really the intention is to facilitate workers, not the public in general. Walking and cycling is advised for getting around. If you are on public transport, or out shopping, the advice is to wear a face mask.I’m over 70, am I still a cocooner? The advice for the over-70s or medically vulnerable is still to be “extra vigilant”, to stay home as much as possible, and to use specially allocated times when shopping. You may have small numbers of people in your home, if social distancing can be observed.Please tell me there’s something there for the kids Thankfully, yes. But it’s a trickle, not a flood. Outdoor summer camps are now permitted, so long as they entail no more than 15 people mixing together. Playgrounds can reopen, so long as they’re supervised. There’s some confusion over exactly what that means, however, with Dublin City Council last week saying it would not be reopening pending clarification on “supervision”. Watch this space.What about the 2m rule? Stay 2m apart where possible there’s been a lot of debate about this, and in time it may change, but for now it stays in place.And should I be heading back to the office? While some rules on work have been relaxed, such as for solitary workers, the general advice is still to work from home where possible.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4273558.1591622245!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"traffic volumes up as latest covid 19 restrictions are lifted","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFile photo: Traffic volumes are nowhere near what they normally would be suggesting that a lot of people have not returned to their offices and are obeying the rule that they must stay within 20km of home.

Traffic volumes were up by 24 per cent on that stretch of road.However, traffic volumes are nowhere near what they normally would be suggesting that a lot of people have not returned to their offices and are obeying the rule that they must stay within 20km of home.Traffic volumes in comparison with June 8th in 2019 were down between 36 per cent on the M4 to 55 per cent on the M1 near the Border.Transport Infrastructure Ireland concluded: “As a general conclusion, this morning’s increase in car traffic across the sample traffic counters appears to be higher than the growth levels experienced last week.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4273070.1591558427!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus government departments running out of money","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said he expected that the Department of the Taoiseach would reach its limit in September. Photograph: The A number of Government departments are due to run out of money in the coming weeks because of significant financial demands in light of the Covid-19 pandemic.The Department of Business is due to reach its spending limit next month following increased spending on additional coronavirus measures. The Department of Health will exceed its budget in August and the Department of Taoiseach is also likely to reach its spending limit in the summer.The Government will again seek to have the Dáil rush through authorisation for potentially billions of euro in additional funding for these departments after a similar vote was needed last month for the Department of Social Protection.Extra funding of €6.8 billion was needed for the department in order to continue funding welfare payments.In correspondence to Fianna Fáil TD Michael McGrath, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said that in relation to the Department of Business “based on current projections in relation to the drawdown of these additional resources there is a risk that this limit will be reached early in July”.Additional costsHe added it would be expected that the Department of the Taoiseach would reach its limit in September but his department has been advised that there “are additional costs arising from the role of that department in co-ordinating work on the Covid-19 crisis, that may accelerate the date . . .”The State laboratory will also exceed its budget of €7.8 million in September, as will the secret service.Spending in the Department of Health was more than €8 billion by May and is expected to reach €13.6 billion by August.It comes as a new analysis from the Dáil’s parliamentary budgetary office has found that overall Government spending is €4.27 billion above pre-pandemic expectations so far this year.The analysis pointed out that “exchequer spending on the public health and social protection aspects of this crisis, and falling tax revenues, has led to an exchequer deficit at the end of May of €6.1 billion, almost 100 times the size of the deficit at the same stage in 2019. The full extent and cost of State-funded interventions relating to the pandemic are not yet clear.”ScrutinyThe report also found that the overspends in the Department of Health “are almost entirely related to the response to the pandemic and are concentrated in the HSE current spending allocation”.It also criticised a “regrettable” availability of data in relation to spending in the department.“At a time when Health is a priority for the delivery of public services and additional spending is being proposed, the lack of data to facilitate scrutiny of that spending is regrettable.”In terms of the extra funding approved for the Department of Social Protection, the report said while the department now has “sufficient funding for the immediate future”, a “supplementary estimate will probably be required in the autumn”.About €2.2 billion has been set aside to fund the Government’s weekly pandemic payment.“Additional spending on public services promotes public wellbeing but only when that money is spent efficiently and effectively. It is of paramount importance then that the outputs produced by the money spent on public services are measured appropriately and presented in a transparent manner.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4273407.1591607013!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government formation talks leaders see progress on sticking points","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil\u0027s Micheál Martin, Green Party\u0027s Eamon Ryan and Fine Gael\u0027s Leo VaradkarParty leaders have sought to keep the Government-formation process on track following a weekend of disagreements and a Green Party leadership challenge which destabilised the negotiations.The leaders of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party met for four hours yesterday in an attempt to resolve major outstanding issues which included disagreements around how and when to reduce the country’s deficit and an impasse over the planned increase in the pension age.Sources last night said that there was “movement” on the pension issue with Fianna Fáil figures\u0026nbspsaying there was “optimism”\u0026nbsparound\u0026nbsptheir demand to keep the pension age at 66.It is understood\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspFine Gael are\u0026nbspalso\u0026nbspinsisting on guarantees that income tax and USC will not go up and will also demand a “July jobs” initiative to stimulate job creation and help out sectors like tourism and retail. Well-placed sources said the talks were successful and leaders now believe they can see the “landing zone” on almost all of the major sticking points. In a statement after the meeting, the parties said they “had a constructive meeting and made progress with many outstanding issues. “All parties will continue the talks tomorrow.”The three parties reached broad agreement over the weekend in areas such as communications, energy, social protection, health and retrofitting. They are also near agreement on the issues of transport and infrastructure, with sources in the Green Party admitting that roads projects which are already in process are likely to proceed, leaving less money for cycling and walking budgets.Among the sticking points which arose was the issue of the abortion legislation which is due to come up for review in the lifetime of the next government.It is understood that the Green Party pushed for the three-day waiting period to access medication to be removed and negotiators also sought the imposition of exclusion zones outside abortion care centres.\u0026nbspRaised concernsSources say this was resisted by Fianna Fáil, who are understood to have raised concerns that they could encounter difficulties with their membership if this was included in the text of the programme for government. A source in Fianna Fáil said the party wanted to respect the result of the referendum in terms of the three-day wait and said inidual members of the party have no objection to exclusion zones that would prohibit protests outside facilities.Some of the policies agreed in principle over the weekend include: a commitment to protect the core welfare rates a retrofitting scheme that homeowners could pay back through their utilities a promise to establish a media commission which is “platform agnostic” to ensure the future viability of the industry.A Fine Gael source said Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has made clear that while Ireland can borrow cheaply at the moment, this will not always be the case and the country needs to ensure that the deficit is reduced.A Green Party source said the current demand from the other two parties is for a yearly reduction in the deficit which would begin immediately. “That to us is basically austerity,” a party figure said.Green Party demands to reduce the level of greenhouse gas emissions by 7 per cent per annum were also described as a “particularly sticky” issue.The negotiating process was also complicated by the decision of Catherine Martin to run for the Green Party leadership against Eamon Ryan.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Holidaymaker said he stumbled into abandoned well after being chased by wild dogMan (60) dies some 500 miles north of Sydney after board-riders pull him to shoreLarge crowd gathers shortly after legislature outlaws insults to China\u0026rsquos national anthemTrump administration has presented China with \u0026lsquoopportunities\u0026rsquo on the world stageStorm made landfall further south than expected giving some respite to metropolis ravaged by coronavirusDeath at Wuhan\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquowhistleblower hospital\u0026rsquo prompts wave of anger at hospital authoritiesSchools in deprived areas reported girls using newspapers and rags in attempt to manage periodAnnual vigil to mark Tiananmen Square massacre cancelled but activists still plan to rallyOfficials and media say US criticism of Hong Kong policing illustrates double standardsExperts fear country\u0026rsquos caseload could reach 1m in several weeks if virus is not curbedBejing approved decision to create laws for Hong Kong to curb sedition, secession, terrorismMove paves way for anti-sedition laws which rights advocates say will threaten city\u0026rsquos freedomsAt least 69 cases this week linked to cluster of infections at logistics facilityThousands take to streets to oppose Beijing-backed laws curtailing city\u0026rsquos freedomsMove to impose security law illustrates Beijing\u0026rsquos increasing tendency to flex its muscleProtesters get ready for more demonstrations against proposed Beijing lawsCommissioner in territory says contentious new security law aimed at \u0026lsquotroublemakers\u0026rsquoPM has made most of her communication skills and the country\u0026rsquos political cultureCian English (19), from Carlow, died following fall from Gold Coast apartmentChina proposes path to imposing rules used against dissidents on the mainlandStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4273359.1591614001!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus new zealand to lift most restrictions as virus eliminated pm says","story":"New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Arden has said the country has eliminated transmission of coronavirus and will lift all containment measures except for border control.

So can I finish with a very simple ‘Thank you, New Zealand.’”The South Pacific nation of about 5 million people is emerging from the pandemic while big economies such as Brazil, Britain, India and the United States grapple with the spreading virus.There were no active cases for the first time since the virus arrived in New Zealand in late February, the health ministry said. New Zealand has reported 1,154 infections and 22 deaths from the disease.“Having no active cases for the first time since February 28th is certainly a significant mark in our journey, but as we’ve previously said, ongoing vigilance against Covid-19 will continue to be essential,” Dr Ashley Bloomfield, the director-general of health, said in the statement.New Zealand has vowed to eliminate, not just contain, the virus, but the health ministry has been cautious about declaring victory.It said elimination did not mean eradicating the virus permanently, but stopping “chains of transmission” for a period after the last infected person left isolation.It also required New Zealand to “effectively prevent or contain any future imported cases from overseas”, it added in an emailed statement.Brazil Anti-government demonstrations broke out in several Brazilian cities on Sunday as president Jair Bolsonaro suffers a growing backlash against his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Protesters carrying signs in defence of democracy and against racism gathered in Brazil’s largest cities despite medical recommendations of social distancing, many encouraged by US demonstrations that followed the death of George Floyd. Pro-Bolsonaro marches also took place in some cities, in smaller numbers. As the number of deaths from Covid-19 soars and Brazil becomes a global hot spot for the virus, the government faced increased criticism over the weekend when it decided to limit the amount of data published about the pandemic. In response, health secretaries from all Brazilian states began compiling and releasing their own numbers for total cases and deaths from Covid-19. Brazil registered 37,312 total coronavirus deaths while overall cases in the country reached 685,427, according to data from the health ministry on Sunday. It now has the third highest number of deaths in the world after the US and UKUKTravellers arriving in the UK will now be required to self-isolate for 14 days under government measures to guard against a second wave of coronavirus. All passengers — bar a handful of exemptions — will have to fill out an online locator form giving their contact and travel details, as well as the address of where they will isolate. People who fail to comply could be fined £1,000 in England, and police will be allowed to use “reasonable force” to make sure they follow the rules. Border Force officers will carry out checks on arrivals and may refuse entry to a non-resident foreign national who refuses to comply with the regulations. Failure to complete the locator form will be punishable by a £100 fixed penalty notice.Travellers arriving from within the Common Travel Area (CTA) — which includes Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands — will not need to self-isolate unless they have arrived in the CTA in the last 14 days.Britain’s coronavirus lockdown has led to dozens of people dying at home alone and not being discovered for up to two weeks, it has been reported. Doctors believe several dozen such cases occurred in London between March and May, with bodies lying undetected for so long they had started to decompose, according to . Exactly how many people have died at home alone is not known, but all such cases are referred to local coroners upon discoveryGreece Bars, nightclubs and internet cafes have been allowed to reopen in Greece, where an early lockdown is credited with keeping the number of coronavirus deaths and serious illnesses at low levels. Nearly all lockdown measures have now been lifted in a phased reopening, with regulations in place for businesses to maintain limits on the number of customers allowed and distances to be maintained. Most bars, nightclubs and restaurants operate outdoors in Greece during the summer months, which has helped authorities in allowing them to reopen. However, government and health authorities warned that local lockdowns could be imposed if violations in social distancing regulations lead to outbreaks. Italy The Italian government’s point person on combating the Covid-19 pandemic says so far not enough Italians have downloaded an app to help health authorities trace contacts with people testing positive for the virus. Domenico Arcuri said in an interview on Sunday with Italian state TV that two million people in Italy have downloaded Immuni, the app that uses Bluetooth technology to signal when someone comes in close contact with an infected person. That number is “still too few”, Mr Arcuri said. He was referring to experts advising that at least 60 per cent of Italy’s 60 million people would have to use the app for contact tracing to be effective. As Italy gradually emerges from lockdown, allowing travel to resume throughout the country for whatever reason, the health minister and scientific experts who advise him have urged citizens to use Immuni.Germany Germany recorded a decline in the number of new coronavirus cases, while the infection rate rose above the key threshold of 1.0 for the first time in six days. There were 300 new cases in the 24 hours through Monday morning, bringing the total to 185,750, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. That compares with 526 the previous day and almost 7,000 at the peak of the pandemic in late March. Fatalities increased by 12 to 8,685. The daily death toll has remained well below 100 since mid-May. The reproduction factor of the virus, known as R-naught, rose to 1.05 on Sunday from 0.87 the day before, according to the latest estimate from the Robert Koch Institute. That means 10 infected people are estimated to infect an average of around one other person.Denmark Denmark continued to roll back its restrictions on Monday, after dramatically reducing its Covid-19 infection rate. Danes can once again visit gyms, public pools and amusement parks. And a ban on groups of no more than 10 was lifted, with the new limit set at 50.SwedenSweden’s prime minister was forced to defend his Covid-19 strategy after opposition parties mounted a scathing attack amid signs the government’s handling of the pandemic was badly flawed. With more than 4,500 deaths, and Sweden’s chief epidemiologist – who advised keeping most of society open – admitting mistakes, prime minister Stefan Lofven became the target during a broadcast debate of party leaders Sunday night. Ulf Kristersson, leader of the main opposition party, said “there have been obvious, fundamental failures.” Mr Lofven said there’s no reason to abandon the approach but acknowledged room for improvement. “We have far too many fatalities in elderly care.” He also said the government “should have tested more people.” Swedes now face travel restrictions in the European Union due to the country’s high infection rate.India India is reopening its restaurants, shopping centres and religious places in most states even as the number of coronavirus cases and deaths in the country grows. The health ministry reported another 9,983 cases on Monday, raising India’s count past 256,000 to become the fifth most in the world. The 206 fatalities reported on Monday were the highest single-day rise and takes the country’s death toll to 7,135. New Delhi is also reopening its state borders, allowing the interstate movement of people and goods. India has already partially restored train services and domestic flights and allowed shops and manufacturing to reopen. Schools remain closed. The number of new cases has soared since the government began relaxing restrictions. There has also been a surge in infections in India’s vast countryside following the return of hundreds of thousands of migrant workers who left cities and towns after losing their jobs. Indonesia Retail stores, restaurants and offices reopened in Indonesia’s capital after more than two-months as authorities eased social restriction rules to jump-start an economy hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. The number of visitors to dine-in restaurants and retail stores is limited to 50 per cent of their capacities under a new health protocol unveiled by Jakarta’s administration last week, which also saw public transport services being restored to the pre-pandemic period albeit with reduced capacity. Jakarta, the epicenter of the nation’s virus outbreak, switched to a month-long transition phase from a partial lockdown last week by allowing places of worship to reopen. The city of almost 11 million people has seen the rate of infections fall below the threshold seen as safe to resume limited activities, according to Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan. South Korea South Korea reported 38 more coronavirus cases in 24 hours, bringing the total tally to 11,814, data from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show. About 800 people are being tested for possible infection from a student who visited the Lotte World theme park, though there have been no confirmed cases yet. Infections related to a logistics center rose to 138, while the number of confirmed cases from Seoul metropolitan region churches rose by four to 86.Pakistan The number of new coronavirus infections in Pakistan has continued to spiral upwards, as the nation of 220 million people surpassed 100,000 cases, with more than 2,000 deaths. The daily infection rate spiked after the Islamic holy month of Ramadan ended and markets were thrown open during the Eid-al Fitr holiday at the end of May. That followed the government refusing to close mosques and deciding to open up the country even as medical professionals pleaded for a stricter lockdown. Since then the daily infection rates have held fairly steady with just under 5,000 new cases each day. Testing has held steady in recent days at about 22,000 each day, with government officials saying Pakistan aimed to eventually carry out 30,000 tests every day. Prime minister Imran Khan has gone on national television to tell people the country’s poorest cannot survive a strict lockdown. –PA, Reuters, BloombergEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4272018.1591378999!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"barnier insists pragmatic workarounds are possible for trade in the north","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichel Barnier holds the Official Journal of the European Union C34 during a press conference on Friday in Brussels regarding the fourth round of Brexit negotiations. Photograph:  Daina Le Lardic PoolGetty ImagesBusinesses in Northern Ireland should be able to use workarounds and exemptions to make checks on goods on the Irish Sea border less onerous, chief European Union negotiator Michel Barnier has said.He was responding to an opinion column in The  in which contributor Newton Emerson expressed concerns that the EU was cynically taking a “maximalist” position on checks in order to use the North as a “bargaining chip”.Mr Barnier emphasised that the special arrangements for the North – under which it will apply EU customs rules so that checks take place in ports and airports there rather than on the land border with the Republic – had been jointly drawn up and agreed with the British government, and that there was room for pragmatism within them.“Regarding Mr Emerson’s concerns ... I would say that we can take into account those concerns within the framework as it’s currently written, because it’s written in a very precise way,” Mr Barnier told reporters after the latest round of EU-UK talks concluded.Imported“Simplified declarations can be used for large economic operators, supermarkets being one of them,” he said.For goods that are imported into the North from Britain or elsewhere outside the EU, exemptions on tariffs are possible if it can be proved that the produce will not enter the single market.“This is something we are discussing with the United Kingdom as we speak,” Mr Barnier said. “We’re ready to work with the UK further on all aspects of what the EU customs code can offer in order to facilitate trade and do everything we can do that end. But for that we need genuine commitment also from the UK side also on a number of technical issues which I have to say isn’t always forthcoming.”Special arrangementsA joint EU-UK committee is currently overseeing the implementation of the special arrangements for the North agreed as part of Britain’s withdrawal from the EU.\u0026nbspOfficials have said that plans for additional infrastructure to enforce checks need to be agreed swiftly in order to be ready for when the new arrangements come into force at the end of the year.Mr Barnier insisted he was keen to find a compromise. “I’m not dogmatic. Sometimes there is a bit of spin amongst UK politicians saying I’m some kind of dogmatic person and representing a technocratic commission, but I’m a pragmatic man,” he said.“I’m sure if we don’t get bogged down in ideological debate with pragmatism we can pull this off.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"British-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonWHO forecasts coronavirus will kill 42,000 and infect most of 28 million populationRival Gantz to take over as prime minister of Israeli unity government after 18 monthsAshraf Ghani to lead country as rival Abdullah Abdullah oversees Taliban peace process, sources sayCeremony will end political deadlock that has dragged on for more than 500 daysArab and foreign jihadis ambush military convoys and assassinate officials as Baghdad and Damascus try to contain coronavirusThree men captured west of Caracas are the latest \u0026lsquoterrorists\u0026rsquo arrestedAt least 24 killed by suicide bomber in separate attack in Afghanistan on TuesdayStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4271818.1591367972!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit uk says sides need face to face talks to make progress","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t British Brexit negotiator David Frost: “Any such deal must of course accommodate the reality of the UK’s well-established position on the so-called ‘level playing field’, on fisheries, and the other difficult issues.” Photograph:  Kenzo TribouillardAFP via Getty ImagesBritain’s chief negotiator David Frost described progress in the Brexit talks as “limited”, adding that the two sides were close to the limits of what could be achieved without face-to-face talks.Speaking after the latest round of talks ended on Friday, he said the talks must intensify and accelerate but appeared to abandon Britain’s threat to leave the talks if the shape of a deal was not in sight by the end of June.“We need to conclude this negotiation in good time to enable people and businesses to have certainty about the trading terms that will follow the end of the transition period at the end of this year, and, if necessary, to allow ratification of any agreements reached,” he said.“For our part we are willing to work hard to see whether at least the outline of a balanced agreement, covering all issues, can be reached soon. Any such deal must of course accommodate the reality of the UK’s well-established position on the so-called ‘level playing field’, on fisheries, and the other difficult issues.”In its negotiating mandate last February, the British government said that if not enough progress was made in the talks by June it would “need to decide whether the UK’s attention should move away from negotiations and focus solely on continuing domestic preparations to exit the transition period in an orderly fashion”.A senior British negotiating official said on Friday that coronavirus had delayed progress and it was time for talks to move to a different format with a smaller group of negotiators.

The country is still seeing fewer than 300 new cases on average each day.A similar scenario is playing out in Sweden, where citizens have been able to retain many of their freedoms during the pandemic.New cases and deaths are on the rise, by between nine and 12 per cent over the last week, but numbers remain relatively low, with fewer than 600 daily cases and 50 deaths.In the UK, newly reported cases and deaths continue to fall but at a much slower pace than countries which saw outbreaks at a similar scale. In Italy, new cases and deaths are falling at an average rate of between 23 and 28 per cent over the last week, and in Belgium, between 15 and 23 per cent.In the UK, deaths have begun to plateau, partly due to revisions in historic data over recent days.On June 1 445 deaths were added to the historic data after being identified through testing carried out by commercial partners.But the rate of infection is also falling at a much slower rate - an average of nine per cent over the past week.The implications of the slow recovery in the UK are most concerning as he country is still seeing higher numbers of infections and deaths than many of its European neighbours.More than 1,800 new cases are still being detected each day, eclipsing those in Italy (395), Belgium (156) and Germany (435).And with more than 300 new deaths reported each day on average, the death rate in the UK is four times higher than in Italy (75).On Friday, new analysis from Public Health England and Cambridge University revealed the R rate - the rate at which the virus multiplies within a population - had crept back up to 1 in the North West and South West of England.Dr Yvonne Doyle, PHE medical director, said: Our estimates show that the regional R numbers have increased although they remain below one for most of England - this is to be expected as we gradually move out of lockdown.It is vital that everyone continues with social distancing, practising good hand hygiene and must remain at home and order a test if they have symptoms.Due to changes in the way data has been reported in Spain and France over recent weeks, they have been omitted from this analysis as they are unreliable for comparisons.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown restrictions not simple lives versus livelihoods","story":"On March 25, just a day after Britain shut down, economist Professor Philip Thomas, of Bristol University, made a grim prediction.If the country remained in lockdown for longer than two months, he warned, any lives saved would be wiped out by those lost from the impact of the inevitable recession.Britain hit that timeline more than a fortnight ago, but restrictions largely remain in place and there is growing alarm among economists that the cure has become far deadlier than the disease.Prof Thomas now estimates that 150,000 people could die from Covid-19 over five years under the intermittent lockdown conditions necessary to keep infection rates, or the reproduction \u0027R\u0027 number, below one if a vaccine is not found.But he predicts that 675,000 could die from the collateral damage – far more than the 577,000 deaths predicted by Imperial College London if coronavirus had been allowed to run through the population unchecked. More, in fact, than all British lives lost in the Second World War. A nation\u0027s economy and its health are so strongly linked that at some point they become inseparable, Prof Thomas said when he released the new figures last month. Poverty kills just as surely as coronavirus.Scientists are so worried about the catastrophic costs of lockdown that the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) has commissioned research to determine whether the impact of recession will be far more damaging to the nation\u0027s health than the pandemic itself.Arguably, such research should have been carried out months ago.The Government has been widely criticised for failing to bring in economists early on. When the country went into lockdown, there had been no modelling of the long-term health and social effects of shutting down an entire economy. Speaking at the Science and Technology Select Committee on Friday, the eminent economist James Poterba, professor of economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), said: There was too little interaction between the epidemiologists and the economics community.This is a situation where economics is absolutely essential to inform policy design. The social scientist can spot things that might not be on the radar for the folks that have been trained as medical doctors.Carol Propper, professor of economics at Imperial College London, recently published a paper suggesting that an forthcoming recession will lead to a significant rise in chronic illness.During the most intense part of the 2008 UK financial crisis, there was around a five per cent drop in employment. A similar drop in the coming year would see chronic conditions in working-age people rise by between seven and 10 per cent.That translates to around 900,000 more people with conditions such as asthma, depression and heart problems, the Imperial paper predicts.  Speaking at the select committee Prof Propper, also the president of the Royal Economic Society, said children would be particularly hard hit.This is a complex problem in which we have a health shock which has led to an economic shock, she said. Our research indicates that a one per cent fall in employment equates to a two per cent increase in prevalence of chronic disease.“Several recessions in the past affected the young, particularly young children. Those recessions cost a long shadow over their lives, and children born in recessions can live a considerably shorter length of life than children not born in those periods.So far, our understanding of how recessions affect health has been based on the 2008 financial crash. But the economic fallout from coronavirus is likely to be far worse.During the financial crisis, GDP in the UK contracted by 6.4 per cent per capita over two years.  But in March alone, Britain experienced a fall of 5.8 per cent, while the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) has forecast an unprecedented drop of 35 per cent. It means the health costs from the pandemic could be five times worse than the costs in 2008. Even the less gloomy predictions, such as those by the Centre for Economics and Business Research, suggest coronavirus will cause global GDP to decline twice as much as the last financial crisis, and could tip the world into a 1930s-style recession. Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, is said to have signed off on plans to reopen the economy after being warned by Alok Sharma, the Business Secretary, that a failure to get the hospitality sector moving could cost 3.5 million jobs. The OBR has forecast unemployment rising by more than two million to 10 per cent in the second quarter of 2020 alone.Experts are predicting particularly large rises in depression and anxiety, and recessions tend to lead to an increase in suicides. Between 2008 and 2010, there were 846 more male suicides and 155 more female suicides in England and Wales than would have been expected before 2008. Ireland reported an extra 476 deaths. Cancer Research UK has warned that the crisis could mean an extra 18,000 deaths from cancer this year alone as urgent referrals across England dropped by 62 per cent, while chemotherapy treatments have been running at just 70 per cent of normal levels.   Since the beginning of March there have been nearly 13,000 unexplained excess deaths, which are likely to be from people not being able to access healthcare, or dementia patients losing routine and access to loved ones.A lengthy and devastating recession is also likely to bring austerity, which will stop Britain from devoting as many resources to health services, leading to an overall decline in life expectancy. Following the financial crash of 2008, the increase in life expectancy in Britain stalled for the first time in 30 years. Some scientists even estimate it may have knocked an average of seven weeks off life. The price of staying in lockdown is simply becoming too great.As Prof Thomas concluded recently: A global economic crash could be a much more significant threat to human life. At some point we will have to endanger lives in the present to save those in the future.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"post brexit fishing rights progress blocked eu member states","story":"Michel Barnier was forced by EU fishing nations to block any hope of progress in talks over post-Brexit fishing rights last week, senior UK negotiating sources claimed on Sunday. The EU’s chief negotiator had suggested a new process in a bid to break the deadlock over how to calculate fishing rights. But he was forced to abandon the move after EU fishing countries such as France, Belgium, Ireland, Denmark and the Netherlands rejected his bid for compromise and told him to hold firm to his red lines.The week’s negotiations ended with no significant progress on fishing, which is one of the major obstacles to agreeing a free trade deal with Brussels before the end of the transition period at the end of the year.“Until they give us some more there’s no way of deriving hard information about the numbers. That appears to be the difficulty. If they could do it we would happily talk to them.”Britain wants a Norway-style fishing agreement, separate from the free trade deal and with annual negotiations. Rather than catch shares being determined by the historic catch patterns of the Common Fisheries Policy, the UK wants to use zonal attachment, a system it argues more accurately pinpoints where the fish are.More fish are now in UK waters because of climate change. “Zonal attachment is the fundamental,” the source said before predicting the British quota would be “quite a lot larger” in the future. Mr Barnier’s negotiating mandate calls for the status quo to be maintained and for EU boats to have access to UK waters on exactly the same terms as before Brexit. The historic catch patterns of the Common Fisheries Policy disadvantages British fishermen. The EU position is to “uphold existing reciprocal access conditions, quota shares and traditional activity of the Union fleet”. It is thought that Mr Barnier\u0027s suggestion to find some middle ground would have been to include other factors in how rights are calculated, such as the economic impact on coastal communities and historic links between Britain and other European countries. EU fishing ministers told Mr Barnier the week before the last round of negotiations his mandate had not changed. On Friday, Mr Barnier admitted the EU would have to shift from its red lines but insisted annual negotiations were unacceptable to Brussels. He said a “balanced” fisheries deal was a precondition for any trade deal. Despite blocking a potential route of progress in the talks, he criticised the UK for missing a July deadline to strike an agreement over fisheries.“On fisheries we have very strong positions on both sides,” Mr Barnier said, “The EU wants the status quo. The UK wants to change everything.”“If we want an agreement we will have to discuss somewhere between the two positions.”“Obviously they need to move off from where they started and it is just a question of when that happens,” the senior UK source said.British and EU negotiators expect to hold smaller, more intensive and, if possible, face to face meetings in July to try and break the impasse. Boris Johnson will meet with the presidents of the three major EU institutions and try to break the deadlock at political level in June.The last three rounds of negotiations have been held online because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has made it harder to build the trust to get deals done.

Should protesting still be allowed during a pandemic? What did you think about the decision to topple a historic statue that has stood in Bristol city centre since 1895? Read on to see what your fellow readers have had to say and then share your own opinions in the comments section below.I profoundly dislike the rewriting of history through a twenty first century lens, and I find mob rule utterly abhorrent. But I have no issue with statues and other monuments being removed after due process, if that is what the public want.The Government is massively out of touch with good sense. The Black Lives Movement is well overdue and historical figures who promulgated slavery must be diminished in the public sphere.The problem with the Colston statue is that the democratic process had worked - a decision had been taken to amend the statue with a plaque detailing the horrendous trade that had enriched Colston.This was then frustrated - for more than five years - by a small minority of councillors who vetoed any agreement on wording.If the democratic process is not respected, this is exactly the sort of act you can expect.It seems clear to me that all the people protesting over the weekend demonstrated that, through their actions, they believe that \u0027no lives matter\u0027. We still have a virus circulating the UK that is harming and killing thousands of people yet they are happy to risk many more deaths by disregarding the primary means of spreading the virus.These people wish to wipe out history. History has taught us time and again to beware of them - they are the type that want to wipe out anyone who doesn\u0027t agree with them. Britain is great because it has a place for history warts and all!Every single one of these thugs must be identified and arrested.A stiff prison sentence is required here, this country used to be a democracy and it\u0027s time the police stopped trying to be \u0027the protestors friends\u0027 and did their job.Stop \u0027taking a knee\u0027 and instead take a statement.Ms Patel, you are drinking in the last chance saloon, restore law and order!The Colston statue should be reinstated. The reason is simply that nobody has the right to erase history or rewrite it. The majority white population does not \u0027celebrate\u0027 slavery by having a statue of a slave trade in the town square, it merely recognizes that the past is as it was and should not be forgotten.The very fact that a generation of moral tyrants is trying to destroy liberty ought to be a reminder of the dangers of forgetting the lessons of the past, not a pretext for carrying out cultural vandalism.I think we\u0027d all agree that the police action that led to the death of George Floyd was wrong.But two wrongs never make a right and the Black Lives Matter movement doesn\u0027t do the black community any favours when the response isn\u0027t a night of knee jerk anger, but a concerted orgy of law breaking over many days.The same people were on YouTube on December 13 last screaming not my Prime Minister.These \u0027protests\u0027 are no longer about BLM but have been hijacked by the left wing mob of anarchists, capitalist hating yobs who have no agenda other than disruption and the toppling of a democratically elected government.There are enough clear images of the yobs who tore the statue down - bet you none of them are prosecuted.I could cry. We are the laughing stock of the world.How can we, only one month after celebrating VE Day and the sacrifices of that generation, allow this behaviour to take place on our streets ? Our police have been injured, memorials defaced. They even tried to set fire to our Union flag. What next ?Boris, tweeting your condemnation is far from good enough.

We have chosen to abide by both the letter and the spirit of these rules, which is why we have made no comment about anything related to the DOJ during the course of this year. We believe in playing straight bat.”The Duke of York has previously insisted that he is willing to cooperate with American officials investigating Epstein, who died in August while awaiting trial for sex trafficking.But reports claim that the Prince could be forced to speak to US prosecutors.The Sun reports that the department of justice last month sent a mutual legal assistance (MLA) request directly to the Home Office, bypassing Buckingham Palace.A department of justice spokesman told The : “As a matter of policy, the U.S. Department of Justice does not publicly comment on communications with foreign governments on investigative matters, including confirming or denying the very existence of such communications.”It is understood that the Duke\u0027s team now plan to set out their full interactions with the DOJ, which sources say will contradict claims he has refused to engage appropriately. A source said: “Legal discussions with the DOJ are subject to strict confidentiality rules, as set out in their own guidelines. We have chosen to abide by both the letter and the spirit of these rules, which is why we have made no comment about anything related to the DOJ during the course of this year. We believe in playing straight bat.”The MLA could potentially see prosecutors sitting down in London with the Duke of York, 60, and compelling him to assist their investigation.The paper reported that no decision on the request has yet been made by British officials.Sources told The Sun that it was unlikely the Duke would be aware of the MLA request at this stage because countries are legally obliged to keep them secret.A source said: “It’s a huge statement of intent from the US and it moves Andrew into the realms of a criminal investigation.“It’s also frankly a diplomatic nightmare.“The DoJ does not make a request of this nature lightly, especially one involving a senior member of the British royal family.“It puts the UK government in a very difficult position - and the Duke of York even even more so.”The US could seek his voluntary cooperation, without him being under oath. The Sun reported that the US authorities were not pursuing this option, because they were frustrated with his unwillingness to assist.Instead, the paper said it is thought the Duke would likely be asked to attend the City of Westminster Magistrates’ Court to provide oral or written evidence on oath.If he refused to speak to the prosecutors, the Duke could be forced to attend in person by summons, with lawyers from the justice department able to quiz him.The Duke, unlike the Queen, does not hold sovereign immunity from prosecution.Any evidence session could be held “in camera” - privately, with no press or public present.Prince Andrew has vehemently denied all allegations of sexual abuse, and insists that he never met Virginia Roberts, who accused him.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/08/12/artificial-intelligence-sleep-ai.jpg","title":"artificial intelligence human sleep ai los alamos neural network","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Researchers at Los Alamos discover neural network reaps benefits \u0027equivalent to\u0026nbspa good night\u0027s rest\u0027Artificial intelligence designed to function like a human could require periods of rest similar to those needed by biological brains.Researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory in the US discovered that neural networks experienced benefits that were the equivalent of a good night\u0027s rest when exposed to an artificial analogue of sleep.We were fascinated by the prospect of training a neuromorphic processor in a manner analogous to how humans and other biological systems learn from their environment during childhood development, said Yijing Watkins, a computer scientist at Los Alamos.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe discovery was made by the team of researchers while working on a form of artificial intelligence designed to mimic how humans learn to see.The AI became unstable during long periods of unsupervised learning, as it attempted to classify objects using their dictionary definitions without having any prior examples to compare them to.Smart toilet uses AI camera to detect ‘anal print’When exposed to a state that is similar to what a human brain experiences during sleep, the neural network\u0027s stability was restored.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

The latest study, which involved 2,254 British adults, also revealed that around six in 10 people experienced worse sleep since lockdown began on 23 March.Charting Sweden’s no lockdown strategy“Nearly two-thirds of the UK public report some negative impact on their sleep from the Covid-19 crisis, clearly showing just how unsettling the pandemic and lockdown measures have been for a very large proportion of us,” said Professor Bobby Duffy, director of the Policy Institute at King’s College London.“And this is clearly tied to both how stressful we’ve found the virus itself, and how much we fear the impact of the lockdown on our employment and finances.”Data gathered in April by wearable technology firm Withings showed that people in the UK had been sleeping for 15 minutes longer on average each day during the lockdown.France saw the biggest increase in daily sleep times, with the average person sleeping for an extra 20 minutes each night.These findings can be partly explained by people not having to commute to work due to either working from home or not working at all during lockdown.Similar data from fitness tracking firm Polar revealed that people in Germany are also sleeping for longer.A significant increase in sleep time was recorded by Polar’s sleep-tracking devices as lockdown measures were introduced in Germany on 22 March.Researchers at University College London (UCL) are currently studying the effects lockdowns are having on people’s mental health.Early results suggest that higher levels of anxiety and depression are linked to lockdown restrictions.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

spoken of his concerns that current progress of space technology means that humans will not make it to Mars in his lifetime.Speaking at the Satellite 2020 conference in Washington in March, he revised previous estimates stated in 2018 that a SpaceX craft could be ready for a trip to Mars as early as 2025.The thing that concerns me most right now is that unless we improve our rate of innovation dramatically, there is no chance of a base on the moon or a city on Mars. This is my biggest concern, he told the audience.We\u0027ve got to improve our rate of innovation or, based on past trends, I am definitely going to be dead before Mars.The 48-year-old has frequently spoken of his ambition to die on Mars, though always with the caveat, just not on impact.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAdditionally, the new advice by WHO suggested that people over 60, as well as those in high-risk groups, should wear medical grade masks in cases where social distancing isn\u0027t possible.However concern remains that masks may themselves introduce risk factors – including making people feel less inclined to continue other measures like social distancing and hand washing.Mr Tedros added: “Our guidance also explains how to use a mask safely. People can potentially infect themselves if they use contaminated hands to adjust a mask, or to repeatedly take it off and put it on, without cleaning hands in between.“Masks can also create a false sense of security, leading people to neglect measures such as hand hygiene and physical distancing. “I cannot say this clearly enough: masks alone will not protect you from Covid-19.”Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?The announcement comes just a day after the UK government announced it would be making face coverings mandatory on public transport following months of claims the science was not clear on their effectiveness.“We are advising governments to encourage that the general public wear a mask. And we specify a fabric mask – that is, a non-medical mask,” the WHO’s technical lead expert on Covid-19, Maria van Kerkhove, added. “We have evidence now that if this is done properly it can provide a barrier... for potentially infectious droplets.”The UN agency’s advice that all healthcare workers dealing with Covid-19 patients, or with suspected cases of the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, should wear medical masks remains the same, Ms Van Kerkhove said.However, now that advice has been broadened to suggest staff coming into contact with any patients or residents in clinics, hospitals, care homes and long-term residential facilities should also wear masks at all times.Additional reporting by Reuters.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

My business relationship with you is over, Dave continued, before using a barrage of abusive swear words.Elon Musk breaks Twitter hiatus to demand Amazon is \u0027broken up\u0027Posting a screenshot of the email on his Instagram account, which at time of writing has gathered nearly 170,000 likes, Mr Bezos wrote: There have been a number of sickening but not surprising responses in my inbox since my last post. This sort of hate shouldn’t be allowed to hide in the shadows. It’s important to make it visible. This is just one example of the problem.“And, Dave, you’re the kind of customer I’m happy to lose.”This isn’t the first instance where the Amazon CEO has posted emails he has received. Last week, Mr Bezos shared an email from an angry customer about the company’s Black Lives Matter banner, that was visible on Amazon’s homepage.Amazon facial recognition falsely matches politicians to criminalsHowever, the company’s actions have been criticised by supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement as well, which has recently been protesting the death of George Floyd. Moreover, Amazon continues to manufacture and pitch its facial recognition software to law enforcement, even though such technologies disproportionately misidentify black faces, and although only 15 percent of its workforce is black, those people make up 85 percent of its warehouse staff.This is not an issue unique to Amazon. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey partnered with Beyonce to donate £4.9 million to “communities of colour” during the coronavirus pandemic, yet has been repeatedly called on to make Twitter take stronger action against racism or to remove prominent accounts that promote racist content.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Figures from the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) show a 175 per cent rise, with both charities reporting this their “busiest period ever”. Furthermore, a survey by the giving platform Neighbourly of 900 charities and community groups providing food to the vulnerable found that 70 per cent expect the situation to get even worse in the next six to 12 months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent proprietor Evgeny Lebedev paid special tribute to the almost 6,000 ordinary iniduals who have dug deep to contribute to our appeal. He said: “Time and time again Londoners have shown that they are capable of immense generosity and community spirit in this period of crisis.“To all those that donated, bought and bid — I salute you.”Morgan Stanley said the bank and its employees in London had made the donation as part of their global Covid-19 response.How to support our campaignClare Woodman, head of Morgan Stanley EMEA, said: “The Felix Project plays a vital role in distributing food to people in need, especially those severely impacted by the pandemic. I am proud our employees in London are supporting them as part of our Covid-19 Hunger Relief Campaign.”Another substantial donor was Partners Capital investment group, which donated £95,287.John Collis, head of Partners Capital, Europe, said they “selected The Felix Project as one of our charities to support during this difficult period as it is one of the most impactful charities in London today”.Heads down for quiz nightThe original Top Gear trio — Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May — will tonight host a special Zoom quiz in aid of our appeal partner, The Felix Project. Participants in the Quintessentially Foundation’s “World’s Greatest Quiz Night” will face five rounds of questions devised by Nicholas Shearing, questions producer for top British TV quiz shows Pointless, Debatable and Impossible. May, who has driven Felix vans delivering food to vulnerable Londoners throughout lockdown, said: “At least in this stay-at-home pub quiz version, it will be easy to cheat.” 7.30-9pm. Tickets £10: thefelixproject.orggreatestquizOur appeal was also boosted by the silent auction, in partnership with Quintessentially Foundation, which closed this week with 135 bids placed for 36 lots and raising almost £40,000.The most highly prized lots were two tickets to a Liverpool FC game, four tickets to the Euro 2021 semi-finals, a video-chat with Spurs coach Jose Mourinho, a private guitar lesson with singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding and a helicopter lesson.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe latest figures from The Trussell Trust show April was the busiest month ever for the network of food banks, with an 89 per cent increase in emergency parcels compared with the same month in 2019.And the number of parcels provided for children has more than doubled, while almost twice as many families with children are receiving them (a 95 per cent rise).Colman visits The Felix ProjectDr Rachel Loopstra, lecturer in nutrition at King’s College London, said: “It’s clear from the data, as well as from trends in foodbank use, that families with children are really struggling right now. Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Rebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

Everyone is very grateful,’ says a volunteer who also uses service when his own illness means he is unable to pitch inFormer music manager John McIntyre was unsure how he would cope when lockdown began.“I was very scared,” said the 75-year-old who has a respiratory condition and lives alone in a one-bedroom flat in Dalston. “If I caught Covid, I wouldn’t be able to get enough oxygen to the heart. I just had to follow the advice and be safe.” Mr McIntyre, who used to manage the jazz reggae band The Beatroots, has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema.He has relied for his daily meal from local charity Made In Hackney which is supplied by our Help the Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project. Mr McIntyre is one of more than two million people who are classified as “extremely vulnerable” because they have compromised immune systems. For the last 10 weeks, many of them have struggled to get access to food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSince March, volunteers from the River House Trust charity have been dropping off Felix produce to people living with HIV. One such volunteer is former actor Stephen Hart who was diagnosed in 2006. When he is too ill to leave the house, he also uses the food delivery service.Despite being high-risk and a life-long diabetic, Mr Hart has been helping to get food to those more vulnerable than him. He has been unable to work since his health deteriorated two years ago, but Mr Hart, who lives alone in south London, said he wanted to help others.How to support our campaign“When I feel well enough, I pick up boxes from River House and drop them off for people who need them,” he said. “I do it when I can but some days are bad days.”Mr Hart said his condition means sometimes he can’t get out of bed. He occasionally receives a Felix box for himself so he knows he has food when he is too sick to move. “It is reassuring to have food in the house,” he said. “Felix has been a lifeline.”Although the British HIV Association said there “remains no evidence” that people with HIV are at greater risk of Covid-19 infection, those with a low CD4 count – the white blood cells affected by HIV – have been advised to shield.Mr Hart said members of the HIV community have been “nervous” since the outbreak. “There isn’t much specific advice so the community has been trying to look after each other.”A 62-year-old living with HIV for 37 years, who asked not to be named, described how his parcels have helped him. He said: “I pick up the boxes as I don’t have energy to go shopping. They’ve been great.”Mr Hart said it was extremely moving to see the response to his deliveries: “It is amazing. Everyone is very grateful.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2. Hands should be cleaned more often than usual with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds and dried thoroughly. Alternatively, hand sanitiser or alcohol hand rub can be used3. Promote the ‘catch it, bin it, kill it’ approach to coughing and sneezing4. Clean frequently touched surfaces regularly using standard products, such as detergent and bleach5. Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Moscow’s daily Covid-19 caseload has persisted around 2,000 for the best part of 3 weeks, hovering ten times above targets for ending the lockdown and with little downward pressure.Nonetheless, the city is officially reopening, its mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on Monday. As of Tuesday, authorities will begin lifting the strict lockdown regulations that have restricted city life for ten weeks. They include smartphone QR passes for journeys across the city, which in reality were never refused, and compulsory mask-wearing and exercise “timetables” that were increasingly ignored. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn a pre-recorded video, Mr Sobyanin claimed “big data” showed Muscovites were sticking to the rules. Most believe his sooner-than-anticipated relaxation was, in fact, acceptance of the contrary. The mayor announced normal business would be resumed in three stages. Speakeasies and underground barbershops flourish in lockdown MoscowTuesday, 9 June, marks the end of most stay-at-home regulations, with hairdressers and beauty salons also allowed to open. On June 16, dentists, museums, zoos, libraries and restaurants with verandas will open their doors. Gyms, swimming pools, kindergartens, and restaurants with indoor seating areas will follow a week later, in time for the Kremlin’s rescheduled victory parade of 24 June. Most of Moscow’s lockdown measures came into force at the end of March. QR-passes for city journey arrived two weeks later.On the other side, the first steps towards relaxing the lockdown came 11 days ago, on 27 May. This was when Mayor Sobyanin unveiled a plan for scheduled outdoor exercise and compulsory mask wearing outside. In the event, both measures were impossible to police and were largely ignored.  Writing on his official blog, Mr Sobyanin nonetheless attempted to present the quarantine regime as a “victory” for Moscow and his team. The city was de facto returning to its “normal rhythm,” he said. What would now follow was a much vaguer “regime of self-preservation and care of those around us.” The news of a return towards normal business will certainly come as a relief for the tens of thousands of businesses unable to work throughout the pandemic. Most have been offered scant support from the government. Now, at least, they have been given the chance to fight for their survival. Alexei Navalny, Russia‘s main opposition leader, also interpreted the news as an opportunity. “So coronavirus regulations are being cancelled, and on 24 June we have a great big parade,” he wrote on Twitter. “That means on Saturday 27 June we can all meet for a demonstration against Putin“ No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He always beat them.#Once she even had strangles on her neck.#KATE MCCANN once wrote about her #horror# that a worker at their Praia da Luz holiday complex may have accidentally informed Madeleines suspected abductor that she, her husband Gerry and pals ate out each night.A former Ocean Club worker tipped off main suspect Christian B that Madeleine had been left alone, it was claimed over the weekend.Police sources believe the insider had Christian Bs old Portuguese mobile phone details — one of two numbers revealed by UK cops last week — in his diary.But a member of staff at the complex may also have alerted Christian B by making a note in a staff register that was open for all to see, Sky News reports.In her book, Madeleine, Kate McCann wrote: #It wasnt until a year later, when I was combing through the Portuguese files, that I discovered that the note requesting our block booking was written in a staff message book, which sat on a desk at the pool reception for most of the day.#We wanted to eat close to our apartments as we were leaving our young children alone there and checking on them intermittently.#Mrs McCann added she thought the message book entry had been made #in all innocence#.GERMAN prosecutors handling the Madeleine McCann case are said to be #absolutely certain# that Christian B is the #right man#, it is claimed.But there is not yet an arrest warrant out for the suspect, who is still in prison serving a sentence for other offences,and has not been charged over the little girls disappearance.Today, Julian Reichelt, editor-in-chief of German newspaper BILD, told Good Morning Britain: “Investigators and prosecutors here are absolutely certain they have the right man but so far they haven’t charged him.“There isn’t even an arrest warrant on him which isn’t necessary because he’s in jail anyhow for another charge.“But so far, they are still missing the one important thing which would be either the body or a confession by Christian B.“So far, we have learned that they haven’t even talked to Christian B, they haven’t even questioned him already because they are still trying to put together more and more of the pieces so they can put pressure on him and maybe get a confession from him.#GERMAN prosecutors believe there are more victims linked to Madeleine McCann suspect Christian B.Hans Christian Wolters, Braunschweig state prosecutor, said: #We assume there are more victims.#And he said that the suspect has not yet been questioned by police over Madeleines disappearance.The senior prosecutor said: #It is currently a circumstantial suspicion.#We have not yet questioned the suspect in this case.#CHRISTIAN B could be extradited to Portugal under a European Arrest Warrant.But cops are still hunting for definitive proof in the case.Under German law, he could not be extradited to Britain, German news site Op-Onloine reports.#It is not enough for an arrest warrant or an indictment,# said Hans Christian Wolters of the Braunschweig public prosecutors office.German prosecutors believe Madeleine is dead.COURT documents seen by The Sun revealed that a German pal, who alerted cops about Christian Bs  rape of a widow in Praia da Luz, told how the suspect would brag he had broken into some villas while the occupants were inside.Christian B. ed to Germany in the late s, telling pals hed made thousands from his burglaries.A former friend said: #He was helping himself to cash, jewellery, electronic items. #He used the money to buy drugs and sell them on.#CHRISTIAN B led a search party to find a teenage girl who had fled a foster home in the months after Madeleine disappeared and found her in a nearby seaside town.It is understood the girl was pregnant when she ed # with Christian B leaving the area soon after.One local said: #He found her. She was in Lagos with a group of Romanians, and from what I’ve heard at the time, when she got back to the house, she was pregnant.#Then the teenager disappeared and then this guy disappeared. I assumed she was taken back to Germany given the circumstances that she was pregnant.#Another woman, who would eat at the restaurant where Christian B worked, wept as she said: #I don’t want to relive this man. The destruction he has caused. The things he had done. I cannot bear to think of it.”GERMAN authorities are said to ignored warnings from police that Christian B may have killed Madeleine McCann.A report from detectives who were tracking him said seven years ago he was a key suspect, it is reported.But the lead was ignored by Germanys Federal Criminal Office, news magazine Der Spiegel claims.The report came after British detectives made a fresh appeal for information on a German Crimewatch-style TV programme.MEANWHILE, Christian B was feared to be a gun-toting criminal,  according to residents in the Portuguese village he stayed at shortly after Madeleines disappearance.But Portuguese cops have not yet visited Foral to speak to locals about the suspect.Foral is about  miles from Praia da Luz, the resort where Madeleine vanished in .#Everyone was absolutely terried when he was around because he used to carry a gun,” said Lia Silva, a local woman.Christian B is also said to have taken part in a local search to find a missing teenager.DETECTIVES investigating Madeleines disappearance have received hundreds of tips, they revealed.Following a police appeal for information,around  leads have been flagged to Met Police cops leading the Operation Grange investigation.The UK police probe into Madeleine is still classed as a missing person inquiry as there is cops say there is no #definitive evidence whether Madeleine is alive or dead”.A Met Police spokesman said: “The Op Grange team have had just short of  pieces of information through, in calls and emails.”MADELEINE McCann suspect Christian B told colleagues #there are ways to make a body disappear# as they discussed the toddlers disappearance.Christian B is said to have #lost it# as workers at a kiosk he ran in his hometown of Braunschweig when they tried having a conversation about the toddler.Barmaid Lenta Johlitz, , told German newspaper Bild: “Once he was completely freaked out when we were sitting talking  with friends about the Madeleine case.“He wanted us to stop. He cried out, ‘The child is dead now and that’s a good thing’, then he said: ‘You can make a body disappear quickly.

I don’t want to know anything.”Christian, one of three boys adopted by the couple, became a wild teen. He stole cars and behaved inappropriately with young girls.When a crash left Fritz in a wheelchair they couldn’t cope and he was sent to a home for delinquents.He was sent to live in a home for delinquent boys in  when he was aged .Sun on Sunday columnist Karren Brady has called for justice for Madeleines parents, Kate and Gerry McCann.Karren wrote: #Anyone with children had only to take one look at Kate and Gerry McCann, Madeleine’s parents, to identy with the bottomless pit of pain etched all over their faces.#Not only were they contending with the loss of their tiny daughter, they were briefly considered suspects in her disappearance, before being cleared of any wrongdoing by Portuguese investigators.#I am not sure how anyone lives with the uncertainty about whether their child is alive or dead.#She added: #With any luck, enough evidence will be gathered to make sure that, whatever has happened to this child, justice will be served.#CHRISTIAN B was a twisted loner at school who was hated by all the other children, a former classmate has revealed.The Madeleine McCann murder suspect spent his days annoying the other children and getting into a string of fights.He also goaded teachers but then laughed in their face when they reacted, the former pupil revealed.He told The Sun: “I have only ever had one fight in my le – and that was with Christian B.“He spent a year being sneaky and snidey with me, never stopping with the comments.“One day I exploded and told him I wished he would go back to the children’s home from where he had come from.“We all knew he was adopted, so I shouldn’t have said that but I lost my temper with him.A BRIT dad has slammed bungling Portuguese cops for ignoring his daughter’s crucial witness statement.Gordon Sillence, , said his girl Tasmin, then , twice saw a man who looked like Christian B lurking outside the McCanns’ flat.She even saw a little girl, believed to be Madeleine, on the balcony being watched by the prowler.A photofit was made with her description of a fair-haired man with pockmarked face and sunglasses.But Mr Sillence, who used to own the Praia da Luz apartment where Madeleine holidayed, said cops seemed more interested in an older suspect and the McCanns themselves.Mr Sillence, , told The Sun how his daughter # now  # was left haunted by the sighting of the man and remains traumatised to this day.A WOMAN saw Madeleine McCann get into a German-owned Volkswagen van in Spain more than three weeks after the three-year-old went missing, its claimed.In a police statement seen by The Mail On Sunday the person, a witness reported seeing a child that looked like the little girl leave a restaurant called Tunnels in Alcossebre on May  .

He and I worked together in The Hague on the prosecution of the Serb Generals Mladic and Krstic over the Srebrenica massacre in .They were both duly convicted and imprisoned with long sentences – that was justice properly applied, not the ludicrous allegations of struck off lawyer, Phil Shiner, or the mendacious work of the grotesquely expensive Iraq Historic Allegations Team.Well done to Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon for stopping IHAT in  and now to the present Defence Secretary, Ben Wallace, for finally killing off that most damaging process.Why would any sensible young person think of putting on the Queen’s unormthey thought they could be tapped on the shoulder years after an operation and questioned over  allegations No one is above the Law, soldiers included, but their employer, the Ministry of Defence, must exercise its duty of care to its people responsibly and never again allow wholesale unfounded allegations to be made.And so, to the Troubles in Northern Ireland around which the spectre of a knock on the door by police asking questions about incidents  or  years ago still lingers on for former British soldiers.Ex-Household Cavalry soldier, Dennis Hutchings, is standing trial for attempted murder in the High Court in connection with the killing of a civilian in Northern Ireland in .I have a copy of the letter from the Army Legal Services at the time informing him that, following a police investigation, the Director of Public Prosecutions had “directed that there is to be no prosecution of any military personnel” arising from this tragic event.Yet today, with no new evidence being presented against Dennis Hutchings, this -year-old veteran with end-stage renal failure must listen in by video-link while a single judge decides his case.When Dennis said the other day: “To say that I’m disappointed in our legal system would be choosing my words carefully”. That is a very polite understatement by a most loyal ex-soldier. Where, on the other hand, is the Government’s loyalty to him Dennis Hutching’s case clearly illustrates the disproportionate attention being paid to soldiers and former soldiers arising from their service in Northern Ireland. During the Troubles, around , people were killed in the Province and very many more injured.Reliable statistics show that % of the deaths were caused by terrorists .Less than  per cent of those who were killed between  and  were at the hands of the police and the military and of these, with a handful of exceptions, all were found to be lawful.There is no getting away from the fact that the vast majority of soldiers in Northern Ireland got up in the morning with a clear aim to abide by the Law and fulfil their duties with integrity.Terrorists, on the other hand, got up in the morning with the clear aim to kill and to maim, for purely political purposes.So, what is to be done  Accepting that no one is above the Law and that where credible allegations, backed by evidence, are made against anyone, then charges must be laid, a case heard in court and a proper finding reached.This applies to soldiers and to civilians alike. And there are still unexplained deaths in Northern Ireland. But for investigations to focus unduly on former soldiers is grossly unfair. The British Army kept detailed records of who was where, doing what on a given date.None of the paramilitaries, the IRA nor the UVF or UDA, kept such records, so starting with inquiries first to soldiers, while logical to the police mind, is thoroughly unreasonable and very worrying,done in the wrong way with an unexpected knock on the door.It is for that reason that the former Attorney General, Geoffrey Cox MP, proposed that such questioning should be on the presumption not to prosecute. In this way soldiers can be invited to provide information but without the fear that they will incriminate themselves or their comrades.Families of the bereaved have the right to know what happened to their loved ones but not at the expense of stress and worry to  and -year-old former soldiers. That offends natural justice and must stop.On my last morning as Chief of the General Staff on th August , two investigators presented themselves in my office in the Ministry of Defence to ask about a death in Belfast in . This was nothing more than a fishing trip and quite unacceptable.In the United Kingdom, we are justiably proud of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines. They take risks on the front line to protect our national interests and citizens at home and abroad.They are trained to follow core values of selfless commitment, courage, discipline, integrity, loyalty and respect for others. They go about their duties with these values very much in mind.They deserve the respect of the country and the support of the elected Government of the day whose operations they conduct on behalf of the people. They do not deserve to be accused and harassed years later.I am delighted that the appalling IHAT is now itself part of history, so too must be the witch hunt of former soldiers who did their duty in Northern Ireland.

The shining light in all of the darkness has been their twins Sean and Amelie, who are now almost  years old.They were just babies when Madeleine went missing, and although she hasn’t been in their lives for the past  years, they have had to grow up in their big sister’s shadow.Kate and Gerry are fiercely protective of the pair, and have tried to shield them from the outside world, especially the fetid online swamp of vindictive attention-seekers and conspiracy theorists.It can’t be easy trying to allow them to lead a normal le, while wanting to wrap them both in cotton wool and keep them safe.Any time I have offered this poor, bereft couple support, I experience a tiny pinprick of the kind of horric agony they have to endure.All I have to do is spend a few hours muting the vile trolls so they are effectively ranting in an empty room.Kate and Gerry are engulfed by a tsunami of prejudice and hatred every time Madeleine is back in the news.It’s already started up again.The next few days, weeks and months will open a lot of old wounds for Madeleine’s parents.They will have to relive the very bleakest times of their lives, and their hearts will be broken in pieces all over again.We all wanted Madeleine to be found alive, and for the family to have the chance to heal together.Realistically that’s not going to happen.But I hope to God they will finally find out what happened to their little girl and at least be able to mourn her.And then, somehow, try to get on with the rest of their lives.WHAT on earth was going through the head of racist cop Derek Chauvin as he snuffed the le out of George Floyd He must have realised the poor man couldn’t breathe and was close to death.Chauvin was also fully aware his actions were being filmed on a number of mobile phones, but he continued to forcibly put pressure on Mr Floyd’s neck and throat.Chauvin, who has been charged with second degree murder, displayed the most supreme arrogance.We can only surmise he feels himself to be above the law.I couldn’t watch the footage of a man dying before my eyes and I absolutely understand the despair and anger in the US, from everyone sick to their stomachs.Those who cry that Mr Floyd was a criminal are missing the point.Black men in the US are ASSUMED to be law breakers.They are stopped and searchedthey drive a half-decent car, and treated like dirt.They have to prove to cops they have nothing to hide while young white boys are not subjected to such prejudice.And it’s not all that much better on this side of the Atlantic.I absolutely understand the despair and anger following Mr Floyd’s death, and although I can sympathise, as a white person I can’t begin to understand what it’s really like because I don’t live with racism every day of my le.I completely respect people’s right to demonstrate and their heartfelt need to express solidarity with Mr Floyd and his family and to draw a line in the sand.At the same time I was deeply worried by the mass gatherings of people right in the middle of this pandemic, and concerned for their safety. You simply cannot have protests while observing social distancing.People were angry and upset and trying to comfort each other with embraces and hugs.There were confrontations with authorities – with police and protesters standing eyeball to eyeball.In London we saw isolated incidents of violence but most of the protesters were peaceful.They were, however, just too close to one another.And it would be an enormous tragedywe were to see a spike or second wave of coronavirus because of the heinous actions of one US cop.I really hope the killing of George Floyd is a turning point and there is some sort of common ground where people, regardless of their colour, start talking to each other to achieve a greater understanding.While we have a sour, embittered man in the White House who is using Mr Floyd’s death as a way to ide the nation and to further his bid for re-election, I seriously doubt any progress will be made, but we all need to try.I AM a huge admirer of Kate Middleton, who has the future of the Royal Family on her slender shoulders.She is never going to be a charismatic force of nature. But I don’t think that’s a bad thing – and not what we really want from our royals in any case.Kate is kind, hardworking, elegant and classy.  She takes her duties seriously and tries to help her chosen charities with an admirably hands-on approach.She is a loving mum, sweet-natured, reliable and loyal.This has led to some people accusing her of being rather dull.And she has been the subject of a snarky article in Tatler magazine, which claimed she has felt exhausted and trapped in the Royal Family ever since Harry and Meghan decide to run for the Hollywood hills.Kate is also dismissed as having “an aura of blandness” and accused of having acquired a much posher accent over the years.Kate was so incensed by this article she has taken legal action against the posh publication, claiming a string of inaccuracies – including a pre-wedding spat with her sister-in-law just before Meghan’s wedding to Harry.Incredibly, Tatler claims the pair fell out over whether Kate’s daughter Princess Charlotte should wear tights or not on the big day.It has all proved too much for Kate.She wants the world to realise she is not some sort of magnolia blancmange and to prove she is no pushover by demanding the offending article be removed.Kate might be quiet but she is also grimly determined.I suspect copies of Tatler will be airbrushed from all royal residences forthwith, never to darken their gilded coffee tables again.BIG congrats to the cast and crew of Holby City, who are up for a well-deserved Bafta in the Best Soap  Continuing Drama category.Much like late, lamented police drama The Bill, Holby has been shamefully overlooked and underrated when it comes to awards and recognition.The cast – in particular Rosie Marcel, as Jac Naylor, Bob Barrett as Sacha Levy and Kaye Wragg as Essie di Lucca – consistently put in cracking performances and the whole show just quietly gets on with knocking it out of the park week after week.I’d dearly love to see them taking home a Bafta,only to flag to BBC bosses what a gem of a show they have on their hands.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

All the other drivers on the motorway could see it too. But the Tesla, bombing along at around mph, with its self-drive autopilot system engaged, did NOT see it.It even went straight past the driver of the overturned truck who was at the side of the road, a good distance from the crash site, frantically warning oncoming motorists to slow down. And then came the impact.Luckily, no one was hurt. But the accident does serve as a useful reminder about technology. It can make le fun and it can make le convenient.

Had he not researched the car at all  I know Tesla says its autonomous system is nine times safer than a human. But a quick Google search would suggest that sometimes, like all technology, it isn’t safe at all.I actually quite like Tesla’s current range of cars. I think they are interesting and fun and I can see why, in lockdown, the Model  was the best-selling car in Britain.

But what staggers me is that the new chief suspect Christian B was living just a few miles from the Portuguese resort where she was last seen. His phone puts him in the resort itself on the night of the abduction.He was even interviewed by Plod back in . And it’s not like he was a model citizen. Described as a burglar and a drug dealer, it’s known he was also a paedophile. He’s even doing time in Germany right now for child sex offences. And yet somehow he was never arrested.It makes me wonder.

The more people there are, the more food there is for the rats.”Female rats can fall pregnant immediately after giving birth and can produce seven litters per year with up to eight babies each time.They can also mate up to  times with randy males in the space of a few hours.Professor Steven Belmain, of Natural Resources Institute in Greenwich, has also recorded an increase in rodents in suburban homes which he blames on a lack of food in city centres.He also said that hunger has made the ravenous rats more brazen meaning they are seen more and more during the day.Speaking about the rats fighting each other, he said: “They are quite territorial, so will defend their patches as much as they can.”While rats do not carry Covid-, they can spread other zoonotic diseases including Weil’s disease – a bacterial infection which can cause chills and headaches.Professor Belmain believes that while some of the vermin will migrate back to the cities once the lockdown is over, many colonies will continue to expand in the suburbs.He said: “What is happening is they are moving into residential areas and finding food sources there, so deciding to make it home.“Some people are telling me they are having real problems.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are building something new but we have to protect our interests.We cant let our economies and businesses suffer because of Brexit, especially at this times of pandemic and economic crisis.It is unprecedented but we have to protect what we stand for and what we believe in and at the end of the day, never ask the EU negotiator not to protect European interests, it is obvious.This week it was revealed the PM is refusing to stump up a £million bill demanded by the EU to pay for its coronavirus recovery.The PM has sparked a row with Brussels by insisting the sum must be cut down - risking further souring the trade talks.Brussels announced a £.billion fund in April to help the bloc’s economies weather the pandemic.The cash will come out of this year’s budget, meaning Britain is liable to pay a share under the terms of the Brexit deal.The week also say fishing industry experts warn a Brexit fishing deal which strips EU states of being able to fish in UK waters would lead to blockades at Calais.EU countries want to continue to be able to fish in British waters and dont want to have their current quotas cut.But the UK has vowed to take back control of its waters and give priority to British fisherman.But any new agreement on fisheries would deprive France and other European countries of a signicant part of their fishing hauls which could spark fury and blockades, according to The TimesNational Federation of Fishermens Organisation Barrie Deas said: As night follows day there will be blockades, theyve done it for much less in the past.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But this cannot be at the expense of lives.“The science is clear thatwe limit the risk of new cases being brought in from abroad, we can help stop a devastating second wave.”Under the policy, all new arrivals - including ing Brits – must fill in a passenger locator form to give an address where they must remain for  days.Health officials will carry out telephone checks and £, fines will be slapped on anybody found breaking the quarantine.But former Cabinet minister and Tory MP David Davis, who has branded the policy “mad”, warned that Britain is now at risk of being refused quarantine-free access to European countriesMr Davis told The Sun: “As our rates of infection are higher than most countries in Europe now, they may turn round and tell us we’re no longer welcome.“If that happens, this policy will prove to be a truly disastrous self-inflicted wound.”Mr Davis added: “Quarantines for countries that still have high infection rates such as Brazil are still valid, but they should be the exceptions not the rule.”Problems continued to pile up for the policy last night.A third airline, EasyJet, has joined British Airways and Ryanair in suing the government to halt it.The Channel Tunnel’s owner Getlink has also written to the PM to plea for his urgent intervention, as it branded the quarantine plan “fraught with problems”.Passenger form templates and other red tape only arrived late on Friday, giving staff too little time to implement it before this morning. Spain, Greece and Cyprus are all in the top five countries that Brits visit annually, with Turkey and the USA making the final two.Turkey said last week that talks have begun with the UK government to set up a quarantine-free air bridge from July .Spain, Greece and Portugal have also said they want British tourists to be able tothere by then. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris wants distancing cut to one metre, giving the all-clear for pubs and restaurants to reopen and start rehiring the millions laid off since lockdown.Rishi Sunak is counting on this to trim Treasury job-support measures costing the economy a dizzying £billion.It will kickstart a new-normal summer, with open-air weddings, beer-garden service and marquees to protect punters from the rain.Summer holidays are back on track after being stymied for weeks.Airlines will bypass quarantine with air corridors to approved holiday destinations such as Italy, France, Greece and Turkey.These measures are not risk-free. Scientists point to a possible surge in Covid cases in the North.But equally reputable experts insist there is little chance of a second wave.The risk of the NHS failing to cope has now passed.Meanwhile, lockdown has brought its own death toll. Countless lives have certainly been lost from failure to diagnose and treat cancers and heart diseases.The price in lost schooling and crippled le chances will be paid for decades to come.Lting lockdown is a tough decision for any prime minister.But, as Boris knows better than most, to lead is to choose.

If they could do it we would happily talk to them about it and see what could be done.Last week Mr Barnier accused the UK of backtracking on both sides commitment to net a fishing deal by the end of this month.But he also admitted publicly for the first time that Brussels will have to drop its hardline demands.He said: On fisheries we have very strong positions on both sides.

A vaccine has not yet been found to treat the virus despite efforts by scientists across the globe.Prof Heymann today told Thethat the “only way to deal with it is mitigation”.He added: It could become endemic in humans. It could mutate in such a way it becomes more or less virulent. Or more or less transmissible. Or it could disappear.Prof Heymann had previously worked on Sars and said the disease had been easily passed between communities, which is similar to Covid-.Like the viruses that cause Sars and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome , Covid- is an RNA virus - with RNA as its genetic material, rather than DNA.That means the virus blends with its host’s DNA, and can mutate rapidly.Many countries have been successful in diminishing cases of Covid-, all without a vaccine.Places such as South Korea and Germany have both managed to implement effective track and trace programmes.Therefore they have been able to get on top of the pandemic, minimising loss of le.If this was to happen in places such as the UK, that has had a plethora of cases, the virus would be left with nowhere to go.Prof Heymann said this may mean that there are not enough people to transmit the virus.He added that the Asian countries managed to get on top of the virus in January due to their rapid response.This was due to the fact that they began contact tracing and isolation very early on.Prof Heymann said such measures help starve the virus and are critical circuit breakers that help stop transmission.He added that the disappearance of Sars was due to the response by local authorities.Travel bans were put in place almost immediately as well as border closures and researchers worked together to try and work out the best cause of action.This time around, Prof Heymann said the level of coordination between ious governments has been stretched.He added that the world has not been able to work well on a political level, despite scientists and researchers working together to fight the virus.Sars caused  deaths and as the virus mutated as it passed through humans it slowly began to deplete, meaning that like Sars, Covid- one day might just “disappear”.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Ms Moran added: “We cannot afford to lose them, a music venue isn’t just a space – it’s a hub for culture in a community as well as a major local employer. “If we want to move forward together after this crisis we need to revive and renew the arts, we need to support them now before it’s too late. “We cannot allow to curtain to call on the UK’s cultural jewels.” "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus lockdown changes what you","story":"NewsCoronavirus lockdown changes: What you can and cant do from Monday June Some changes to the coronavirus lockdown rules will come into force from Monday, June  - from dentists reopening to new parking charges and quarantine plansShareCommentsByMax ClementsLucy Skoulding:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video uk-hospital-coronavirus-death-toll-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,newGrid:true,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,newGrid:true,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics coronavirus-lockdown-changes-what-you-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The government is slowly easing lockdown restrictions so people can start doing things that werenapost possible in lockdown.However, the pandemic and the restrictions are far from over, but every few weeks the government is tweaking the rules slightly so that we can do more.Reports circulating suggest the government is keen to see the economyto some sort of normality as quickly as possible over the next month, reports the Liverpool Echo.Although the bulk of changes are expected to come in from  June, there are some minor changes to the lockdown rules that will come into force from Monday, June . What you can already do under the lockdown rules Since the initial lockdown back in March, when the public was told only to leave the house for food and daily exercise, there have been several tweaks to the rules.On May , Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that groups of six people from dferent households would be permitted to meet in gardens and in outside spaces, so long as they remained socially distanced, from June .Also from June , iniduals classed as clinically vulnerable, who had been shielding in their homes since the beginning of the pandemic, were allowed to meet one person from another household so long as they remained two metres apart. Workers who are unable to work from home have now been encouraged to go back to work, such as those in the manufacturing and construction sectors. Some primary schools have reopened to all pupils in Reception, Year  and Year , although many local schools and local authorities have refused to comply with the governmentaposs timeline.Here is what is changing from Monday, June . Dentists One major change that is set to take effect is the opening of dentists in England. Dentists have been told they can begin taking appointments and open their doors to patients again. Although dentists were permitted to perform emergency treatment during the lockdown, everyday appointments for fillings and crowns were cancelled to stop the spread of the virus. The Chief Dentistry Officer, Sara Hurley, said that dentists could re-open so long as surgeries comply with the governmentaposs PPE and Infection Prevention Control requirements.  Quarantine Another well publicised change to lockdown rules taking effect tomorrow is a new two week quarantine for people entering the UK from abroad.From Monday, June , travellers arriving in England will be required to self-isolate for  days on arrival, as part of measures in place to reduce the spread of coronavirus.The temporary measure will see tens of thousands of new arrivals to placed in quarantine, although the measures have been criticised for causing disruption to the travel and aviation industry. Many more signicant changes will come into effect from June  including: the opening of non essential shops the planned opening of secondary school pupils in Year  and  and the mandatory wearing of face masks on public transport.Parking charges Some local authorities across the UK are reintroducing parking charges from June , after weeks of them being suspended. Liverpool City Council, for example, put a suspension in place for  weeks, from March , on parking charges in the city centre. Where pay and display was usually in operation during the day, drivers were allowed to park in a pay and display bay, without penalty, at any time.What you still canapost do during lockdown Under the current rules you still canapost visit people inside their homes or stay overnight. Indoor leisure activities are still prohibited under the coronavirus rules with indoor sports courts, gyms, leisure centres and public swimming pools remaining closed. You still cannot shared a private vehicle with someone from another household, and restrictions on the number of people attending funerals remain in place.

The regionaposs ban on travelling more than five miles from your home will remain in place well into July. And hotels and bed and breakfast properties will stay shut for the time being.Mr Drakeford told the I newspaper the best hope of tourism ing to Wales this Summer was in self-contained accommodation like cottages and self-catering flats.He said: The best hope is that we will be able to allow people to come back to visit Wales in accommodation that is entirely self-contained, where in effect you could be self-isolatedyou needed to be,you were to fall ill [so] you would not be not posing an additional risk to others.” He said reopening hotels was much harder because of shared facilities. Number  said it was possible that England and Wales could open up hotels at dferent times. The PMaposs spokesman said: Of course, yes. It sets out in the [lockdown easing] roadmap that itaposs something we will consider, and we will be guided by the evidence and advice that itaposs something that is safe to do. Mr Drakeford complained contact with Westminster had been very ad hoc. “It’s as and when. Weeks can go by and there’s no contact, and then you get a burst of contact,” he said. “When contact happens it’s generally good and worthwhile, and I wish there was more of it.” It echoes complaints made by the Mayors of Liverpool and Manchester about communication with the UK Government.  Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said yesterday: We need a new relationship with government to manage the risk in the North West and get this virus into a position where the risks to our residents are managed, where the the aposaposR rate is below  and people can be confident in this public health message. He added: Itaposs been dficult for us to judge because of the lack of information thataposs been made available to us.

Non-essential retail is expected to be allowed to open from next Monday. When the alert level system was introduced by Boris Johnson said it was intended to help the government decide how tough social-distancing measures should be. At level five, which Britain never even reached at the the height of the pandemic, social distancing is supposed to be extreme and contact is supposed to be incredibly limited. Even at the peak of infection the Government claim the UK has never been at level five. When it was announced Mr Johnson suggested that once Britain moved to level three, where the virus is still in general circulation but the NHS is not at risk of being overwhelmed, that social distancing measures would be relaxed. But since that announcement last month Britain has remained at level four, where there is a high risk of transmission, and social distancing rules are supposed to be enforced. Despite this, last week we saw lockdown measures eased, leading many people to ask what exactly the warning level system is for. And today Downing Street confirmed that there isnapost a clear link between the alert system and the decision to ease lockdown measures.  This means that non-essential shops could still be allowed to reopen on  June providing they are “Covid-secure” - eventhe warning level remains at four. Boris Johnson’s spokesperson has said changes to lockdown measures are “guided by the scientic and medical advice” and the separate five tests for easing lockdown.  The threat level is decided by the chief medical officer Sir Chris Whitty, guided by data provided by the Government’s new Joint Biosecurity Centre . Today a Downing Street spokesman said that while the decision on reopening is conditional it wouldnapost necessarily be accompanied by a drop to level three in the warning system.

A post on the -year-oldaposs account read: I need a holiday so much, Iaposd be willing to go away with the McCannaposs at this point. Avon and Somerset Police said on Friday it was investigating her social media account which has now been removed. But other inappropriate messages have also been posted on the Beat Manageraposs account.

A post on the account responded: Itaposs a never-ending story. Things in the future are going to be so good. Once the deception is shown for all to see, we will know what freedom is. In another status, she boasted that some of her content had been removed by Facebook for violating its policies. Yet another encouraged others not to read the news and hinted again that coronavirus is made up as it simply stated: Social media distancing. In other posts, her account proudly revels in her tasteless content.  With a picture of a hand sticking the middle finger up, one post said: This is my Facebook, I post what I want. Donapost like it  Unfriend me. Contains mature adult content. Not appropriate for minors, or adults with large sticks up their a**. In another, a post reads: Let me forever be known as the girl who does whatever the f*** she wants.

Britain recoiled with horror when eight month old baby Samantha, Dawn, two, and David, four, were killed at their home in Worcester in . David McCreavy was caring for the three young children when he carried out the horrofic crime - and now their mother believes the monster who murdered her children is free. McCreavy had been welcomed into the family home as a lodger by Samantha, Dawn and Davidaposs father, Clive Ralph, who offered him a place to live and a key role at the heart of his loving family. He thought nothing of leaving his little ones in McCreavyaposs care, especially as the lodger was known to be found of children, especially the little ones he shared a home with. What he ed home to after collecting the childrenaposs mother, Elsie, from work horried a nation. McCreavy seemed to have vanished along with the children after he had flown into a drunken rage because baby Samantha started crying for her bottle. Using his bare hands he strangled the baby and she died from a fracture to her skull. He then attacked the two other youngsters with a chilling force. McCreavy slit two-year-old Dawnaposs throat and strangled Paul, four, with a wire. But killing the innocent children wasnapost enough for twisted McCreavy - he then horryingly mutilated their tiny bodies. He attacked them with a pick axe and then impaled their bodies on a fence. It earned him the chilling nickname the aposMonster of Worcesterapos and McGreavy was jailed for  years for the brutal crime. Aged just  at the time of the killings, no one could have predicted the terrying events of that night. Elsie claimed McGreavy was like a father to the trio and even said he had criticised her when she disciplined Paul. McGreavy had moved into the family home when Elsie was pregnant with her youngest daughter. He immediately became a much-loved part of the family, often cooking Sunday dinner and babysitting for the three children. His crime stunned the nation - how could a man who adored the children he was living with subject them to such horror  McGreavyaposs family were also baffled. His father, Tom McGreavy, said: Everyone who knew David knew that he loved children. But the affable young man who had become a key part of family le for the Ralphaposs was hiding a dark past. Born in Southport in , he was the second oldest of six children and spent much of his childhood moving between army bases as his father was a sergeant in the army. His early le pushed him to pursue a career in the Armed Forces and by  he had quit school and enlisted in the Navy. In the late sixties, and stationed in Portsmouth, McGreavy joined his first ship, HMS Eagle. Described by colleagues as a arrogant young man and cocky McGreavy found himself subject to several disciplinary procedures. But then he started drinking and his career began to unravel. While working as a steward in the mess hall he spotted his name had been written in a Chief Petty Officeraposs Book. Worried this could mean he was about to be told he was changing jobs he started drinking. Criminologist Dr Elizabeth Yardley said: He actually broke into an officeraposs ward room and set fire to a bin that had papers in it. He said he did this mistakenly, by accidentally dropping a cigarette end, and he did raise the alarm at :am. He expected the Navy to believe he was just an innocent eye witness, they saw beyond that and he was court marshalled. He was found guilty of negligence and sentenced to  days detention. By  he had fallen in love with a woman called Mary, who he proposed to just one week after meeting her for the first time. In the same year his career in the Navy had collapsed and he was dismisssed and he was forced tohome to his parents. A series of jobs followed, from chef to labourer, but they all eneded the same way - he was sacked. His attitude, arrogance and alcohol were all cited as reasons. McGreavy now put all his focus on his upcoming marriage to Mary - and he wanted a huge white wedding with all the trimmings. But on New Yearaposs Eve  Mary ended the engagement, leaving McGreavy devasated. Depressed and sulking while living with his parents, McGreavy moved into with his school friend, Clive Ralph. Cliveaposs decision to allow him to lodge with his family would have devastating consequences. The father had married Elsie when she was just  and pregnant with their first child and worked hard as a lorry driver to provide for his growing family. Living conditions in the two-bed house were cramped. McGreavy shared a bed with little Paul while baby Samantha was in a cradle cot in her parentsapos room and Dawn slept in a bed next to her mum and dad. Cliveaposs lorry driving job meant he was regularly away from home and Elsie was grateful for McGreavyaposs help in caring for the children and running the home. A genial man who was adored by the family and liked by those who knew him, once again his personality completely changed whe he drank. McGreavy was arrested several times for being drunk in public and his father warned him to stop. But his refusal to listen cost three young children their lives. On the night of the killings McGreavy had been drinking in a pub with a friend. He drank between five and seven pints and played cards and darts. Clive picked him up so he could babysit the children while he went to collect Elsie from her own job in another pub. Nothing could have prepared the couple for the scene that greeted them when they ed home. The walls were drenched with blood and there was no sign of McGreavy or the children. Police found their bodies impaled on the fence an hour later. At the time the sight was so hideous that Detective Superintendent Bob Booth, head of West Mercia CID, said: No investigating officer has ever had to witness that such a scene of indescribable horror. When police arrested McGreavy he initially denied carrying out the gruesome murders. By the following afternoon, he snapped and confessed. During his police interview he slumped forward and started sobbing. McGreavy said: It was all too bloody gruesome. It was me but it was not me, how could I do it  On Paul I used the wire. Everything just seem to cave in. I picked up the pickaxe and used all of them then I went outside and put them on the railings. All I can hear is the kids, kids f****** kids. I did the same to Dawn and used the piece of curtain wire on Paul. Asked why he had killed the three innocent children, McGreavy replied: That is what I have been trying to figure out. He pleaded guilty to the murders in a hearing that lasted just eight minutes. Most of his sentence has been served with him under protection as he has been subject to abuse from other prisoners. In , McGreavy was transferred to an open prison and now he has been cleared for release. The news has come as a devastating blow to their mother, now Elsie Urry after re-marrying. She is terried she will see him on the street. McGreavy would be subject to exclusion zones including where Mrs Urry lives - but they could still bump into one another where.

Using ropes the demonstrators pulled Colston down and rolled him into the water, to great cheers from onlookers, Bristol Post reported. Speaking live on BBC Radio Bristol, Mayor Marvin Rees warned about the dangers of mass gatherings. While he said he did not support criminal damage, Mayor Rees argued the toppling of the statue was now part of the cityaposs history. Itaposs still underwater, at some point it will be fished out... we will obviously take the statue out, he said. But we have a number of priorities in the city at the moment not least trying to face up to an £million gap in our budget that we have been left with by national Government not funding us adequately for covid. Whataposs happened to the statue is now part of that statueaposs story. People in Bristol came together and said we donapost want that statue in the middle of the city. What I would also recognise though-  and itaposs important to do so - is that many people are dismayed by the tearing down of the statue and as a city it is our job to unite those voices to. We do live in a country where some people feel like they are losing their grip on their history and identity, many people believe Colston represented their sense of Bristol. So we as a city need to now have that kind of discussion with ourselves about what we are as a city and how we all make sure we have a sense of place and ownership. He added: It is highly likely that the Colston statue will end up in one of our museums.  For many years before the statue was taken off its plinth yesterday campaigners in Bristol and further afield have been calling for it to be removed. Colston was a member of the Royal African Company, which transported about , men, women and children from Africa to the Americas. On his death in , he bequeathed his wealth to charities and his legacy can still be seen on Bristolaposs streets, memorials and buildings.  Avon and Somerset Police said a decision was taken not to intervene when it became clear the statue was coming down. In the day since a petition has been launched to have a statue of Paul Stephenson stand on the now empty plinth. The local hero led the  Bristol Bus Boycott, started because the Bristol Post announced in  that black workers were refused work, despite a shortage of employees.

Even smaller details like hair and make-up can be crucial to make a bride feel her best on her big day. One bride from the US had a very specic vision for exactly how she wanted to look on her wedding day and hired two professionals to make sure her hair was perfect. But despite her extensive planning, this still did not go as they should. After the bride-to-be had found her perfect hair style on Pinterest - an elegant half up do - she showed her two hairdressers and also asked for some subtle highlights too. But when her hairdressers went rogue and strayed from the Pinterest picture she had given them, the bride was left wishing sheaposd done it herself. Instead of blending the highlights throughout the brideaposs hair like she wanted, the hairdressers gave her a harsh blonde ombre, which looked nothing like the picture. And rather than giving her the soft beachy waves like the model, hers resembled tighter ringlets.

Most fans would think an owner would buy a club and then buy other clubs in other countries.“How I would see it personally is that you create really good partnerships, like Aberdeen have with Atlanta. That’s a fantastic partnership.“I’ve been out there. The owner has more zeros than you can write down. They’ve got a great structure. There are amazing ways of working.”Asghar, who is currently working with United boss Robbie Neilson on recruitment for next season, feels the club – and Scottish football as a whole – has lots to learn from other nations’ approach to marketing the game and driving revenue.That’s a task he is passionate about accomplishing at Tannadice.“I understand that Scottish fans traditionally come to the game at  o’clock on a Saturday after a few pints with their pals,” he said.“[They] have a pie at half-time and after a game they’re moaning about the team or talking about how well it’s done. A brilliant weekend, back in work on Monday.“Now football is much more than that.“We’ve got the opportunity to get Dundee United out to places like India, the Middle East, South America and the US because technology makes it a lot easier.“We’ve got a product we can definitely market better across the world.“It’s challenging. American clubs speak to us about how we get such passion and support. Dundee United fans have fathers and grandfathers who supported the club.

He started at  and has worked his way through the ranks and has worked very hard and deserves his promotion as they all do.“The opportunity is there now for Dan in the next couple of years to progress to category one status and that’s the target for every Scottish referee andyou’re on their list it can open up potential for European assignments. We don’t want to get carried away, but once you reach category  it opens up doors.”It’s not just players who have been missing football since the game was shut down in March.Roy says referees are just as keen to get back in action.He added: “Referees are missing football as much as anybody , they’ve not even been allowed to meet up to train together.“We had our local association’s annual general meeting on Zoom which worked well, but it’s still not the same.“For one of the regional coaching sessions where clips of games are reviewed, over  referees joined in on the Zoom .“But it’s still tough when you’re not able to train as a group, although I know the guys are working hard inidually.“However, it’s the camaraderie that everyone misses and they’ll all be keen to be back among their mates.“It’s the same as players missing being in their dressing room with their team-mates.“Referees are in exactly the same boat, they’re cut off from their hobby which means a lot to them.“Once we’re allowed to train as a group again it will be a boost for all the referees.”The Aberdeen and District Referees’ Association are being creative in a bid to attract new officials.The organisation are unable to hold their usual June introductory class as normal, but are holding it virtually instead.Association manager Sandy Roy said: “As a refereeing association we still need to try to attract people to become referees.“We know some people will have lost interest in it or because of lockdown decided not to start classes when things get back to normal.“So we’ve tried to come up with something. We’re not able to go to the Sports Village for classes, but people can learn via Zoom from the comfort of their own homes and then once we are able to have gatherings we can meet and go over the physical aspects of the course.“If the class is successful then the hope would be that we could have new referees ready for next season once they’re able to do the practical and the exam.“We usually run a course in June, this year it’s slightly dferent, but maybepeople are bored at home this will appeal.”Anyone interested in joining the class should contact association secretary Roddy Cobb at roddycobb@sky or on  .For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"argyll sport decimated amid coronavirus response","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe coronavirus response has forced the cancellation of sporting events up and down the region.Just when the situation will settle down enough to allow sport to re-start is anyone#s guess at this stage, but early casualties have included shinty, football, athletics and a planned youth football trip to Europe.The committee of Mid Argyll Athletic Club took the dficult decision to postpone the Argyll final of Sports Hall Athletics which was due to take place at Atlantis Leisure in Oban this Sunday, March .With more than  young boys and girls qualying for the final from the four local area competitions and the possibility of another -plus family member spectators filling the games hall the organisers felt it was sensible to postpone the event.A statement from the organisers said: #After consultation with the management staff at Atlantis Leisure it was decided it was best to follow the guidance that is currently being issued by the Scottish Government and others to attempt to restrict the spread of the coronavirus.#We will revisit a date for holding the competition once the coronavirus situation is clear andnecessary this may be have to be after the summer school holidays.

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

unclear.The community council warned that the launch of a new vision for the area three years after the local authority produced its Cockenzie Masterplan document ndash which it has never adopted ndash would leave the public with no confidence in the planning system.East Lothian Council paid consultants to produce the Cockenzie Masterplan for the former Cockenzie Power Station site, which it

NPF.\"A number of consultations have taken place in our area and they have come to nothing.\"The feeling is the residents have lost confidence in the system.Neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council

They are a giant of nature, yet also incredibly intelligent. They feel emotion like we do, in fact possibly more so as the emotional part of their brain is even more developed than that of humans.The old saying that ldquoan elephant never forgets is rooted in this fact. An elephantrsquos emotional intelligence comes from its ability to remember and recall distant memory. Like humans, an elephantrsquos way of being is mostly learned in early le, rather than just based on instinct.They are therefore highly sensitive creatures, influenced and affected by what they experience just as we are.Irsquove heard dferent versions of this tale, and here I have peppered it very slightly with my own style:Once, a king in ancient India owned an elephant. This royal elephant was the joy not just of the king, but also his people.The trainer would ride the elephant every day along the streets. She was a magnicent sight, and children would run out to wave and watch the elephant go by. The trainer took a dferent route each day so people in dferent neighbourhoods all had a chance to enjoy the spectacle.The people felt a real love and affinity for the elephant. Despite her size and strength, she was gentle and affectionate with the people. She would pat children carefully on their heads with her trunk and took care in where she walked.The elephant made people feel safe. More than once she had saved a child from drowning in the nearby river, or from a predator from the jungle. She was a sacred animal to the people.But then people began to notice a change in the elephantrsquos behaviour. She became aggressive and unpredictable. Instead of being patient with the children she knocked them out of her way with her trunk. Instead of being careful where she walked, she deliberately trampled on peoplersquos gardens.The trainer tried his best to control the elephant, but she seemed like a dferent animal. He couldnrsquot understand why she was behaving so dferently.It just got worse, until one day the elephant suddenly set off on a charge and rampaged through the streets, trumpeting loudly as she charged at the terried people, almost killing some of them.The king was horried and ordered the elephant to be confined to her stables. With dficulty she was finally brought under control and locked in.ldquoWhat is going on  asked the king to the trainer.ldquoI have no idea your majesty he replied, ldquoitrsquos asshe is a dferent elephant.ldquoPerhaps the elephant is ill in some way  suggested one of the kingrsquos advisors. But the vet found nothing physically wrong.Then the trainer suggested asking an old man who lived in the jungle as ldquohe is known for his wisdom in understanding animals, perhaps he will know what the cause of this is.So the king sent a messenger and the old man came to the royal palace.ldquoCan you help  asked the king.The old man asked to be left alone with the elephant for a while.When he ed he looked at the king and said: ldquoWhatever is wrong is something that cannot be seen. I must spend some time with the elephant to understand what is troubling her.And so the old man decided to watch over the elephant that night. He smeared himself in mud to mask his scent and hid in a corner of the stable.It was late evening when he heard voices.A group of men had entered the stables from a small side door. They were a gang of murderers. They were using the royal elephant stable as a place to meet and plan their activities. And in so doing they recounted stories of their deeds.Their leader was a man with a cold and ruthless heart. He told stories about his le and deeds, of how hersquod murdered and tortured people he didnrsquot like. Members of his gang laughed and shared their tales too, likewise full of hatred and cruelty.The elephant slumbered as these tales were told, but they were unknowingly heard by her. When the elephant woke the following morning, the tales of hate and violence still swirled in her mind.The old man went to the king.ldquoYour majesty, there are two things you must do to cure the elephant.ldquoThe first is to remove the murderers who meet in the stables at night.

Many report feeling lonely, anxious and disconnected from their families and communities.Before coronavirus, loneliness was already a signicant public health concern. Age Scotland research found that more than , older people in Scotland could go a week without seeing or speaking to another person.Age Scotland say the health impact of chronic loneliness is as harmful as smoking  cigarettes a day and raises the risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, depression and developing dementia.Brian Sloan, chief executive of Age Scotland, said: \"I am delighted to launch our Age Scotland Friendship Campaign at a time when it is more important than ever for older people to feel valued and connected.\"The past three months have been extremely dficult for tens of thousands of older people who have struggled to cope with feeling cut adrt from society and desperately missing family, friends and normal le.\"Our free friendship line is a place where older people can turnthey are in need of support, comfort and reassurance or even just a friendly chat.

The First Minister has taken control of the management of the pandemic in Scotland. She has stated on many occasions that she takes the decisions and the responsibility and she has fronted every daily press conference, a feat of stamina and leadership that is admirable in itself. Butthe ldquoelite has failed, so has the First Minister.Its not aswe were not warned. There were at least four reports, three specically for the Scottish Government, that told of lack or equipment and processes to handle a pandemic, but it appears that the warnings were ignored, and the necessary preparations were never made. It is also obvious that the UK did not lock down quickly enough, but the first signicant outbreak was in Edinburgh and it was covered up by the First Minister. Had it been known to the public, pressure for an earlier lockdown would have been likely. Instead concerts and sporting events were allowed to continue, including the Scotland-France rugby on March . The Old Firm game of March  was cancelled by the SPFL, not the Scottish Government. BBC Scotlands Disclosure programme calculated that a two-week delay could have cost , Scottish lives over the following month.The lack of preparedness and delayed lockdown affected the UK and the devolved administrations in equal measure, resulting in lack of PPE, hospital beds, ventilators and other necessary equipment. The urging of the WHO to ldquotest, test, test was ignored in Scotland as much as England, and current testing levels are lower in Scotland. Infections are at the same rate in Scotland. The death rate from the virus is the same. Excess deaths are the same. Deaths in care homes are slightly worseanything. Discharging potentially infected people, and therefore the virus, from hospitals into care homes is the same. There is the same callousness in refusing to move the elderly sick from care homes to hospital. The result in all of the UK has been more infections and extra deaths.A good comparator of success or failure is New Zealand, with the same population as Scotland but with  deaths compared to our ,. It is dficult to see how such breath-taking levels of incompetence bolster any case for ldquoindependence except with those obsessed with it in the first place.

You rightly report the view that ldquoalarm bells were ringing for both the Scottish and UK governments. Surely objective readers have concluded that both administrations failed catastrophically, resulting in a huge number of lives being lost.Elsewhere in the same edition the impact on Scottish education was exposed in David Bolrsquos coruscating article headed ldquoPupils have been left severely traumatised\". Again an indication that Nicola Sturgeonrsquos handling of these matters is no better than Boris Johnsonrsquos.Moreover, Saturdayrsquos Herald was not a one-off. Switching scores of frail elderly patients from hospitals into care homes, without their or their familiesrsquo agreement, is surely beyond defending far less a case for independence.The consequences of the Nike Conference in Edinburgh and the cover-up which followed will not go away.Boris Johnsonrsquos appalling handling of the Dominic Cummings affair remains without justication. But anyone who followed Ms Sturgeonrsquos attempts, for a whole day, to seek to retain her hapless adviser, until her own career was clearly in jeopardy, will hardly be convinced that the First Ministerrsquos motivation was at all laudable.Mr McKennarsquos repeated description of the many who disagree with separatism as ldquoUnionists is offensive to those who understand its connotations.

The Yes SNP Green coalition has been unwilling to acknowledge, far less address, that issue.And so I believe that the Government and people of Scotland must find a way of addressing the issue of how we can deal with the consequences of being part of the Dystopian DysUnited Kingdomwith its architectsrsquo rejection of the UK values its citizens once believed were at least implied in its unwritten constitution.I find myself thinking that a resounding vote for an SNP Green alliance next year with a correspondingly overwhelming rejection of Jackson Carlawrsquos Conservatives would be the only way to put the necessary shot over the bows of the DDUK.

First: how should we treat farm animals in Scotland  Second: do we want Scotland to have the highest standards becausewe do, why is the Scottish Government allowing a practice thatrsquos no longer happening in England  And third: will we learn lessons from Covid  Because in Scotland we still disrespect animals in ways that have spread disease in the past and could do so again in the future.I have to say here that, until I started looking into this case, I hadnrsquot properly realised Scotland was still persisting with a practice that became such an infamous issue  years ago. You may remember it: in the s, half a million male dairy calves were being exported from the UK every year, mostly for veal, but the dairy industry eventually realised ndash thanks to a campaign against the practice ndash that their image was suffering and the number of exports dropped dramatically.However, the trade does still continue and Irsquom sad to say that for the last three years the only place in Britain where itrsquos been happening is Scotland. Since , more than , calves have been exported from Scotland to Spain where they are fattened for beef. The calves are usually taken from their mothers on their first day of le and loaded on to the trucks at two weeks old. Many other male calves are shot at birth .:MSPs back animal welfare reformsAh but wasnrsquot therea whole scandal about this a couple of years ago and didnrsquot PO say they would stop carrying calves from Scotland  True, but the Scottish Government remained supportive of live exports and, after PO made their decision in , the industry switched its tactics. So now, instead of going by boat from Cairnryan, the calves are driven to Ramsgate where a ship, chartered by the exporters, takes them to France and then by road to Spain.Which is where the court case comes in. The petitioner in the case is Compassion in World Farming, the organisation that campaigns for better farming standards, and their argument is that, in allowing the export of calves to Spain, the Scottish Government is breaking the law. The Government disagrees and has appointed a QC to fight the case, although exactly what their defence will be we donrsquot yet know.What the law says is that unweaned animals should not be transported for more than eight hours unless, after nine hours, they are given water andnecessary fed. Now as far as we know, after eight hours or so, the calves from Scotland are stopped at a motorway service station in Essex and the automatic watering system in the trucks is operated. But each truck is tightly packed with up to  calves and no one goes on board to checkall the calves take the water. Chances are many donrsquot.As for feed, what calves of that age receive is milk or a milk replacement, but the trucks donrsquot have the facilities for that so for the entire journey to France , they will not be fed. What the Government may argue ndash and it would be a pretty lowdown argumentthey try it ndash is that itrsquos not necessary to feed the calves. But calves of that age feed at least twice a dayand the schedule of documents sent to the Court of Session includes an unequivocal statement from Professor Donald Broom, the UKrsquos foremost authority on animal welfare: it is necessary to give milk or milk replacement to calves that have been transported for eight or nine hours.Compassion in World Farming say the Scottish Government has also tried to argue ndash surprise, surprise ndash that the problem arises in England and when I got in touch with the Government, they said it would be inappropriate to comment while legal proceedings were ongoing. They did, however, say they were committed to consulting on the recommendations of the Farm Animal Welfare Committee, which includes a nine-hour limit on journeys for calves. ldquoOur preferred policy intention, said the spokesman, ldquois not to support unnecessary long journeys involved in the export of livestock.But a statement like that raises more questions than answers. First, why support exports anyway - the UK imports a lot of beef so why not use the male dairy calves for beef in this country  Secondly, evenyou think live exports are a good idea, why fight a case over a time limit you say you support  And thirdly, is the fight really worth it  The calves being exported represent the rump of an industry that isnrsquot even economically signicant any more. Do we really want to be the last place in Britain where this happens :Opinion: Mark Smith: Why is Nicola Sturgeon not taking more flak over coronavirus  Ah yes: the English get-out clauseAnd perhaps the fact that the case is happening in the middle of a pandemic should also give the Government pause for thought. If you havenrsquot watched the recent webinar with the celebrated primatologist Jane Goodall, I recommend it. She didnrsquot hold back. Humans have brought coronavirus on ourselves, she said, because of our disrespect for animals that have been pushed closer into contact with each other, and theyrsquove been pushed closer together in markets, on intensive farms, and in trucks parked up at motorway service stations in Essex.So what happens now  The case against the Scottish Government is due to be heard on August th and campaigners on animal welfare will be keeping a close eye on it. Therersquos also an awareness day on live exports this Sunday. The aim, in the end, is to stop live exports all together and the hope is that the Scottish Government will show some sense. What wersquore realising is it may take a judgment of the Court of Session to make that happen.Our columns are a  for our writers to express their opinions.

So both in my role as Commissioner and as a member of the public, Irsquove been considering how public authorities have adapted their approach to sharing information of all kinds since the impact of this pandemic began to be felt ndash and how they will do so in weeks and months ahead.Inevitably we all have questions about the decisions being made by our leaders and public services, and never more so than at a time when those decisions, sadly, may mean the dference between le and death. This is why it is so vital that Scotlandrsquos law ensures everyone has a right to seek information from public authorities, and ndash with only very few, limited exceptions ndash to receive it.For some public authorities, changes brought about by the current disruptions will make this challenging . However, not all will be impacted by the pandemic in the same way, and every authority must continue to respond to FOI requests promptly, and in any event within the  working day timeline.The Scottish Parliament has, however, acknowledged the challenges faced by authorities and has accepted that sometimes, even when responding promptly, it will not be possible to meet this timeline. The current emergency legislation therefore allows me, in certain circumstances relating to the pandemic, to decide that an authority has not breached the law evenit has failed to respond to a request within  working days. I have issued detailed guidance on the emergency changes to FOI law on my website, and will continue to enforce these provisions firmly and fairly.Crucially, FOI law also places a duty on public authorities to publish information about the work they do, the decisions they take and the services they provide ndash in a proactive way and not just when requested. This duty remains unchanged but is more important now than ever.Since we are all coming to accept that the disruption caused by the pandemic will continue for some time, I hope and expect that public authorities in Scotland will respond by adapting their ways of working, learning from this challenge, and updating their practices to ensure that people can easily access the information that matters to them ndash during this dficult time and beyond.By publishing key information proactively, clearly and speedily, authorities can both reduce the time they spend responding to requests for information later, and promote the transparent culture we all want and expect in our public services.The importance of this point was clearly highlighted by MSPs in the Scottish Parliamentrsquos Public Audit and Post-Legislative Scrutiny Committee last month, in their report on the current state of FOI law. Although the Committeersquos report was agreed before the outbreak of Covid- in Scotland, many of their recommendations highlight the real opportunities we have not only to maintain, but to improve, access to information for people in Scotland, and I look forward to helping them become a reality.Ultimately, we ndash citizens, public authorities and regulators ndash are in this together. In the face of all the disruption and uncertainty we are living through, we have a chance to change the way we understand and interact with one another about key decisions and services for the better.

We are rightly proud in the Northern Isles of having some of the highest standards of produce in the world. Farmers and consumers alike deserve peace of mind about fair standards and fair prices for the food we produce and eat.He continued: “I am astonished that the government has leapt directly from denying earlier this year that lower food standards would be permitted to defending this policy turn wholeheartedly. Undercutting farmers and crofters is not what was promised about the “brave new world” of future trade deals.“It is concerning that the government seems more interested in carrying water for Donald Trump and his #America First# mentality than in supporting our farmers. The government should be accountable to the people they represent, not the whims of US negotiators.”Speaking in the House earlier in the week, Mr Carmichael highlighted the potential impact to farmers and crofters in the Northern Isles: “I would like to hear what the Government’s response is to press reports today that the Government are set to open British markets to food products produced to lower US standards as part of the trade deal with Donald Trump. This was the rhetoric we were given by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster: he told us that there would never be chlorinated chicken on our plate.“Now, in fact, we hear that as a consequence of the so-called dual tarf process it is quite possible that we will see such products being imported to this country. In fact, we are told that the Secretary of State for International Trade is arguing that these tarfs should be reduced to zero over  years, giving farmers time to adjust to the new “normal”.“For the farmers and crofters in my constituency, it will be a hard reality for them to survive in. Because we are a long distance from the market, we have not gone for mass-produced food. We have sought to improve the quality of the products we have and put into market with a view to export. Tarfs on those export markets will be absolutely fatal to the agricultural interests of the highlands and islands.”Responding for the government, the Paymaster General, Penny Mordaunt MP, said: “I fully understand why he may be sceptical about trusting the government, but trust the people. They value animal welfare, we should trust the consumer and there are massive opportunities for our farmers for rest of world trade.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However, we are asking you, for now, to please stay within, or close to, your own local area. And don’t use public transport unless it is absolutely necessary.”The first steps out of lockdown could only involve “careful and cautious” changes, she said.In Orkney, this means that travel on public bus and inter-island ferry and air services will continue to be for essential reasons only during Phase One, with passenger numbers severely restricted as a result of and in line with social distancing requirements.Across Scotland it is assessed that social distancing will reduce transport capacity by  per cent –  per cent and this figure is very much in line with the assessment in Orkney for our ferries and local bus services.During Phase One, there will be no changes to the current timetables for local bus, ferry and inter-island air services.For Orkney Ferries, the aim is to help protect residents in the isles from the risk of infection – along with the crews who operate the service – and to ensure that the ferries can continue to run and deliver freight and other essential supplies.The Scottish Government’s new guidance, published on Tuesday , will help public transport operators and passengers prepare for the further lting of lockdown restrictions at a future date.Detailed information from the government on the newly announced Public Transport Guidance has been sent to the council. Careful consideration is being given to how this might apply locally when the move to Phase Two begins.The guidance does state that people should wear face coverings when using public transport and further information on the council’s expectations on this will be provided in due course.The government has acknowledged that there will be geographic challenges in implementing the guidance and that there can be no ‘one size fits all’ to the approach taken across Scotland.The government’s latest travel advice is available here: https:www.transport.gov.scot coronavirus-covid- transport-transition-plan advice-on-how-to-travel-safely copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The thriving guided tour business, accustomed to  per cent year-on-year growth, first saw international bookings collapse before a deluge of cancellations from domestic customers. Neil said: “It was emotionally devastating. We went from a growing and profitable business to zero revenue coming. “It was a week that felt like a year and I was in tears again and again.currently enlisted. The company also received £m from Barclays from the UK Government-backed Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme .“We have been able to retain our  staff in the UK through the furlough scheme. We would have been unable to pay them with zero revenue coming in. The CBILS has allowed us to cover our overheads including rent, rates and IT systems.”“Once we made a furlough claim the funds were released quickly and it is great news that it has been extended until October.”Neil said that Macs Adventure was well-positioned for the recovery in the travel market and that the Coronavirus had accelerated industry trends. He said: “It will take us between three to five years to rebuild the business however we are very well-placed to recover. “The market for impactful and active travel is growing.”Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers:Details of the support available to businesses across the UK can be found at www.gov.uk coronavirus business-supportcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

At the Sandwick Manse, he kept a daily record for  years, beginning in , and became a recognised expert on Scotland’s weather.After Clouston’s death, the station moved around Orkney but kept going right up until WWII. Magnus Spence ran it in Deerness for almost thirty years,  – . His son, Magnus Thorfinn Spence, was Chief Meteorologist for Bomber Command during WWII. With very neat symmetry, the story now moves to the other end of the world # to the South Orkney Islands. Base Orcadas is an Argentinian weather station but it was founded in  by the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition, led by William Spiers Bruce. His grandmother was Charity Isbister, whose father Caleb owned Ness Farm, Stromness. Spiers Bruce went to the Antarctic as a scientist on a whaling expedition in  and became fascinated by the polar regions. He went on expeditions to the Arctic and, when he couldn’t get there, he went to the top of Ben Nevis, which had snow cover for  days of the year. An Observatory had been built there in  by the Scottish Meteorological Society, to try to learn more about weather patterns. The first Superintendent was RTOmond, the son of Robert Omond from Kirkwall, who became President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and Mary Traill, daughter of Professor Thomas Stewart Traill, . Omond was involved with the Observatory right from its planning stages. Ill health forced him down from the summit after seven years, but he remained in overall charge until the Observatory closed in . William Spiers Bruce had applied to join Scott’s expedition to the Antarctic. When, despite being one of the most experienced Polar scientists in the country, his application was rejected, he raised the funds for an expedition supported by the Royal Scottish Geographical Society. The Scottish National Antarctic Expedition of - is not as famous as those of Scott and Shackleton but it has been described as one of the most cost-effective and carefully planned scientic expeditions of the age. As well as establishing the weather station, the expedition brought back a large number of botanical, biological, zoological and geological samples. The house built for the men and their instruments was called Omond House. As well as giving Spiers Bruce a lot of practical and scientic advice, Omond had given a very sizeable donation to the expedition.The Ben Nevis Observatory only lasted eighteen years and only had three observers so it is strange that there is still more Orcadian involvement. According to his entry in the Australian Dictionary of Biography, Charles Anderson, from Moa in Stenness, was the Superintendent there after he graduated in . He quickly realised he wanted to be somewhere warmer and went to work at the Australian Museum in Sydney in , eventually becoming its director.The full version of this article can be found on page  of this week’s edition of The Orcadian. A biography Charles Anderson is available on the #People# page of www.aboutorkney. Patricia Long is a local tour guide based in Stenness, with a particular interest in social and family history.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The minister has agreed to look at Mr McArthur’s suggestion and highlighted that the government is looking at a range of ways to offer support to farmers.Following the exchange, Mr McArthur said: “The COVID- outbreak has forced ious initiatives planned by SNH and the Orkney Greylag Goose Management group to be put on hold. As a result, local farmers have been faced with having to spend more time and resources trying to keep resident greylag geese numbers under control.“I know from seeing first-hand the impact that greylag geese can have on crops and farmland. Over recent years, as the resident Greylag population has increased, so too has the damage and the cost of trying to address the problem. “It would seem sensible, therefore, to use any funding earmarked for the earlier control measures to help reduce the financial burden on farmers having to take steps themselves. This could include contributing to the cost of cartridges, but there may be other options available.“I’m pleased that the minister responded positively to this suggestion and agree to explore the options for providing such support, as well as wider efforts to bring Orkney’s resident Greylag goose population down to more sustainable levels.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

If born in Delhi then you might be Hindi or Sikh.Kenyans are more likely to be Christian.In Scotland, your type of Christianity might also depend on location catholics and protestants coming from fairly well-defined geographical areas.Of course, culture is more than religion, but even for non-adherents and atheists, it is often a signicant part of the richness of the societies we live in.I was in Bali, Indonesia earlier this year during the festival of Galungan.The place was literally dripping with decorations.Ornate and huge ‘penjor’ lined the roads and adorned buildings, taller than telegraph poles and more prevalent, they were beautully twisted and plaited from palm fronds.Shrines and offerings were everywhere. It was vibrant, colourful and beautul. It was a religious festival, but totally embedded in the culture of the Balinese, in the way Christmas is in Scotland.Balinese people are among the friendliest I have come across in all my travels, a genuine and warmth in their demeanour.Balinese folk are brown in colour, because it is very sunny in Indonesia they have evolved to have more melanin, and therefore more protection against the sun.We don’t choose the colour of our skin, or the culture we are born into, but what we do with our lot is a product of our upbringing, our wider society experience and everything that has happened to us.Most of our behaviour is due to nurture not nature, and is down to choice.Our values and empathies lie in our reaction to our experience and learning from consequence. The problem stems in that much of that experience lies out with our control.If we are black, poor and have been persecuted by institutional society since birth, we might take to the streets.When pepper sprayed, or met with water canon, rubber bullet or tear gas, we might resort to throwing rocks, petrol bombs.Windows might be broken, we might loot.If our role model father figure was a gun toting white supremacist, we might believe ourselves to have a greater entitlement than those of a dferent colour.We would be wrong.These are extreme examples # rationalising and trying to understand the actions of others is fraught with generalisation and perhaps cliché.We can never know what makes a person act the way they do, and we can only imagine being in their shoes, and seeing through the lens of their eyes.What is as tragic as a police officer killing another human being in a slow, seemingly deliberate fashion, is that a society, a culture and its institution can produce someone capable and accepting of such an action.I hope the killer will be brought to justice, and that a grieving family can find peace and forgiveness, but more importantly can we heal the society that produces this behaviour.Most of the ills are due to poverty, deprivation, and the inequality of opportunity.Fear and ignorance is layered on top, with greed and entitlement. Power normally resides with the rich, who want to stay rich.The cry is that we are all the same underneath, black, white, brown yellow, and yet we are all dferent, unique, products of vastly dferent culture, geography, upbringing, beliefs and experience.We are both the same and both dferent, and this confusing contradiction should be embraced, celebrated and above all respected.Scotland is known for celebrating ersity, but it is more than the music, the festivals, the ceremonies and the food, it is the people and their attitudes and their experience we should celebrate.It may be sometime before visitors from other continents arrive back to the Highlands in any number, but our communities as hosts are in a perfect situation to embrace the cultures brought and above all respect both dferences and similarities.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1942-2020-Stalag-9C-No-1401Original.jpg","title":"shinty pipers to commemorate the heroes of st","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine June , was to become one of the most important dates in the history of their regiments.It was to become, arguably the equivalent of the battle of Festubert in World War I which had a colossal and catastrophic impact of shinty playing communities.Both battles are seared in the memory of many families still involved with the game.The contribution through piping towards the special commemoration which has been organised for next Tuesday is being organised by Shinty Memories Scotland, the project which uses archive material to help people with dementia or suffering from isolation and loneliness.Shinty Memories will also be telling some of the stories involving the period after the battle.Shinty Memories ambassador John MacKenzie said: “The name St Valery is right up there with all he battles which have had tragic consequences for many families who were, and still are, involved with shinty.“Some of our greatest players and iniduals were involved at St Valery.

course, it’s a good thing.Very often we tend to forget where we feel we belong, particularlywe have been ‘transplanted’ where, either through natural migration or simply not being allowed back to your own bed because you are perceived as a walking , potential germ time-bomb.Despite Gaina being willing to take the daily risk, and my being eternally grateful that she is Marvin Gaye was wrong.Wherever I lay myhat, it’s certainly not my home.I lived in the centre of Stornoway in a previous le.It was tolerable because the front door of the Royal Hotelwas the distance of a free-kick from just outside the penalty box away.Barring that, the Wee Co-op and the Trading Post provided hugely comforting ‘book ends’, sandwiched as I was, comfortably in between.When nary an eyebrow was raised when you ordered a can of Special Vat cider at  in the morning, paying with a handful of change where a p was undoubtedly king of the finds the determination of where my ‘home’ was largely depended on proximity to alcohol.Luckily things have changed.It doesn’t take much to calibrate where you truly belong.I dare say that for each and every one of us that calibration is measured dferently, using dferent tools and metrics.Each to their own.There are bound to be many for whom the lockdown has heightened their state of anxiety.Townies, I respectfully suggest, much more than others.Waking on Sunday, after a night burning not much rubber, to the noise of whatever it was that had driven herself indoors from her crocheting in the sun I could feel the sap rise.A terrace in the capital is no place when the sun shines brightly and the neighbours are Status Quo fans.The decision was immediate.It required just the two connected synapses to flicker briefly.“Pack what you need, we’re going to Point”.As she continued with the never-ending blanket in the warmth and safety of the Republic, I decided to head for the shore.Something I don’t do nearly often enough is walk through my own village, in my own time, grown increasingly comfortable in my own head.With a colander on the cranium, attached to many electrodes and a Sinclair ZX , a compass and a barometer handy I reckon my epicentre would be found somewhere between my front door, Shinigeadh, Loch an Duin and Allt Diobadal.Shinigeadh was picture perfect.The walk down to the geodha was spectacular.Even the sheep knew I wasn’t a tourist.I’d wax more lyrical, but I know you’re already jealous.‘Mata’ MacIver, in his wonderful monthly column, ‘My Portnaguran’ in our local magazinealludes to the importance of our local football team when it comes to our sense of community.Guess who were amongst the very first to respond and offer their services when the Covid crisis struck Along with the people you’d expectthey were the first to coordinate support to anyone in need.Never mind the locally elected representatives and the Community Council we were left standing whilst the people of the Roo did what decent folk do.By the time we caught up, deliveries and safety nets were already in place.It was happening all over these islands and the people who don’t require prompting to do the right thing and never stop to look for recognition or thanks.It’s not what they’re about or why they get involved.But can we take the time to recognise each and every single one of them next time we step outside to clap The whole weekend was confusing for many unable to restrain themselves following weeks of conflicting messages.There was, of course, theof golf and fishing as part of the easing of the lockdown but throw in Dominic Cummings, the huge sense of relief at ‘something’ positive happening, no new cases in the Western Isles for nearly six weeks plus spectacular weather, and you could feel the collective engines revving.We should have been thinking of going from neutral into first gear as part of a gradual process back to a semblance of normality .What we saw was akin to the starting grid of a Formula  race.The lights went from red to green and, with added Buckfast and MD , a little bit of mayhem ensued.It was, in hindsightentirely predictable.A scientist, rocket or otherwise, wasn’t required.Luckily, or unluckily, the weather has ed to normal and, after some warnings, people recognised that their actions were premature and inappropriate.This ‘thing’ isn’t over and we need to remain vigilant.Complacency is our biggest danger, still.Let’s get back to keeping it real.Truth be told, we couldn’t wait.After a ten week lay-off, it was never going to be pretty.Especially for those of us who might still tend to struggle having played ten rounds in ten days.Naturally I started with a par at the, stroke-index one, hugely troublesome, opening hole at Stornoway.I may only ever manage a handful of fours in a season at the ‘Castle’, so the huge joke was on me and playing partner, Alan ‘Biddley’ MacLeod.‘Bid’s’ tee shot had last been seen heading left towards the Woodlands Centre and I fully expected to follow suit.I managed the plumb centre of the trees on the right, but miraculously played some decent recovery golf, albeit only briefly.It wasn’t so much a case of ‘it’s downhill after this’, which it certainly was, more a case of ‘who cares, isn’t this wonderful ’.Much like halitosis, any golf is better than no golf at all.We kept score, briefly, before it all became a bit too much and we decided to enjoy ourselves.The course was full.The sun was shining.Genuinely it was hotter than it had been in Florida last October.‘Things’, generally couldn’t be better.We will, naturally, spend a couple of weeks ‘acclimatising’ before we plunge headlong into competitive golf proper.That night my legs and feet ached, my back required some WD, but a’ bhalaich, I was a happy bunny.I wasn’t alone.Who was keeping score anyway Colin MacRitchie’s playing partner on Saturday, that’s who.Whilst some of us require several layers of cobwebs to be removed before we can be considered ‘contenders’ the talented require nothing more than a robust practice swing.Starting with a bogey, , at the ‘Castle’, nobody could have predicted the explosives to follow.Yes it was just a ‘bounce’ round and yes, we were still only playing off the yellow tees: but that didn’t detract much from the incredulity with which his card was greeted.From the second hole he went birdie, birdie, birdie, birdie, eagle, birdieto be ‘out’ in a breath-taking, -under, .He started back with yet another brace of birdies before completely losing form and racking up ‘just’ seven straight pars.  #         # Going round anywhere, at any time, in  blows is a stunning achievement.It certainly posts a warning to the other serious contenders for the summer season and the ‘majors’ ahead, however truncated it they may be.The Scarista faithful, too, were busy finding themselves at the weekend.Nobody was too keen to blow anything resembling the remotest trumpet, regards any semi-official scoring but the sense I got was that greenkeeper James Dunne was possibly the man to keep a close eye on.He spent the weekend asking about the bounce and loft on wedges.“ or  degrees loft with - degree bounce ”, he queried.Billy Fraser, who actually does know what he was talking about, chipped in with what appeared to be sound, indeed polite, advice.‘Bounce is your friend’ Captain Kuna opined.Now there’s a man in touch with his inner Barbara Woodhouse.Having latterly abandoned the notion of flailing around with a driver, or any fairway woods, James has foundthat his scoring has dramatically improved.The ‘Essence of Harris’ Trophy this Saturday may well be his opportunity to demonstrate his new-found Karma.Benbecula threw themselves straight back into competitive action with their May Medal last Saturday. Donald MacKay won with a nett , two shots ahead of Dami Steele on .Both qualy for the end of season gold medal.On Tuesday they began the season-long Order of Merit with a Willie Monkwin. Dami continued his runner-up habit.Down at Askernish they’re still probably trying to get over the shock of my naming it as my favourite course on ‘Spors na Seachdain’.I’ve been lucky enough to have played some wonderful courses these past -odd years but the South Uist links still ‘does it’ for me every time.I even considered becoming a member this year, along with Stornoway and Harris before Covid took a hold.Too far Maybe I should approach the Tiumpan Head grazings committee.What a course that would make.You’d never get me out of Point.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rosswa-logo.jpg","title":"ross shire skye and lochalsh womens aid are here for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineRoss-shire Skye and Lochalsh Women’s Aid provides services to women, children, and young people in the Ross-shire, Skye, and Lochalsh areas that are experiencing, or have experienced, the effects of domestic abuse.

Every day we put them in a dferent themed pose except for Sundays when we always do church, Sunday school and creches, and then on Saturdays the theme will be sport of one kind or another.Now we are in the winding down stage and the bears will be going into hibernation. We have decided to repeat our top ten favourites including Northern Ireland Bake Off and Wimbledon.When the Belfastfirst covered what the couple were doing - the idea initially was to put a smile on the faces on people walking past their home, but now Mr Corrin said he and his we have benefited so much as well.Mr Corrin continued: My we loves teddy bears and I always got her a Harrods bear as part of her Christmas present when I used to go back and forward to London on business, so now she has  and around  dferent bears in total. We have been so fortunate with the weather but I have put the gazebo up in case it rains because these bears are very precious.My we is shielding and because she is I am too, so we haven#t been beyond our garden gate in ten weeks. We started this because we wanted to put a smile on people#s faces. As the weeks have passed we have heard more and more about the effects being in lockdown is having on people#s mental health and even our Minister said how beneficial this has been for everyone, he said.It has been of great benefit to us too because we have enjoyed seeing people saying hello from the other side of the gate and of course knowing we have raised so much for Marie Curie has been the icing on the cake.Belfast Most ReadPubs, restaurants and shops in Northern Ireland can open on July  as coronavirus lockdown rules to be eased to save economyLiam Neeson mourns death of #much adored# mother KittyCouncil urged to rename Newry street called after nationalist who backed slave tradeTributes to Shane Lappin who died in accident while building new home in Co ArmaghCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No new Covid- deaths in last  hours,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In Mitchel#s place of birth in Dungiven, Co Londonderry, a play park also displays his name and several GAA clubs around Ireland have honoured his memory in their names.But as the Black Lives Matter campaign takes hold across the world following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, a darker side to a giant of Irish history has led to calls for tributes to the activist, author and political journalist to be removed.Now an online petition has been set up by a former Newry man, who is hoping to change his council#s opinion on celebrating his name.I grew up in Newry. I walked through John Mitchel Place every day on my way to school, said Padraig Mac Cionnaith , now living in Dunmurry.I#m not a historian and I never thought any more about the name and why there was a statue. No-one ever remarked on it. It was through chance that I found out about his beliefs and what he stood for in America in the s.This was a man who was a rebel with two causes. How can we be comfortable with remembering one while conveniently sweeping the other under the carpet Padraig will now be writing to all  councillors in Newry and Mourne calling for the street to be renamed. I don#t want this to be a green and orange political issue, that#s why I#ll be contacting every councillor, from every party, he said. When Newry is the home town to sporting legends like Pat Jennings, would it not be a better idea to honour those rather than someone who was a great advocate of slavery in the United States, no matter what his involvement in Irish nationalism was  It#s particularly relevant now with what has been happening in America. We have people standing up for rights through the Black Lives Matter campaign.People are taking to the streets, voicing their opposition in their thousands here in Northern Ireland. Yet in Newry, and where across Ireland, we are lauding one of the great supporters of slavery.In Bristol, Edward Colston#s bronze memorial, situated on Colston Avenue in the city centre, was built to honour one of the most virtuous and wise sons of Bristol. But in recent years, campaigners have expressed anger at the commemoration of a figure prominently involved in Britain#s slave-trade past, and yesterday, it was toppled.Now, Mitchel, who was born in and is often memorialised as a hero in the US and Ireland, could suffer a similar fate. A statue to Mitchel was erected in Newry#s John Mitchel Place, an extension of Newry#s main street, Hill Street.The Presbyterian was a giant of the Young Ireland movement. The British feared his influence and in a show trial convicted him of sedition and treason. Transported to Tasmania, he escaped from the penal colony in  and found his way to America.He was also one of the most extreme pro-slavery advocates of the American Civil War, calling blacks an innately inferior people and claiming that he wanted to make the people of the US proud of slavery as a national institution. He often expressed the view that slavery was inherently moral and good in itself.The petition is available at change.org by searching Rename John Mitchel Place  Belfast   Most ReadPubs, restaurants and shops in Northern Ireland can open on July  as coronavirus lockdown rules to be eased to save economyLiam Neeson mourns death of #much adored# mother KittyCouncil urged to rename Newry street called after nationalist who backed slave tradeTributes to Shane Lappin who died in accident while building new home in Co ArmaghCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No new Covid- deaths in last  hours,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

to build stamina rather than speed in the absence of race meetings.She said: “I have been training on trails and the road and the beach so it has been great to get back to the track.”The athlete was recovering from injury so the coronavirus restrictions actually gave her extra time to recuperate without worrying about missing events.She said her fellow competitors in countries like Australia had been able toto training much earlier and swimmers in Northern Ireland still faced dficulties – but added it was good to be back.Being at home more meant being closer to the fridge, but she said she

Aisling Quinn and Danielle Harkin from Carndonagh, both completed the Adult Learning University Access Diploma in Combined Studies at NWRC, which provides students who have been out of education, a pathway to Higher Education and University study. Aisling now works as a nurse at Buncrana Community Hospital, while younger sister Danielle is working overseas as a Cath Lab nurse in Australia. NWRC is currently accepting applications for the new college semester in September , and both sisters, who went on to study Nursing Degrees at the University of Ulster at Magee, said it was the perfect stepping stone to help themto education after a gap of several years, and go on to their dream careers. googletag.cmd.push Mum of three Aisling, who now lives in Malin, said she always wanted to be a nurse. She explained: “After school I did not feel ready to start my nursing journey and went on to do a pre-nursing course, but I always knew I wouldone day. As a mature student I researched courses to help me gain entry, and the Access Diploma in Combined Studies in NWRC kept popping up. After not studying for  years it was the perfect course to get me back into learning mode and prepare me for the Degree course I wished to pursue. googletag.cmd.push “The lecturers were very hands-on, helping in every way they could to ensure you performed to the best of your ability. The constructive feedback from peers and lecturers was particularly helpful. The course content allowed me to develop new skills and encouraged me to become more confident in myself academically. “Before completing the course I enrolled in the BSc Hons Nursing degree. One of the lecturers helped me through this process and ensured all relevant information was included in my application before being sent. I passed the interview and commenced the course in . In December  I graduated with a ’ honours degree, said Aisling. Aisling worked in Altnagelvin Hospital but last year moved closer to home and got a post in Buncrana Community Hospital. She added: I am thankful for the Diploma as it enabled me to pursue a career that I love. I would highly recommend this course to anyone seeking to further their education whatever path they are planning to take.” Little sister Danielle, who completed the Access Course a year before Aisling, is now working in Australia as a nurse. Danielle said: I decided to do the course as I thought it would be the perfect stepping stone to get into the nursing degree I desired. I did not get enough points from my Leaving Certicate so this was another path available that enabled me access. “The course was very good and I would highly recommend to others looking to pursue their career in Nursing or further their education in any way.

Kerry keeper Shane Ryan managed to claw Paddy Smalls speculative shot from above the bar, before toe-poking to the safety of Stephen OBrien. The Kenmare man offloaded to David Moran, who in turn thumped a long ball down the Cusack Stand sideline. When defender Davy Byrne lost the flight of the ball, Tommy Walsh didnt need a second invitation. Killian Spillane burst purposefully through the middle. Walsh, only on the pitch two minutes, gave him the ball. Dublin had enough bodies to deal with it, but Spillane had other ideas. Fresh and fearless. With one feint of the shoulders, he was onto his left foot before burying to the net. Stephen Cluxton shouldve done better, but the Kerry mans low bolt unleashed a bottled emotion from five years of waiting. googletag.cmd.push In , he was the fulcrum of Jack OConnors attack as Kerry won a first minor All-Ireland in two decades. With - to his name and a natural ability to kick off both feet, he lit up that summers championship. In most other counties, he wouldve been straight into the senior team the following season. This was the year of the senior and double. How can we ever forget Kieran Donaghys retort at Joe Brollys statement of Kerrys demise. His family tradition would suggest that he was born to play for Kerry, but Spillane – son of four-time winner Tom - was going to have to wait. googletag.cmd.push Stephen OBrien, Johnny Buckley, Donnchadh Walsh, Paul Geaney, Donaghy and James ODonoghue held the senior jerseys. Darren OSullivan, Kieran OLeary, Declan OSullivan and Barry John Keane were all on the bench. When the squad was announced for the  Super s game with Donegal, Spillane was listed at number , but started the game. Peter Keanes secret weapon notched three points in a - apiece blockbuster. He had arrived and his All-Ireland final goal announced him as a Kerry star of the future. A marked man. On the Ring of Kerry, you will pass through Templenoe. Apart from the sign, you wont even know youve passed through it until you reach the nearby Kenmare. The clubs pitch, which produced Tom, Mick and Pat Spillane, hugs the bay. They supplied four players to the Kingdom squad for last years All-Ireland final - Gavin Crowley, Tadhg Morley, brothers Adrian and Killian Spillane. Almost a tenth of their , from a club that won an All-Ireland junior title. ANOTHER PATH In years between being a minor winner and Eacuteamonn Fitzmaurice handing him a senior league debut, in , Killian played on the Kerry junior team. Jason Foley and Graham OSullivan, mainstays of the current defence, did the same. Conor Cox, now playing with Roscommon, used the junior grade as a step ladder to the next level of his career. It has a ruling that enforces a county to change their entire team after winning it, yet Kerry have still won it five times in a row. Its not the most prestigious title in the world, but its football and a shop window. The fact that Kerry are getting such a pull from the bottom rung, gives them such an advantage. Declan OSullivan hails from Dromoid Pearses. In Tyrone, you have Rock supplying Kieran Gourley when Tyrone were in their pomp. Galway goalkeeper and An Spideal man Maghnus Breatnach has played for the juniors, a grade that helped elevate his clubmate Antaine Oacute Laoiacute to Paacutedraic Joyces attention. Mayos Darren Coen was the same. Derry are nowhere close to getting this type of . In the last  seasons,  players have played league or championship. From John Brennans Ulster final season of  to the present day, none come from junior clubs. Goalkeeper Oran Hartin had two appearances and played junior championship for Limavady, but of the  seasons, they have played at intermediate level for six of them. Of the , only  hail from intermediate clubs. For the purposes of the study, the club is graded on the number of years playing at championship level in the last decade. It ranks Greenlough and Newbridge as senior, with Foreglen at intermediate. Enda Lynnhas represented Derry most during the window. Oisin Duffy, Niall Keenan and Neil Forester are the only intermediate players to exceed  outings, with Marty Donaghy taking his tally to  in the  qualier exit to Longford. In terms of championship action, nobody outside of the senior grade has played more than  times, though Niall Keenan is likely to be the first. A debate for another day is the lack of city players that have made the breakthrough. The total sits at three. Neil Forester and Eoghan Concannon, neither of whom are on Rory Gallaghers senior squad, are two. Ben McCarron is the third. Of around  boys in a year group at St Columbs, I remember Eamonn Burns saying that only around  had the basic skills by the time they entered the gates in first year. Some dont have clubs at all. Until that changes, it is dficult to see the city really giving Derry the support it needs to progress as a county. And there are people promoting Gaelic games in the city, who are as passionate as anywhere  in Ireland. There just arent enough. When I think of the joy in the face of Neil Forester after winning games with Derry minors and the sheer dejection after Castledawson beat Steelstown in the  intermediate final. Real emotion. If only there were more like him to drive the GAA message in the city. Back to the topic in question, getting players from minor to senior. The Derry conundrum. Rather than going around in circles, why not enter a team in the All-Ireland junior championship  Since there are no Ulster teams involved, it would take travel and money. And it would take time. Derry have been at the top of the charts in recent years, in terms of funding from Croke Park. Maybe it is time to filter some of that cash into the area that is failing most and leave underageto clubs and schools, who are continually churning out players. From chatting to a few people from non senior clubs, there could be an appetite for it. But it would need to be done properly. Not a half-arsed job. As a starting point, draw up a football development committee. Call a meeting, for all the captains and chairmen of Derrys intermediate and junior clubs and put out the feelers. Ask the hard questions. Why have players been overlooked  Leave it open to players who either have not made the U , or are too old for it. Take a look at the club manager circuit and approach someone to take it on. It wouldnt take up that much time, as players need to have access to their club. They have the first draw on the players after all. Essentially, it is a development squad for the seniors. What would it have not done for a Lee Moore, who was one of the best county minors in Ireland for two seasons  He wasnt ready to displace Paddy Bradley. Who was, Lee had all the qualities to have been his successor. A Paudie ONeill needs his class properly massaged into a county senior player. It is a long shot and it will be hard to sell. There will be plenty of obstacles. But isnt there always, in all walks of le. If it was easy, it would have been done already. In the last ten years, Neil Forester, Niall Keenan, Oisin Duffy, Eoghan Concannon, Marty Donaghy and Bliain Gormley are the six intermediate players, from the  who have worn an Oakleaf championship jersey, to have played in the championship for Derry from outside the senior ranks. Its not enough. Kerrys Shane Ryan and Killian Spillane dont play for senior clubs. They were county minors in , and five years later – in their senior debut season – they were on the front line, battling for Sam. ALSO READ - Be careful what you wish for. More...

The plan was to bring entertainment to the war weary inhabitants of the town.This meeting would lead to the formation of St Patrickrsquos Operatic and Pantomime Society and their first production was Phyllis, the Farmerrsquos Daughter mdash a title that has dated somewhat.The public responded by volunteering as actors, stage hands, working with costumes and music.Principals and chorus rehearsed separately. Only one week before opening night did they merge, coming together for the first time on the stage of St Patrickrsquos Hall.It was advertised as lsquoA Feast of Music, Song and Dancersquo boasting  voices. Rehearsal took place in the McLean home, the cast rehearsed upstairs, while machinists and costumiers worked downstairs.Phyllis, the Farmerrsquos Daughter was performed on Sunday, May , and Monday, May , .It proved successful enough to be followed in  by other productions such as Tangles, The Enchanted Rose and Quest of Olwen.The performances, in the absence of film footage and photographs, appear to be lost in the haze of time.Tangles, described as a grand musical comedy, was performed in St Patrickrsquos Hall on Monday, June , the night before the Normandy Landings. The performance was in aid of the Down County Infirmary.The programme included cast and production notes. The actors, credited as lsquoMortalsrsquo included Michael Tomelty as Lollipop, Sally King as Princess Pansy, Lillian Lundy as Dame Mouldy, Leslie Rice as Lord Humbug and Master Michael Rea as the Inn Keeperrsquos Son. lsquoImmortalsrsquo included Peggy Halloran as Titania, Maura Blaney as Nona and Mary Gilmore as lsquoCinderellarsquo.Also included was an array of guardsmen, a chorus of fairies, village chorus, court dancers, innkeeper chorus, fairy partners, bunnies and a chorus of gnomes, who included Maureen Dorrian, Annie Murphy and June Doyle. In all, the cast numbered .The scenic artist was Mr James Maguire and the costume designer was Mrs OrsquoKelly. In charge of actors make-up were Mrs Maguire, Kathleen Branf and Mrs Gilmore.But, what was the story  With appearances from gnomes and Cinderella it may have had a little to do with fairyland.Is there anyone out there who remembers  At this distance, it is just a forgotten show, one of many that enter-tained people at a most dficult time in history.Around Lecale and where, there were a number of amateur dramatic companies, many more than today, who performed many shows. Here are but a sample.Old King Cole by May King, with nine scenes and a chorus of , was a three-hour show, staged in St Patrickrsquos Hall, Downpatrick, at pm on Sunday, February , .Reserved tickets were on sale from Mr Breen, Mr Fox and Mr Doris.Ballykilbeg Dramatic Society gave the public a production of Paul Twyning by George Shiels on Sunday, March , and Tuesday, March , , with a repeat performance in St Patrickrsquos Hall, Downpatrick, the following Sunday.Kilclief Parish Amateur Dramatic Club staged Shielsrsquo new comedy, The Fort Field, in St Malachyrsquos Hall in the village on Sunday, May , . They also performed it in the Stella Maris Hall in Strangford the following Friday.Killyleagh Dramatic Society presented St John Ervinersquos lsquoBoydrsquos Shop at the Belfast Dramatic Festival during the first week of September , having staged it during the late summer of that year in Strangford.On the night of Sunday, November , , you could treat yourself to Stars over Ballynoe, an all-star iety concert in St Patrickrsquos Parochial Hall, Ballynoe, with Alister Dick, the famous Irish tenor, Alfie Donnelly, Irelandrsquos funniest comedian, the Legamaddy Dancers and the Portaferry Hawaiian Band.

Hopefully, therersquos more to come, he said.Joersquos latest work is QUINN - No Place to Hide, a standalone follow-up to a successful launch of the first in the series. The title is dedicated to his great grandfather, Sam Quinn, a man Joe admired for the way in which he dealt with the harshness of le in Downpatrick at the turn of the twentieth century.ldquoHe worked -hour shts, six days a week, as a yard foreman at the Rearsquos bottling plant in Market Street, Downpatrick. It was backbreaking work for which he earned a pittance to feed a large family. He never complained, never took a holiday, and never ventured outside the confines of the town. He lived through two world wars, the creation of the Irish Republic, and countless other momentous times, yet he kept his head down and simply got on with his own le.Joe is quick to point out that the character in his latest book is nothing like his ancestor. ldquoAll Irsquove taken is his name. My version of Quinn is that of an international assassin who leaves Downpatrick to join the Irish Rangers and later becomes a gun for hire in America. Talk about two dferent worlds! Perhaps though, therersquos a bit of parallel in that I transferred old Sam Quinnrsquos stoicism and relentless nature into a make-believe cut-out who lives his le by those very ideals.With a -year background in journalism, it was hardly surprising that Joe wanted to keep writing when he switched careers in  to head up Down Business Centre, a support enterprise agency to help promote start-up businesses.He said: ldquoI loved the interaction with local entrepreneurs, but the writing bug doesnrsquot go away. I had always an idea for a book and couldnrsquot stop scratching the itch. After a few years, I decided to put it into action.That first book mdash SOMEONE HAS TO PAY mdash was a product of the Northern Ireland Troubles. It is set in the unlikely surroundings of Bishopscourt, a former RAF base just outside Downpatrick, and features a British government elite squad assembled under the relative anonymity of the old complex for the purposes of waging a final shoot-to-kill war against the IRA.Joersquos own assessment of the story brings a wry smile. ldquoItrsquos a far-fetched idea, isnrsquot it  It couldnrsquot have happened, could it  Thatrsquos the essence of the storyteller and I guess itrsquos why I love doing it.A recurring theme in Joersquos books is that he likes toin a mention of his hometown whenever possible. Yoursquoll find Downpatrick cropping up a lot in background narratives, or as the setting for a few hair-raising episodes that attempt to weave their way into the history and fabric of the area.ldquoItrsquos just something I like to do. Irsquom a Downpatrick man and I have the urge to shout about it when the chance arises. Wersquove a lot going for us in this area and it can only do good to let the world know wersquore here.One of his other books SPENT FORCE, which was a crime thriller set in the West of Ireland and featured a fading Garda detective, attracted praise from two signicant sources. One was Ken Bruen, the international bestselling author of the Jack Taylor Irish crime series, who wrote: ldquoSometimes a book comes along that you instantly know......damn, I am now going to have to read this all over again for the sheer joy of the narrative. It means that I will have to swear off other books for a time as very few can provide the utter joy and delight of Joe McCoubreyrsquos superb novel.Another unexpected source was a serving Garda sergeant who posted a glowing review on the Amazon . ldquoA top-class novel which deserves high praise. I am from Irish law enforcement and this novel is as close to a real-le investigation as you can get. Gripping from start to finish, totally believable characters, strong storyline, Highly Recommended.Joe admits he was floored by the feedback. ldquoOn the one hand there was an endorsement by perhaps Irelandrsquos foremost crime thriller author, while on the other there was vindication from a policeman that the research and effort to get things right had paid off. Itrsquos what any author craves, and itrsquos what makes you want to get back over the keyboard and start into the next adventure.That next adventure is taking Joe back to the West of Ireland to team up again with his favourite Garda detective. The sequel is provisionally titled FORCE OF NATURE which delves into the murky world of a serial killer. Not surprisingly, Downpatrick features heavily again.ldquoYes, the killerrsquos first three victims are young girls from Downpatrick. The story will move from here to Westport and back again. Irsquom still not sure how it will end, and thatrsquos as much an appeal to me as it is to the reader.Joe explains that hersquos not a dedicated story plotter. ldquoI use a broad brush. I get an idea and just run with it. I donrsquot like to be confined to structure from start to finish, with the result that Irsquom not quite sure where Irsquom going from one chapter to another. I think of it as being spontaneous, which means I usually go off on tangents that keeps things fresh and moving along. Itrsquos a seat-of-the-pants alternative to being a plotter.Joe publishes all his books under his own publishing house, Inishfree Communications, which also offers support to local writers. To date, he has helped eight others to complete their author journey ndash between them they have published more than  titles. He provides proofing, formatting, and design services, including suggestions on the most effective covers for inidual books.ldquoItrsquos a big part of what I do these days, says Joe. ldquoThere are lots of budding writers and independent authors out there who just need a bit of extra help and encouragement to bring their work in front of the masses. I get as much of a kick out of seeing these books go on sale as I do from my own works.Joe McCoubreyrsquos books are available as paperbacks or eBooks on the Amazon and Barnes  Noble s..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd June 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Call for hedge removal after near miss  ","story":"AN overgrown hedge close to a BT exchange in Killyleagh is being blamed for a near miss involving a pedestrian and a bus last week.A woman who was forced to step on to the main road to avoid the hedge was almost struck by the vehicle as it passed, leaving both her and the driver shaken.BT has confirmed that it plans to cut the hedge this week, but local councillor Billy Walker said the telecoms giant must go further and remove it completely.He said there was a wall behind the hedge, suggesting that once the hedge is removed, BT would only have to build a small fence on top of it to secure its base.ldquoThe overgrown hedge has been an issue for many years and there have been countless near misses involving people who have had to step off the footpath to pass, including mums with prams. What happened last Friday is the final straw as far as I am concerned, declared Cllr Walker.ldquoThe only sensible solution is to remove the hedge in its entirety. To do so would not cost a lot of money, but would save lives as at this time of year as people would not have to walk on a busy main road to pass.Cllr Walker says he has raised the issue with the telecoms company over the years, but was told the hedge could not be cut back as it was the nesting season.ldquoMy biggest fear has always been that someone could end up getting killed or seriously injured at this part of Killyleagh. While I am thankful the woman who stepped off the footpath last Friday was not seriously injured, this must be the last incident of this kind, said Cllr Walker.ldquoI am appealing to BT to do the decent thing and finally remove the hedge. We have been fortunate up until now no one has been injured, but I shudder to think what could happen at this location.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThis situation is a major accident waiting to happen, but it can be avoided by simply removing a hedge. It is s no brainer and I hope BT will agree to my request.A BT spokesperson said the organisation was sorry to learn of the distress that the hedge may have caused and would be in contact with Cllr Walker directly.ldquoThe hedge is scheduled to be trimmed back this week.

Some people have looked at Everest and thought climbing it is necessary. Others call those people crazy.Everesting is described as ldquofiendishly simple, yet brutally hard. Ride hill repeats on any hill anywhere in the world mdash or on Zwt, the virtual cycling simulator mdash in a single activity until you climb the equivalent height of Mount Everest.The concept was created by Hells , who also control the induction into the Everesting Hall of Fame. Website Everesting.cc contains the rules to follow.Well, call me crazy, but I did it. No, I didnrsquot fly to Nepal and climb the actual mountain. Irsquom not a former pro athlete or extraordinarily gted human, nor am I an adventure adrenaline junkie looking for a fix. Irsquom just a  something mdash  to be precise mdash son of God who has a family, a job, a dog, a bicycle, and I landed myself in the Everesting Hall of Fame. And you can too.I decided to use the challenge to help raise funds for mental health organisations Aware and Ballynahinch Counselling Service, or The Hub, as itrsquos known locally. My initial target was pound but I was astounded and humbled by the generosity of people. In the end donations totalled pound,.I chose to start at am so I could have family support at the finish. Despite the early start I was joined by my we, Jennie, and through the day she was a great support, bringing me fresh drinks and relaying messages of support.I turned on my favourite music playlist and hit the hill with a measured effort that I thought I could sustain for hours. I planned a bidon of sports drink for each ascent, as well as -g carbs per hour. Real foods early in the ride and gels and sugary drinks for later in the ride.The first three or four ascents felt strangely comfortable, averaging  minutes up each time. I was almost an hour ahead of my estimated -hour schedule by midday. I later noticed some friends,, who were tracking my progress, were saying how strong I was riding and hoped that I wouldnrsquot pay for it later.They were right! Ascents six and seven were so tough, even to the point where I felt physically ill, and my times were now over  minutes per climb.vEveresters add the tag lsquovEverestingrsquo to their Zwt profile name which means anyone on the course that sees it knows you are vEveresting and many will ride with you, congratulate you, give you a thumbs up, or just encourage you to keep going.These wonderful sherpas made it a much more enjoyable experience, especially during the sixth and seventh ascents when it was dficult to want to keep riding and my butt was telling me that I was crazy to push on.Despite wanting to reach the finish as soon as possible, I had to listen to my body, and so I stopped for some food and a bit of a rest. Another quick shower, kit change and application of chamois cream, and I was ready to continue.I was joined online this time by good friends Nathan Mullan and Stephen Hanna, both from Dromara Cycling Club, and Sam Carmichael and Nigel Bradley, from my old club, Northwest CC. Seeing them there gave me a real boost and that combined with knowing I had the end in sight really spurred me on to the finish.The final  metres of climbing were the best - I was getting messages of encouragement from Zwters from places as far away as Germany, USA and Colombia. I finished shortly after pm, over  hours after I first leapt into the saddle and boy did I sleep well that night.So to finish, Irsquod like to say a huge thanks to everyone for their support, to those who donated in such hard times mdash Irsquom so grateful and Irsquom hopeful we will make le that little bit easier for others.I havenrsquot put any thought into the next challenge mdash on Sunday I said never again mdash but the beauty of cycling is therersquos always the next time.

Thatrsquos something our whole extended family embraces.ldquoItrsquos going to be bittersweet but we are happy for Mary and the lovely couple who are adopting her. Itrsquos good to know that she will be going to her forever home and will have a lovely little le. Thatrsquos always the ultimate aim for a child, particularly a younger child.ldquoHowever, one of the challenges is trying to teach her about adoption. How do you teach a three year-old that she will be leaving us and going to a forever family  We had to be creative and came up with the idea about the Christmas elf. Like many houses, we had Bauble the elf at Christmas, who was then lsquoadoptedrsquo by Mary and now lives with us all year round and is part of our family. We even made an adoption certicate to show her it was real.ldquoWhile Covid- has put a hold on this for now, we still have to prepare both Mary and ourselves, as it will be hard to say goodbye. But, as our daughter keeps saying, itrsquos part of foster care and what is right for Mary.ldquoEveryone has been writing their goodbye letters to her. We have prepared a book about her time with us and videos so that she wonrsquot have any gaps when shersquos looking back on her le.The Dicksons have been fostering since  and have looked after eight children so far, ranging in age from one to eight. They do respite fostering ndash temporary childcare for another fosterer or family ndash and short-term foster care.Itrsquos something that the couple have wanted to do for a long time.ldquoI wanted to foster for as long as in my early twenties and my husband felt the same, said  year-old Tanya. ldquoWe both came from family backgrounds where close relatives were in the caring professions.ldquoWe were very united in knowing that we would foster one day, even from the day we were married. However, when our daughter Hannah came along, we wanted her to be part of it, obviously, and to wait until the time that we were sure she understood the impact of it.ldquoWe waited until she was about  before we contacted the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust. Thatrsquos where our journey started, and we havenrsquot looked back once. The Trust has been with us every step of the way. The only regret we have had about fostering is not doing it sooner.The Dicksons have also been supported by their nearest and dearest in doing something that many other people consider doing.ldquoWe were lucky that our families were always on board with us regarding our fostering, Tanya said. Our employers have been amazing, our church family and even the village family of Crossgar. Everyone has really embraced our fostering journey.After making contact with the Trust Tanya, who works at Kilmood Early Years Playgroup, said that after a period of assessment and training they began to foster six months later.ldquoI think the assessment can put people off, but I believe itrsquos an invaluable tool as you come out of it knowing yourself better, she explained. You know your own personal qualities better and your skill base.ldquoItrsquos also essential as it helps the Trust match children with dferent needs with dferent foster carers. The only thing we stipulated is that any child we cared for would be at least two years younger than Hannah as we wanted her to be the eldest child in the house.Hannah, who is a student of Saintfield High School, has been integral to the couplersquos success as foster parents and has relished her role as lsquobig sisterrsquo.Mrs Dickson said: ldquoHannah has been so great with the children. With Hannah maturing, she is showing her experience of fostering in a very positive and beautul way by showing empathy to others.ldquoThatrsquos something she would never have experienced had we not fostered and she feels more grateful for her family le. She wants to be a nurse and I can see that great caring spirit being fostered in her care of Mary. Itrsquos been so rewarding and has changed us completely for the better.Unlike many first-time parents, Tanya said foster parents always have help and support available.She said: ldquoEvery child that comes through our door is dferent and you adapt accordingly for whatever that child needs. We have the support of a link worker, who has had a lot of training. Yoursquore never on your own.ldquoWe have learnt to take things at a childrsquos pace. Some children who have been looked after before are used to being more independent and self-sufficient.

Republicans are already planning a memorial on council property in Castlewellan and it is believed that loyalists in Ballynahinch may erect a memorial to dead UVF terrorists on council land at Langley Road.KILLYLEAGH ndash A new community forum, to represent the interests of a wide range of groups in the Killyleagh area, is to be set up.The umbrella organisation will represent what has been described as the ldquoimpressive level of community activity in the area.The idea to create the new group was floated at last weekrsquos annual meeting of the Killyleagh, Shrigley and District Town Committee by secretary Peter Bryson.He said the new group is vital to enable better communication and planning and help with the compilation of joint funding applications to a range of funders.He said the creation of the new group could provide the perfect  on which to develop partnerships of shared interest in the Killyleagh area.SAINTFIELD mdash As the controversy over the dangers of mobile telephone equipment continues, Saintfield residents have found themselves at the centre of the most recent debate.Parents and councillors met in the local library last week to discuss their fears of two telecommunications masts at Comber Road, which they believe are casting a shadow over the local high school.The public meeting was called by mother-of-three Laura Bill in the wake of the independent Stewart report which advises parents not to allow their children to use mobile phones, and pointed to children as being most likely to be affected by possible health risks.Leukaemia is one illness which reports have suggested could be caused, or aggravated by, radiation from mobile phone masts.One woman told Thursdayrsquos meeting that a pocket of seven children under  years of age suffer from childhood leukaemia in the Saintfield area, leading to parental fears that this could be aggravated by the existence of the masts.BALLYGOWAN mdash A shooting incident in Ballygowan during the early hours of Monday is being linked to a paramilitary feud.The house at Comber Road was sprayed with automatic gunfire by four men who smashed a number of windows. One of the weapons police believe was used in the attack was an AK  assault rle.No one was injured during the incident which is being linked to an ongoing feud between the LVF and UVF.A police spokesman confirmed yesterday the gunment made off in a white-coloured Ford Mondeo car which had a taxi sign on the roof.The vehicle drove off along the Comber Road in the village and into Comber where it was abandoned and set on fire at the rear of the Leisure Centre.Detectives investigating the incident have issued an appeal for information and want to hear from anyone who may have seen people acting suspiciously in the vicinity of the house at Ballygowan to contact them.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Members of Edengrove Presbyterian Church in Ballynahinch have said farewell to the Rev Trevor Steele, who is taking up a new appointment in Ohio.Last Sunday morning, Mr Steele and his family were presented with a number of gts by the congregation to thank them for their service and contribution to the le of the church.Along with his we Carol and children Andrew and Joanna, Mr Steele is moving to the United States after accepted a call to McCord Road Congregational Church in Toledo where he begins his ministry next month.Mr Steele has been in Ballynahinch for the past five years after accepting a call to join the congregation at Edengrove while he was assistant minister at Carrickfergus Presbyterian Church.GAA mdash Peter McGrathrsquos job as Down football manager is safe, for the time being.

adjacent empty buildings and a Newry, Mourne and Down Council-owned car park met to discuss a new brochure which has been designed for the near two acre site.While it was suggested that the coronavirus pandemic is likely to delay the redevelopment of the huge site, traders and politicians are keen to see work starting on the eagerly-awaited economic regeneration of this historic part of the town.The local council and the Department for Communities are spearheading an ambitious regeneration project with the new brochure mdash understood to be still in draft form ndash designed to provide potential developers and other interested parties with an overview of the sitersquospotential and secure expressions of interest.A number of Irish Street businesses have already invested in upgrading their respective shop fronts while the former police base was recently given a fresh coat of paint as part of a revitalisation scheme.The development site stretches as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue and is also adjacent to the Irish Street car park, with council officials looking to make the brochure available to the pubic virtually.Described as a strategic and prominent location in the heart of Downpatrick, senior council officials, politicians and members of the business community are excited at the Irish Street sitersquos development potential.While the imposing former police station enjoys protected status and cannot be razed to the ground, it is hoped that potential developers will be able to come with an imaginative plan for the building.It has been identied as a development opportunity site in the Down Area Plan, with the area to the front included in Downpatrickrsquos conservation area.While it has been suggested that housing could form part of any redevelopment proposal, the building has been touted as a potential base for offices.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities are keen to revitalise Irish Street and hope its redevelopment will act as a catalyst for the wider economic and social regeneration of the town.They are keen to retain Irish Streetrsquos uniqueness where residents and traders live and work alongside each other and ensure that there is adequate parking. There have already been suggestions that an underground parking facility at the current Irish Street car park would allow retail units to be built on top.Work was recently completed on a protracted public realm scheme in Irish Street and it is hoped that the redevelopment of the former police base will complement this project, which resulted in the provision of new granite paving, street furniture and lighting.Downpatrick councillors are keen to see the redevelopment proposal increase the number of shoppers to the town to provide a boost for existing traders who have been at the heart of the townrsquos economy for many years.It is also hoped to regenerate the town centrersquos night time economy with politicians eager for the Irish Street scheme to create a number of much-needed new jobs.Earlier this year, a number of Downpatrick councillors were given the opportunity to view the inside of the former police base and the expansive grounds to the rear.Local council officials say they are committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site and had been planning to meet with them to discuss the way forward prior to the coronavirus pandemic.In addition, the local authority aims to work alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have previously expressed an interest in the Irish Street location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre. However, it remains to be seenthat interest remains given the current economic climate.Downpatrick councillors say that they recognise the Irish Street regeneration project provides an opportunity to regenerate the town centre and provide a boost for existing businesses and hope that the project can be progressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd June 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Minister asked to give assurances on bypass  ","story":"STORMONT roads minister Nichola Mallon has been asked to make it clear that delivering Ballynahinchrsquos multi-million pound bypass remains one of her key priorities.The appeal has been issued by South Down MP Chris Hazzard mdash a former minister at the Department of Infrastructure mdash who is keen to see work starting on the poundm project.When he was at the helm of the Stormont department, Mr Hazzard signed off the eagerly-awaited bypass in December .Since then, there has been major progress to deliver the near two-mile scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads, with work already completed on a major archaeological investigation along parts of the route.Work was due to complete on the schemersquos economic appraisal before the end of last year, with roads engineers confirming recently that in order to advance the bypass schemersquos state of readiness, preparatory work on contract documents was ongoing to ldquominimise the time required to initiate a procurement competition, should funding become available for construction.The bypass, which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district, is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with major new roundabouts proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Mr Hazzard said while the coronavirus pandemic has consumed much time for all government departments, he does want to diminish Ms Mallonrsquos role in working constructively with her executive colleagues in mitigating the worst effects of the global emergency.But he said since that taking over the reins at the roads department five months ago, the minister has issued statements on electric bikes and hydrogen buses and what he described as ldquoplenty of positive soundings on other capital projects, but there hasnrsquot been a single word on the long overdue Ballynahinch bypass.ldquoThis is a relatively low-cost, yet strategic infrastructure scheme that is shovel ready. Yet it hasnrsquot featured in any of the ministerrsquos public commentary on her departmentrsquos priorities for the time ahead since taking office in January, said Mr Hazzard.ldquoIt is unsurprising then that local businesses and commuters are beginning to question the infrastructure ministerrsquos commitment to deliver this scheme.The MP says he has once again asked Ms Mallon to definitively set out that the Ballynahinch bypass remains a priority for her department and set out a timeline for commencing construction.He added: ldquoIn light of the severe economic impact of Covid- and ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the successful delivery of this project will be a vital step in improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of our local community in these dficult times.In a letter to Ms Mallon, the South Down MP said the bypass scheme is at an advanced stage and is as close to ldquoshovel ready as any other project in the government departmentrsquorsquos capital programme.He has asked the ministerthe Ballynahinch scheme remains a ldquopriority capital project, what stage is it currently at and when will construction work be signed off Responding to Mr Hazzard, a spokesman for the roads minister said that while she is currently faced with ldquoserious and challenging budget constraints, she has already stated that she is committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for communities and improve lives across the North.ldquoShe very much recognises that many in the local community support the provision of a bypass in Ballynahinch, the spokesman continued.ldquoIn finalising budget decisions, the minister is focused on addressing the need to fund essential infrastructure work, promoting a green recovery and getting other strategic projects underway.The spokesman said that in particular, Ms Mallon is considering her long term priorities for strategic road improvement schemes and how they might facilitate complementary improvements to promote sustainable travel choices, connecting people and communities, creating thriving and liveable places that enhance opportunities and our economy.The spokesman added: ldquoThe minister understands the frustration among the people of South Down at the failure of previous administrations to deliver important projects.ldquoShe has already set out her ambition to address regional imbalance with the delivery of projects and hopes elected representatives from across all parties and across the Executive will support her in securing the money to deliver strategic projects which improve both our economy and the wellbeing of our local communities in South Down and across the North in these dficult times..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd June 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"National Trust sites reopen  ","story":"A NUMBER of local National Trust properties reopen from today.The National Trust has confirmed that Saintfieldrsquos stunning Rowallane Garden and Castle Ward and Mount Stewart mdash both on the shores of Strangford Lough mdash will be welcoming visitors after being closed for a number of weeks as part of the coronavirus lockdown restrictions.In total,  properties are reopening across the province, with Trust officials confirming that advance bookings will be required in order to limit numbers and maintain public safety.

Funding opportunities are being explored and while this work will also have been interrupted, I hope that it will resume in the near future.ldquoTourism is the districtrsquos number one offering and

Please try again later.Submitting...It seems obvious, but how many of us really know when we’re reaching the end of our contracts The rules for most business sectors state that you should be notied in advance of a contract renewing. For things like insurance where the regulations are strict, you should be notied in writing a month in advance. However, some sectors just send an email or even *shocked face* a text! I don’t think that’s fair or transparent, but given the current situation, its up to you to turn detective to beat the sneaky renewals.Why not set up a calendar reminder a month before the renewal date so you know you’ve got time to shop around ... the firm isn’t providing the service you signed up for.Nothing lasts forever and over the course of a year, the service that businesses offer you will change too.If you believe that the business you signed a contract with isn’t providing the key things that you wanted from it, that can often be grounds to break the contract early. However, the rules are not definitive in most sectors, so you’ll have to put your case to the business in detailyou want to avoid an exit fee.... the relationship has broken down ‘Breaking up is never easy, but I have to go...’ sang Swedish megastars and tragic relationship experts, ABBA. Sometimes relationships with businesses break down and you shouldn’t have to be tied to them by a contractthey’ve behaved badly.As with any relationship, it pays to be honest with yourself about where the blame lies. If a business has treated you badly and refuses to listen, then make a complaint and take it to an ombudsman or alternative dispute resolution scheme need be. Make sure that you specy in your complaint that you want to move on without charge. Resolver can help you make a complaint – or even pass on your comments – to a business for free....you’ve moved and the service isn’t available.Sometimes businesses aren’t very good at logic. One of the big areas of complaint I’ve seen involves people who move to other parts of the UK where a service isn’t available or isn’t much cop. This is most common when it comes to broadband, cable or mobile phone services.The fact of the matter is,your service isn’t available in your new home you shouldn’t have to pay an exit fee. Yet some firms are still digging their heels in over this. Don’t take no for an answer. Be polite but firm and ask the business to waive chargesyou can’t get the service – and go to the free ombudsman servicethey don’t listen....the firm changes its TC’s and you’ll be paying more moneyMany contracts allow businesses to change their terms mid-way through. Butthe change is ‘signicant’ and – more importantly – you’ll be paying more money you should be given the opportunity to get out of the contract without charge. However, you’ll be given a window of opportunity to do this andyou don’t respond in time, you’ll often be chargedyou realise late and try to leave.Meanwhile, remember pandemic-related problems. Be realistic about some problems posed by COVID . There may be a shortage of engineers and contracts to install services, for example. But you could still negotiate with your existing service provider by letting them know you’re thinking of going.Hitting a brick wall when switching  Resolver can help sort out complaints about pretty much anything for free.

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch

make face masks compulsory public transport","story":"Mark Drakeford said Englands decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel

decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel alternative.\" article_url   content_id
