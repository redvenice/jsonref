The charge is 1 per cent of their child benefit for every £100 above the £50,000 threshold. So for those on £60,000 per year or more, the tax charge wipes out the value of the child benefit.The £50,000 threshold was set in 2013 and has not been increased since to take account of rising earnings.Sir Steve said that if the threshold is frozen to the end of the Parliament, an estimated 250,000 will be drawn into the net. This is based on an assumption of a 3 per cent per year increase in nominal average earnings for the next four years.He said that, in addition, those paying a tax charge of less than the full amount of their child benefit will face a steadily increasing tax charge over the coming years.Hundreds of thousands of families, many of whom may not currently file a tax return, will have to declare their liability to a high income child benefit charge. These families will have to register for self-assessment.Some families have reacted to the charge by not claiming child benefit in the first place. The number of families on child benefit has declined every year since the charge was introduced.Where families make no claim at all, the parents (often mothers) miss out on potentially valuable National Insurance credits towards their state pension.Two years ago the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimated that between 2013 and 2019, another 360,000 were dragged into the child benefit trap.A Treasury spokesman said: \u0027We have a responsibility to target our support to those most in need, which is why it\u0027s fair that we are maintaining the current high income child benefit charge threshold.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Electric car branded worst motor experts reveal ten useless vehicles time","story":"Share this articleElectric car voted worst motor ever as 10 awful bangers named by expertsREVA G-Wiz - the worst cars ever | Auto Express"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1ff6939bf778635f7de7975e0c23ec9afc28485/1_0_1632_979/master/1632.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ee8d6b8920e0670c2e402812b1b8b50","title":"my job is making my pupils realise their worth how i found my calling in the classroom","story":"A chance encounter on a train set Misk Sharif Ali on her journey to become an educator. Here, the award-winning further education teacher discusses how she only wishes she started soonerWhen she left school at 16 with one GCSE, Misk Sharif Ali couldn’t have imagined that one day she’d be a silver award winner in the Pearson National Teaching Awards. She was recognised last year, in the further education lecturer of the year category, for her commitment to changing the lives of her students. “I was just speechless when I was told,” she says. “It was overwhelming.”The ICT teacher’s journey to the front of the classroom has been anything but straightforward. Sharif Ali grew up on what she describes as “the worst estate in north London” and she would skip school to look after her four younger siblings or to help her mum.“I learned how to work the system,” she says about turning up just enough not to raise alarm bells, or intercepting the post before it arrived at home. “My mind wasn’t always on education. I learned to annoy teachers so that I would get kicked out of class and could go home. I was argumentative and sarcastic, and they couldn’t handle me.“I can spot those tricks in my students now because I’ve been through it,” she adds. “When a student sits in front of me when they come to enrol at the college, especially the ones who’ve been through something similar or been kicked out of school, I always picture myself. They’re trying to paint a picture, they’ve rehearsed lines. They’re saying what they think I want to hear. I can always tell.”It was only her ICT teacher, she says, who took the time to try to understand and to encourage her. “He said: ‘Well done, that was amazing!’ about something I did one day. I never missed any of his classes after that. That was the one GCSE I got.”Returning home after spending a year living in Yemen with her grandparents, she started a part-time job at an optician’s and tried to enrol in further education. With few qualifications, she struggled to find somewhere that would accept her until she visited City of Westminster College, a further education college in central London. “I told the tutor a bit about myself and she gave me a chance, enrolling me on to a BTec level 2 course in ICT.” After progressing on to level 3 and graduating with distinctions and merits, she went to university to study complementary medicine (rather than her beloved ICT, as her family did not approve of it).Training to become a teacher hadn’t crossed her mind, and she was considering qualifying as an optometrist until a chance encounter on a train. “I helped an elderly lady send a text message to her son. She was so grateful that I thought I might enjoy teaching older adults about technology.” Later she researched routes into teaching and came across the diploma in education and training. It was during a placement at Newham College in east London, as part of the course, that she fell in love with working with teenagers.Some of those first students, when interviewed by Pearson for the recent awards, described Sharif Ali as “empowering, positive and encouraging”, “very unique” and “one of the best teachers I‘ve ever had”. “She never gives up,” one said. “That makes me look up to her. She believes in me.” She helped a student with issues he was having organising a flat with the council, another who was struggling with their mental health, and stayed at college late to help with assignments, even if they were set by other teachers. Some students said they were about to give up, but she encouraged them to keep fighting.“Giving them time is really important,” Sharif Ali says about her approach in the classroom. “I try to bring laughter, warmth, enjoyment to every class so my students don’t feel they are in a lesson. I want them to feel like they’re safe, and to steer them towards making a positive change through my own failures and accomplishments.”Having finished her diploma in education and training in 2015, she went on to complete her qualified teacher learning and skills certification three years later, and has almost completed a master’s in education.“I probably should have gone into teaching a long time ago,” she says. “While sometimes it feels like a job that never finishes, you never really switch off, and it can be very, very challenging – I always look forward to going to work. I love what I do. Education isn’t always about what’s in a textbook. It’s about having a teacher who believes in you. I believe in all of my learners, regardless of where they come from. And part of my job is making them realise their worth, too.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/567147de5064132c6e1a250adb582530faa719b6/1_0_6072_3644/master/6072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=705f9f2e756fea01dc4a05791a9e28d7","title":"why i teach i know the impact a great teacher can have on a child","story":"For Emmanuel Awoyelu, once an excluded pupil, becoming a teacher was a deeply personal journey – and one he never imagined takingWhen I think about my school experience, there are few positives I can take from it. By the time I left secondary school, I had already experienced two exclusions. Consequently, I left with only four A-C GCSEs and very little idea of what I would do with my life. As the eldest of three children, the weight I felt on my shoulders to succeed was immense. And the feeling of disappointment was even greater. My parents, who immigrated from Nigeria in the 80s, were incensed at how I was wasting my golden ticket to a better life. For them, education was vital because back home it was a luxury their families couldn’t afford.I had many difficulties in school I struggled to engage in particular lessons and often felt a lack of motivation. Admittedly, I was a class clown, and almost definitely used my humour and buffoonery at the wrong time on one too many occasions.The one shining light was Ms Sponge. She was my English teacher for much of secondary school and very quickly became my “school mother”. It was a running joke that I was the teacher’s pet a title I earned not because I was a goody two-shoes – quite the opposite. I was cheeky, humorous, and sometimes loud, but Ms Sponge never made me feel in the wrong. Instead, she helped me discover a love of writing. By calling me up to read in front of the class or asking me to share my stories, she created an arena for me to excel and did what no other teacher was capable of – seeing beyond my defence mechanism of being a class clown and bringing out the best in me. In her class, I read and wrote stories and acted in plays that were far removed from my reality. Soon, I began to relish English lessons, knowing every writing task was an opportunity for escapism.My love for the written word hit new heights when I started writing my own poetry. This developed into songwriting, which very quickly became my favourite way to express myself. Before long, I started performing songs in school assemblies, which gave me the confidence to perform at music events when I left school. Writing, in all its forms, was my passion and something I had a natural talent for – but I’m not sure I’d have ever discovered it were it not for Ms Sponge. She cultivated my skills and saw me for who I was an empty vessel waiting to be used to bless others.Despite her impact on me, I never dreamed of becoming a teacher myself. Even when I eventually found myself working in education after university, I was initially content with the impact I was making as a teaching assistant and a sports coach. However, the more I worked with disadvantaged children, the greater my desire to make the leap became. I wanted to change the narrative for young boys who came from similar backgrounds to mine, I wanted to be the role model I needed growing up – and I soon realised that becoming a fully fledged teacher was the best way to do this.Fortunately, I knew what a good teacher could do for a child’s confidence and development Ms Sponge’s kindness and love for teaching planted a seed in this young boy from East Ham. Despite the odds stacked against me as an excluded child, I went back to university to qualify as a teacher and now use my love of writing as a way to engage my students. I teach children who have social, emotional and mental health issues (SEMH) and most of them have had some type of adverse childhood experience.When I prepare my resources, I often incorporate my own stories, poems and song lyrics, and then get up in front of my year 6 pupils and perform as if I was headlining the Royal Albert Hall. It’s important for them to see me read so they, as young boys, learn to love the written word too. But I believe it’s also important for them to hear about my cultural experiences: what it was like growing up in a Nigerian household or being a teenager in east London.As a young, black man who never had a black male primary teacher, I appreciate that representation matters. Some students can relate to my experiences for others I provide a new perspective. Ultimately, sharing my authentic self is what makes me unique, and I encourage my students to do the same. I also urge them to read aloud to others, because their voice and experiences deserve to be heard.Children are ready and waiting to absorb knowledge, as long as you give them the chance to take the lead in their learning. This is why I love being a teacher, particularly to primary school children to play a part in shaping the lives of the next generation is a privilege, and something I never take for granted.As an educator in an SEMH school, you don’t hear many “thank yous” on a day-to-day basis, but the seed you sow in your students can’t be underestimated. And with the uncertainty and confusion brought on by the pandemic, there’s never been a more important time to remind teachers that they’re doing the most important job in the world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fe271379a9b5ed1da54a872cf2dbabc78e3752c/0_288_4339_2604/master/4339.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55f33abec3c206d67a2358a1b05a28a0","title":"riding high the surfing maths teacher on the crest of a wave","story":"When she’s not in the classroom, teacher Emily Grimes can be found riding waves in the chilly North Sea. She tells Nicole Morley how she came to find her perfect balanceIt might be a frosty afternoon in the depths of winter, but Emily Grimes is in her wetsuit, catching some post-work waves in the North Sea, just a short drive from Monkseaton high school, a comprehensive in Whitley Bay, where she teaches maths.The 26-year-old, who grew up in Blaydon, near Gateshead, a town featured in the 19th-century Geordie folk song Blaydon Races, has always loved the outdoors and grew up riding horses. But it wasn’t until a post-university trip to Australia in her early 20s that she caught the surfing bug.“I remember thinking: ‘I don’t get the point,’ after seeing people paddle out and then get pushed back towards the beach,” she laughs. “But once you start surfing, you begin to see nature and the weather in such a different way. It has definitely made me feel more connected to the natural world.”For Grimes, surfing is a mental exercise as much as a physical one – something she’s valued more than ever as she’s navigated her first year of teaching during the Covid-19 pandemic. “I feel so lucky that I’ve still been able to surf during lockdown. It’s provided a real stress release and escapism.“When you’re on a board on a wave you can’t think of anything else. It’s a flowing sort of state, which I hadn’t experienced before,” she says. “When you’re on a horse you aren’t totally immersed in what you are doing, not like when you’re in the water.”Grimes always excelled at maths, and for a time it seemed she was destined for a career in the City. But an office job was never something that really appealed, and after graduating with a 2:1 in economics and finance from Newcastle University, she spent two years travelling around the US and Australia, before returning to her native north-east to train as a teacher.While surfing might be a relatively new hobby, teaching is an option that Grimes has long had in mind. After university, she came to realise that it was a career she would find immensely rewarding – and one that would allow her to continue her outdoorsy lifestyle.“Even back in sixth form, I would learn by helping my friends and teaching them. I also tutored pupils taking economics A-level while I was studying it at university. When I was in Australia, as well as leading horseback tours I taught at a riding school and worked as a surf instructor.”For Grimes, teaching on the north-east coast has provided the perfect work-life balance, allowing her to not only pursue, but actually combine, her passions for teaching and surfing.“I think the skills of teaching surfing and teaching in school are totally transferable,” she says. “In both cases I’m sharing my skills and passions. Obviously teaching maths is a lot more formal, but whether I’m on the beach or in the classroom it’s about building collaborative relationships.”Fortunately for Grimes, she’s found a school with an outlook that matches her surfer’s spirit. “What I like about Monkseaton high is that its ethos is based on equality, positivity and mutual respect. You can feel that in a school. It’s welcoming.”That’s not to say that her students aren’t sometimes a little taken aback when they discover that their new maths teacher likes to ride waves in her spare time. On discovering Grimes’s hobby, a rather perplexed year 10 student remarked: “I didn’t even realise teachers had lives!”Grimes smiles: “I like it when pupils find out that I surf. They’ll see the surfboards on top of my car, and see me heading off after school when the surf is good, and ask about it, which I love. I want to make sure they see me as approachable and know there is mutual respect.”In fact, it’s exactly these kind of exchanges that have led Grimes to love her career in teaching. “It’s the relationships that you build with the pupils, and the interaction,” she says. “I get so much out of it when I see pupils progress. People may think that teaching or helping people is a selfless act, but it actually makes me feel so good. It’s a really unbeatable feeling.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7ddbf99afd6a09399a964725fec163c74113e8d/950_560_1574_945/master/1574.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=373652eedcf8847a34abb9f13c533bcf","title":"education is freedom why my mothers legacy drives me to teach","story":"Inspired by her parents’ dreams – and her pupils’ joy – Rihula Sameer-Mour is fiercely committed to fostering a love of learning in the classroomFrom a young age my parents taught my siblings and me that education was freedom. I was born on Fuvahmulah, an island in the Males with few schools and around 40 in a class. Good grades were highly valued and my parents encouraged hard work. Education brought opportunities we weren’t born with it was the way to build a good life. My mother, Khaulath, was head of English at the school, and my father, Abdulla, who’s a well-known poet, taught Dhivehi, our local dialect, so teaching was in my DNA.When I was eight years old we moved to Australia where mum studied for her degree in education. I went to a school that was creative and enriching, with lots of outdoor learning. I was the only child who wasn’t white but, as a kid, I didn’t notice our differences. We moved to England when I was 13, this time for mum’s PhD. School, in inner-city Manchester, was a different environment again. My friends and I were studious and had to work hard to make it, but I got A*-B grades at GCSE and went on to A-levels and an English degree.I think teaching is in my DNA. As a child, I would make registers and pretend to teach at home. I knew it was a good job and saw the respect that my parents earned from people on the island who, long after they’d left school, would come up to them to say how they’d inspired them. I saw my parents’ dedication and how happy the job made them.My mother died in 2013, weeks after giving birth to my youngest sister. The day before she slipped into a coma, I was due in London for my teacher training interview. I wanted to stay at her bedside but mum told me to go. I missed her final, waking day. From then on, everything in my career has had to be worth it, it has to mean something. I help care for my younger siblings (I am one of five) and I guide them with their school work. My parents’ inspiration is everything to me.When I took my first teaching job in 2014 I wasn’t sure I was cut out for it, but the school I teach in now has changed my life. I joined four years ago and was given a mentor. He taught me how to be a creative and inspiring teacher, and gave me confidence. I made friends and now mentor trainee teachers myself. Teaching is not just about the children, it’s the mark you can make on colleagues and the community too.A year into the job I was promoted to head of English. I am now head of year and sit on the governing body too. I didn’t realise how rare it was for a woman of colour to hold a leadership position in a UK school and I’m proud to be part of the change. I would love other young people to continue taking up the mantle, to see that those roles are within their reach. Even if you are the only person who looks like you, going for jobs you deserve will enrich the ersity in classrooms.I have my father’s love of writing and instil that passion in the children I teach. I established a partnership with Manchester’s Portico library that gives our pupils the chance to have a book review or short story published each year. A couple of years ago, I travelled to South Africa to establish links with a school in Cape Town. Now the children write to one another and share details about their lives. Writing unlocks the world for young people it brings a subject or a place to life and allows them to express their own views and experiences.There is so much I love about teaching – the children, the joy they get as they progress. Playing a part in that is so rewarding, it gives me real purpose. This is a profession where hard work pays off. Our school is creative, we try to give the children ownership, chances to lead their learning, guiding them to discover answers for themselves.There are pupils going through hard times who allow me to connect with them too. The children inspire me as much as I hope I inspire them. I have worked hard but come far. It’s a job where I know that my best is enough. My parents had their own dreams but the sacrifices they made are my driving force and I am forever grateful to them for that. I feel that this path, this profession, makes their sacrifices worthwhile.Rihula Sameer-Mour, 30, is head of English and of year 4 at Beaver Road Primary School, in Didsbury, Manchester."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/203957877d72030d948b29ea02a5e6cdf80c1422/0_162_2970_1782/master/2970.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4380eefca74729873605d5ac5452525f","title":"20 photographs of the week","story":"Protests in Myanmar and Spain, Mount Sinabung erupts, the destruction in Syria and the enduring impact of Covid-19: the most striking images from around the world this week"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd9b0018e965d6c53a24569e85c0c0e9ad09bda8/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d77a3fda455a2ff3c9d1c24bac149ab5","title":"the man who saves cats in fukushimas nuclear zone in pictures","story":"Sakae Kato stayed behind a decade ago to rescue abandoned cats whose owners fled radiation clouds from the Fukushima nuclear plant"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13fdaeee2e18c00635564f5277fbaa5409603694/0_38_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=44a1ae0e4288b33001fe63d5a91a1755","title":"school covid tests pupils in england very likely to get false positives","story":"Children who test positive on lateral flow tests will have to self-isolate even if later PCR test is negativePlans to test schoolchildren in England with controversial lateral flow tests have been thrown into disarray after it emerged it was “very likely” children and their parents would be asked to self-isolate unnecessarily.Every pupil who received a positive test result after taking a rapid lateral flow device (LFD) test at school should check their result against a so-called gold-standard laboratory test – known as a PCR test – due to the fact that the LFD result was just as likely to be a false positive as a true positive, a leading statistician has said.“All LFD positives should be subject to PCR confirmation when we are asking all children to undergo such testing,” Prof Sheila Bird, a member of the Royal Statistical Society, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. She said it was “very likely” a positive LFD result would be false. “The concern is that the void rate with LFDs is about as high as the positive rate. About as many tests are void as test positive … It may be you’ve taken them badly or the kit has performed badly.”Secondary pupils returning to classrooms in England on Monday will be asked to undertake three initial LFD tests at school which, because staff are trained to guide children taking the tests, is deemed to be an “assisted test centre”.When the LFD test is taken at an “assisted test centre” such as a school, the Department for Education confirmed that children who “falsely” test positive – ie they subsequently take and receive a negative PCR test – are not allowed to stop self-isolating and return to school.A DfE spokesperson said: “As has always been the case, a negative PCR test does not release an inidual from self-isolation requirements.”He added: “Iniduals with a positive LFD test result from an assisted test site will need to self-isolate in line with the guidance for households with possible coronavirus infection.”This means that, next week, schools will have no choice but to inform families that a negative result with the gold-standard PCR test does not override the “false positive” LFD result, when it is taken at a school test site – an oddity that Bird said she was “shocked” by.“I think there is sufficient capacity to be offering the PCR confirmation for all LFD positives,” she said.“The problem with these lateral flow tests is they’re not sensitive enough to do the job they’re meant to do,” said Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union. “The PCR test is much more reliable so what I’d hope in this situation is schools get evidence of a PCR test and allow the pupils to be in school.”She said the debacle raised questions around the usefulness of lateral flow tests. “The danger is that young people and children who don’t have Covid are kept off school unnecessarily because of a false positive. And those who have Covid will go to school, because they got a false negative. That is the danger because they are simply not accurate enough.”Confusingly, pupils who take LFD tests at home – which they will be asked to do twice a week once the school stops testing them – are required to take a PCR test to “confirm the result”, if they receive a positive LFD result. But they are not required to do this if they take the test at school.One father decided to speak out about the accuracy of LFD tests after his son’s LFD test came back positive. “He doesn’t leave the house, he’s a teenage boy, he shows no symptoms and he’s not unwell,” the man told the Today programme. “The school told us to get a PCR to double check it … The result came back the next day and was negative.“We spoke to NHS 111 and they said the PCR test was the important one and the LFD was clearly a false positive, and that we should be able to remove the self-isolation through track and trace.”But they refused to remove the self-isolation order, he said. “Any positive from a PCR or LFD was to be taken as a positive, and there were no exceptions to the rule,” he said. “We’ve got to isolate when we know he’s not unwell.“If this is ramified across 24,000 schools, even if it’s just one child per school who gets a false positive, that’s 24,000 families who have to self-isolate and can’t work.”The DfE spokesperson said: “The rapid asymptomatic testing programme for education has been set up to support the return of all students to nurseries, schools and colleges.“All staff, secondary and college students, their families and the families of primary school children will have access to twice-weekly testing as an additional reassurance on top of the strengthened safety measures in place from 8 March.“We encourage everyone to consent to testing, following in the footsteps of the staff and students who have already taken millions of tests over the past weeks while schools have been open only to critical worker and vulnerable children.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79cf43edc9c402015aa80b8f35c674002558e6d8/0_0_2169_1446/master/2169.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c311fc5571e11b2ab69618c8616263e8 960w","title":"bayern munich v borussia dortmund bundesliga live","story":"Willkommen, Bundesliga-Fans, Hipster und andere Zeitverschwender, zur minutengenauen Live-Berichterstattung des  über Der Klassiker! The two giants of modern-day German football, Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund, meet for the 129th time this evening at the Allianz Arena, with the 2020-21 title very much on the line. Not for Dortmund, you understand they’re well out of the race, trailing Bayern by 13 points. But the hosts have it all to play for, as they strive to stay ahead of RB Leipzig at the top.The recent results of Der Klassiker suggest Bayern will get the win they crave. Back in November, they won 3-2 in Dortmund, their fourth consecutive win against their rivals. It was also their seventh victory in the last eight, a sequence that has included some proper thumpings: 4-0, 4-1, 5-0, 6-0. They’ve got Dortmund’s number right now.They’ve also got 28-goal Robert Lewandowski up front, and he’s chasing the great Gerd Muller’s all-time Bundesliga record of 40 goals in a single season, something der Bomber achieved back in 1971-72. Lewandowski scored in both of Bayern’s last two games, handsome victories over Lazio, 4-1 in the Champions League, and Cologne, who were mauled 5-1.

His report has landed. Here it is, you know what to do. Thanks for reading this MBM!A dejected Mikel Arteta takes his turn. “It’s a tough place to come and a difficult pitch ... but if you don’t score the big chances that we had, if you give a goal to the opponent, and you don’t get the decision when it’s a clear penalty ... we made a mistake but it can happen when you play short or long ... someone has to explain to me what a penalty is ... we have to look at ourselves and not find any other excuses ... we should have won the game ... you have to win by two or three goals when you play like that ... if you give any hope to a team in the Premier League they are going to take it.”Sean Dyche speaks to BT. “Overall another good point ... I was super-pleased with the physical capability of our players, who kept going at Arsenal for the whole 90 minutes ... I’m a fan of VAR ... that’s when it’s worth its weight in gold, it clearly hits him on the shoulder ... it’s a funny one about the referee, he couldn’t wait to get the red card out, just give yourself a second, absorb it, then make a decision ... he’s a fine referee in my opinion too ... our defending was outstanding, especially at the end ... and we created the golden chance of the game ... if you press them for the whole game, sometimes you get your reward ... it’s not easy to do that, trust me ... our team has a strong mentality, no doubt.”Erik Pieters, at the centre of everything after coming on, speaks to BT Sport. “It was a good 30 minutes of me, wasn’t it?! I got a yellow, a red, a shot on goal! We defended all of us to make sure we didn’t lose this game. With a bit more luck and clinical finishing, we could have taken the three points. You hear different stories, shoulder is hand ball, shoulder is not hand ball. Our equaliser was a bit lucky, but they all count. It was a great effort from the lads. I didn’t see the scramble at the end, forget about that!” A tinder-dry interview from an extremely chuffed player. He was worth the price of admission alone.Not entirely sure how Burnley survived that in the end. The pinball game in their box, right at the end, would surely end in a goal nine times out of ten 99 out of 100 perhaps. But not this time. VAR also denied Arsenal two penalties for handball, though only one was the correct decision. However, you can’t win matches after giving away a goal like Granit Xhaka did, you just can’t, it’s not on. Either way, Burnley fully deserved their point after a staunch second-half display, during which they had their chances too. Arsenal stay in 10th with 38 points, while Burnley remain in 15th on 30.90 min +4: This is absurd, even by this match’s circus standard. Bagatelle in the Burnley box. The ball breaks to Ceballos, who sidefoots powerfully towards the top right. But the ball crashes off the upright and clear!90 min +3: Luiz wedges into the Burnley box. The ball breaks to Aubameyang on the penalty spot. He’s got to score, but Mee throws himself into the road of the shot, blocking and clearing!90 min +2: As does the second. Seems that penaltyred card brouhaha has tuckered everyone out.90 min +1: The first goes by without incident.90 min: The ball nearly breaks to Rodriguez in the Arsenal box, but Luiz gets in the road to block any danger. There will be a minimum of89 min: Arsenal have enjoyed 83 percent possession during the last five minutes. Burnley respond by taking their sweet time over a free kick, extracting some of the sting from the game.88 min: Can this game go on for another 30 minutes, please?86 min: Credit where it’s due, VAR did the business there. Meanwhile, as the dust settles, Rodriguez comes on for Vydra.85 min: VAR spots that the ball came off Pieters’ shoulder, so Andre Marriner reverses both of his decisions. Justice is done. This game, ditchwater-dull for so long, has exploded into glorious technicolour!84 min: Saka crosses from the left. His dipping cross is met by Pepe, who volleys goalwards. The ball pings off Pieters on the goalline, off the bar, and into the arms of Pope! What an escape! But the ref thinks it’s a hand ball, so points to the spot and flashes the red card to Pieters.82 min: Now it’s Arsenal who nearly hit the front! Tierney rolls a delicious ball along the corridor of uncertainty from the left. It reaches Pepe, eight yards out. He’ll surely whip home! But he takes a fresh-air swipe, and the ball rolls away from the danger zone. What a chance!80 min: Vydra chests a long ball down, then exchanges passes with Wood. Vydra takes a step down the inside-left channel and slips the ball back to Wood, a gorgeous one-two-three. Wood is one on one with Leno! He slams low and hard. Leno blocks brilliantly. Well, this match has livened up!79 min: Pieters nearly adds insult to injury by sending a sensational dipping volley towards the top left from the best part of 30 yards! Leno tips over. Vydra nearly finds the top-right with a header from the resulting corner, but steers it just wide.77 min: “Proximity” has been cited as the reason for the non-decision. VAR is a fiasco, like that’s breaking news.76 min: On BT Sport, former referee Peter Walton, a company man good and true, expresses surprise that the penalty wasn’t given, which tells you all you need to know.75 min: VAR says no. That is nonsense. Pieters had his arm extended and batted the ball away!74 min: Pepe twists and turns down the right, in the Burnley box. He claims a handball against Pieters. Nothing doing, they’re too close together. The ball bounces up against Pieters’ right arm again. That looks more of a shout, with the defender’s arm out to the side. VAR will check. This could be a penalty, you know.73 min: Arsenal stroke it around, but in their own half. Burnley are more than happy to let them be about their business.71 min: Pieters comes through the back of Lacazette, who nearly razes Turf Moor to the ground with his ear-splitting screams of pain. That’s initially a worrying sound, but thankfully nothing too serious, and the striker’s soon up and about again. Pieters receives a yellow card for his clumsiness. 69 min: Pepe comes on for Willian. 68 min: Vydra wriggles on the edge of the Arsenal box and nearly turns into space. He miskicks and falls under pressure from that man Saka. Burnley want a penalty, but Vydra had kicked Saka’s shoe, and quite correctly neither referee nor VAR chappie are interested.67 min: Burnley make a second change, replacing Gudmundsson with Brady, who returns after a three-match absence.66 min: Pieters chests down on the left flank and shapes to bomb forward. He’s bundled over from behind by Saka, who is on a booking and really needs to watch himself now. Not enough for a second booking, but he’ll be testing the referee’s patience.65 min: Still scrappy. Pope has had very little to do since the restart.63 min: Arsenal send on Lacazette in place of Odegaard, while Burnley replace Taylor with Pieters.61 min: It’s all very scrappy, which surely benefits Burnley more than it does Arsenal. “Re Michael Gibson’s ‘come on Arsenal, stop mucking about’ half-time exhortation: that’s some of that cockney rhyming slang, right?” writes Geoff Wignall, whose nickname may or may not be Effand.59 min: Arsenal stroke the ball this way and that, but can’t find a gap in the Burnley back line. Here’s AB Parker, replying to Paul Tingen of 49-min fame: “Playing out from the back is the way the elite teams play nowadays and has more benefits than it has downsides. If anyone really feels that’s not true, I refer them to Liverpool last year, and City since Pep has come in. Xhaka has a mistake in him and needs shifting. It’s been five years since he’s come in now and we haven’t reached the Champions League once with him. Meanwhile, it’s the fault of his midfield partners, his managers, or maybe, just maybe it’s his fault? If a midfielder can’t control a ball in a tight space, what is he there for?”57 min: Burnley are much-improved since the break. Arsenal still haven’t quite cleared their heads after Xhaka’s music-hall turn.55 min: Saka is booked for a cynical - and wholehearted - block on Taylor.53 min: The corner’s whipped into the six-yard box by Brownhill. Leno claims and drops under pressure from Tarkowski, but gathers at the second attempt. That was better goalkeeping than this entry makes it sound, because it was like Piccadilly Circus in that six-yard box. Leno was under attack from all angles.52 min: Corner for Burnley, as Taylor pressures Saka down the left.51 min: Saka dribbles infield from the right, turning and slamming a shot straight at Mee. The ball breaks to Odegaard, who whistles a low drive towards the bottom right. Pope gathers, but only at the second attempt. That was a highly decent strike.49 min: A fairly uneventful start to the half, so let’s dip into the bulging MBM postbag again. “Much as I enjoy having a go at Xhaka, as he can be very ponderous in the way he plays, this preposterous goal was an accident waiting to happen, and not primarily Xhaka’s fault,” argues Paul Tingen. “It’s a direct outcome of Arteta’s obsessive playing-out-from-the-back tactics. So the blame should before anything go to Arteta, then to Leno for passing to Xhaka in his own penalty area, while Xhaka’s already under pressure. Why did Leno not hoof the ball upfield, as any half-decent goalie would have done in that situation? He must have had the manager’s instructions in mind. Or is it taboo to criticize Arteta?”47 min: Nothing’s going right for Po’ Granit. Now his shirt has been ripped in the punk-rock style. I’m assuming that just happened, rather than during a full and frank exchange of views in the dressing room.Here we go again. Burnley get the second half underway. Xhaka looks fine, no signs of his being slapped for 15 minutes straight.“In the dressing rooms, both managers will be singing ‘Dammit, Granit!’ to the popular tune from Rocky Horror. Only one will be singing the ‘I love you’ part” - Fred Decker.“That Burnley goal has massive echoes of Karius v Real Madrid. As a Liverpool fan it’s given me immediate PTSD thinking about it. At least my son, who is a Gooner, will shut up about it though. So thank you Granit, from Loris Karius and I! Best wishes and come on Arsenal, stop mucking about” - Michael Gibson.Arsenal have dominated. They’ve been the better team. But the hosts are level thanks to one of the stupidest goals you’ll see in a good while. Xhaka will presumably be making his apologies during the break.45 min: Luiz intercepts in the centre circle and feeds Willian down the left. Willian wins a corner off Tarkowski. Burnley just about deal with the corner. There will be one additional minute.42 min: Arsenal had been comfortable, but now they’re rocking a bit, and Leno does well to keep hold of a low McNeil drive from a tight angle on the left.41 min: There’s some blame on Leno, who should have just cleared his lines but gave Xhaka a dilemma instead. Even so, Xhaka should have spotted Wood standing right next to him, and he probably shouldn’t have been trying to execute a cute scooped pass towards Luiz on the right wing anyway. That was preposterous.Mari passes back to Leno, who decides against bashing clear and passes to Xhaka, six yards in front of him, instead. Xhaka, facing his own goal, plays a blind pass to his left, slapping the ball off the hip of the lurking Wood and into the net! That’s pure farce, and once again, Xhaka, sent off in the corresponding fixture at the Emirates, has made a royal show of himself against Burnley.37 min: Arsenal break and Burnley are extremely light at the back. Aubameyang romps down the middle of the park and slips Saka into the box on the right. Saka is clear, but can’t sort his feet out to shoot, allowing Brownhill to stick in a toe and clear.36 min: Xhaka creams a long pass down the left for Aubameyang. Pope hares out of his box to head clear, just in time. Aubameyang wasn’t far away from nicking the ball around the keeper, though, at which point Burnley would have been in a world of trouble."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26951c7c2fae05a9da6877c07734d889e870a446/35_517_4857_2917/master/4857.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=7f3c37b47dddcf35792dab4b5be5366f","title":"alex salmond nicola sturgeon and the turmoil inside scottish politics","story":"With Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon giving evidence today, the ’s Scotland correspondent, Libby Brooks, charts the unravelling of the alliance between first minister Nicola Sturgeon and her predecessor Alex Salmond – once seen as Scotland’s greatest political partnership’s Scotland correspondent, Libby Brooks, discusses the turmoil inside the SNP, with Rachel Humphreys. Today Nicola Sturgeon gives evidence to the Scottish parliament’s inquiry into the government’s handling of complaints of sexual assault against Alex Salmond. Sturgeon has been accused by the former first minister of possibly breaking the ministerial code and is subject to a second inquiry that will examine this.  Yesterday John Swinney, Scotland’s deputy first minister, agreed to release his government’s legal advice on Salmond’s court action after facing cross-party censure in Holyrood. It reveals that the Scottish government was warned by its senior lawyers it faced defeat in an ultimately successful legal action by Alex Salmond. The guidance, released by Scottish ministers on Tuesday, confirms that their two counsel told them the revelation that a senior official had previously met and briefed two complainers against Salmond had devastating consequences for their case. There were further developments yesterday when evidence from two other witnesses called into question Ms Sturgeon’s version of events. Text messages between senior party and government officials, which Salmond last Friday claimed indicated that witnesses and the police were pressurised to pursue his criminal charges in order to overtake the judicial review, were handed over to the inquiry too. Libby looks at the impact this could have on the SNP and its fight for a second referendum on independence. It’s just a few months until Scotland heads to the polls. The way the allegations against Salmond have been handled could also have a devastating impact  for the #MeToo movement and reporting of sexual assault and rape in Scotland, says Libby."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9d9f2f231206b82a31fe3a285dd1146cff045a0/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bae80af01f0a3a8ac2d1512cb8874eb","title":"guantanamos highest value detainee and the guard who befriended him","story":"Mohamedou Ould Salahi was once Guantánamo’s highest-value detainee, but during the 14 years he spent behind bars he was never charged with a crime. Salahi and his former guard Steve Wood reflect on their time at the prisonOne evening in November 2001, an electrical engineer named Mohamedou Ould Salahi was visited at his home in Mauritania by plainclothes intelligence officers. They wanted him for questioning. Salahi was taken from Mauritania first to Jordan, then to Afghanistan, and finally to the Guantánamo Bay detention facility in Cuba, where he would be held without charge for 14 years – an experience he wrote about in his 2015 memoir Guantánamo Diary, which has now been adapted into a film, The Mauritanian. In the first of two episodes about his story, Salahi tells Anushka Asthana about the torture he experienced in detention, and the series of events that brought him under suspicion in the first place. Salahi’s former guard Steve Wood describes how he formed an unlikely friendship with Guantánamo’s most high-value detainee, and reflects on how that friendship led him to question his job and the entire “war on terror”.

However, given that England has a Covid-19 death rate that is significantly higher than Scotland’s, it is clear that Sturgeon has achieved a better outcome and saved many Scottish lives over the course of the pandemic. Outcomes on other issues deserve some recognition, too. Many of Scotland’s social democrats are finding it increasingly hard to work out why the UK’s leading social democratic newspaper and its columnists persistently find it hard to give any recognition to a progressive, pro-European, social democratic government within these islands. Plainly it is far from perfect, something that Sturgeon, unlike the blustering UK government, often admits. Doesn’t Sturgeon deserve at least some support, as well as proper scrutiny and criticism?  doesn’t find it hard to give credit where it’s due to Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand. Why not Sturgeon in Scotland too?Keith McLeayDrymen, Stirling• Martin Kettle says ministers complain that every UK grant to Scotland under the Barnett formula is “rebranded as exclusively Scottish government spending without any acknowledgment of where it comes from”. It in fact comes from taxes raised in the UK’s four nations, plus borrowing on behalf of the four nations, collected by the UK government and fairly redistributed by the UK. So you could say the Scottish government is spending Scottish money in Scotland. One day we’ll cut out the middleman.John WarburtonEdinburgh• Nicola Sturgeon has come in for much criticism (Nicola Sturgeon: government made ‘catastrophic’ error in Salmond inquiry, 3 March) and the health of Scottish democracy has been called into question. Can you imagine the UK government pursuing and losing a judicial review of its conduct? And, following precedent, declining to release the legal advice? Yes. Can you imagine the UK parliament successfully demanding the release of such advice? Or the prime minister subjecting himself to eight hours of detailed questioning by a parliamentary committee? And frankly admitting to errors? No. Accountable parliamentary democracy is alive and well in Scotland.Adam RennieEdinburgh• Steve Bell has Nicola Sturgeon addressing Alex Salmond as “youse” in his cartoon (If…, 2 March). Nobody in Scotland ever used that form when referring to one person. “Yous” is a plural pronoun, and, as such, is a valuable linguistic development, given the deficiency in the dialect usually referred to as standard English.It’s a resilient form, having survived generations of palm pummelling in Scottish schools, as well as constant mockery and derision of the kind exemplified in the cartoon. Not only has it survived in recent years, its use, naturally or defiantly, has been heard even in the discourse of university teachers. Maybe it’s that defiance that riles the elitists and linguistic bullies.Liam StewartOrphir, Orkney"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6587d50335dd42e7a054c8eac275087c3dbbd15e/0_116_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=d63acf4cab0a6a43443864ba85f4481d","title":"channel 4 the celebrity circle","story":"With a cast compiled by throwing a dart at a ‘Who Will Do Absolutely Anything?’ board, the show threatens to be messier and more backstabby than everChannel 4 already knows that The Circle is an incredible TV format. The problem is that not quite enough of the rest of us have realised that yet. That’s why C4 has folded the show (briefly: a group of people in a block of Instagram-neat apartments compete to be liked via a clunky in-house social media app they can either be their boring selves or someone more interesting there is absolutely no benefit to pretending to be someone else, only the constant risk of being found out for some reason this medium inspires a lot of very bizarre flirting) into its annual Stand Up to Cancer output, because here is a worthy platform for blockbuster reality telly on a par with the Big Brother of yore.So to The Celebrity Circle (Tuesday, 9.15pm, Channel 4), a short, trial-sized series of The Circle set to run before this year’s actual series of The Circle. The show has been cast, as per tradition, by throwing a dart at Britain’s hallowed “Who Will Do Absolutely Anything?” board, so we have all the hits: Loose Women Nadia Sawalha and Kaye Adams, teaming up to pretend to be Gemma Collins Duncan James from Blue, who at this point you have to assume just hangs around outside television studios, hoping there’s a gameshow in need of a ringer Denise van Outen, fresh from her stint on Celebrity Gogglebox and “every celeb-adjacent TV show filmed in the past 25 years”, plays as Denise van Outen, while Radio 1’s Rickie \u0026amp Melvin play a fascinatingly unconvincing Will.i.am.There is a little intrigue this year with the addition of Baga Chipz, the Drag Race UK graduate, who turns out to be an incredibly astute scholar of the game (playing as Kim Woodburn), and the blossoming structured-reality double act Pete Wicks (Towie) and Sam Thompson (Made in Chelsea), a classic po-faced gothexcitable puppy duo who compete as Rachel Riley, for some reason, and amuse themselves by bickering and playing Jenga. Much as I want to hate the two of them – I feel as if their tag-teamed TV appearances are being forced upon me, the same way the music industry made me aware of who Jess Glynne was, despite me never wanting to know – I must begrudgingly admit that, actually, they are good.Fans of The Circle proper will know that it is not really about the early stage episodes. The show really gets going when a few more layers of trust and distrust have been achieved when the original lineup has been clipped of a few members when relationships have flared up and fizzled out, like that bit in last year’s (supposedly non-celebrity) series when Richard Madeley flirted with Fatboy Slim’s son by shouting very slowly at a television.I think it’s important to note that this Celebrity edition brings an extra layer of dazzle, given that a lot of these people have already intimately schmoozed with each other at various West End afterparties, so know how they text and talk (“That’s definitely Denise. She always calls me ‘Duncs’,” deduces Duncan “Sherlock” James). As a result, it threatens to be messier and more backstabby than ever. Listen, unless you haven’t noticed, we’re all locked indoors. We may as well watch people have fun while doing the same."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ae7f763cce406b9a63e0ea9ce116399eb5b7b7f/251_205_2953_1772/master/2953.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=50e4cba9446383e8a720c2ac14a6a30e","title":"amanda gorman says she was followed by security guard who said she looked suspicious","story":"Poet, acclaimed for her performance at Joe Biden’s inauguration, tweeted ‘this is the reality of black girls’Amanda Gorman, the poet who won acclaim for her performance at Joe Biden’s inauguration, has told of being followed home and accosted by a security guard who allegedly claimed she looked suspicious.She said the incident, on Friday night, was emblematic of “the reality of black girls” in the US, in which “one day you’re called an icon” but the next day considered a threat.Gorman wrote on Twitter:She said in a following tweet: “In a sense, he was right.

But can he get Republicans on board?Joe Biden came to power promising a New Deal-like economic agenda that would not only combat the Covid-19 pandemic, which has now claimed more than half a million lives and caused unemployment not seen since the Great Depression, but also confront the deep-rooted disparities it has exposed.After a blitz of executive orders in the opening days of his presidency, Biden is on the verge of achieving the first major piece of his multi-pronged relief and recovery plan, a $1.9tn coronavirus stimulus package expected to reach his desk by the end of next week.But the partisan tightrope Biden is walking to advance the sweeping pandemic relief bill – which enjoys broad public support – likely foreshadows even greater challenges that lie ahead as he pivots from “rescue” mode to his next and possibly biggest legislative act: a multi-trillion dollar plan to rebuild the country’s ailing infrastructure.“The American Rescue Plan is largely about relief – for the millions of people unemployed, for distributing vaccines, for opening schools safely,” said Virginia congressman Don Beyers, the Democratic vice-chairman of the joint economic committee.“This next bill can be almost completely characterized as investment in the future.”Even more so than the stimulus plan, a wide-ranging jobs and infrastructure bill would weigh the president’s desire for bipartisanship against his promise to enact progressive economic policies that could forge his legacy. With the barest of majorities in Congress, Biden has little room for error if he hopes to succeed in a policy quest that bedeviled his predecessors.In theory, infrastructure is an area where Democrats and Republicans can find common ground. Fixing bridges, roads and broadband networks has long unified Americans and elected leaders. Yet there is little bipartisan agreement over the size and scale of such a package.“He wants to move as quickly as possible,” Peter DeFazio, an Oregon Democrat and the chairman of the House transportation and infrastructure committee, said after a bipartisan meeting with Biden on Thursday. “He wants it to be very big and he feels that this is the key to the recovery package.”Emerging from the same meeting, Missouri congressman Sam Graves, the top Republican on the transportation committee, tempered expectations of a deal.“A highway bill cannot grow into a multi-trillion dollar catch-all bill, or it will lose Republican support,” he warned in a statement. “Republicans won’t support another Green New Deal disguising itself as a transportation bill.”During his presidential campaign, Biden cast the infrastructure effort as an economic road map to create jobs and revitalize industry, saying it would be the “largest mobilization of public investment since” the second world war.As proposed, his “Build Back Better” infrastructure plan would spend trillions of dollars to make the US economy more sustainable, more equitable and more competitive, particularly with China, with ambitious investment in public transportation, sustainable housing, electric vehicles and upgrading the power grid to be carbon pollution-free by 2035. Funded by a mix of tax increases on corporations and the wealthy, his agenda promises to create millions of union jobs and direct significant resources to communities of color disproportionately affected by the consequences of climate change.As talks intensify between the White House and Congress, progressives and environmental groups are contemplating even bigger proposals, pointing to the recent crisis in Texas that left millions without water and electricity during a severe winter storm, as a reason to act urgently – and unilaterally, if necessary. Some moderate Democrats are angling for a more cautious, bipartisan approach, while Republicans and business groups are setting conditions for their cooperation, as fights brew over how to pay.The White House has said it is premature to talk about the shape of an infrastructure package, at least until Congress passes the relief bill. But this week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Democrats were already proceeding with the “recovery” part of Biden’s agenda.“Its’ an exciting time,” she said.Haunted by the slow-paced recovery that followed the financial collapse of 2008, when the Obama administration enacted a slimmed-down stimulus package amid fears of inflation and Republican objections to rising national debt, only to suffer major defeats in midterm elections, Democrats are eager to act boldly while they have unified control of Congress.“If you have an opportunity to go big, go big,” Beyer said. “You’re going to pay a political cost one way or the other, so you might as well get as much as you possibly can when you get the opportunity to do it.”Sean McElwee, co-founder and head of the progressive polling firm, Data for Progress, said it was good policy and good politics to pursue an ambitious economic agenda. Voters prioritize results over bipartisanship, he said, arguing that Democrats could defy political history in the 2022 congressional midterms if they act boldly on the economy.“Joe Biden understands that Democrats will be judged in 2022 by how he has handled the economy and the pandemic,” McElwee said, citing broad public support for the president’s relief plan and the enduring appeal of infrastructure spending. “The political benefits of going small just aren’t there any more.”Biden has held several high-profile meetings to build support for a bipartisan package, including with top officials, labor leaders and lawmakers involved in drafting infrastructure legislation.Ahead of his meeting with lawmakers on Thursday, Biden said the group, which included transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg, planned to discuss “what we’re going to do to make sure we, once again, lead the world across the board on infrastructure”.After spending decades in the Senate and eight years as vice-president to Barack Obama, Biden is plainly aware of the complex matrix of political and ideological considerations that have felled previous attempts to pass a major infrastructure bill. Yet since the onset of the pandemic, and the ensuing economic crisis, Biden has embraced a far more aspirational agenda that intentionally echoes the vision of Franklin Roosevelt, whose New Deal programs helped lift the country out of the Great Depression and transformed the role of government in American life. Despite his reputation for compromise and preference for bipartisanship, Biden largely rejected appeals from Republicans to dramatically shrink his $1.9tn stimulus package, which includes $1,400 payments to tens of millions of families, extended unemployment benefits as well as tens of billions of dollars for vaccine distribution and coronavirus testing. In pitching his relief plan, Biden has insisted that now is time to “go big,” and that the greater risk is doing too little, not too much. But as he looks beyond the immediate crisis, it remains unclear how the president will choose to proceed with the rest of his agenda. Progressives, largely encouraged by the opening weeks of his presidency, are now pressuring Biden to adopt the same go-it-alone approach for the rest of his agenda. Attempting to forge a consensus with Republicans, they warn, would almost certainly result in a bill that falls short of his campaign promises to address the deep-seated, structural inequalities in the economy exacerbated by the pandemic.“I think Biden understands that there is a real opportunity here to deliver lasting, legacy-defining improvements to America that otherwise would never get done,” said Faiz Shakir, who was the campaign manager for Bernie Sanders’ 2020 presidential run. “He wanted an FDR-modeled presidency and this would be a huge, huge investment in working people on a scale that we have not seen since FDR.”The urgency of the pandemic has helped fuse public opinion – and a factious Democratic caucus – around the need for a massive stimulus bill. But spending trillions more on infrastructure with initiatives that reach far beyond the present emergency is a different battle entirely, said Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.Biden campaigned on his plans to control the pandemic – and a promise to end hyper-partisanship in Washington. A plan that achieves neither goal could risk a “huge political backlash” beginning with the midterms next year, Galston said.“History is full of administrations who came to power, over-read their mandate and then went too far and evoked a reaction,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/419dc4e76797ddf8fb22ad6edcbddbbaffcdc6b8/0_127_3808_2284/master/3808.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=0b212a07622506b35e86b582bb835b73","title":"eu indecision led cyprus to allow in uk visitors says minister","story":"Tourism industry could not wait for clarity from Brussels about Covid-19 immunity certificatesCyprus’s decision to allow vaccinated Britons entry to the country ahead of the rest of the EU was spurred by the bloc’s reluctance to take a decisive stance on Covid-19 immunity certificates, the island’s deputy tourism minister has said.Explaining why the country had broken ranks with other EU members by deciding to admit Britons with the certificate from 1 May, Savvas Perdios told the  that visitors, holidaymakers, and the travel industry all “needed clarity”, which the step sought to deliver.“We felt that we had to announce it because we don’t know when an agreement will be reached at a European level,” said the politician in a telephone interview. “For people who are going to be travelling here, we wanted to provide certainty that Cyprus is going to be ready to welcome them. Travel planning requires certainty.”The move, unveiled late on Thursday, came as the bloc struggled to forge a united front on “vaccine passports” first proposed by Greece in January. Tourist-reliant countries on Europe’s south-east fringe appear increasingly willing to act independently as they desperately seek to salvage industries battered by the pandemic.Before the pandemic, Britons far surpassed all other arrivals to the former British colony, ethnically split between Greeks in the south and Turks in the north since 1974.An estimated 1.3 million UK tourists visited the south in 2019 – almost twice the local population. As in Greece, which had attracted record numbers before the pandemic but suffered a massive drop last year, tourism in Cyprus was pummelled in 2020. In February, Nicosia and Athens reached a deal with Israel allowing citizens with Covid-19 vaccination certificates to travel unimpeded between the three countries. The accord is expected to come into effect at the end of this month.Perdios said Anglo-Cypriot teams were already in talks to discuss the details of how vaccine passports would work as part of a similar bilateral agreement with the UK.“It’s a matter of technicalities as to what the certificate will look like. We’ll have further meetings in the next few days and weeks to finalise everything,” he said, emphasising that Greek Cypriot authorities were prepared to be flexible about what format the document eventually took. “We will use whatever the UK government wants us to use. It is the UK that will decide whether the certificate will be digital or whether it will be a certificate from a GP … We will not be asking to have a vaccine certificate based on our design.”Bookings to the island have risen since Boris Johnson announced his government’s roadmap out of England’s third national lockdown.Although 17 May was set as the earliest possible date for the resumption of international travel by the British leader, Perdios said Nicosia had also decided to include the UK in quarantine-free travel as of next month. Since the emergence of Covid-19 variants, all non-essential travel out of the UK has been banned, with rare exceptions.But with Greek Cypriot authorities mindful of the island’s large community of British expatriates, Perdios said anyone arriving from the UK as of 1 April would be given special dispensation in line with restrictions recently lifted for incomers from the EU. This week the island began accepting travellers based on a country categorisation system with colour codes defining the epidemiological caseload of each member state.Cyprus has said that inoculated visitors will have to have had two jabs, both approved by the European Medicines Agency.Tourists who contract the virus in the country will continue to be covered by the Cypriot government, with the state picking up “all costs” for them and their dependants in a repeat of a scheme initiated last year.“But we are not only opening up to vaccinated travellers,” Perdios added. “Everybody will be allowed to travel here, with or without certificates, and of course the date of travel depends on the UK government and when it decides to allow outbound travel.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8d8769cab8ab06fb2d8d4031bacabd17037fc5b/0_113_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f52ba0a4587b5d6e0320628926ab5556","title":"spanish farmers deeply split as ban on hunting wolves is extended","story":"The predators, protected in the south, are widely blamed for attacks on livestock but some think coexistence is possible“There have always been wolves. We humans have hunted and killed all the animals around us because we want everything for ourselves,” says Laura Serrano Isla, who tends her flock of 650 sheep near Burgos in north-west Spain.“We think we rule the world but if we kill all the rest of the animals, the wolf will come for our livestock.”Wolf hunting is already banned in the rest of Spain, where the creatures are practically nonexistent, but the impending extension of the ban has triggered a war of words between conservationists and farmers.After a decision taken last month by the environment ministry, protections for the Iberian wolf in the south of Spain will be extended north of the Douro river, where controlled hunting had still been allowed.“The environment ministry has declared total war against livestock farmers,” says Aurelio Pérez of the farmers association Coag in Castilla y León. “It will lead to the end of livestock farming here. As it is, in much of Castilla y León there are fewer inhabitants than in Amazonia, fewer than eight people per square kilometre.”The move to extend the ban was backed by Ascel, the association for the conservation of the Iberian wolf (Canis lupus signatus) and has the support of more than 400 scientists and the WWF, among others. Of Spain’s 17 regional governments, only Galicia, Castilla y León, Asturias and Cantabria, raised any objections during the consultation period that ended on 26 February.Coag claims wolves kill about 15,000 livestock a year at a cost of €5.5m. In some areas, farmers can claim compensation and according to Ascel €809,000 was paid out last year in Castilla y León.Luis Suárez, coordinator of conservation for the WWF in Spain, dismisses claims that the ban makes the coexistence between farmers and wolves impossible.“In many areas such as Zamora and Galicia a coexistence between wolves and farming has been achieved,” Suárez says. “No one really knows how much damage wolves do. In some places they don’t report attacks, in others they are exaggerated or even dishonest. Also, you have to put the losses in the context of the total population of 30 million cows, sheep and goats.”Fernando Rodríguez Tábara, a 22-year-old farmer who keeps 21 mastiff dogs to protect the 120 cows on his farm in Zamora, supports the hunting ban.“The wolf is good for us,” he says. “The wolf cleans up nature. They eat dead animals that would otherwise increase the risk of infection for livestock. The wolf is the intermediary between wild and domestic animals.”Keeping so many dogs is an expensive business, and food, vets’ bills and insurance cost between €6,000 and €7,000 a year but Rodríguez says he’d rather be ruined feeding dogs than feeding his cows to the wolves.Serrano agrees. “A farmer who takes care of his flock doesn’t have to fear the wolf,” she says. “Some want to hunt them because they don’t want to spend the money, others because they haven’t changed their ways in 40 years.“For there to be a coexistence we have to protect our livestock. If you have a bar, you close it up at night, right? Otherwise, you’ll get robbed. It’s the same with livestock.”Serrano says the government has to stump up the money to help farmers pay for fences and livestock-guarding dogs if it wants the wolf to survive and to prevent further depopulation of rural areas.“What farmers want isn’t payment, they want protection,” agrees Suárez. “We need a good programme at central government level to provide this.”However, this isn’t enough for some. “What we want is for the minister to resign,” says Pérez."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"CDP says number of Irish companies reporting is up from 31 to 47Reductions due to coronavirus pandemic will prove temporary, concludes global stocktake"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been almost a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 200,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,000 people have died.Globally, over 100 million people have been diagnosed and over 2.5\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Scientists have been racing to develop a vaccine that would bring an end to the pandemic, and there are now 64 different vaccines in clinical development, with another 173 in preclinical development, according to the World Health Organisation.Three of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer and another from Moderna.The EU has put in place purchase agreements with four other vaccines once they are approved for use - Sanofi-GSK, Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen) and Curevac. The bloc is also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva. 144,581 had received their second dose.Some 161,532 of these vaccines had gone to people in long term residential care facilities, while 235,590 had gone to frontline healthcare workers and 63,029 had gone to people over the age of 70.Globally, over 276 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine have been administered.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 5.4 million doses by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.Two doses of the vaccine, four weeks apart, are needed to offer the best protection against Covid. However, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc. While talks continue on how to increase production, the company has now committed to a total of 40 million doses for the EU in the first quarter of 2021.While the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab, resulting in a significant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.How many will Ireland get? 190,000 doses in February and a further 95,000 in early March - supply after this is not confirmed.Storage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Expected on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more, assuming it secures regulatory approval.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, paving the way for its availability in Ireland by April.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million dosesStorage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and expects to have its first results by April 2021. On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?In December the HSE published the provisional order in which people in Ireland will be vaccinated against Covid-19. After over-65s in care homes and frontline health workers, people aged 70 and older and other healthcare workers are next in line to receive the vaccine.The next categories are: people aged 65-69 years an ill-defined group referred to as “key workers” and people aged 18-64 with certain medical conditions. Next up will be: those living or working in crowded conditions people working in education those aged 55-64 workers in other occupations important to the functioning of society people aged between 18 and 54 and, finally, pregnant women and those under 18.As of March 2nd, 235,590 vaccines had gone to\u0026nbspfrontline healthcare workers, while 161,532 vaccines had gone to people in longterm residential healthcare facilities.The vaccination of people aged over 85 began on Monday, February 15th, with 63,029 shots\u0026nbspbeing administered so far, while those in the 70-84 age bracket should begin to receive their first dose by March 8th.The HSE has said everyone over the age of 70 should have received their second dose by mid-May.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4503398.1615022915!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"president releases photos of new dog misneach","story":"President Michael D.

Photograph: Getty ImagesFebruary 29th, 2020The first confirmed case of coronavirus in Ireland. The National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) confirms it is a “male in the eastern part\u0026nbspof the country” who has returned from an affected area in northern Italy. Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan said: “This is not unexpected. We have been preparing for this eventuality for many weeks now.”The last day of February 2020 in Ischgl was a day from heaven. The conditions were calm, windless. Against an azure blue sky, snowy white peaks dazzled like diamonds. Thousands of people arrived into the Pauznan Valley that day and made their way up to the skiing resort nestled at an altitude of 1,377 metres in the Austrian Alps.There may have been no avalanches or lenticular clouds but the tourists in their brightly-coloured jackets and ski goggles were walking into the eye of a deadly hurricane, one that would sweep its way across Europe within weeks. This storm might not have been visible but had already been raging here for days, if not weeks.In time, this small Austrian resort would become identified as the first super-spreader of Covid-19 in Europe, reckoned to have seeded many hundreds of cases in at least ten countries. And among those were dozens of early Irish cases.Ischgl is a swish and popular ski resort in the Tyrol region of southern Austria with 293km of ski runs, and 45 ski lifts, offering the highest quality skiing in the region. The local cable car company netted €80 million in 2019, making it the biggest operator in Austria.The resort has been popular with the Germans, Danes, Norwegians, Finns, British, Icelandic and Irish. It has not only been a magnet for its superlative ski runs. Its reputation as a lively apres-ski and party resort has also earned it the nickname ‘Ibiza on Ice’. No matter how clean the Alpine air might be, a crowded skiing resort with a crowded nightlife scene was a perfect petri dish for the spread of the new coronavirus.February 29th was a Saturday. That was the turnover day for the weekly packages, when one wave of tourists left and another arrived. Among the incoming skiers were dozens of Irish people, mostly arriving on Ryanair flights landing in the German airport of Memmingen.The first case of coronavirus had been notified in Ireland that day. But for those arriving from Dublin, Ischgl seemed a big remove from the hotspot of northern Italy.Eóin Wright from Kilmainham, Dublin was among a group of six from Ireland, all in their fifties, who arrived that day. On the same flight was another group of five friends, all from Munster, also in their fifties. They included Tipperary men Brendan Bourke and John Cormack, a former All-Ireland winning country hurler.March 1st, 2020The secondary school where the teenager was a pupil is closed down, with all parents and teachers being told to restrict their movements for 14 days.Case number one in Ireland was a second-level student from northern Dublin. The family had gone on a skiing holiday in Italy during the mid-term break earlier in February. At that stage the virus was associated with a handful of villages in northern Italy and not with the Alps. The family flew home through Bergamo Airport and spent a few hours there. It is likely it was there the infection occurred.At the time, the focus was on 11 small villages in that region and not the city. It was only later Bergamo became the epicentre of the virus in Italy with distressing images of overcrowded ICU units and coffins lined up outside morgues.When the family returned home, the number of cases in most European countries outside Italy could have been counted on the fingers of one hand. The official HSE advice then applied only to those who arrived from a high-risk region (China, Far East, Iran, and northern Italy), or were a close contact of a confirmed case. They were told to self-isolate and contact their GP only if they were experiencing symptoms. That advice would not change until the middle of March.The family read the HSE website on its return. Then one of the teenager’s siblings started developing symptoms, including fever. He was tested but was negative for Covid. In fact, he had caught the flu. Despite not displaying symptoms, the father insisted all be tested. It was then the other teenager was confirmed as a positive case.The authorities might have been preparing carefully for this moment for many weeks, but, given all the build-up and anticipation, it was not a surprise the first case became such an enormous media event. Looked at a year later and through the prism of so many cases and deaths since then, the decision to shut down the teenager’s school now seems excessive.But so did the coverage, which bordered on the hysterical, especially on social media where those unfortunate enough to contract the disease in the first weeks of March were subjected to a witch hunt on Twitter and Facebook. This is despite the fact they had followed all of the advice (which was to contact your GP only if you were displaying symptoms) and were blameless.As it happened, the teenager remained asymptomatic throughout his 14-day quarantine – which in itself was telling.March 2nd, 2020Ireland remains in a containment phase, with one confirmed case currently in isolation and contact tracing is underway.Eóin Wright is a strong skier. The 53-year old father of three had been going to Ischgl for 15 years because of its superb and technical ski runs.“It’s more for advanced skiers. There was a group of six of us, from 53 to 57, all good skiers. Before we left Covid was not really an issue in Ireland. It was in Italy of course, but not in Austria we thought.”Ischgl has a reputation as a party resort. But for Wright and his friends, it was all about skiing. “We were not big apres-ski people. We had a few nights out but for us we had gone there to ski.”Brendan Bourke and his friends were also experienced skiers, enjoying the slopes during the day and the social life in restaurants and bars later on.Today, Bourke recalls the bars so crowded that staff had to blow whistles to get through the throngs.In an interview with the German media organisation Der Spiegel, his friend John Cormack talked about visiting Nikis Stadl bar, which was the source of a large cluster where the crowd sang along to German pop songs. The atmosphere does not vary from year to year. Nor do the songs – he knew the words of some of the German songs from previous visits. “You know what you are going to get,” he said.March 3rd, 2020A second case of coronavirus has been confirmed in the east of Ireland. The case is a female and is associated with travel from Italy. All non-essential travel to four regions in Italy is now being advised against. The previous advice was limited to 11 specific towns in the region.Some believe, even argue, the coronavirus was in Ireland much earlier than late February. However, Dr Cillian de Gascún, director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory says: “The first laboratory confirmed case was on February 29. We started testing on February 7. We had been testing for the guts of a month and had not detected anything,” he says.One unusual case emerged in Cork. An elderly man in hospital since February died in March. He was subsequently found to have been positive for Covid-19. That gave rise to a suspicion the virus might have been in the country at an earlier stage. Subsequently, it emerged the man visited a restaurant in Cork also visited by a person recently returned from Italy. Transmission happened there, it is believed.If that was so, it might merely have pushed the date back a few days, rather than weeks and months. The weight of evidence shows the first cases in Ireland were associated with skiers returning from the Alps in Italy, France and Austria. But because many displayed no symptoms upon returning to Ireland, they might not have been tested as early as they could have been.This was a new virus. And it behaved very differently from previous iterations. In the initial states, asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission did not feature in the descriptions. The focus was on droplets and hand-washing, not aerosols. Face masks were not seen as necessary. There was no reference to a tell-tale sign, the loss of taste and smell.The knowledge of its characteristics reminded you a little of JK Galbraith’s famous quote on the 1929 Wall Street Crash: “They did not know that they did not know.”Connolly uses a colourful metaphor to put it in context. “The whole purpose of a virus is to perpetuate. If it kills you in the first five days, it is a boy racer virus and kills itself out.”She contrasts Covid-19 (Sars-CoV-2) with the earlier Sars virus, which caused 8,000 cases and killed 800 people between 2002 and 2004. It was successfully contained.Connolly explains: “With Sars 1 people began to show symptoms after day five, and they did not become infectious until after that. That gave you a window of time where you could isolate and quarantine.“But with this one it begins transmitting before people get sick, which is like the flu. A key ability of this virus is to transmit presymptomatically and asymptomatically.”De Gascún agrees: We were learning from our experience of the original Sars in 2002 and 2003 where viral loading increased over time with the duration of illness and people were only infectious with the onset of symptoms.“If we had known that earlier that would have had an impact on how we tackled things. Certainly, for example, the guidance around mask wearing changed when we realised that presymptomatic infection was a factor and people could have a high viral load before the onset of symptoms.”Laboratory testing confirmed the provenance of the early cases were from Europe.March 4th, 2020Four new cases are confirmed in Ireland. The patients have all returned from skiing holidays in northern Italy.As the Irish groups continue their skiing holidays, a development in Iceland changes everything for Ischgl. Groups of Icelandics who had been in the Austrian resort arrived back. Eventually 21 of them would test positive for Covid-19, and the country’s chief epidemiologist Dr Torolfur Gudnason declared Ischgl a “high risk area”.The Icelandic authorities contact their counterparts in the region. However, one of the Icelandic skiers refers to the possibility of being infected by a passenger he sat near on the flight returning from Italy. The Austrian authorities seize on that line to talk down the possibility of Ischgl being a hotspot. Local business interests do not want to shorten the season.Later that week, a Norwegian barman at a Ischgl restaurant tests positive. Fifteen colleagues subsequently do so, too. The restaurant was visited by both Irish groups who feature in this article.Soon new clusters emerged in Sweden, Germany, Denmark and Norway. All are traced back to Ischgl. Norway estimated 500 cases could be linked directly or indirectly to the resort.The Irish skiers – like all the holiday makers there – remain largely oblivious to the danger. Cormack told Der Spiegel his wife sent him a Whatsapp message on the 4th saying Iceland considered it a hotspot. They turn on the TV, but there is no reference to Ischgl on any channel.March 5th, 2020Seven new cases are confirmed. Four are linked to travel from northern Italy. There are now 13 confirmed cases in the State.Dr Roger McMorrow is an anaesthetist and clinical director of the National Maternity Hospital. He is admired for his ability to organise. The new coronavirus had been playing on his mind since he saw the first images from Wuhan in December. He organised a few meetings in work and on February 12th sent a general email to all staff on preparation.Like most hospitals, Holles Street did not have an plan in place that could cope with the storm that was coming. For one, there were critical shortages of PPE. “We had 100 SSP2 (surgical masks). That would not last one day dealing with a coronavirus patient,” he said.The hospital had one negative pressure ventilation room (where exhausted air is driven out). The emergency department, single rooms, a ward and a theatre complex were converted to negative pressure rooms. “Babies will keep coming. So we needed a normal obstetrics service. We cancelled gynaecology and used the rooms as a coronavirus ward.”It was done on a wing and a prayer. With PPE shortages, medical staff tried to wash and autoclave (sterilise) visors and gowns. Staff were limited to wearing face masks in certain areas.McMorrow put out an appeal on Twitter in the early days, and a company in Magherafelt that made blinds, developed a visor that the hospital could use. It arrived well before the first big deliveries from China.The hospital ultimately dealt (successfully) with three very sick patients, all of whom came though, with one baby being delivered early.A tenth, or slightly more, of the hospital’s staff were infected with the virus. As close contacts had to isolate, there were times when a fifth of all staff were absent. “That was a real burden”, he says.“Paradoxically, professionally, it was an extraordinary time to be a doctor. Everything you prepared for in your life led up to this point. It was a massive challenge, but all the normal barriers were removed. I had thought the HSE was not dynamic, but it stuck by everybody and put the shoulder to the wheel.”It was the first time in his career that Cillian de Gascún had seen a new virus emerge and watch it grow. “I was in training for Sars 1 and it never really came here. It has been interesting to watch the virus emerge and evolve and develop.”The virus has become more efficient. “It did take this virus some time to find its feet in humans. It was not readily transmissible. We have seen over the intervening 12 months it has attained a reproductive number of between 4 and 6 whereas seasonal influenza is down at 1.4“That is what has struck me. This virus has identified a new host, crossed the species barrier, managed to transmit and really travelled around the world in a short period of time,” he said.“To my mind there is no reason to believe it will not become an endemic virus. It is unlikely with vaccination we will be able to eliminate it. We have only really managed that with smallpox and one of the polio virus types.“It is not something that happens readily and with an R number of between four and six, it will be difficult to do especially when you have an asymptomatic transmission stage.”March 6th 2020Five new confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Ireland. Three are associated with travel. Involved in pandemic planning in recent years, Connolly says everyone was taken aback by the level of disruption, and its impact.New pandemics are possible. A century has passed since the Spanish flu, but there should be no complacency that it will take a century for the next one to arrive. “The one positive thing is there has been immense advances in vaccine technology and diagnostics and that will stand to us in the next pandemic,” she says.March 7th 2020One new case is confirmed – a man who returned from northern Italy. There are now 19 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Ireland.Eóin Wright and his five friends arrive home from Ischgl. All are feeling fine. “We heard about the Covid cases in Ireland and checked the HSE website just to be safe. Ischgl was not on the watchlist. There was nothing to be worried about.” Wright returned to work in the hairdressing salon he owns in Dublin. He was feeling 100 per cent.Then on Monday night the group got a call from their host in Ischgl to tell them that 12 staff in the restaurant they visited had tested positive.Wright looked at the website and saw that only those who were symptomatic should self-isolate. He rang a GP friend, Dave Coffey, who gave sage advice it might be best to take a week off work just as a precaution. It was just as well. On Thursday, one of the six tested positive. Wright sought a test on Friday. By Saturday he was beginning to feel ill.“All six of us got Covid,” he says. “Two got sick. Two were asymptomatic. One got headaches. One lost his sense of taste and smell. I was one of the two who got sick. I went downhill quickly with a high temperature, headaches, aches and lethargy. I was sick for 12 days.“There were 12 people in the salon and 20 clients that had to be tested. Everybody was negative which was a relief, as were my parents who are elderly.”A year later, Wright is still overcoming long Covid symptoms. He has had back problems and his sense of taste and smell have only come back in the last six weeks.He does not particularly blame Ischgl. “I don’t know if anybody at the time knew how bad it was or how dangerous it would be,” he said.Out of Brendan Bourke and John Cormack’s group, five got Covid. Bourke began to show symptoms after three days home. Like Wright, recovery has been show, with taste and smell back only in recent weeks.“I looked at the website for Ischgl a week after coming back. It showed people still on the slopes. I could not believe it. We were there when they got the warnings, and they tried to blame it on some guy coming from a plane going to Italy,” he says.He worried about who he had been in contact with when he was presymptomatic. Thankfully, he deliberately stayed away from his 91-year old mother. She celebrated her 92nd birthday at the end of February.But it was uncanny. Of the 11 people in the two groups, all tested positive.Cillian de Gascún says travel plays a key role and highlights the need for controlling importations. But he also points out that focusing exclusively on travel is too simplistic. Skiing trips did seed Ireland’s first cases, but the virus would have come in another way, even though the tempest would have been a little later coming.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics is affordable housing achievable","story":"In January, the Affordable Housing Bill was published by Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Darragh O’Brien.

So if you\u0027ve been infected before and then get your first dose of the vaccine, you have a really excellent response to that single dose compared to someone that wasn\u0027t infected before.Last month, researchers from Mount Sinai Hospital, in New York, found that people with prior infection had between 10 and 20 times more antibodies after their first vaccination than those who had never had the virus. The authors said those with a previous infection would be unlikely to need a second dose and jab supplies could be erted elsewhere.The University of Maryland, in the US, also found a greater antibody response in healthcare workers who had previously been infected after vaccination.Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology and infectious disease at the University of Edinburgh, said: Both papers suggest that people who have had a PCR confirmed covid-19 infection may only require one dose of the vaccine. Certainly, this would appear to provide them with protection that is at least as good as two doses of vaccine. However, incorporating this into a mass vaccination programme may be logistically complex and it may be safer, overall, to ensure that everyone gets two doses.Lawrence Young, a virologist and professor of molecular oncology, at the University of Warwick, said: If future work can confirm this high level of immunity post a single mRNA vaccine in this group of iniduals, this could become a viable option when there are concerns around vaccine supply.The King\u0027s research showed that women were twice as likely as men to suffer side effects from the Pfizer jab and around 50 per cent more likely from the AstraZeneca vaccine.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"roy greenslade inside story fleet street editor ira","story":"The IRA weapons dump at a remote spot in the Welsh countryside was thought to be intended for a Christmas bombing campaign on the British mainland.In the autumn of 1989 the Sunday Times had heard that police were keeping watch on the secret cache but, with the agreement of Scotland Yard, had chosen not to publish details of its existence. The authorities needed more time.But more than 30 years on there are now questions being asked about whether the information on the weapons dump and other Sunday Times investigations into the IRA stayed within its newsroom.It emerged last week that one of its most senior executives at the time was secretly supporting the IRA, covertly cheering the terrorist group on from behind the office walls and condoning its bombing campaign that murdered innocent civilians both on the mainland and in Northern Ireland.In an article, Roy Greenslade revealed that while working at the heart of Fleet Street he had been secretly devoted to the paramilitary cause, and may even have tried to meddle with his own newspaper coverage to try and discredit the British armed forces.Writing under a pseudonym, Greenslade had contributed articles to a Sinn Féin pamphlet, attacking the British government.And perhaps most troublingly of all, Greenslade revealed that he had enjoyed close relationships with senior Republican leaders, and even spent his family Christmases with a senior Sinn Féin activist named as a member of the IRA’s Army Council.“In a sense, I guess I employed what might be called journalistic entryism,” Greenslade wrote in last week’s British Journalism Review. The 74-year-old added that he had been “in complete agreement about the right of the Irish people to engage in armed struggle” – even as the newspapers he worked for denounced the IRA’s terror campaigns.“I came to accept that the fight between the forces of the state and a group of insurgents was unequal and therefore could not be fought on conventional terms,” Greenslade wrote. “In other words, I supported the use of physical force.”Greenslade left the Sunday Times in 1990, and after a short stint as editor of the Daily Mirror, spent much of the following 28 years as a media columnist for , frequently berating other journalists for perceived ethical misdeeds.Greenslade was also hired as professor of journalism at City University of London, where students paid £9,000 a year for a course which included his lectures on how journalists should behave. Later he gave evidence to the Leveson Inquiry.But the journalists who worked under Greenslade are now concerned that he may have been guilty of far worse than hypocrisy.  Instead, they say his admissions raise serious questions about whether intelligence on IRA activities may have found its way to the Republican leadership. Others say Greenslade would have been privy to Government briefings while editing the Daily Mirror in the early 1990s.David Leppard worked as crime correspondent at the Sunday Times under Greenslade in the late 1980s, reporting weekly on the IRA campaign of bombings and assassinations, and later led the newspaper’s Insight investigations team.“The entire thing is scandalous. Roy has questions to answer,” Leppard told The  this week.“We were getting information, which we were relaying to Roy in advance of publication about police operations, security service information. Much of that information we couldn’t publish because it would compromise active investigations,” he said.“There always were discussions in the office when Roy was the managing editor about surveillance operations, technical details around IRA mortars engineering, about the type of explosives they were using, about the sources of supply from the Republic and Northern Ireland into the mainland, about police surveillance operations, about current investigations on people who had been arrested, fingerprint analysis on bus tickets, all sorts of stuff.“Quite frankly, if I had known what I now know, I would have refused to do that job. It would have been potentially compromising my sources, but also national security. Not to be pompous, but people were dying.”Leppard remembered one instance when reporters got wind of a surveillance operation codenamed Pebble on a suspected IRA arms dump in Pembrokeshire, but kept the information quiet for weeks after Scotland Yard imposed a news blackout. In December 1989 armed police made their move, arresting two IRA operatives and uncovering a cache containing 100lb of Semtex explosives, detonators, and heavy automatic weapons. The head of Scotland Yard’s anti-terrorist branch later said the store was likely intended for a Christmas bombing campaign.“That was the kind of thing we knew about, but didn’t publish,” Leppard said.“The fact that police arrested the two men might suggest that the IRA didn’t know they were watching. But we knew that the IRA had a very concentrated and forensic information-gathering exercise about what the police knew about them. They had a counterintelligence department, obviously, counter surveillance techniques. They would have wanted to know the kind of information that we had,” he said.“Roy is claiming to be some sort of entryist on behalf of the IRA into the media, and I’ve covered a lot of intelligence stories in my life. And we all know an entryist is a double-sided operation where the person infiltrates an organisation and then reports back to the handler.“Roy had access to highly classified information. And if he wanted to be an agent inside the heart of the British establishment, in order to obtain information about what the security apparatus knew about the IRA, it’s difficult to see a better position to be in.“I’m extremely alarmed about the prospect that information we may have acquired from the most confidential of all sources might have found its way somehow to the very people that we were investigating.”Greenslade discussed the period in an interview with the British Museum in 2007, unearthed by The .“Various people in the office had MI5 contacts. And it was quite amusing to watch them all come up with different stories from each MI5 contact, none of whom were ever named to us,” he said.Less amusingly, in 1983, a 24-year-old journalist named Philip Geddes was killed by an IRA bomb outside Harrods. Christopher Wilson, an author and broadcaster who helped set up a memorial fund in his memory, this week asked whether Greenslade may have information about those connected with terrorist acts.Greenslade told The  that he categorically denied passing on any information to the IRA, adding that he never had access to classified state secrets. “I was an intellectual supporter, not a practical one,” he added. Indeed, some of Greenslade’s other colleagues at the time – including his former boss – doubt that he passed on any significant information to his associates in the IRA.Andrew Neil, editor of the Sunday Times from 1983 to 1994 and a staunch unionist, told The : “I find it hard to see how he could have had any influence.” The newspaper had a track record of investigating the IRA, naming first Gerry Adams as the IRA’s chief of staff, and then Thomas ‘Slab’ Murphy as its senior organiser in the 1990s, and attracted criticism for its attempts to undermine the TV documentary Death on the Rock over the shooting of an IRA terror cell by the SAS in Gibraltar in 1988.Greenslade by his own admission tried to interfere with the Sunday Times’s coverage by calling one of his own reporters in a fake Irish accent, relaying a bizarre tip that SAS soldiers had boasted to an airline captain in a hotel bar that they had known the men were unarmed. Greenslade later admitted in the British Museum interview that he had been handed the information by a “Republican contact”, adding: “I did my little bit to try and get at the truth.”Peter Hounam, the Sunday Times reporter who Greenslade attempted to hoodwink with his fake Irish accent, told the Press Gazette yesterday: “Setting aside my Gibraltar investigation, my concern is now that our wider investigations into the Troubles may have been compromised if, as Roy says, he was so close to paramilitaries.”“We knew he had a Trotskyite view. We didn’t know he was an IRA supporter. He might have had Republican sympathies but he never tried to force them on the paper.”The greater worry was “Roy’s ability to embellish stories. You could take the guy out of The Sun but never The Sun out of the guy,” said Neil of Greenslade’s move from the tabloid to his broadsheet newspaper, adding: “In the history of British journalism he doesn’t even merit a footnote. Those who worked with him more closely than me, when they saw he had become professor of journalism on ethics, said it was akin to Henry Kissinger winning the peace prize.”Greenslade explained in his recent article how he was first drawn to the IRA cause in the early 1970s, after a “a quick-fire educational tour” of Belfast and Londonderry while working for The Daily Mail.Later he met an Irish journalist, Noreen Taylor, who at the time was distributing pamphlets for Clann na hÉireann, an IRA-supporting group for Irish emigrants. Her parents were staunch Catholics who had moved to Glasgow from County Donegal so that her father could find work as a bricklayer during the Troubles. She was “imbued with a Republican spirit,” Greenslade wrote last week.Taylor was already married to a senior journalist at the Daily Mirror, and Greenslade’s short first stint at the paper – before he returned as editor, and later admitted fixing a £1m Spot the Ball competition – was cut short when her angry husband confronted him in the newsroom.Soon afterwards on a trip to Ireland, Taylor, now Greenslade’s partner, introduced him to Patrick Doherty, who later became vice chairman of Sinn Féin and was once named in Parliament as a member of the IRA’s Army Council.“My first kiss of Donegal in June 1971 turned that youthful infatuation into a full-blooded love affair,” Greenslade later wrote of the visit.“I closed my eyes. I had already fallen for Noreen. I knew I was falling in love with her homeland too.“Back in Britain days later, I haunted bookshops, reading everything I could find about Ireland – history, politics, topography, literature, mythology, poetry and especially everything about Donegal.“I searched in vain for an Irish connection. My mother thought there had been talk of my great-grandmother being Irish. If she was, we could find no proof. Did my name offer a clue? In Olde English, I discovered it was grene slaed, which means ‘dweller in the green valley’. Well, in Donegal there were green valleys galore.”Greenslade’s IRA sympathies grew deeper after the events of Bloody Sunday in January 1972. As he rose through the Fleet Street ranks, however, Greenslade decided to keep his views on Ireland to himself.“I needed a wage because I was on the verge of taking a mortgage,” he wrote. “Better, then, to button my lip and carry on... to own up to supporting Irish Republicans would result in my losing my job.”Greenslade moved in with Taylor and her young son and daughter (Hollywood actress Natasha McElhone) and the pair later married. Family Christmases were spent at the Dohertys’ home in Donegal. Eventually, in 1989, the couple decided to buy their own house nearby, but the local police were aware of Greenslade’s IRA connections and did not give the family a warm welcome.“I have fantastic sympathies with the Irish Republican movement and lots of our friends are drawn from that,” Greenslade said in the British Museum interview.“Being friendly with the vice president of Sinn Féin, our closest friend there, drew some unwelcome attention from some people. Within the town, it was well known. I don’t think the guards, which is what they call the police in Ireland, were my best friends then.”Greenslade admitted in last week’s article that while working on Fleet Street he was secretly writing articles for An Phoblacht, Sinn Féin’s media outlet, under the pseudonym George King (‘King George’ reversed).An Phoblacht used a number of fake bylines, to give the impression of a much larger staff of volunteers and was edited and laid out from Sinn Féin’s headquarters in Parnell Square in Dublin.One source suggested that Greenslade wrote editorials, not just articles.“He was Johnny on the Spot as far as events in London went, like the mortar attack on John Major’s cabinet during the first Gulf War, and the Brixton jail escape in 1991,” the source added.One source claimed that Greenslade’s other associates at the time included Jimmy ‘Mortars’ Monaghan, who reportedly gained his nickname due to his skill in manufacturing homemade mortars and once served as head of the IRA’s engineering section. Greenslade denies this.Perhaps Greenslade’s most mysterious friendship, however, was with the suspected Hyde Park bomber John Downey. Identified as a suspect a month after the 1982 bombing that killed four British soldiers, Downey had been convicted of IRA membership in May 1974, and was also wanted in connection with a car bomb that killed two UDR members in August 1972.After police put his face on a wanted poster, Downey was reported to have led a shadowy existence during the 1980s, moving between Republican safe houses. Later he opened an oyster farm near a village in Donegal, close to Greenslade’s home.During the collapse of Downey’s eventual trial in 2014, it was revealed that Greenslade had stood surety for him when he was granted bail. The journalist bought his oysters from Downey, the court heard.In last week’s article, Greenslade insisted: “John was, and is, a Donegal neighbour. All I know of him is his dedication to peace.”Family members of the Hyde Park victims, however, believe Greenslade has questions to answer over his friendship with Downey, and his links to the IRA.In a letter seen by The , the brother of 19-year-old trooper Simon Tipper, who was killed in the attack a fortnight after his wedding, urges Boris Johnson to back a police investigation into Greenslade’s activities.“Greenslade is, of course, entitled to express his political opinion and support for Irish Republicanism. However, his glorification of and support for terrorist violence is dangerous and it appears to me to be potentially criminal,” Mark Tipper writes.“I would like to ask for your support to ensure that all necessary and appropriate investigations are carried out into whether, in his position as the editor of a national newspaper and a senior executive on other newspapers including the Sunday Times, Greenslade might have provided material support to the IRA by passing it confidential and sensitive information.”In a statement issued to The , Greenslade said: “I was not privy to any classified information. I was an office-bound executive with no contact personally or by phone with any person from the security services. So, it follows that I didn’t pass any such information to anyone.“I categorically deny passing any information to the IRA at any time. I didn’t have any information to pass on. I was an intellectual supporter, not a practical one.”But a Whitehall source signalled tacit support for an investigation into Greenslade last night, suggesting that his activities “cannot be overlooked”.“Roy Greenslade recently admitting he supported IRA terrorism during the Troubles is abhorrent and an insult to the families of all those who were killed at the hands of the IRA,” the source said.“The fact he had until relatively recently been teaching media ethics to journalism students is bitterly ironic. His shameful duplicity cannot be overlooked.”After years of furious denials, former  editor Alan Rusbridger has finally condemned Roy Greenslade.In a statement, Rusbridger said Greenslade – who for 28 years used his pages to lecture the rest of Fleet Street on ethics – should have been more honest about his “obnoxious” support for the IRA.Greenslade ought to have been “frank about his own political beliefs and attachments” when publishing articles on Northern Ireland, he added.But the idea that Rusbridger was in the dark about Greenslade’s beliefs may come as a surprise to his critics.More than 20 years ago, an article in The Spectator magazine alleged that there was an “IRA cell” at , with Greenslade at its heart.The piece by Stephen Glover claimed that the paper’s pro-IRA leanings were evident in its editorials, often critical of British government policy.Other members of the cell allegedly included Georgina Henry, the paper’s deputy editor, who died in 2014. At the time, Rusbridger responded furiously, issuing a long statement denying reported aspects of Greenslade’s friendship with former Sinn Féin vice president Pat Doherty, and insisting that Henry had never written leading articles for the paper.The Spectator refused to apologise, instead running an interview with Ronan Bennett – Henry’s partner, a former Republican anarchist turned screenwriter and a close friend of Rusbridger’s, who co-wrote a BBC drama with him on genetic engineering in 2000 – conducted by the magazine’s then-editor, Boris Johnson.When Johnson asked Bennett whether he would turn in the Omagh bombers if he found out who they were, the reply was “No.”In the intervening years, Greenslade’s columns and blogs frequently appeared to reflect his Republican sympathies, including “BBC programme used anonymous single source to smear Gerry Adams” in 2016, and “The IRA hunger strike and Fleet Street’s graveyard of truth” in 2011.A  insider said this week that the newspaper regularly hosted “Shinners” – members of Sinn Féin – and that “Martin McGuinness was a regular in the editor’s office” during the Alan Rusbridger years. “It is no secret Shinners were in and out the offices,” the journalist told The .Rusbridger had also been aware of criticism aimed at Greenslade after he openly criticised an alleged IRA rape victim, accusing her of hiding an anti-Sinn Féin bias.In a 2014  column, Greenslade questioned the claims made by Máiría Cahill in an award-winning BBC documentary, suggesting that she had “only sought to go public with her sexual abuse allegations after she had turned against the organisation for political reasons”.The BBC has contacted Greenslade for a response. In a statement this week,  said it had received a complaint from Cahill and “is investigating this issue”.“The readers’ editor will also be reviewing other historical Roy Greenslade articles concerning Northern Ireland, to ensure that they meet ’s editorial standards and are sufficiently transparent,” a spokesman said.Greenslade insisted that he “did nothing more than the scores of journalists who keep their political views to themselves”.Read more: My friend was murdered by my boss’s mates in the IRA More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bidens democrats arent moderate","story":"It is interesting to watch what the Democrats in the US have been doing now that they have control of so many of the levers of government. A large part of the appeal of Joe Biden in his run to be President was that he represented the centrist tradition in the Democratic Party. Recognising a weakness during the race, Donald Trump constantly tried to weigh Biden down by connecting him with the wildest fringes of the American Left, especially those who have made it into Congress in recent years.Trump’s warnings may have been good for his own base, but they did not sufficiently persuade the rest of the country. Biden just seemed like the sort of moderate the country could do with for a while.The reality already appears to be somewhat different. For instance, on Wednesday the House of Representatives passed a bill called the “George Floyd justice in Policing Act”. Among much else, the bill seeks to end racial and religious profiling” and end the legal doctrine that protects officers from lawsuits brought against them by members of the public. Some of what the bill proposes is sensible and overdue. But parts of it are simply going to make the job of the American police even harder than it already is. All driven by the far-Left’s desire to punish every police force in America for the actions (for which he is now awaiting trial) of one police officer in Minnesota.As it happens, the problem in American policing at present is not that the country suffers from a surfeit of officers who can be pushed around with ease. Trained men and women have been leaving police forces in droves over the past year, and cities like Chicago have already seen the escalation in homicides that results whenever the US police are put on the back foot.A pragmatic Left would attempt to improve police training while defending the police. An ideologically motivated one would allow anti-police rhetoric to make its way from the radical Left and into law.President Biden may be the smiling centrist, but the months to come will show whether it is his hand that is truly on the tiller.One of the most reliable rules in life is known as O’Sullivan\u0027s law. It states that all organisations which do not actively define as Right-wing will drift Left-wards in time. In no area is this more pronounced than among NGOs (non-governmental organisations). In recent decades nearly every NGO I can think of has drifted seamlessly and endlessly to the Left: Oxfam, Save the Children, Human Rights Watch. It is harder to think of an organisation the law does not apply to than the endless number to which it does.But nowhere are the results so pronounced as they are with Amnesty International. In principle its aims and objectives are laudable. Certainly Amnesty has done some good in its past. But again and again it falls prey to the Leftwards drift, ending up in a wasteland where it cannot discern right from wrong.In 2010 there was a minor disturbance within the organisation when the head of its “gender unit” Gita Sahgal resigned in protest over Amnesty’s partnerships with the extremist group Cage. That group may be marginal but it is made up of some pretty radical Islamists. Sahgal thought that Amnesty oughtn’t to be sharing platforms with such people. Amnesty disagreed. However, in 2015 one of Cage’s leaders praised Mohammed Emwazi as “a beautiful young man”. At this stage Emwazi was better known as “Jihadi John” because he was decapitating prisoners in Iraq and Syria on behalf of Isil. This was strong meat even for Amnesty, and so this link between Amnesty and Cage was briefly severed.Now it is back on, with Amnesty and Cage once again reunited as partners, in a campaign against the Shawcross Review of Prevent. Meantime, Amnesty has dropped Putin critic Alexei Navalny from its “prisoners of conscience” listing. The reason Amnesty has given is that it is horrified by “xenophobic” comments which Navalny made many years back. It is an interesting standard this: where Putin’s critics cannot be prisoners of conscience, but Isil’s buddies are perfectly suitable partners.

We will try to make it as smooth and hassle-free as possible. They can book flights and start choosing the places where they want to go.”Despite the minister’s optimism, the Covid-19 situation in Greece is not good. The number of new cases is on the rise. On Wednesday, 2,700 new cases were recorded – the highest daily number so far this year.On Thursday, there were another 2,200 new cases, along with 35 deaths. It is thought the more contagious British variant of the virus is to blame.Some popular tourist islands are currently considered to be at particularly high risk, including Rhodes, Evia, Lefkada and Samos.“We do have resurgent numbers but there are not as many deaths because the vaccine is starting to bite,” the minister said.“In November, during the second wave, we had around 3,000 cases and about 125 deaths a day. Now we are seeing around 2,500 new cases each day but only about 25 to 30 deaths. We are beginning to see that the strategy is working and I don’t see why it won’t continue to work.”Announcing on Thursday the administering of one million doses, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the prime minister, said: “Every week that passes, we are building the wall of immunity that will allow us to leave behind this ordeal.” He said Greece was “at the beginning of the end” of the pandemic.Mr Mitsotakis was one of the first European leaders to propose the idea of coronavirus passports as a way of allowing people to travel again.Greece is heavily reliant on tourism, with its total contribution to the country’s GDP estimated to be as high as 25 per cent.Last year, tourism revenues were nearly 80 per cent down compared to the 2019 season, amounting to a loss of €14 billion.On Kastellorizo, a tiny island that lies just off the coast of Turkey, vaccination of the whole population is due to be completed by mid-March.“We already feel relieved,” Michael-Stratos Amygdalos, the deputy mayor, told The . “Before, we lived in anxiety and agony”.Kastellorizo has only had one Covid-19 case, detected in a soldier stationed on the island.But for such a remote location, which does not have a hospital, vaccination is vital, particularly with the prospect of tourists arriving in the summer.Greece’s vaccination roll-out has been dogged by supply problems, as well as allegations of nepotism.Last week, the deputy mayor of Thessaloniki and the head of the city council were dismissed after allegedly arranging for their families to be vaccinated, using shots that were meant for the elderly and people with disabilities.Despite the recent surge in cases, particularly in big cities such as Athens and Thessaloniki, some islanders are chafing under Greece’s months-long lockdown.The island of Amorgos, in the Cyclades, has had no recorded cases of Covid-19 since the beginning of the pandemic.Yet schools and shops are closed, daily curfews are in place and residents are obliged to wear masks in outside spaces.“We have zero cases. Why is the high school not open?” said Maria Nomikou, who runs a bar on the island, which is famous as the setting for the Luc Besson film The Big Blue about the rivalry between two champion free ers.The government came under fire last year for botching the opening up of tourism during the summer.At the peak of the holiday season, restrictive measures came into place in many island destinations, forcing visitors to leave or cancel their holidays.The Greek government was later accused by doctors and opposition politicians of fudging coronavirus numbers, endangering the health of both islanders and tourists.The government was also accused of not properly testing visitors who flew into Greece and of failing to institute health measures that could have curtailed the spread of the virus.The question of whether opening up tourism under these conditions is what led to the resurgence of Covid-19 in the autumn, a second wave that is still continuing, has been the topic of intense debate between the government, medical professionals and opposition parties.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"future hong kong beijing targets independent judiciary fierce","story":"This article is the first in our three-part series, The Future of Hong Kong, looking at how much has changed since the first protests against Beijing\u0027s extradition bill two years ago.Martin Lee, a respected Hong Kong barrister, had just finished his Saturday morning walk around Hong Kong’s Victoria Park when seven police officers arrived at his door to arrest him.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"give students second freshers week help make friends top psychiatrist","story":"Students should be given a second ‘freshers’ week’ when they return to university this summer to help them make friends again, a top psychiatrist has said.Some undergraduates may find it difficult to socialise with peers after spending a prolonged period of time in semi-isolation, according to the president of Royal College of Psychiatrists.Dr Adrian James said university students have been “particularly badly affected” by the pandemic and that their struggles with mental health have increased “significantly” over the past year.During the autumn term multiple coronavirus outbreaks on campus meant that social activities were curtailed and thousands of students were forced to self-isolate in their halls of residence.As the term went on, many universities cancelled in-person lectures in favour of online learning, leaving students largely confined to their bedrooms.Since January, the majority of students have been told to stay at home rather than return to campus, and continue their studies remotely during the national lockdown.Only those taking degrees in a select group of subjects - such as medicine, dentistry, veterinary sciences and social work - were told they are allowed to return to university where face-to-face lectures resumed at the start of term.On Monday, students taking practical courses who need access to specialist facilities and equipment are allowed to go back to campus. But all other students have been told to wait until at least the end of the Easter holidays, when the Government will “review options”.Dr James said that while some students will find it easy to get back into university life and into the habit of socialising, others will have a tougher time.“Depending on how the pandemic has affected them, some will find it incredibly difficult,” he told The Sunday . “They will have missed out on a lot of those helpful things that students get when they start university.“You might need to recreate some of that - almost do a freshers week for everyone and get the whole system up and running, get the get people used to meeting with each other, linking up with each other and linking up with the support they can get at university.”He said universities must be ready to help students meet one another by organising and facilitating social events and activities.“Those who are not naturally very sociable and have got into a pattern of not having contact with people, and that has been enforced, and actually then suddenly moving to a situation where there is a potential to meet lots of people - I think some need very particular support,” Dr James said.“Some students will have had a virtual experience but absolutely no experience at all of meeting people face to face.”He went on to say that universities should set up formal “buddying” systems, where students are partnered with someone in the year above them who can help to show them the ropes.Dr James said that university psychiatry societies have reported that students have been “sorely affected by the disruption and that their experience of mental illness has increased significantly”.“They are at a formative time of their lives and they are missing out so much of the sort of things that help them grow as a person,” he said.“They have been mucked around and throughout the whole of the pandemic they have faced a lot of uncertainty and unpredictability.

This is just the beginning.NASA engineers said they were studying possible routes for longer rover voyages on the surface of Mars.A slightly longer trip was planned for Friday, and perhaps another Saturday if all goes well, NASA said.The rover can cover 200 meters per Martian day, which is slightly longer than a day on Earth.And it goes five times faster than Curiosity, its predecessor, which is still functioning eight years after landing on Mars.Perseverance deputy mission manager Robert Hogg said engineers were also preparing for the first flight of a helicopter drone carried by the rover.Hogg said the rover team was working out flight zones and hoped to conduct the first flight in late spring or early summer.He said the mission had not experienced any major problems so far.It\u0027s all just minor stuff, he said. Everything we\u0027ve tried has worked beautifully.Perseverance was launched on July 30, 2020 and landed on the surface of Mars on February 18 on a mission to search for signs of past life on the Red Planet.The rover\u0027s primary mission will last just over two years but it is likely to remain operational well beyond that.Over the coming years, Perseverance will attempt to collect 30 rock and soil samples in sealed tubes to be sent back to Earth sometime in the 2030s for analysis.About the size of an SUV, the craft weighs a ton, is equipped with a seven-foot-long robotic arm, has 19 cameras, two microphones and a suite of cutting-edge instruments.So far it has sent back more than 7,000 photographs, including one of a light brown rock that was used to test a device called SuperCam: an ultra-sophisticated French-made camera the size of a shoe box that can shoot a laser beam at rocks up to seven meters away to analyze their makeup.The rover is only the fifth to set its wheels down on Mars, all of them American. The feat was first accomplished in 1997.The United States is preparing for an eventual human mission to the planet, though planning remains very preliminary.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror school term tinkering","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Mirror: School term tinkering a distraction from decade of Tory failuresThe Tories cut per-pupil funding between  and  and additional cash for education was also noticeably absent from this week’s Budget - tinkering with school terms is just a distraction from the failures of the past decademirrorShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  MAR Newsopinionthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video schools-begin-covid--testing-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

So it is right to look at ways of helping pupils catch up with the weeks of lost learning. This should be done in consultation with teachers so they are not lumbered with additional hours of work for no additional pay. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson’s concern about the impact of Covid on education would carry more weight had he not been part of a Government that cut per-pupil funding by % between  and . Additional cash for education was also noticeably absent from this week’s Budget. If this Government cared about children’s futures, it would invest properly in schools, expand free school meal provision and reopen the hundreds of Sure Start centres it closed. And it would not have created a situation where schools have had to beg parents for basics such as pens and even toilet rolls. Tinkering with school terms is just a distraction from the Tory failures of the past decade. Cruel industry More than two million kangaroos a year are killed to make sports shoes. Animal rights campaigners claim the cull also results in the deaths of , orphaned joeys, either from slaughter or starvation. Consumers in the UK are probably unaware of this barbaric practice when they buyfootball boots made by some leading brands.The best way to stamp out such inhumane acts is to force firms to be transparent about how and where their goods are sourced.

She recalls: “He said, ‘You’ll know it’s done Deirdre’, and he’d pick up one noodle and throw it against the wall. ‘If it sticks, it’s done,it slides off it’s not done yet’. He loved to cook.” As her surname suggests, Deirdre’s great uncle was America’s most infamous gangster, Al Capone.Deirdre, now , who says she is “probably the last person on this Earth” to have properly known him, is chatting from her home in Florida as the latest movie about her beloved “Uncle Al” is released on Netflix this week.British actor Tom Hardy stars in biopic Capone, complete with heavy prosthetics and plenty of characteristic violence, blood and gore. What is your view  Have your say in the comments section But Deirdre, who turned seven the day Capone died following a stroke in January, , paints a sweeter picture and reveals the ruthless gangster had a surprisingly sensitive side. Not least that old Scarface was pretty thin-skinned about his iconic scar, which Deirdre says he got in a bar fight when he complimented a girl he met. Her brother took offence – with a kne. “He hated the scar. He would try and hide that at all times,” she says. “It’s dficult to find a picture where he doesn’t shield it. He was very self-conscious about it. “He didn’t like to have anything wrong with him at all, he was a perfectionist.” So much so that there was one sure- fire way to put the wind up him. Deirdre recalls: “If you wanted to rattle Al Capone all you had to say is, ‘Where’d you get that spot on your shirt ’ He’d be like, ‘Oh my goodness there’s a spot on my shirt ’ and he’d run to get it out. He wanted to be perfect at all times.” Clearly image meant a lot to him. Deirdre adds: “If you see any picture of my uncle he had a white hat on. “The reason is, he loved cowboy movies and in them the good guys always wore white hats. “He always wore one because the media was so against him, trying to blame him for everything, so he’d wear a white hat to let people know he was a good guy. He felt victimised.”  She fondly recalls he didn’t mind his young niece asking about the scar, though. To her, he was always a good guy. “I would sit on his lap and feel it and say, ‘Does that boo-boo hurt ’”. “He’d laugh and say, ‘No, not any more’.” It feels like there might be a tad of whitewashing going on in Deirdre’s recollections of Capone, the younger brother of her grandfather, Ralph. Ralph was nicknamed “Bottles” for his role in the fearsome Capone bootleg alcohol empire, the Chicago Outfit, which made its fortune during Prohibition. Deirdre explains it was actually Ralph who was in charge. But he was happy for Al to be the public face. “Al loved the limelight, loved to be out with a beautul woman on his arm. My grandfather hated it,” she explains.  And she insists they had nothing to do with the infamous  St Valentine’s Day Massacre, in which seven rival gangsters were murdered. The killings earned Al Capone the title of “Public Enemy No”. Deirdre also lives by the “mantra” he was a “mobster, not a monster”. She believes he never killed anyone himself, but admits he ordered killings. “There is no evidence at all of he himself murdering somebody,” she says. “Were people killed  Of course. I equate that part of American history to the Wild West. In the Wild Westyou rustled someone’s cattle or stole someone’s woman there was a price to pay.” Deirdre is also quick to mitigate the Capones’ move into criminality as the children of Italian immigrants to Chicago. “That was the times,” she says, in a strong Chicago drawl.  In those days the Italians were the last to be hired and first to be fired. Italian boys weren’t going to be doctors or lawyers.” She says that when she got older and read about Capone’s “alleged” activities she struggled to equate them to the sweet-natured man she knew. Her dad gave her the surname Gabriel, his middle name, to protect her. But once it got out she was a Capone she was bullied and ostracised. “I never was invited to parties, andI tried to have a birthday party nobody would come,” she recalls.  In terms of knowing her uncle firsthand, she was only a child, so perhaps her rosy memories are understandable. Her mother was pregnant with her when Capone was released from jail. Ever elusive, he’d finally been convicted of tax evasion aged  in , and locked up for  years, ending with a stint in Alcatraz. Deirdre says he despised his time in the island prison. “He couldn’t talk about it, it was so horric,” she says. “When I went to Alcatraz as a visitor I cried when I saw the size of his cell and conditions he had to live in.” She adds that he was desperate to see his we Mae and son Sonny, whohe’d moved to Florida for their safety.The period after his release, in the last years of Capone’s le, is portrayed by Hardy in the new biopic. According to the movie, Capone is beset with dementia, with the mental age of a -year-old. Deirdre agrees that by the time he was released his mental state had deteriorated shockingly, but insists this was due to mercury injections she claims were given to him to treat syphilis.  She recalls her family sought medical help to fix the problem and by the time she was old enough to remember him, he had recovered. “They had a big party for him when he got out, and he would come up and say, ‘Who are you  Who are you ’ He was not in his right mind,” she says. “My grandfather and Al’s we and mother took him to this doctor. “They leached those poisons from his body and he was fine. He did not have dementia,” she says, repeatedly. Instead, she recalls a fun uncle who lived in a Miami Beach mansion, dripping with wealth. “The house is magnicent to this day,” Deirdre says. “He had a magnicent yacht, chauffeur-driven limousine, he never drove, he had servants. He was high-society in Miami. “When we stayed, whatever we wanted was ours. You never paid for dinner, the restaurants would treat you. But I never saw anyone scared of him.”  Although the family never wanted for money, Deirdre believes the myth there is a lost million of Capone’s wealth still potentially stashed away, the location of which died with him. But she says she’s long since given up on finding it and cashing in. She says: “If it’s anywhere it would be Chicago. I also believe they have a lot of dealings in Cuba. I believe a lot of money was in safety deposit boxes in Cuba. But I have to let that be now.” Her first memory of Capone is in the giant seawater filled pool at his home. “My Uncle Al loved to be in the pool. That house had the biggest pool of any place in Florida,” she recalls. “The bay water would come in, salt water, and little fish would swim in there.” I try to put aside any connotations of sleeping with fishes.

Al lted me up. “That was the first time I experienced being in salt water, and I must have had an unbelievable look on my face because Al picked me up, and looked at me and started laughing so hard and threw his head back.” The uncle she knew even dressed as Santa to give presents to his staff’s children, and taught her to play mandolin and sing an Italian lullaby, though she didn’t speak the language. She feels he was a “beaten” man, not in a melancholy sense. Simply because he wanted to give up his old le. “He wanted to be home with his family, see his son get married and have children,” Deirdre says. “Prison had beaten him. He just could not go through that again or put his family through that. He wanted to be at home, have his mother’s cooking, be with his son.” "},{"url":null,"title":"chinese takeaway adds wham bar","story":"NewsChinese takeaway adds Wham Bar Chow Mein to menu following popular demandRice Box Derry in Northern Ireland now offers a Chow Mein sprinkled in broken pieces of Wham Bar for £. - and the announcement sparked a rather angry response on FacebookmirrorShareCommentsByLuke MatthewsAudience Writer:,  MAR NewsFancy it \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

But were there signs from the start that the break-up - famously dubbed aposMegxitapos - was almost inevitable, as some experts claim  Royal commentators have argued that the clues Harry, , wanted to leave were there even before Meghan, , came on the scene in . The Duke and Duchess of Sussexesapos relationship with the royal family has deteriorated further even after the pair announced they were stepping back from public le in early . This week, Buckingham Palace said it will probe allegations of bullying thrown at Meghan in an unprecedented public move. Got a story  Email webnews@mirror. It has been reported that Meghan had treated staff badly while she was a working royal, which forced two to quit their jobs and a third to lose their confidence. She denies the claims and a spokesman has labelled them a smear. The twists and turns have come just days before the Sussexes sit down with Oprah tomorrow evening, in which the couple are expected to talk about a wide range of issues, including aposMegxitapos. In a dramatic clip released this week, the duchess said she could not be expected to be silent about palace lethe royal family was perpetuating hoods about her. The row has also emerged as Prince Philip, , remains in hospital after receiving surgery for a pre-existing heart condition. The coupleaposs split from The Firm shocked many when it was announced in , but experts have argued there were always signs it was likely - or even inevitable. Victoria Howard, founder of royal news site The Crown Chronicles, told the Evening Standard : It was always inevitable that this would be how it ended.Harry and Meghan have carved quite a niche for themselves in the US already. I think they are not going to be held back by this, itaposs more the personal side. People are rooting for them to do well and want them to be happy. They werenapost and thataposs why it ended up the way it did. Robert Lacey, author of aposBattle of the Brothersapos, echoed the idea on the Mirror podcast aposPod Saves the Queenapos - and put forward that Harry may have been considering a split even before Meghan.  He said: There are factors that made it tending towards inevitable. As we know, because heaposs said so, Harry doesnapost like what happened being called Megxit, because he’s actually said for the record, aposthis was my decision, not my we’s decision’. Body language expert Judi James, like Mr Lacey, believes Harry always wanted to leave The Firm - and that Meghanaposs arrival presented him with the perfect opportunity. Judi said: It is possible that Harry was always destined to leave the royal family and that in Meghan he found the perfect catalyst to help him lead the le he needed, both mentally and emotionally.

Meghan was the ‘breath of fresh air’ the Firm needed, but being a ‘breath of fresh air’ for the royals means changing the wallpaper in the guest bedrooms, not stepping up and speaking out. The coded signs that pointed towards Harry’s future new le in the US - that he optimistically describes as aposstepping back, not stepping downapos - have been visible for many decades though. And, like the tragic breakdown of the marriage of Harry’s parents, many of them have been visible in the body language rather than voiced in actual words. Judi now has looked back at some of their public appearances and shared her opinions on whether aposMegxitapos was predestined.  Check out our timeline below: Sibling rivalry Judi believes that Harryaposs desire to leave the royal family goes back even further than Meghan and can be traced, in part, to a supposed breakdown in his relationship with Prince William. She said: Would Harry ever have quit the UKhis relationship with William hadn’t broken down  The strong historic relationship between William and Harry seemed to thrive on competitiveness and the typical sibling banter. But that banter did begin to suggest the threat of future rts as Harry moved to independent adulthood while his brother played the role of critical parent. A competitive Harry had to grow up and create his own power-base but with a brother moving steadily to the throne that might never have been seen as possible. aposThe Diana Factorapos -   Judi picked the coupleaposs Invictus Games appearance in  as an early example of their unhappiness with the media attention. She said: [Harryaposs] desire to protect Meghan from any of the intrusion that had occurred with Diana was apparent in Harry’s body language from the early days of their relationship. At the Invictus Games in  the emotions between the pair looked obvious but with the cameras present a side of Harry was emerging that we got to see repeatedly prior to his move to the US. Walking with Meghan on a private outing we can see echoes of Diana’s first press encounters when she was hounded in the street. Harry’s deadpan, dipped eye expression and sucked-in lips shows a dislike of the photographers and he has tucked Meghan slightly behind him and beneath his arm in a aposwing-shapedapos protection gesture. Engagement photocall -   The couple announced their engagement in November , after  months of dating. But Judi says that Harry and Meghan looked uneasy - hinting at a dferent future. She said: There were subtle body language signs that it was Meghan doing the motivating here with a rather more press-reluctant Harry. Harry’s barrier rituals were almost constant, with his right arm held across his waist and at one point his right hand tucked partly inside his jacket in what looked like a desire to hide rather than perform. Meghan, meanwhile, showed a capacity for a more maternal-looking approach, placing one loving, possessive hand on Harry’s chest and even rubbing his arm in what looked like a gesture of reassurance. Judi added Meghan would grow to become more protective, as seen in her mannerisms in the recent Oprah clips. The aposFab Fourapos launch -  Harry and Meghanaposs first official engagement with Prince William, , and we Kate Middleton, , saw the quartet - dubbed the aposFab Fourapos - take the stage at a Royal Foundation launch event. Judi says that Meghanaposs star power on stage showed a dferent future for the couple, so she could escape the red tape. She said: The launch of this new royal team saw that ‘team’ sink without trace almost before it had got off the blocks. When Meghan spoke, she was a show-stopper, giving a brief CV of her experience working with causes and campaigns and speaking with pace, energy and a sense of urgency to get things done and achieve change. How all that energy was ever going to sit within the slow-moving traditions of royal protocol was anyone’s guess. Meghan had been given the  to achieve change but she had also inherited rules and red tape to prevent it. Meghanaposs meetings with the Queen -  Judi says she believes that Harry and Meghan prefer to announce events in their own style - like their recent baby photo. She thinks that Meghan struggled with directions from other royals, including the Queen, so struck out on her own. Judi said: You can only imagine any modern woman being taken aside and shown how to act and move in public by her grandmother-in-law. For a grown woman in her late thirties with a successful career under her belt, her smiles might have belied the challenge that she felt. As an actress Meghan must have taken all the body language rules in her stride but this wasn’t a role in aposThe Crownapos where she could switch off, it was a role for le. The barefoot in the grass baby announcement photos in the US probably reveal the kind of body language the couple prefer to use. Breaking with baby tradition -   Meghan gave birth to baby Archie in May . There were claims at the time that she and Harry had coordinated the photocall after the birth for US television, although this was denied. But Judi says: There was a feeling at the time of Archie’s birth that Harry and Meghan were beginning to do things their own way and on a more global scale. [The photocall] did seem to fly in the face of royal tradition. It was Harry cradling the baby throughout while Meghan appeared to stand guard in a more protective role over her ‘two boys’. Meeting celebrities -   The Sussexes stepped out onto the red carpet for the premiere of aposThe Lion Kingapos in July . The pair, who lent their support to filmaposs conservation campaign #ProtectThePride, were seen greeting celebrities - when Meghan made a choice comment. This provided a big verbal clue about the coupleaposs plans, according to Judi.She said: Watching her with celebrity ‘royals’ like Beyonce in the US, it was easy to see Meghan was more comfortable with the tactile approach of hugs, hand-holding and other signs of open affection and approval.As Meghan clearly basks in the motivational encouragement, flattery and support in this Hollywood line-up, she appears to provide a big verbal clue about problems in the UK, voicing her pain when she says ‘Thank you, they don’t make it easy’.

The -year-old electrician had plans of converting his Coleshill homeaposs shed into a man cave, but once the pandemic hit he decided to create a space Leanne could relax with kids Ellis, eight, and Nancy, four.Taking advantage of his vast links across the trade industry and tips on ious Facebook groups, Jack eventually finished the project at a cost of around £,, reports BirminghamLive. The pub features a wooden bar with bar stools, a dartboard and ambient lighting, plus a cosy sofa for chilling out as a family.Have you created a garden pub during lockdown  Let us know at webnews@mirrorOutside, thereaposs a paved patio and a brick-built barbecue area for al fresco entertaining. Iaposd decided to build the man cave as when we moved into the property there was an old manky shed which had a hole in the roof and was really rotten, explained Jack. When we went into the first lockdown, I was put on furlough so I thought right Iaposm going to make this space look amazing for my we, who works really hard in her job.

Niall Dunn, , says he “lost ­everything” when motorcyclist Harry was killed in August . Since the tragedy he has had to give up work and move home to live with mum Charlotte Charles, . Niall now fears he will struggle to move on unless Harry’s alleged killer –American Anne Sacoolas – faces justice. But the diplomatic row over her controversial flight from the UK is still ongoing. Niall’s milestone birthday on March  will be another painful reminder of his brother’s absence. He said: “It’s so dficult to describe what birthdays, Christmas, and Mother’s Day and Father’s Day are like now. “I know my parents want to make these days special for me but none of us can get away from the fact that Harry isn’t there any more. “To be honest, as special as these days have been in our lives, I dread them now. “I feel like I have lost everything losing Harry and I just can’t find my feet. “Losing a twin is like losing half of you.” Niall moved out of home for the first time in April  to live with a friend in the village of Croughton, Northants. He found work as a steel ­fabricator and was loving his ­new-found independence. Mum Charlotte said: “He was working hard and feeling so proud of himself, and we were so proud of him.” But on August , , everything changed for Niall. Keen biker Harry, , was riding past the US military base at RAF Croughton when he was fatally injured in a crash.  Mum-of-three Sacoolas,  – whose husband worked at the base – was spoken to by police at the scene. She later fled the country claiming diplomatic immunity. Niall tried toto his job – just  yards from the crash scene – but found it impossible to focus. Charlotte explained: “He couldn’t concentrate and couldn’t stand the thought of people not knowing what to say to him. “He tried carrying on living in the house but couldn’t manage it – the flat was  yards from where Harry died and work was even closer.”  Niall moved back to Charlton, ­Northants, to live with Charlotte and stepdad Bruce Charles, . In the  months since his brother’s death he has spent much of his time playing on his computer, watching TV and playinghis electric guitar. Former GP surgery worker Charlotte also gave up her job in the wake of Harry’s passing. She said: “Niall’s really suffering. He’s been struggling the whole time and it’s not getting any easier for him. “The world was just opening up for him when Harry died, there was every possibility out there. “But now Niall is the unseen casualty of this situation. “He hates going for walks in case he is recognised and worries what people will say to him. He’s had his le robbed as well and we are just supporting him as much as we can.”  Niall added: “I just couldn’t bear living close to where he died. It was too painful. At the moment I’m just living hour by hour, trying to get through every painful day the best way I can.” For Harry turning  would have marked an important milestone in his le. On his birthday he would have been eligible for a full licence, allowing him to ride a bike of any engine size. Harry shared this passion for bikes with stepfather Bruce, who has now quit biking after  years in the saddle out of respect for Charlotte. Niall says his coming-of-age birthday will be “bittersweet” for mum Charlotte and his dad Tim Dunn, .  He explained: “I just wish my brother was here with me to celebrate. “I feel completely empty, sad and angry about the way our lives have changed. We have all tried to take steps forwards but it’s just not possible until we get justice and closure.” Sacoolas was charged with causing death by dangerous driving following herto the United States. However, formal extradition requests have been turned down by the Trump and Biden administrations.

A legal “loophole” meant she ­qualied through her husband, even though he did not have protection. This loophole has now been closed by the UK Government. Harry’s family still hope the mum, who lives in Virginia, will “do the right thing” by facing a British court. They are also pursuing a civil claim against Sacoolas and her husband in the US.

I was already home and munching on my impulse-purchased cinnamon scroll from Britainaposs first aposno tillapos store before a receipt of my purchase popped up on my phone screen. I immediately clicked through to the Amazon Shopping app to assess the damage. For £. - not terrible, but not exactly cheap either. I visited the new supermarket at  The Broadway, Ealing, west London, on Friday as it drew its first flocks of shoppers curious to try out the experience. What do you think of Amazon Fresh - will you shop there  Join the debate in the comments below... How it works Surveillance technology allows shoppers to simply scan in using a QR code then place items in their bag. Instead of handheld scanning equipment, the sophisticated aposJust Walk Outapos camera technology tracks shoppersapos movements and determines the items they take off the shelf using machine vision.Amazon tells me the system sets out to answer the question: “who took what ” A spokesperson explained: Anything a customer takes off the shelf is automatically added to their virtual cart. Anything they put back on the shelf comes out of their virtual cart.When customers are done shopping, they can just leave the store. Later, we’ll send a receipt and charge the customer’s Amazon account.So instead of paying at the till, shoppers simply walk out and the app tallies the items picked up and charges them directly to the bank card attached to their Amazon Shopping app account. The surveillance system concept has been labelled aposdystopianapos by privacy campaigners.Some UK unions fear articial intelligence-staffed stores will form a blueprint for slashing jobs, even as the coronavirus pandemic-hit world is hailing supermarket staff and delivery drivers as key workers.I decided to check it out for myself, saving my ‘top-up’ shop ahead of the weekend’s grand lockdown activities of making banana bread and drinking at least one bottle of wine.  How to shop at Amazon Fresh At the entrance, a group of Amazon staffstood outside and guided shoppers. They told us to open the Amazon Shopping apps on our phones and check the correct card details were attached. I opened the trolley symbol in the app, then tapped the aposFresh Codeapos tab. I scanned the code at a security turnstile as I entered the store, much like you might use your phone at a Tube station.  Shoppers were being guided by friendly staff wearing face masks who pointed me to brown paper bags bearing Amazon branding. I askedI could use my reusable bags instead and they agreed. It was disarmingly simple. “So I just walk around and put things straight in my bag ” “Go for it, straight in your bag. You donapost have to do anything ,” a shop assistant told me cheerily.  The first thing you will notice is the ‘Amazon’ brand and aposBritish produceapos marks emblazoned on almost everything. Some items carried Morrison’s markings - Amazon Primeaposs same-day delivery online shopping service has a deal with the brand and upmarket US grocer Whole Foods. Amazonaposs physical store opens to an ample fruit and vegetable and meat selection. Just next to that is an Amazon Hub - so you can pick up your sausages and your parcels in one visit. The fare is of similar pitch and quality appearance to Waitrose - think fancy ready-meals, a large ravioli range, hoisin duck wraps, on-trend chocolate-orange desserts. The supermarket has mimicked its rivalsapos meal deal strategies, offering ‘night in’ package deals of a ‘main and side’.  A fellow shopper picked up a couple of packets, then noticed it was two not three items for £. We both felt it was a bit steep and moved on. I crossed paths with him again in the chilled aisle as he planned his Friday night dinner. He showed me a packet of chicken breasts - noting he’d have to use it by tonight anyway as the meat expired tomorrow. I checked the app’s ‘basket’ throughout my shop to seethe items were dropping into my virtual trolley in realtime. They weren’t - but I figured the camera technology would wait for me to leave the shop before giving me a final receipt, reckoning it was watching to seeI would put anything back. I went to inspect lunch options - noting on the way the decent-sized aposfree fromapos selection, and that staple items like bread, milk, eggs and butter and tinned goods appeared to be competitively priced. My shopping list included: flour, baking powder, baking soda, a loaf of bread, oat milk, butter, bananas, a bottle of red wine, and dishwashing liquid. I left with just one impulse purchase. Hereaposs what the full shop at Amazon Fresh, Ealing, west London cost on Friday March , . My Amazon Cinnamon and Almond Swirl, g £.Amazon Our Selection Super Seeded Farmhouse Loaf, g £.By Amazon Rainforest Alliance Bananas, Pack of  £. By Amazon Unsalted Butter, g £.

OATLY The Original Oat Drink Semi, L £.Total: £. A broad selection of sandwiches, wraps, and salads looked likely to appeal to shoppers of all tastes, but the prices and gourmet selections felt similar to the MS just down the road - or the Pret-a-Manger a couple doors down from that. I wondered what would stop shoppers who saved time on their seamless Amazon Fresh shopping experience from popping where on their lunch-break to pick up a snack and coffee at competing prices. But in the spirit of a review, I popped a cinnamon scroll pastry in my bag .For one-stop shoppers, the supermarket also featured a user-operated coffee machine dispensing Oatly oat milk. I was tempted to have a go on it, but another shopper told me it was broken. He was unsure how the surveillance system would know he hadn’t got his coffee, but a staffer had told him someone would come to fix it soon. We both unconsciously looked up at the ceiling asto check whether the Matrix was sending someone to our rescue. Within seconds, a smiling employee was upon us bearing armfuls of milk and promising she could fix it. I moved on to the booze section, where a locked gate and real-le employee waited like a bouncer granting access to a nightclub. Thereaposs little more humbling than waiting at a self-checkout till for a supermarket worker to glance at your tired eyes over a face mask and confidently hit the “visibly over ” button on the touchscreen.  I didn’t get IDaposd at the little Amazon Fresh nightclub either. But being let into the sealed-off section was like being ushered into the VIP area. I pored over the shelves - finding a modest but decent wine selection and clocking some local London craft beer. I popped a discounted Malbec in my bag and with no tills to pay at the exit as promised, I made a ginger attempt at walking out the door. “I feel like I’m shoplting haha” I told the security guard, who laughed at me then pantomimed a gallant, sweeping gesture to the sliding doors: “You can just go straight out. The privacy debate[Amazon Fresh] offers a dystopian, total-surveillance shopping experience, Silkie Carlo, from privacy watchdog Big Brother Watch, told the BBC. Amazonaposs intense tracking of shoppers will create larger personal data footprints than any other retailer. Customers deserve to know how and by whom these records and analytics could be used. Amazon told the Mirror privacy information was laid out for shoppers to read on its site: We take data protection very seriously and all personal data is treated in accordance with long-standing policies. As noted on in-store signage in our Amazon Fresh store in the UK: Once you enter the gates, we use in store technologyto link the Amazon account and payment information you provide to your presence in the store. We do the same with your guests. You can access your in-store purchase history in your Amazon account. Otherwise, we will associate information collected by our in-store technology about your visit with your Amazon account for up to  days. The review After my shop, I waited outside Amazon Fresh about another  minutes, constantly refreshing the app to see what I had spent - to no success. I know what youaposre thinking: aposJust use your maths you big twit.apos In fairness to Amazon,I was to visit the supermarket again I would be aware I should carefully tally my purchases. But I hadnapost known going in that the items would not appear live in the app. And the warm and bright atmosphere, and seductive ease of popping groceries into my bag was just so distracting. When I walked out and realised I had no idea what I had spent I nearly performed a slow-clap for Amazon.  Itaposs clear the shoppers are the most valuable products in the store. This is true of other supermarkets too - every last one is laid out to entice shoppers to spend and inspire toddlers to throw tantrums in the aisles. Rivals had rolled out self-scan devices for shoppers long before this latest gimmick. But the relative ease of the experience and the surveillance technology both add an extra layer of temptation at Amazon Fresh. Everyone  I spoke to had the same experience. I polled four shoppers outside the shop, and not a single one could tell me how much they had just spent. We were all so charmed - or perhaps fooled - by the novel experience of wandering around the store popping items in our bags: we had forgotten to do our mental maths.  One local shopper, railway worker Paul, bought a cappuccino and a box of snack bars. He told me the coffee was decent. Paul enjoyed the shopping experience, but admitted he too was unsure what he’d just paid exactly - guessing it was “about a fiver.” “I went for a coffee as a bit of an experience, it’s a nice concept - it’s not cheap but I expected that,” he told me. “You definitely could get carried away, thataposs the thing - it’s a little bit too easy andyour maths isn’t that great like mine isn’t - it could probably get expensive.” If the goal is is to create an environment in which a shopper can easily impulse purchase - all the while giving away precious consumer habits data - then Amazon has nailed it.  I’m old enough to remember going to the supermarket with cash long before smartphone banking and self-checkout tills. I would add up my purchases in my head as I popped items in the trolley, with a budget in mind. Today’s supermarket adventures are pitched to a modern customer experience - cash use is slumping - even more so during the pandemic. Today a shopper might expect to pay for their purchases by on their phone or by tapping a contactless card. I have grown too accustomed to watching my purchases added up on a checkout till - putting some backI’ve overstretched. I already find myself forgetting to use my arithmetic, and relying on my banking app - where I get an immediate spending report popping up on my phone every time I make a purchase so I know the exact score.  Which is why I found Amazon’s bricks-and-mortar approach disarmingly clever. The tech giant’s genius lies in its devotion to consumer demand for convenience and instantaneity.But itaposs a business model which has left it facing accusations of exploiting its round-the-clock global workforce of warehouse workers and delivery drivers, and calls for UK tax reforms to target its soaring profits.I can order a package on Amazon Prime in seconds by dropping an item in my virtual basket, pressing and thumb-print on my phone screen - and the little brown cardboard package will be at my doorstep on the same day.  With that in mind, surely Amazonaposs wizards are capable of creating a shopping experience that adds and subtracts items from real and virtual bags in realtime. If the monitoring technology must be so state of the art that it isn’t possible to update live - then I can only speculate whether that is a decision one of the biggest companies in the world has made quite deliberately. I asked Amazon about this, and the company told me shoppers will receive their receipt within a few hours of completing their shopping trip, both via email and in the app. Other shoppers noticed it too - despite being overwhelmingly pleased by the experience. Local mums Clair and Sarah decided to check out the store to buy treats for their children.

The Duchess of Cambridge will speak in a BBC show set to air on the same day as Prince Harry and Meghanaposs tell-all interview on Sunday. The comments are part of a BBC programme featuring the royal family celebrating the Commonwealth which will be screened on Sunday - a few hours before the bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey airs in America. The growing war of words from Meghan and Harryaposs controversial televised chat have overshadowed the special programme marking Commonwealth Day. In an extract from the show - A Celebration For Commonwealth Day - the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have a video chat with Dr Zolelwa Sumba, from South Africa, an advocate for the rights of healthcare workers on the front line. The duchess tells the medic: Here in the UK thereaposs been masses of public recognition of the amazing work the front line are doing and itaposs sad, almost, that itaposs taken the pandemic for the public to really back and support all those working on the front line. Do you enjoy reading about the royal family for all the best royal news from the Mirror hereWilliam, Kate and their children were pictured last year joining in the weekly applause for frontline workers during the early part of the pandemic. Dr Sumba replies: We actually know the problems, we see the problems every day, you walk into work there are the problems. The problem is our voices are not heard. We are on the front lines and we are expected to lt humanity.So my advice to everybody is,you know a healthcare worker - any healthcare worker - you just love on them, love on them, love on them some more. If their child needs looking after offer, you know,they need a meal, offer. William says: We, Catherine and I, have spoken to a lot of healthcare workers in UK and around the world over the last year - we hear your worries and your concerns and thank you for your time chatting to us about it. It was at Westminster Abbeyaposs Commonwealth Day service in March last year when the Sussexes were last seen with their family, sitting close to the Queen, Charles, Camilla and William and Kate. A few months before that they had sent shockwaves through the monarchy by announcing they would be stepping down as working royals. In extracts released over the last few days, Meghan has criticised the constraints she faced as a working royal, and said it was liberating to be able to say yes to a request for an interview with the US chat show host. She accused The Firm - as the royal family is sometimes known - of perpetuating hoods about her and Harry. During the programme, Charles pays tribute to the extraordinary determination, courage and creativity of the Commonwealthaposs people during the Covid crisis. Speaking from Westminster Abbey, where he was last seen publicly with Meghan and Harry, he says the pandemic and climate change are existential threats which have no borders. The prince says: The coronavirus pandemic has affected every country of the Commonwealth, cruelly robbing countless people of their lives and livelihoods, disrupting our societies and denying us the human connections which we so dearly cherish. Amidst such heart-breaking suffering, however, the extraordinary determination, courage and creativity with which people have responded has been an inspiration to us all. This pandemic has shown us the true nature of a global emergency. We have learned that human health, economic health and planetary health are fundamentally interconnected and that pandemics, climate change and bioersity loss are existential threats which know no borders.

After videos of the Duke and Duchessaposs interview with the famous American TV host were released ahead of its screening on Sunday, some drew comparisons between her chosen glamorous look and that of fellow American, Wallis. Meghan, , chose a ,black Armani dress, belted above her stomach and featuring floral embroidery over one shoulder. With her hair parted and pulled into a neat bun, the pregnant Duchessaposs chosen look was strikingly similar to one Wallis wore in a  portrait - the same year King Edward VIII abdicated to marry her. Baltimore-raised Wallis Simpson met Edward, Prince of Wales when she was  - the same age Meghan was when she met Harry. Wallis, like Meghan, had already been married before meeting her prince.Do you enjoy reading about the royal family  for all the best royal news from the Mirror  here This caused controversy for Edward - as royals were not allowed to marry orcees at this time. As a result, he opted to give up the throne to marry love of his le and subsequently, Wallis became a duchess - the Duchess of Windsor. Edward and Wallis married six months later in the south of France. Wallis too went on to receive abusive hate mail and was also accused of being a Nazi sympathiser. Many viewers of the CBS teaser clip of Harry and Meghanaposs Oprah chat were quick to point out the similarities between both Duchesses. One tweeted: My initial thoughts were that Meghan is borrowing Dianaaposs look with the black outfit and heavy eyeliner. And he seems to have styled her hair like Wallis Simpson. Another added: I donapost know does no one  feel the serious Wallis Simpson vibe coming off Meghan in that trailer.One Twitter user remarked: Meghanaposs stf posture is the spitting image of the Duchess of Windsor - surely deliberate.Meghan paired her outfit with plenty of diamonds, including a dazzling , , Cartier diamond tennis bracelet from Princess Dianaaposs jewelry collection and a ,  Cartier Love Bracelet.  She also wore a ,Aquamarine Collette Pendant Cord Necklace from sustainable designer Pippa Small. The interview comes amid claims of bullying by staff who worked for Harry and Meghan. An investigation, ordered by the Queen, will examine claims Meghan “humiliated” aides, subjecting them to “emotional cruelty and manipulation”, driving out two personal assistants. A spokesman for Sussexes described the claims, reported in The Times, as an attack on Meghanaposs character that had left the Duchess saddened.  They said: The duchess is saddened by this latest attack on her character, particularly as someone who has been the target of bullying herself and is deeply committed to supporting those who have experienced pain and trauma. She is determined to continue her work building compassion around the world and will keep striving to set an example for doing what is right and doing what is good.

Rhiannon Morris was in an abusive relationship with Kane Haines for two years during which she ended up in hospital and said he aposdrained the le and soulapos out of her in a repeated cycle of physical and mental abuse.The -year-old was left with black eyes, bruising and subjected to tirades of verbal abuse which culminated in Haines telling her he was going to kill her and set her house on fire, reports Wales Online. Haines, , was sentenced to  months imprisonment in December with Rhiannon, from Cardf, finally able to move on with her le. At the beginning of the relationship things were very dferent as Haines was described as the perfect guy in the beginning and described him as aposcaring, charming and everything you would wantapos. She said: Once I broke down on the motorway and he came to meet me in his car. It was only minor things. He knew I had recently left my childrenaposs father and he was the first relationship after that but he seemed like the perfect guy in the beginning. But he later became violent and controlling, especially when he was drinking and after after Rhiannon moved to Barry where he lived, matters became much worse with Haines moving himself in and refusing to go. A year into their relationship on August , , Haines attacked Rhiannon at a barbecue where he headbutted and bit her on the nose. Another attack saw her knocked unconscious in front of her two daughters who were aposscreaming at the top of the stairsapos. She said: He left that day and we locked up the house. I told him not to go back but he would come back because now he had made it his home. In a nutshell it drained the le and soul of me, it was a repeated cycle of mental and physical abuse which at the time I clearly didn’t recognise, I knew it wasn’t right but I never thought I was being abused. It completely ruined me as a person and a mum at the time. I remember a friend repeatedly telling me he was going to end up killing meI didn’t leave, I just brushed it off but looking back I feel he was more than capable. It was almost like he enjoyed having the power, that was the look in his eyes....it was like a thrill to him, he knew he had full control. Kane always knew what he was doing, he started isolating me near enough straight away from certain friends and family members, he would always put them down and make out I’m better off without them. It was always one rule for him, he didn’t care about anyone apart from himself, he was ruthless when he wanted to be. As long as he had a drink or drugs nothing  mattered.  Just a few months later in November, Rhiannon was beaten so horrically she was taken to hospital to receive treatment for a perforated eardrum and whiplash, after Haines had hit her with such force. He then called If her and threatened to kill her and burn down her home, she claimed. She said: In the end I had to leave our house, I went to the police and moved in with my mother. I went in to report the things he did and I was there for seven-and-a-half hours and it was just going on and on. I just thought it was something I was doing. I am not that kind of person,he could do it to me he could do it to anyone."},{"url":null,"title":"new rules schools reopening masks","story":"AdvertorialNew face mask, testing and hygiene rules for secondary schools revealedSchools and colleges are now fully reopening, welcoming back all pupils, and their health and wellbeing are a prioritymirrorShareByDave Masters:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR AdvertorialThe Government is supporting theand education catch-up through ious programmesParents all over the country are breathing a sigh of relief as their children prepare to go back to school after a dficult few months.The classroom is the best place for children to be, as face-to-face learning gives them a secure routine and normality, and helps with their socialisation, motivation and mental wellbeing. Schools and colleges are now fully reopening, welcoming back all pupils, and their health and wellbeing are a priority.

Staff and pupils in secondary schools and colleges are also being advised to wear face coverings where social distancing cannot be maintained.

We can’t wait for them to be back where they can learn and flourish.  “Our students really do thrive on the strong routines and the positive praise culture that we have, and we’re really excited about picking up where we left off, and doing all that we can to make sure we reconnect with a sense of normality and purpose towards enjoying learning and succeeding.” Kirk Balk, a Northern Education Trust academy, has had around  students in school during lockdown and has supported those at home with a full programme of learning.

Kellie Sullivan says her two-bedroom house in Oldham, Greater Manchester, has been littered with issues. On top of the cramped conditions, which means she struggles to find enough space for everyone to sleep, she is battling a huge mould problem after several leaks led to chronic damp. First Choice Homes, who manage the property, have apologised for the ongoing problems and have pledged to resolve the issues - alongside assisting her in getting a new home.But Kellie, whose fth child is due in just a few weeks, says she has reached her witaposs end, reports Manchester Evening News.  She said: I’m just at the end of my tether now. It’s so overcrowded, weaposve only got one storage space so I’ve got nowhere to put anything. We’ve been living out of bags for four years.I canapost find the clothes Iaposm looking for, itaposs chaos  . I clean this house constantly because the smell of damp just gets to me otherwise. Iaposm  weeks pregnant and they want to induce me in a few weeks which is going to make our living situation even harder.  I donapost know what  to do - nothing I can do will make it any better. Kellie has had to throw out countless pieces of furniture, clothes, and even carpets that have been ruined by the damp in the house. Some items have to be moved into the garden to stop them causing more problems before they can be disposed of properly. With rubbish in the area, Kellie also has to deal with rats in her garden and mice inside her home.  Her mum used to help her clear the area but after her sudden death last year, Kellie has to take on the burden alone. Kellie says she worries most about how the problems are impacting her children - especially her eldest son Carter, five, who is autistic. She added: I canapost do anything for my kids - itaposs about what they need and at the moment none of them are getting what they need. I have sensory equipment for Carter but I canapost set it up because thereaposs no room, he has to share a room with his two brothers so he doesnapost get his own space which makes things really dficult.  I slept on the kitchen floor when my daughter was born, because there wasnapost any room in our bedroom for her cot. No oneaposs sleeping properly becauseone wakes up everyoneaposs up, and the kids are all following my sonaposs behaviour which is another problem. My daughteraposs been sick after everything she eats lately, sheaposs having to have blood tests and sheaposs got acid medication but itaposs still happening - I just have to hope itaposs not connected to the mice. We canapost do anything to make it a safer environment for them, Iaposm spending £ a month on cleaning products but itaposs just disgusting - no matter how much I clean it just doesnapost help, itaposs diabolical.  Kellie has now bid on more than  nearby houses but has been turned down for all of them. She does not want to move too far away so she can keep Carter in the same school, as moving to a new home and a new school could be overwhelming for him. Emma Davison, executive director for customer first at First Choice Homes Oldham, said they were working hard to provide a suitable home for the family. “I really feel for Mrs Sullivan in what must be a dficult situation for her family living in a small home, she said. “She is in the top priority band on our and Oldham Councils housing list for a -bedroom home. Unfortunately we have a limited number of homes of this size available at the moment and sadly Mrs Sullivan was unsuccessful in the bids she has made. “We try hard to provide people on the waiting list with a suitable sized home as soon as we can, due to volume of people in Oldham waiting for a home and the Covid- pandemic, which means people are not moving as often, this sometime may take longer than we would like. “We were made aware of the damp and leak issue on  February and have an inspector visiting the property on  March. We’ve also instructed Oldham Council Pest Control to visit the property. They will be visiting on  March.

It has also emerged that the Queen and Buckingham Palace “do not have an advance copy” of Harry and Meg­­han’s interview with Oprah. Royal aides admitted that “everyone will watch it at the same time”.Senior members of the Royal Family have urged for “calm amid the storm” ahead of the interview, which will be shown in the US at am UK time on Monday and then at pm on ITV. What is your view  Have your say in the comments section The Mirror understands the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William have all agreed they will “reserve judgment” until they have seen all of the footage, sources said. In a teaser shown on CBS This Morning yesterday, Meghan speaks of her relief about no longer being constrained by the royals. Oprah tells how she first spoke to the Duchess two months before her Windsor Castle wedding to Harry, , as she tried to land an interview. “So, I just want to say that I called you either February or March , before the wedding,” Oprah says, “asking would you please give me an interview, and you said, ‘I’m sorry, it’s not the right time’. “And finally, we get to sit down and have this conversation.” Meghan replies: “I remember that conversation very well. I wasn’t even allowed to have that conversation with you personally, right  “There had to be people from the comms [Palace communications team] sitting there.” Oprah interjects: “There were other people in the room when I was having that conversation ” “Yeah, even on that call,” the former actress responds. Oprah, , then gushes: “You turned me down nicely and said perhaps there will be another time when there’s the right time. What is right about this time ”  Meghan says: “Well, so many things that we’re on the other side of a lot of... a lot of le experience that has happened. “And also that we have the ability to make our own choices in a way that I couldn’t have said ‘yes’ to you then. That wasn’t my choice to make. “So, as an adult who lived a really independent le to then go into this construct that is... dferent than I think what people imagine it to be, it’s really ­liberating to be able to have the right and the ­privilege in some ways to be able to say ‘yes’.” Oprah asks her: “To say it for yourself ” to which Meghan replies: “I’m ready to talk. To say it for yourself.” The chat show host then pointedly says: “And not to have to consult with anybody at this point. Yes ”  Meghan says: “Yeah. To be able to just make a choice on your own. And to be able to speak for yourself.” Before yesterday’s clip was shown, This Morning host Gayle King – a friend of Oprah and Meghan – moved to defend the Sussexes from the ­backlash over the interview’s timing given Prince Philip’s hospital stay. Ms King, , told viewers: “They did this interview two, three weeks ago before Prince Philip was in hospital. That’s an important point while they’re being blamed for appearing to be insensitive.” The Duke of Edinburgh, , was taken into hospital on February  –the day before the Sussexes met Oprah. Ms King said Harry and “particularly” Meghan have been unfairly “vilied”, while co-anchor Anthony Mason branded the Royal Family “oppressive”.

The Queen, , has to wait until Monday to watch the interview as CBS executives have not offered a preview tape to the royal household. ITV is showing the interview after paying around £million for the rights. CBS has sold the show to  countries. Ms King also asked why Meghan was being investigated by the Palace over claims that she bullied staff yet they are not probing Prince Andrew, , about his friendship with late paedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. She suggested it was because of the -minute Oprah interview. Meghan’s allies in the US, including colleagues from legal drama Suits, publicly backed her too. Executive producer Jon Cowan said she is a “warm, kind, caring person” who has been thrust into an “unimaginable world” and deserves the “benefit of the doubt”. Writer Lindsay Jill Roth, her maid of honour, posted: “Meg’s [modus operandi] has always been kindness.” "},{"url":null,"title":"royal florists brutal cold case","story":"NewsRoyal florists brutal Cold Case murder still mystery with no motive ever foundEXCLUSIVE: The family of Jacob Bornkamp, , and who was stabbed to death while walking home one early morning in , has spoken to the Sunday People about the brutal killing for the first timemirrorShareCommentsByEmily Hall:,  MAR NewsJaapand partner Danny early in their relationship \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Jacob, , was in the prime of his le when he was brutally slain in the street in , just three years after his flowers adorned Westminster Abbey for the funeral of Princess Diana. Flamboyant Jacob, also known as Jaap, had previously made ­bouquets for prime ministers and even a posy for the Queen. His le was cut short in an ­unprovoked kne attack, which many believe was a homophobic murder. The unsolved killing proved to be a watershed moment for the rights of gay people. For until Jacob’s death, partners in same-sex unions were not ­entitled to compensation for the loss of loved ones. But that changed when Danny O’Neill, Jacob’s partner of  years, lobbied the Government to give gay ­couples equal rights. Now Jacob’s family have told his story for the first time in recognition of the florist’s legacy – and in the hope new leads to his killing may yet emerge. Danny, now , believes he was the first gay man to receive a payout from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority after the rules were changed. He recalls being given information about CICA by the police – but same-sex partners were excluded. “It really got to me, because it was so specic and it was there in black and white,” he says.  HypocrisyDanny, of South London, wrote to then PM Tony Blair asking him to revise the scheme. To his amazement, Mr Blair replied saying he would look at changing the law.LGBT rights charity Stonewall was already campaigning, following the bombing of the Admiral Duncan pub in Soho, London, in , where the husband of a pregnant woman killed was allowed to apply for compensation but partners of gay men who died weren’t. Stonewall approached Danny and said they would like to use Jaap’s case as a further example of the hypocrisy. It worked and, in , CICA rules were changed to allow LGBT partners to apply.  Danny offered a £, reward to catch the killer at the time – and says it still standsinformation offered leads to a conviction. He adds: “Marriage wasn’t available to me and Jaap then, but I would definitely have gone for that. “I knew that we would be ­together for le. It’s been a huge loss for me and I miss him awfully. I had a bad time when it happened, it was like a nightmare.” Danny urges anyone with information to step forward, saying: “This person could still do the same thing to someone .” Jaap was  when he moved to London from his native Rotterdam. He worked for esteemed florist Pulbrook and Gould and clients included ex-PM Baroness Thatcher.  Jaap eventually set up his own business with Danny. They met in the s, loved to host parties, enjoyed the cinema and trips to the West End – and doted on Great Danes Ben and Sam. But all that ended cruelly. The night before he died, Jaap and pal Richard Coakley met for dinner, then went to a sauna in Deptford, South London. Staying out later than planned, the pair were walking home along New Cross Road, close to Deptford Town Hall, at .am on Sunday June , . They saw two white, stocky men in their s walking the other way. Richard told a  inquest he felt Jaap’s arm jerk – then he collapsed. One of the men had thrust a kne into his chest. The weapon severed an artery to Jaap’s heart.  An elderly man stopped to help, but was not traced afterwards. Neither was a white vehicle that earlier slowed to let the two ­suspects cross the road. CCTV showed two potential witnesses, a cyclist and pedestrian. The suspects were also on CCTV but although the images were sharpened by NASA scientists, a positive ID never materialised. A -year-old from the Catford area and a -year-old were later arrested but never charged. Police found the bloodied ­weapon – a kne with a spider ­design on the handle – dumped in a bin. But it is unclear whether the Met has DNA from the weapon and,so, when it was last checked against the crime database. Jacob’s nephew Hilgert Bos, , from Eindhoven, visited him in London numerous times and still hopes justice will prevail. He says: “I just hope someone will finally come forward.  “You can never really close the book on something like that. I really feel like his killer could surface after  years. What upsets me most is there was just no motive. Why would someone be on the streets with a kne like that  “Jaap loved London. One of the reasons he moved to London was at that time it was the gay capital of the world – much more liberal and open than Dutch society was. “Uncle Jaap liked ballet, the opera and musicals. I remember attending a musical in the West End with him and Danny and we’d go for food. They were fun times. “When I visited, I usually went with a friend. The four of us would go for dinner, then watch a film on the sofa and have a chat and drinks. Extravagant “On weekend evenings, Jaap and Daniel would go clubbing and I would go with my friend to a club. “Once we asked Jaapwe could join them at their party, but he joked, ‘It’s much too gay for you guys!’ He was extravagant. He once picked us up at the airport wearing snake leather boots, camo trousers and a big white fur coat. Jaap was not your regular florist.  “He used to do big weddings in the Middle East and I remember visiting once and there were  ft palm trees in his workshop, made of stacked pineapples and ­banana leaves. “Also a lot of the floral work for Princess Diana’s funeral service in the church was done by Jaap.” Jaap’s grave is in a London cemetery and the Great Dane statue has drawn much attention – though the background to the case is largely unknown. The murder was seen as a turning point for the police’s often strained relations with the gay community.

installed at the A’s junctions with Western Avenue and Star Road, while work to improve the approaches to the new junctions to make them safer for vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists will also be carried out.This will involve new kerbing, surfacing, new dropped crossing points, safety fence improvements, traffic signage and road markings.Ian Stewart, BEAR Scotland’s north east representative, said: “This major road safety project on the A at Balfarg Junction will see a signicant investment from Transport Scotland which will help improve road safety within the area.“The traffic management planned is essential to keep everyone safe during the project and we’ve planned the improvements to take place in phases to help limit the overall impact to road users.“The overall programme for the works will be provided in due course following discussions with the sub-contractors involved in the project to finalise the details.”The project is scheduled to begin on Monday and is programmed to take place over  weeks, although operators are hoping to keep disruption to a minimum.“Our teams will do all they can to complete the project as quickly and as safely as possible,” Mr Stewart added.“We would like to thank motorists in advance for their patience during this project and advise them to plan ahead by checking Traffic Scotland for up to date journey information and leave some extra time to reach their destination.”The initial phase will take place over four weeks and will involve site clearance, verge works and the installation of traffic signal ducting crossing the carriageway at ious locations.Traffic management arrangements will be restricted to lane closures and temporary traffic lights, although some local side road closures will be needed with signed ersions in place at a later date. vw, px\"  Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE

with a major energy provider to pilot a new way to measure offshore emissions.Neptune Energy will team up with EDF for the pilot project to test a first-of-its-kind approach for measuring oil and gas methane emissions from oil and gas facilities.EDF will coordinate a team of international researchers for the project which includes a specialist airborne emissions sensing firm and Texo DSI, a drone  company.Methane is the primary component of natural gas and is a potent greenhouse gas. To meet the Paris Agreement climate goals, methane emissions need to be reduced from production and throughout the gas value chain.State-of-the-art drone, aircraft and methane sensing technologies will be deployed on the Neptune-operated Cygnus  in the North Sea to provide a close-up view of operations typical of a North Sea offshore facility, such as gas separation, drying and compression technology, and flaring and venting.Pete Jones, Neptune Energy’s VP of operations Europe, said: “Neptune Energy already has one of the lowest methane intensities in the sector, at .%, compared with the industry average of .%. But we want to go further and have set a target of net zero methane emissions by . This study will help us identy where we need to take further action and how we can apply new measurement techniques across our global operated portfolio.”Mark Brownstein, EDF’s Senior Vice President for Energy said: “Oil and gas companies have made commitments to tackle emissions, but you can’t just assert strong environmental performance. You must show it. Having credible data is the first step and we recognise Neptune Energy for valuing emissions reporting that is based on rigorous science.”The study is due to commence in July this year with initial results expected in October.With the outcomes being published in a scientic paper in .For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"  "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/02/WAOH-MPU.jpg class=image wp-image-1780078  attachment-full size-full ","title":"gas supplies restored in keith and huntly following outage","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remResidents in Keith and Huntly were left without a gas supply for the second time in a month yesterday.SGN confirmed as of .am today that issues with their network has been resolve and that customers could start using gas again.The outage came just a month after “major disruption” left , homes in the area without gas heating and hot water for more than a day #

More is required, though, in the medium and longer terms, to help this beleaguered industry to get afloat again and regain some buoyancy.Producers and customers need reassurance that future supplies will be prioritised and to regain confidence in the industry through dedicated marketing and investment where possible through the £m fisheries fund your government announced following the publication of the agreement.Our seafood sector desperately needs Government to take action to secure its survival.

We’ve brought incomers too: piglets from Cowal, calves from Loch Awe and a flock of wild blackies from Dana. Together we’ve set up home and embarked on a mission to live off the land.It’s funny to call something so basic a ‘mission’ asTom Cruise were about to somersault through a window with a self-destructing message exploding in his fist. For millennia it was how everyone lived, yet now the idea of denying oneself a breakfast of Peruvian avocado washed down with a Calornian almond-milk-latte seems intrepid,not heroic.The most heroic thing that happens here on our croft is the odd rugby tackle of a daft ewe trailing half a bramble bush behind her, or brushing one shaggy highland calf when her two pals are desperate for their turn. Our three girls are almost a year old now and on the ridge below our house with the Sound of Jura behind them they look unarguably majestic, but take a closer look and there’s a bucket of mischief in those ginger-fringed eyes.Take too long preening one young lady and there’ll be four stubby horns threatening the backside of either the groomer or the groomed. The pushiest of these -kilo beasties will then ensconce herself in the salon seat, head thrown back, eyes closed while her gorgeous tresses are prettied.It certainly would be mission impossibleanyone were even to suggest these pampered princesses were plate-bound. Their job is to look pretty and maybe have a wee winch with a handsome local bull when they come of age, but we’re not all veggies here on the croft, so something had to be done.The meat section is a pretty strip of woodland inhabited by three of the daftest, squeakiest saddleback pigs this side of Glen Croe. They’re known as Small, Medium and Splodge in the vain hope of maintaining a strictly professional relationship. Their main carer has, however, been encouraging them to use her as a playground to be climbed on, bounced on and nibbled. She, our eldest daughter, assures me she will still happily feast on sausages when the time comes.We’re already enjoying the two lambs and the ewe who made the ultimate sacrice a couple of weeks ago, so the precedent has been set, but it’s not easy. Easy would be flinging New Zealand chops and Danish bacon into the shopping trolley, but that’s not part of the ‘mission’. We’ll cut back on the almond-lattes and avocado toasts, but will the croft yield Argyll’s finest cocoa and coffee beans – and a mountain of chardonnay grapes  This is my mission and I choose to accept it…"},{"url":null,"title":"building the glashan hydro scheme","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Many TSB customers will have a very long journey to reach their nearest branch. Not everybody can use internet banking.The FCA has already pointed out that during the Covid pandemic it will be hard for banks to reach their customers and engage effectively with them on closure proposals.They also pointed out that customers may not be able to get to a bank to make the necessary preparations before the closure, such as transferring to another bank.Instead of just pointing out these dficulties, the FCA should step in and tell TSB not to go ahead with these closures.Leaving only one TSB branch open in Argyll and Bute is unacceptable.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,After an exceptionally challenging year for older people, Age Scotland is seeking their views in the first comprehensive survey of what it is like to grow older in Scotland.The Big Survey explores all areas of le for older people including health and wellbeing, housing, media representation and the impact of Covid-.We hope to gain a better insight into what older people think, experience and care about. Survey responses will help to prioritise future campaigns and shape policy.Older people were asked to shield, the overwhelming majority of deaths took place among the over s and care home residents faced months of separation from family and friends.Lockdown has contributed to soaring levels of loneliness and the absence of regular exercise activities and sports has had an impact on physical fitness.We are pleased to be launching The Big Survey at such an opportune time. This has been a tumultuous time for older people and undoubtedly the past  months have had a profound impact across society.We want to hear how older people#s lives have been affected by Covid, what their expectations are now, how they want to live and what their requirements are for enjoying a fulfilling and happy later le.I would urge as many older people as possible to take part. Each and every response will be considered and they will help shape our policies and our work in the coming years.So please take the time to share your views and help us be there to support older people throughout Scotland in ways that make a real dference.Visit www.ageuk.org.uk scotland to find out more about The Big Survey.We look forward to hearing from you.Brian Sloan, chief executive, Age ScotlandSir,Barnardo’s Scotland foster carers look after children across the west of Scotland, giving them the best chance to have a happier and positive future.But the charity is concerned that the pandemic could lead to a sharp increase in requests to the charity for foster care and is asking for more potential carers in Argyll and Bute to come forward.The pandemic and lockdowns have increased pressure on vulnerable families, with job losses, deepening poverty and worsening mental health which could all lead to family breakdown.Fostering is an exceptional job.We are looking for people who can do a lot of juggling between work, care and home schooling under lockdown.

In contrast, roads in other parts of Scotland have detailed works planned and money set aside to pay for them.

Indeed, it’s clear that this is the most worrying time in recent history to get a cancer diagnosis.At Macmillan, people are calling our support line every day to tell us about the heightened anxiety, loneliness and distress that they are feeling.On our support line – open seven days a week on     – specially trained nurses, counsellors and financial support advisors are available to help anyone affected by, or worried about, cancer. They can provide comprehensive information and advice, as well as emotional support, to help people with cancer cope with the additional strain of the coronavirus pandemic.We know doctors and nurses are working in unspeakably dficult conditions and are having to make tough decisions every day. Healthcare professionals are doing everything they can to keep cancer care on track, but we also know that some treatment – operations, for example – are being cancelled or postponed because essential services such as ITU are full of seriously ill people with Covid-.What is absolutely vital is thatthere are changes to treatment plans, these must involve the person living with cancer and be communicated clearly.Although some changes may be needed for treatment plans, this is not the case everywhere or for all treatments or tests. Healthcare professionals are doing everything they can to make hospitals a safe environment so it’s really important that people with cancer who have been invited for tests or treatment do attend.GPs are openyou are worried about possible cancer symptoms, and screening and other vital tests have resumed in a Covid-safe way. The NHS is still here for you.As well as our support line, comprehensive cancer information and support is also available on www.macmillan.org.uk and our online community is there to provide invaluable emotional and peer support.Gordon McLean, strategic partnership manager in Scotland for Macmillan Cancer SupportSir,Inclusion Scotland, the leading Scottish disabled people’s organisation, believes that planning for the post Covid- Scotland must be about building towards a more inclusive future for disabled people, not back to an old #normal# that excluded a lot of us.As we launch our manesto for the  Scottish Parliament elections, disabled people have told us about the problems they face daily, both before and as a result of Covid-, and what needs to change.Before Covid-, disabled people were already some of the most marginalised and excluded in society.We were more likely to live in poverty, be unemployed or earn less than non-disabled people, and less likely to leave school with qualications, because of the barriers and exclusion we face in our day-to-day lives.The Covid- crisis and responses to it highlighted this, aggravating existing inequalities and generating new ones, and putting the human rights of disabled people at further risk.Going back to the way things were before is not the answer. We don’t want to go back. We want to go forward to a more inclusive future.The manesto # Rights and Renewal # sets out what disabled people told Inclusion Scotland are the most important issues they face and what needs to be done to make a post-pandemic Scotland a better place for disabled people. It has five key asks:I call on all political parties fighting the Scottish Parliament elections and their candidates to pledge their support for disabled people’s Five Asks.Dr Sally Witcher, Inclusion Scotland chief executive officerSir,Our dilapidated roads continue to be raised as an issue by many constituents.While I understand that our roads department is struggling due to local authority budgets being cut, much more still needs to be done.It has been said to me time and time again that we are fast approaching the point of noand when it comes to our roads and that neglecting day-to-day maintenance will end up costing us more in the long run.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures february 12 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Once again, the group excelled, taking the tally for the month to beyond , miles.The Camanachd Association ran a competition on the final day of the month – whoever ran the furthest would be rewarded with a Scotland replica top from association partners Macronstore Highland.Aberdeen University player Joe Folan set the early pace, clocking up . miles at am.

It was especially pleasing to see non-shinty players join our Strava group and help to get us to Barcelona and back.#The Camanachd Association also raised more than £ for the Scottish Association for Mental Heath through the event."},{"url":null,"title":"staying active while home schooling","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It therefore has a special responsibility to do all it can to advance the peace process.So, while calling for an end to violence, it is simultaneously supplying the weapons necessary to prolong the conflict.The shameful neglect of this leadership role and continued licensing of arms to facilitate Saudi-led offensives is unsustainable. It is a stance that leaves the UK increasingly isolated on the global stage, with countries including Germany, Italy and the Netherlands already banning the export of arms to Saudi Arabia.The UK government now faces a choice: to join President Biden and live up to its obligations as UN penholder by ending the UK’s involvement in the Saudi campaign, or to continue to act as both peacekeeper and warmonger, undermining any moral leadership it might claim.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,The SNP has voted to conceal Alex Salmond#s evidence to the parliamentary inquiry.The Scottish Conservatives brought a vote to the Salmond inquiry demanding that Salmond’s evidence, much of which is already in the public domain, be published.This would allow Salmond to give crucial evidence in person about the SNP#s botched handling of this case. All the SNP MSPs on the committee, however, voted against its publication, meaning it will not be released.The Scottish public deserves to know the truth of what happened and why £, of public money had to be paid to Salmond.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,The personal testimony of the men and boys in the final independent report into non-recent sexual abuse in Scottish football # who have shown incredible courage # demonstrates how needed this independent review has been.The abuse young players have suffered in football is inexcusable and heart-breaking. By bravely speaking up, they provided the catalyst for the review and the changes that will come from it are thanks to them.We welcome the ongoing work the Scottish Football Associationhas carried out in light of the report’s recommendations and encourage them to continue their progress.The SFA is showing it is willing to listen and implement changes that ensure no more children suffer the experiences described in the report.We are pleased to see children and young people’s involvement in the process, including the consultation with the Scottish Children’s Parliament. The voices of children and young people are crucial to developing improvements for their own wellbeing and safety and to change a culture where children can be frightened to speak up.Safeguarding in Sport, a partnership between Children st and sportscotland, has developed the Standards for Child Wellbeing and Protection in Sport, which state children have a right to express their views and have their voice taken into account.

Options! There is only one possible and that should be obvious.When I first moved to Argyll, driving through Glen Croe was a beautul feeling that I had left the urban areas behind and come out into fresh country. No longer # it is a disaster zone and will remain so for a number of years, and possibly decades,a new  safe road is not built.With the elections in May for the Scottish Government, we should be calling on our  politicians to deliver a suitable road through Glen Croe and to do it soon, not  years  away with no firm plans to do it even then. Our politicians are in hiding and it is time they should deliver.The option should be for a new safe road well away from any landslide so that we, the inhabitants of Argyll, can get back to some normal le.Derrick Anstee, InveraraySir,The neglect of the A is a disgrace.It’s not just the long detour via Crianlarich when it rains heavily, it’s the potholes and ruts when we get a spell of cold weather.Three years ago we had a cold winter and the A became a dirt track. Emergency repairs had to be carried out. The Scottish Government said they’d solved the problem. Now we have another cold winter, and again emergency repairs are needed.Other trunk roads in Scotland don’t get closed when it rains or get all these ruts and potholes in a cold winter.We need serious money invested now to solve the A problems. Yet all we get from the Scottish Government is waffle about y public inquiries.We need money and action now to make the A as reliable as Scotland’s other trunk roads, not more cheap solutions.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardMr Reid is the LibDem candidate for May#s Scottish parliamentary electionSir,With reference to theto school, I do hope that the pupils in Lochgilphead Joint Campus are kept in at lunchtime instead of being allowed to roam the streets like herds of wildebeast, with absolutely no social distancing or the wearing of masks.There is a perfectly good ing canteen restaurant in the school and or packed lunches.There is no need, at this time, for them all to be out and crowding supermarkets, fast food shops, cafes and chippies.This needs to be addressed by the Argyll and Bute education department as soon as possible.Name and address suppliedSir,In a leaflet delivered to every home in the Argyll and Bute constituency, Conservative MSP Donald Cameron claims that the #UK Governmentannounced the Argyll and Bute Rural Growth Deal worth £ million# and goes on to say that he is working with local councillors #including Alastair Redman# to #see what further action is needed#.The Rural Growth Deal, however, is a joint project involving £ million from the Scottish Government and a matched sum from the UK Government as well as more than £ million from other sources.In addition the deal has its origins in discussions between the Argyll and Bute MSP Michael Russell, then Scottish Government Finance Secretary John Swinney and the former leader of Argyll and Bute Council, Dick Walsh, in February . The UK Government only became involved some years later.This would be a very serious attempt at disinformation were it not so ludicrously self-defeating. Mr Cameron is standing to be a member of the Scottish Parliament yet he is trying to airbrush out anything Scottish about the largest investment ever in Argyll and Bute and its future.I hope it is merely ignorance of what has happened here that has led him to so severely misrepresent the truth of the issue, becauseit is political spin then he needs to apologise and withdraw the leaflet.Being pictured next to Alastair Redman won#t help him either, given that Mr Redman is best known for his regular letters to local papers attacking the very Scottish Government that is putting an extra £ million into this area.The Scottish Tories need to decide who they are working for # Boris Johnson in London, or the people of Scotland.Until Mr Cameron sorts his loyalties out, then he can#t be regarded as any sort of contender for the privilege of representing the people of Argyll and Bute.Michael Russell MSPSir,The SNP has committed £, to prepare for a second referendum within the next year.Instead of being focused on Scotland’s vaccination programme and protecting people’s jobs, the SNP’s priority is holding another isive referendum as early as this year.Setting aside this vast sum of money to help preparations for a referendum shows the SNP’s commitment toScotland to the politics of ision all over again.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 20 the final tee","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The conversations, Kaya hopes, will feel like the discussion that would usually evolve over a cup of tea or an evening pint.Kaya, who begins her residency this month, will record the conversations which will be stitched together as a sound-based artwork called Milk + Two Sugars which will eventually be exhibited on the island for local audiences to engage with and listen to.Over the last few weeks, invitations have been extended to the local residentsin the communities of The Bush and Ballochgoy. To take part they need only call   armed with a ‘cuppa’ of their choosing.The phoneline will be open to two people per day between am-pm on Thursday March  and Friday th, Thursday March  and Friday th. An answer phone message will be available in between times for people to register their interest in taking part.Kaya, who graduated from Duncan of Jordanstone in  with BA Hons First Class in Art and Philosophy in , said: #I begin this residency with a strong nostalgic feeling of connection to Rothesay even though only knowing it through family anecdotes of holidays there. I hope this residency extends these memories into my own stories of the people and stories I come to meet.#With Milk + Two Sugars, I aim to extend these connections beyond a screen and focus on the house phone as my source of extension. I anticipate these oral histories will create an enticing sound landscape reverberated in public spaces for the very community that it captures. The work will also be available to call and hear via a phone number—extending off the island the essence of Bute, those who call it home.#The residency, now in its third iteration, creating an opportunity for emerging artists, whose practice is rooted in social engagement.The Contemporary Visual Art Programme is led by Sophie Crichton-Stuart and curated by Morven Gregor."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures february 26 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Over the course of one to two weeks, the lesions will become even more discoloured and will flatten, and after this they will spontaneously resolve without treatment.A substantial number of these lesions have been seen, primarily in adolescents and young adults with no or only mild symptoms of COVID-. They make up the majority of skin issues associated with the virus. In twointernationalreportson dferent types of suspected COVID-related skin conditions, around  per centof patients with skin complaints reported these lesions.However, given these lesions correlate with mild disease, many of the patients with them in these studies didnrsquot qualy for a COVID- test at the time, and  per centwere otherwise asymptomatic. So while the swt rise of these lesions during the pandemic suggests theyrsquore associated with COVID-, direct confirmation of this hasnrsquot been established. Itrsquos possible theyrsquore caused by some other related factor.The red swelling of these lesions often appears on the top of the toes, close to the nail.

An explanation is that these lesions appear only after a long delay ndash up to  days after infection.The cause of these lesions has been debated. A possible culprit could be type  interferons, proteins that regulate the antiviral properties of the immune system. The theory is that high production of these interferons might result in patients rapidly clearing the coronavirus, but also causeinjury to blood vesselsand increased inflammation. This would explain the coincidence of mild or nonexistent disease, negative tests and skin damage.Another theory concernsACE, the molecule that the coronavirus uses to get inside cells. It is present on many types of cell, including those in the sweat glands, which are common on the palms of the hand and soles of the feet. This could make these areas particularly vulnerable to damage from the virus.Or, it could be thatdamage to blood vessels, caused either by the immune response or the virus, leads to cell death and multiple mini blood clots in the toes.Maculopapular rashThis term describes bothflat and raised areas of discoloured skin. Astudyof  patients in Spain found that  per centof patients with COVID-related skin changes had this kind of rash.These were associated with more severe COVID- symptoms, and were mainly found on the trunk in middle-aged to elderly patients. They tended to last - days, appearing - days after infection.A suggested cause is the bodyrsquos immune system going into overdrive. In some patients, ahyperinflammatory phaseoccurs - days after infection, which leads to tissue damage and, potentially, more severe disease and death.HivesAlso known as urticaria, these areraised areas of itchy skin. In astudyinvolving four hospitals in China and Italy,  per centof COVID- patients that complained of skin changes presented with hives.Hives typically precede or present at the same time as other symptoms, making them useful for diagnosis. They are more common among middle-aged patients and are associated with more severe disease. Viral infections are a known trigger of hives, as they cause the breakdown of cells and the release of histamine through a cascade of reactions in the immune system.Severe urticaria may feel like it is stinging or burning. namtipStudio ShutterstockHowever, itrsquos important to remember that hives are also a noted side-effect of many drugs that have been used to treat COVID-, such ascorticosteroidsandremdesevir.Vesicular lesionsThese are clearfluid-filled sacs under the skin, similar to those seen in chicken pox. They are less common compared to the skin conditions above: in the previously mentionedSpanish studyof skin changes associated with COVID-, only  per centof patients had these vesicles.However, they are thought to be a more specic indication of someone having COVID- than those already listed, and so are more useful for diagnosis. They appear to present in patients with mild disease around  days after infection.

The notion that Scotland, with a mature European economy, is uniquely incapable of tackling our post-Covid challenges tells us more about those who spout these colonial myths than they realise.Brexiteer insistence that walking out of the world’s largest single market will lead to #world beating# trade deals is for the birds.Mr Abendorth#s self-lauded Tory deal with the Pacic is small beer compared to the . per cent hit to Scotland’s economy that Brexit brings in its wake.By contrast, the catastrophic - banking crash was three per cent, which we are still paying for with stagnant wages and food banks.Leaving the EU at the height of the Covid pandemic has been both reckless and unforgivable, as is the price that Scotland is expected to pay for Boris Johnson’s folly.Independence is now an urgent imperative to put the sovereign powers of change back into the hands of the Scottish people.Our dilapidated roads and poorly maintained cemeteries continue to be raised by many of my justiably concerned and upset constituents, including many members of  community councils both on the islands and the mainland.While I understand that our roads department is struggling due to local authority budgets being cut by the Scottish Government, much more still needs to be done.I will, as your councillor, represent your interests and will argue that our hard-working  workforce is given every opportunity to exercise its initiative, to deal with issues at a local level.It has been said to me time and time again that we are fast approaching the point of noand when it comes to our roads neglecting day-to-day maintenance will end up costing us more in the long-run.I will continue to lobby day-in and day-out for better infrastructure in my ward.The Scottish Government’s long-awaited infrastructure investment plan is a big disappointment for Argyll and Bute.The Rest and Be Thankful only gets one small mention – it is to be #enhanced#, but no details and no cash allocated. In contrast, roads in other parts of Scotland have detailed works planned and money set aside to pay for them.After  years of failed attempts at a solution and six months after a major landslide, Argyll deserves better than a vague election promise to #enhance# the road.The only new ferries mentioned are two -metre ferries. These are the same two ferries that were promised in the  infrastructure plan, but still lie in a yard, years late and well over budget. Neither of these ferries is for Argyll and Bute. All we get is vague promises of a #long-term plan and investment programme#.This so-called plan is a shocking neglect of Argyll and Bute.The start of  is proving to be an acutely challenging time for people with cancer, the NHS and for cancer care.

Healthcare professionals are doing everything they can to make hospitals a safe environment so it’s really important that people with cancer who have been invited for tests or treatment do attend.GPs are openyou are worried about possible cancer symptoms, and screening and other vital tests have resumed in a Covid-safe way.

Its six pages contain not a single reference to farming, fishing or aquaculture # all vital industries in Argyll and Bute.The Tories have every reason to be mortied by the devastation their botched Brexit deal has had on the lives of our farmers and fishermen, but to simply ignore these issues is an insult to those who work in these industries and the communities that depend on them.Members of Campbeltown Community Council wish to express their concern regarding the amount of dog fouling that is not being uplted by a small minority of irresponsible dog owners.We are very fortunate in Campbeltown to have so many dferent places to exercise during the current lockdown, only for these areas to be spoiled by dog fouling.

At a time when Nicola Sturgeon’s press conferences dominate the airwaves and many national newspapers support one political party, local newspapers are a very important way for people of all shades of opinion to get their message across.I am very pleased that all the opposition parties worked together in the Scottish Parliament and got behind a motion which called on the SNP government to keep giving business rates relief to newspapers and to use its advertising budget to support regional and local newspapers.The SNP opposed this motion but fortunately it was passed by one vote. I hope the SNP will abide by the will of Parliament and not go ahead with its sinister attack on Scotland’s local newspapers.The UK Government has announced a further £. billion in funding to help Scotland tackle Covid-.

We know spring will come as it always does, but will it be like last year  The coronavirus statistics are better, but will there be another surge Perhaps the hope from the emerging signs of spring or the increasing curb of coronavirus is not enough. Perhaps fear of catching the virus, of death coming knocking and of what lies beyond the grave are never far from your mind. Is there a hope to deal with these legitimate fears  The good news of the Christian message is that the answer is yes, there is.This week saw the start of Lent, a season that takes us on a journey of hope. #But how is Lent a journey of hope # you ask. Where does Lent end  With the historical events of Jesus’ death and resurrection. They are why you can have real hope. By his death, Jesus dealt with our sin and failure and defeated death so that we need no longer fear it. His triumph was confirmed by his physical, bodily resurrection.You can experience this hope by trusting in Jesus alone.

The couple had two sons while living in Kintyre # Jim#s great-great-grandfather Hugh on December ,  and Edward on January , .The family emigrated from Campbeltown in  when Hugh was about three-and-a-half years old and Edward was an infant. They eventually settled in what was to become West Virginia, where William farmed land along the banks of the Ohio River.In America, the couple welcomed three more children # Elizabeth, born on July ,  William Jnr, born on November ,  and Margaret, born on June , .William#s brother Edward followed him to the States in , moving alongside him in West Virginia. Another brother, Archibald, is reported to have emigrated to Wisconsin in .William died of of tuberculosis, aged , on December , , three months after his we died from typhoid fever.Jim, who was an educator in Las Vegas for the past  years and recently retired, said researching his McTaggart ancestry was one of his #favourite hobbies#. He thinks he takes his love of genealogy from his late father, Robert E Cunningham, who recorded his own family history in a publication titled The McTaggart Families ofRobert wrote that, according to the Scots Ancestry Research Society, four place names were associated with the family#s McTaggart ancestors in Kintyre, which were: Achinlene # also spelled Achinglene # Caoranbeg, Knocknow and Glenahervie.Robert added: #These were presumably small villages or crofts where the families lived at ious times before their emigrations. I have obtained Ordnance Survey maps of Great Britain in every scale available, including ones that show highly detailed features of the Parish of Southend, and also a few th century maps of the Kintyre peninsula. Of the four place names above that were associated with these McTaggart families, only Glenahervie can still be found on any of these maps.#Jim told the Courier: #My father tried his best to uncover a link to any source of McTaggarts prior to William emigrating in  but to no avail. My sister Candace and I continue working on finding Scottish relatives, which brings me to contacting your paper.#He is hoping to get in touch with anyone who may be able to assist in locating any of his McTaggart relatives.Jim said: #I enjoy going back to my McTaggart ancestral land in West Virginia to visit the cemeteries, and look forward to visiting Scotland as soon as travel resumes.#I am so amazed that with all of the male McTaggarts in my family#s history, there is no longer one living relative carrying the McTaggart name.#Anyone who feels they may be able to provide Jim with any information or assist him in his research can contact him by emailing mfcnevada@gmail"},{"url":null,"title":"from our files february 26 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The politicians met Andrew Davidson of Ernst and Young, administrators, and David Steele, factory manager in private.#Very useful albeit in dficult circumstances,# was Mr Moore#s verdict. #I hope the administration and management team will be able to work their way through it and Alan Reid will be taking away a number of points to discuss with the Scottish government and others.#Mr Reid added: #With a modern factory, a skilled, committed workforce and the demand for wind energy, it must be possible to find a company willing to take over the site.#TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOHotel jobs boost for the areaA Glasgow company has announced it is to undertake a £ million refit of the semi-derelict Keil Hotel at Southend.Key Leisure wants to turn the art deco building into a four-star hotel and country club.The hotel has been standing empty since  and is believed to be in a poor state of repair. The company hopes to have the hotel open by mid summer.Key Leisure is part of the Premier Cuisine group which owns several pubs and hotels in the west of Scotland, including the Ingledene Hotel at Ardrossan.The hotel is to be called the Mull of Kintyre Hotel and Country Club. It will have  en-suite bedrooms and a leisure facility including a swimming pool, training room and sauna. Once it opens the development is expected to create  jobs.Mr Brian Morton, managing director of Premier Cuisine, said: #The group feels there is a lot of potential in the Campbeltown area for a hotel and country club of this standard.#He added the local golf courses would prove an attraction for visitors from North America and Europe.FIFTY YEARS AGOEditor#s note: The following article and this week#s photograph are used in historical context and should not be considered the view of today’s Campbeltown Courier. This was, unbelievably, the front page lead story  years ago.Hot pants# they are selling like hot cakesThe cries of despondency from the men of the world rang high when the midi and the maxi skirt looked like taking over from the miniskirt.For the past few ecstatic years, males in Campbeltown had been able to ogle at the lithe legs of the females and the thought of these lovely legs being covered abhorred these gentlemen.However, there is still hope for the leg brigade. Hot pants, it seems, are selling like hot cakes and it already looks like being a short summer!In Campbeltown, the shorts are selling well, especially among girls in their late teens.Most of the girls are buying them for wearing to dances # runner-up to Miss Campbeltown was wearing a pair of shorts # but already one or two have been spotted in the street during the day.The shorts cost, on average, about £. and are made from a iety of materials including denim, silk and wool. Shorts by themselves are going well but the bib type is selling best. The pants are also being worn with midi dresses and maxi coats thus giving the girls the best of both worlds. Popular colours are purple, black and red.Local drapers expect a big demand for the hot-pants in the summer and are stocking up accordingly.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOMishap to SS KinlochThe steamer Kinloch met with a mishap on the outward passage from Campbeltown on Monday, but fortunately it did not prove of a serious nature.When the steamer was approaching Lochranza, and was quite near to the pier, the eccentric shaft gave way, and the vessel had to drop anchor. The weather conditions were good.A telegram was dispatched for the services of a tug, and as the delay at the outset was likely to be considerable, a large number of the passengers landed and proceeded overland to Lamlash, where they caught a boat for the mainland.After a bit, the engineers were successful in effecting a temporary repair, and the Kinloch was able to resume the journey under her own steam.There was no interruption in the service on account of the accident, the necessary repair being completed in time to enable her to take up the inward run next day."},{"url":null,"title":"leader february 26 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It really will make a dference to our environment and is something that can be done easily on our daily walks.I would also like to say a big thank you to Jimmy Robertson, the bin man who contacted me and donated his litter-picker, bags and gloves. It is very much appreciated. I wish Jimmy a really happy retirement, and would like to thank him for all he has done over the years.I went back to work at MAKI Pups, the new outdoor nursery based in Lochgilphead, last week but I intend to continue with my litter-picking at weekends when I can. I won#t stop now I#ve started.If anyone wishes to help in any way, please phone me on  .There was an interesting letter from Ron Wilson in the February  edition of the Courier which, as with any politician#s pronouncements, was laced with spin, hyperbole or half truths and consequently tells only half the story.Regarding vaccines, nobody, except the SNP, talks about Westminster#s charity. It is my understanding that Great Britain and Northern Ireland are part of the UK and independently opted not to use the EU system and purchased vaccines for itself.This elicited the usual howls of derision by SNP politicians along the lines of: #This idiotic refusal is all about Brexit and nothing to do with the pandemic and will cost lives,# and others of a similar vein.The inept EU vaccine-purchasing system has been and still is chaotic. France, at the time of writing, with a population of  million, has vaccinated . million. Pro rata, under the EU system, Scotland would probably have received , as opposed to the . million currently vaccinated.The electorate keep hearing: #As an independent member of the EU#. This is possibly an SNP aspiration but I think there are several hurdles to an independent Scotland joining the EU.What currency would be used, what proposals are there to meet the EU fiscal rules for membership in respect of the annual GDP deficit which is currently running at . per cent, well above the three per cent required The last figures available for government debt to GDP of  per cent is well above the  per cent required. Then there is the strong possibility of a Spanish veto or perhaps they are proposing throwing Clara Ponsatí to the wolves and saying: #We are sorry we backed the Catalans in order to curry favour with Madrid.#Regarding the EU solidarity stimulus plan, I would hope that it was considerably greater than the UK there are  member countries. I understand that it is € billion, spread over three years, and the grants and loans are subject to strict requirements. I notice that you do not mention £. billion to date allocated through the Barnett formula which is separate from the money. I do not know how much, currently paid to Kate Forbes MSP, cabinet secretary for finance#s department in the furlough scheme.Regarding the comments relating to Brexiteers and leaving the EU as #Johnson#s folly#, it has obviously escaped Mr Wilson#s notice that leaving the EU, liking the decision or not, was a democratic one by the UK electorate and, unlike the EU or the SNP, in our constitution we do not send the electorate back to vote again until such time that they #vote correctly#.Banking crash  May I remind Mr Wilson that it was the Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of Scotland which were the main protagonists in the UK which had a serious impact on our economy. Mr Wilson#s rather emotive #gimcrack imperial fantasies# could well have applied to the antics of the two Scottish banks# boards of directors.I am not particularly an avid supporter of politicians per se but the current SNP government by any yardstick is a really appalling administration with a record of declining education, health care and financial mismanagement, just to mention three areas.Leaving aside the first two, what should cause concern is the eye-watering amounts of taxpayers# money wasted. The new Royal Hospital for Children and Young People in Edinburgh is at least £ million over budget and still not fully operative Ferguson Shipyard ferry project, currently £ million and no ferries, projected final cost an additional £ million and no firm delivery date other assorted projects like the BiFab yards, £ million, two of which have been bought by a UK company for £, Prestwick Airport, there is a bit of #smoke and mirrors# but somewhere around £ million is close.A bit closer to home, the Glen Croe problem up to the Rest and Be Thankful, which has been ongoing since  and is regularly subject to closure, has had at least £ million spent on it to date. It is of no surprise that Jim McColl said that #everything the SNP touch is a mess#. Added to that, we have the current internecine Salmond Sturgeon Murrell case ongoing currently swallowed up in excess of £, of taxpayers# money and rising.Mr Wilson is perfectly entitled to his point of view, as I am to mine, but as I said in my opening paragraph, and this applies to politicians of all political persuasions, please present the full narrative not some unsubstantiated wish list.The neglect of the A is a disgrace. It’s not just the long detour via Crianlarich when it rains heavily, it’s the potholes and ruts when we get a spell of cold weather.Three years ago, we had a cold winter and the A became a dirt track. Emergency repairs had to be carried out. The Scottish Government said it would solved the problem. Now we have another cold winter, and again emergency repairs are needed.Other trunk roads in Scotland don’t get closed when it rains or get all these ruts and potholes in a cold winter.We need serious money invested now to solve the A problems. Yet all we get from the Scottish Government is waffle about y public inquiries.  We need money and action now to make the A as reliable as Scotland’s other trunk roads, not more cheap solutions."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week february 26 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

But, we live in a world which increasingly believes that to disagree is to hate.Could it be that to disagree might in some circumstances actually be the manestation of love If a child searching for meaning and identity and love has chosen a path of destruction through heroin, for example, would a parent be loving to blindly affirm him Could disagreement be love The apostle Paul wrote this to Timothy, a young pastor: #And the Lord#s servant must not be quarrelsome, but kind to everyone, able to teach, patiently enduring evil, correcting his opponents with gentleness. God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth.#Timothy was to be a model of the Lord Jesus, the most loving man who ever lived and yet the one who disagrees with everyone. Disagrees  Really  Yes, Jesus# first word to the world in the gospel of Matthew is, #repent#, that is, #you are heading the wrong way, turn from sin to God.#Jesus isn’t addressing a particular section of society, or a particular behaviour, he is not directing his gaze at #everyone except me#. This is the most loving call in the world to everyone everywhere. And it#s good news because it comes from a saviour who paid for sin and who offers us the power to change.#I have come,# said Jesus, #that they may have le and have it in abundance.#His invitation  Come, find out how to live and how to love."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 20 the final tee","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The conversations, Kaya hopes, will feel like the discussion that would usually evolve over a cup of tea or an evening pint.Kaya, who begins her residency this month, will record the conversations which will be stitched together as a sound-based artwork called Milk + Two Sugars which will eventually be exhibited on the island for local audiences to engage with and listen to.Over the last few weeks, invitations have been extended to the local residentsin the communities of The Bush and Ballochgoy. To take part they need only call   armed with a ‘cuppa’ of their choosing.The phoneline will be open to two people per day between am-pm on Thursday March  and Friday th, Thursday March  and Friday th. An answer phone message will be available in between times for people to register their interest in taking part.Kaya, who graduated from Duncan of Jordanstone in  with BA Hons First Class in Art and Philosophy in , said: #I begin this residency with a strong nostalgic feeling of connection to Rothesay even though only knowing it through family anecdotes of holidays there. I hope this residency extends these memories into my own stories of the people and stories I come to meet.#With Milk + Two Sugars, I aim to extend these connections beyond a screen and focus on the house phone as my source of extension. I anticipate these oral histories will create an enticing sound landscape reverberated in public spaces for the very community that it captures. The work will also be available to call and hear via a phone number—extending off the island the essence of Bute, those who call it home.#The residency, now in its third iteration, creating an opportunity for emerging artists, whose practice is rooted in social engagement.The Contemporary Visual Art Programme is led by Sophie Crichton-Stuart and curated by Morven Gregor."},{"url":null,"title":"campbeltowns colin joins team scotland staff","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Ed called a meeting at his home on March   to discuss the matter, with  settlers in attendance.A petition was drawn up and signed, asking for the creation of a post office with Ed as postmaster. He suggested naming the settlement Edison in honour of the inventor Thomas Edison.This led to the establishment in  of a trading post on land donated by Ed. In around , Edison#s first hotel was built on a small section of Ed#s land adjoining that on which the store stood.In , Ed married Mary Judson whose parents, Phoebe and Holden Judson, founded the city of Lynden in Washington.

If we want children and families to come to the area we need to keep the school open,# he said.Argyll and Bute Council met yesterdaywhen members were asked to agree to hold informal pre-consultation meetings with representatives from  communities that may be affected by the school estate review.The council was also asked to agree to review the school estate #on an ongoing basis# and reducing the future scale of any changes which would be considered at any one time.Now the proposal is for Rhunahaorine to go into Glenbarr and Clachan and Skipness to go to Tarbert.

This is in contradiction to what is surely the council#s main aim when setting the budget # saving money where possible.Despite many of KRL#s staff having barriers to working, they do an exemplary job and are happy in their workplace # something which is evident from a visit to the recycling centre. The fact that some of them may lose the jobs they enjoy and do so well as a result of this decision is shocking and heart-breaking.Campbeltown has seen record levels of redundancies over the last couple of years, with more than  lay-offs at CS Wind and Campbeltown Creamery alone, never mind the many people who have since lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic. To potentially add to this level of unemployment for no apparent good reason is baffling.KRL not only provides an efficient and cost effective service but worthwhile jobs to people who may otherwise struggle to find employment and are no doubt very concerned about their futures right now.This decision should be reconsidered."},{"url":null,"title":"letters march 5 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I immediately hung up # wondering which of my frailties had been discovered # and phoned  which tells you the last number that called.I twice noted the number given by  and ventured to phone it. On dialling this number, the phone company advised me that there was #no such number#.Over a week, adopting identical procedures, five dferent #no such numbers# were found. The job of answering morning calls was then delegated to the message answering machine and only once did it receive a call which was terminated speedily by the caller without a message.Is there a flaw in our phone companies# systems with consequent loss of income  If this flaw could be eradicated, phone scammers might be less numerous and consequently afford a little more protection for the vulnerable.Going by theof John Newall#s reply to my letter on England#s disastrous Brexit, forced upon Scotland against our democratic wishes, I had expected better than the mishmash of worn out tropes and John Bull exceptionalism trotted out by Mr Newall.Mr Newall makes great play of the successful roll-out of the Covid vaccine in Scotland and the UK. He is absolutely right, it has been a fantastic achievement, but to then go on to use this success to denigrate the EU#s vaccine programme is crass and over simplistic.Our success is an illusion until both doses of vaccine are administered, crowing about vaccines when only . per cent of the UK population has had the vital second jag, compared, for example, to . per cent in Denmark, is both presumptuous and inappropriate.Mr Newall goes on to assert that Scotland has a deficit that will prevent Scotland re-entering the EU, without of course mentioning the elephant in the room, the UK#s ruinous £ trillion # and increasing # debt. Unionists need to get their own house in order before lecturing anyone .Of course, legally, Scotland has no #deficit# or #debt#. How can a country with virtually no borrowing ability have a debt  What Scotland does have is a notional #debt#, the price of Westminster failure within the UK, where spending outwith Scotland#s control is assigned to Scotland, such as Trident, HS and London’s Crossrail. Spending that Scots taxpayers cough up for.Indeed,Courier readers start counting now at the rate of one a second, they#ll reach the number of pounds spent on Boris Johnson’s failed Track and Trace system at about .am on April  in the year . Readers may well wonder where the money went and why this is being loaded on to Scotland#s ledger.Straight from the #Better Together# playbook, Mr Newall brings up the hoary old #Spanish veto# myth. The truth is that Spain has no issue with an independent Scotland in the EU so long as this is within the framework of the UK constitution # which it is.Unlike Catalonia#s predicament, Scotland is not a #region# of the UK, there is no constitutional prohibition on independence votes or indeed of Scotland abrogating the  Treaty of Union with England.This is why successive prime ministers, from Margaret Thatcher to David Cameron, have repeatedly recognised the right of the Scottish people to independence # and why Boris Johnson#s oafish #No# will run into the sand.Mr Newall and I will never agree but that is the essence of democracy, and the right to choose in a free country.Scotland can either remain, semi-detached and impotent, as part of an increasingly insular Little Englander Tory Britain, bringing in its wake further austerity and diminished le chances for our young people, or Scots can vote for independence, just like our neighbours.Yes, there will be dficult choices, yes, there will be mistakes, but they will be our decisions to get right as we work for the prosperous, open and internationalist country that is within our grasp.I am delighted that our council will be investing nearly £. million to help keep Argyll and Bute going and growing.After relentless campaigning from myself and others it#s great to see, at long last, some substantial investment in our crumbling infrastructure.Building on investments made in previous years, an additional £. million will be invested to drive forward improvements and repairs to Argyll and Bute#s network of roads in rural, remote, island and urban communities, bringing the overall roads reconstruction budget to £ million for  .We are also investing more in active travel, in line with the council#s agreed priorities.

heavy on me as president, my colleagues on the board and the joint response group as we have watched the new strain of the virus spread rapidly.ldquoWhile national sport has been afforded the privilege of elite sporting exemption, the risk of mass transportation of untested, largely part-time players is something that cannot be sustained as the cases continue to rise and available hospital

I canrsquot remember the last time I was out for this long!If I were to describe myself, I would say I always have both feet on the ground, but this does not apply during white winters.There is something relaxing about snow that I cannot explain. I instantly turn from a rational person into a dreamer who can spend the whole day outside just watching the white crystals slowly falling from the sky.As I was walking beside the River Esk, the sun came out and made the landscape look special. I walked all the way down to the river mouth, where I sat on the bank to savour the view. Although I was enjoying myself, I also completely lost track of time.I sprang to my feet ready to head back when I spotted something I have never seen before.At first glance, I thought it was a goosander ndash a common resident duck species. It was dficult to have a proper look, as the duck was swimming right against the steep riverbank. I had to look down and lean out over the edge of the bank in order to see it.As soon as its prominent crest appeared before my eyes, I knew it was a red-breasted merganser ndash a winter visitor to the east coast, which I have never had the occasion to photograph.The minute I saw the bird in its full glory, all I could think of was its shaggy lsquolockdown haircutrsquo! I hope you agree with me!Without hesitation, I took a few photos and left the bird in peace.On the way home, I caught sight of a kingfisher that was rushing to his favourite spot for dinner.These ducks can be commonly seen in winter as they travel along the UKrsquos coastline.Their breeding population is concentrated in the north west of Scotland, England and Wales. They can be found in both fresh and salt-water habitats, especially in shallow bays or estuaries.The red-breasted merganser is a handsome bird which belongs to the sawbill family.The term lsquosawbillrsquo relates to the thin and serrated bill, which is designed to catch and hold its slippery fish prey.These ducks can be frequently spotted as they sit low in the water or swim with their head partially submerged.This technique allows them to easily locate their prey and prepare for a e underwater.Both sexes have a prominent profile. During the breeding season, the male develops a dark metallic green colouring on the head, whilst the elongated feathers at the rear of its head form a long and attractive crest.He also gets a white neck collar and reddish-brown breast with black speckles.Outside the breeding season, his plumage resembles the femalersquos, which has a rusty head and crest and pale chest throughout the year.Despite pairing up in winter, the red-breasted mergansers breed in summer.www.facebook zanslens www.instagram zans_lens www

farmland half a mile south of Gullane.It has been uninhabited for more than  years and is today badly ruined and overgrown with noxious vegetation, with nettles and brambles abounding on the site.It was constructed in  or thereabouts by Patrick Livingstone of Saltcoats.An armorial  relocated from the castle to a nearby cottage has the arms of the Livingstone family and the initials of the builder and his we Margaret Fettis of Fawside.The castle has some interesting and unusual architectural features, with a courtyard enclosure and two tall towers to the west, with a vaulted arch between them.A lectern-style doorsquocot was built immediately to the north of these buildings and from its style it has been dated to the mid-th century.Also, in the late th century an outer wall was added, enclosing an orchard and extensive gardens which lay to the north, east and south of the castle courtyard.A lintel over a door in the north wall of the garden carries the date  and the initials GL, presumably for the same George Livingstone who is mentioned in the Records of Parliament as George Levingstoun of Saltcoats in .Saltcoats Castle remained in the Livingstone family until an heiress married Alexander Menzies of Culterallers.Their daughter, Margaret Menzies, married John Hamilton of Pencaitland in , and Saltcoats became the property of that family.Margaret outlived her husband and married secondly William Carmichael, son of the st Earl of Hyndford.She also outlived him and died in , the final resident of Saltcoats Castle.In about , the castle began to be used as a source of stone for local building work, constructing farm cottages and stone walls, and leading to the destruction of much of Saltcoats Castle.Whereas there is consensus that the Scottish population of wild boar was wiped out in the late th or early th century, there are ergent opinions as to where the last specimen was hunted down.One of the claims to fame of Saltcoats Castle is that the last wild boar in Scotland was said to have been killed not far away.The East Lothian postcard kingpin Reginald Phillimore had heard that it was hunted down and slain by Livingstone of Saltcoats, and one of his cards has a vignette of the last wild boar running for its le, with a spear-wielding huntsman in hot pursuit on horseback .As we know, the Livingstone family definitely inhabited Saltcoats at the relevant time, and one of them is said to have received a royal gt in exchange for the head of the last wild boar.According to another version of the Saltcoats boar legend, it was a particularly large and ferocious wild boar that was killed near Saltcoats, not the ultimate specimen yet another version has the valiant Livingstone killing a wild boar that had been terrorising Gullane and its surroundings, being awarded the salt marsh land south of Gullane to build his castle by the king.Saltcoats has an East Lothian rival, namely the hamlet of Prora, near Drem, where a lsquoBoar Stonersquo is said to mark the site where the last wild boar in Haddingtonshire had been slain.This stone used to stand in a field but, since it impeded the agricultural pursuits, it was removed to the garden of Prora Farmhouse, where I have seen it .It was inspected by a party of Edinburgh archaeologists in  and found to be a fragment from a medieval cross, however.The name of Swinton, Berwickshire, originated as lsquoSwinersquos Townrsquo because of the abundance of wild boars in this part of the country.The Swinton family have a wild boar in their coat of arms and there is a tradition that the last wild boar in Scotland was killed near the village.Finally, we have the village of Torinturk, Argyll and Bute, whose name means lsquoHill of the Boarrsquo in Gaelic there are many advocates, on the internet and where, claiming that the last wild boar in Scotland was slain here.Today, there are several wild boar farms in Scotland, from which the tough and canny animals occasionally escape.There are established herds of free-living wild boar in England, and in September , a wild boar was photographed near Fort William, quite possibly the first of these animals to put its trotters on Scottish soil for many a century, but hardly the last, I would think.When visiting Saltcoats, I kept a close lookout for wild boars but found none of them, having to be content with ing home for a meal of Scottish wild boar cutlets cooked the Swedish way."},{"url":null,"title":"plan-approach-horrible-histories-author-create-child-friendly-history-haddington","story":"The hugely

Over the course of one to two weeks, the lesions will become even more discoloured and will flatten, and after this they will spontaneously resolve without treatment.A substantial number of these lesions have been seen, primarily in adolescents and young adults with no or only mild symptoms of COVID-. They make up the majority of skin issues associated with the virus. In twointernationalreportson dferent types of suspected COVID-related skin conditions, around % of patients with skin complaints reported these lesions.However, given these lesions correlate with mild disease, many of the patients with them in these studies didnrsquot qualy for a COVID- test at the time, and % were otherwise asymptomatic. So while the swt rise of these lesions during the pandemic suggests theyrsquore associated with COVID-, direct confirmation of this hasnrsquot been established. Itrsquos possible theyrsquore caused by some other related factor.The red swelling of these lesions often appears on the top of the toes, close to the nail. Ternavskaia Olga Alibec ShutterstockExactly when they appear is also somewhat unclear. In astudyanalysing  patients with suspected COVID-related skin changes, % presented with chilblain-like lesions. None of the patients had respiratory symptoms and they were all COVID-negative at the onset of their lesions. An explanation is that these lesions appear only after a long delay ndash up to  days after infection.The cause of these lesions has been debated. A possible culprit could be type  interferons, proteins that regulate the antiviral properties of the immune system. The theory is that high production of these interferons might result in patients rapidly clearing the coronavirus, but also causeinjury to blood vesselsand increased inflammation. This would explain the coincidence of mild or nonexistent disease, negative tests and skin damage.Another theory concernsACE, the molecule that the coronavirus uses to get inside cells. It is present on many types of cell, including those in the sweat glands, which are common on the palms of the hand and soles of the feet. This could make these areas particularly vulnerable to damage from the virus.Or, it could be thatdamage to blood vessels, caused either by the immune response or the virus, leads to cell death and multiple mini blood clots in the toes.Maculopapular rashThis term describes bothflat and raised areas of discoloured skin. Astudyof  patients in Spain found that % of patients with COVID-related skin changes had this kind of rash.These were associated with more severe COVID- symptoms, and were mainly found on the trunk in middle-aged to elderly patients. They tended to last - days, appearing - days after infection.A suggested cause is the bodyrsquos immune system going into overdrive. In some patients, ahyperinflammatory phaseoccurs - days after infection, which leads to tissue damage and, potentially, more severe disease and death.HivesAlso known as urticaria, these areraised areas of itchy skin. In astudyinvolving four hospitals in China and Italy, % of COVID- patients that complained of skin changes presented with hives.Hives typically precede or present at the same time as other symptoms, making them useful for diagnosis. They are more common among middle-aged patients and are associated with more severe disease. Viral infections are a known trigger of hives, as they cause the breakdown of cells and the release of histamine through a cascade of reactions in the immune system.Severe urticaria may feel like it is stinging or burning. namtipStudio ShutterstockHowever, itrsquos important to remember that hives are also a noted side-effect of many drugs that have been used to treat COVID-, such ascorticosteroidsandremdesevir.Vesicular lesionsThese are clearfluid-filled sacs under the skin, similar to those seen in chicken pox. They are less common compared to the skin conditions above: in the previously mentionedSpanish studyof skin changes associated with COVID-, only % of patients had these vesicles.However, they are thought to be a more specic indication of someone having COVID- than those already listed, and so are more useful for diagnosis.

None of them are definitive and questions remain, particularly about the longer term. But the answers give us hope.: Budget days odd customsThe three vaccines authorised so far in the UK are from Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-Astra Zeneca and Moderna. All were tested in trials involving tens of thousands of participants with very promising results for preventing disease. The first two vaccines are now being rolled out in Scotland and it is expected that supply of the Moderna vaccine, already being used in other countries, will be available later this Spring.Trial results and review of these by the MHRA and the Committee on Human Medicines show that the vaccines are safe and effective. But efficacy shown in carefully controlled clinical trials does not always result in effectiveness in the real world. We now have studies comparing outcomes between people who have received their first dose and those who havenrsquot.In Scotland, EAVE II is an ongoing project that uses patient data to track vaccine roll out in real time. Last week the research team published a paper looking at vaccine effect since the programme started and up to February . They compared outcomes for people who had received their first dose and those who had not.The study found that by four weeks after the first dose the Pfizer vaccine reduced the risk of being admitted to hospital by % and the Oxford-Astra Zeneca vaccine by %. For those aged over  there was an % reduction in hospitalisation.In England, a further study from Public Health England found a similar % reduction in hospitalisation for over-s from either vaccine. The same study found that the vaccines provided protection against developing symptomatic disease and, for the Pfizer vaccine , an % reduction in deaths. These are hugely encouraging results. But research is needed that looks at the durability of this impact, and effect of two doses of the vaccine. These studies have only been published as pre-prints, which means their findings still need to be peer-reviewed by independent experts.Examining the safety of the vaccines was a key part of the MHRA approval process. They are now publishing regular Covid- safety reports. These are based on the Yellow Card system which is a medicines safety monitoring mechanism. The most recent report covers the period from December  up to February . It shows that only very few side effects are emerging ndash between  and  reports per , doses of vaccine. Almost all of these reported side effects are mild and are not dissimilar to those from the seasonal flu vaccine. This monitoring will continue and the people who took part in the original trials are being carefully followed up to look at any long term effects.Another question was how well the vaccine programme would be rolled out in Scotland. Delivering a programme of this scale is a huge undertaking. There have been a few bumps in the road so far, with unfavourable comparisons between Scotland and England in the early weeks when the pace was slower here.Scotland focused initially on residents in care homes and there are early signs that the first dose may already be making a dference in these settings, alongside staff testing and public health measures. Covid- deaths in care homes have declined by over % in recent weeks.Current concerns have been about the supply of the Pfizer vaccine, with a decline in daily doses in mid to late February. Supply is expected to increase in future. Uptake has been excellent so far and better than the % expected by the Scottish Government in their delivery plan. In fact more than % of people over the age of  have now received their first dose. Whether this high uptake can be maintained in younger groups, and whether there are inequalities in access or uptake between dferent ethnic communities or in more deprived areas, is something we need to watch and address.One of the big remaining questions is whether vaccines will help prevent transmission. If vaccines only stop illness, then everyone needs vaccinated to be protected. Butthey also stop transmission, everyone vaccinated can protect other people as well, which will help us ease restrictions with more confidence.:Coronavirus: Scotlands exit from lockdown hinges on vaccines, iants, and suppliesThere are encouraging signs, including from a Cambridge study which found a signicant fall in infections  days after the first dose in research that tested health care staff. More evidence is needed but many studies are underway that will tell us more in future. The need for other public health measures alongside vaccines will continue for some time to come, but we can now see a cautious route out of this pandemic."},{"url":null,"title":"budget-rishi-dishing-recovery-sting-tail-donald-macleod","story":"Not when so many millions of peoplersquos lives and livelihoods are so perilously close to the edge of the abyss, and who rightly expect in times of national crisis, that their government, their chancellor, puts his neck on the line, head above the parapet and hands into the deep pockets of the treasury in order to bail them out.A job made all the harder when there are hardly any beans in the bank left to count and against all your Tory gut instinct you are forced to borrow hundreds of billion to keep the UK afloat during and beyond this crisis.An eye-watering pound billion, the highest peacetime borrowing figures since the end of the Second World War and, even more startling, according to estimates from the Office for Budget Responsibility, our national debt is hurtling towards a back-breaking pound. trillion by the end of .Yet in Rishi Sunak we might now actually have a real chancellor, instead of a spineless chancer, one who is not only up for the challenge, but since he was parachuted in as an unknown backbencher to the hot seat of Number  last February, a month before this deadly pandemic gripped the country, has shown real backbone and leadership, and with fleet of foot danced around his political opponents.

Nerdy stuff, not great copy.So I took a mike. ldquoWere Scottish nationalists paranoid to think the security services were involved in the independence referendum  I asked the giant head.A colleague, from a rival publication - relieved, he later said, at the chance to report something interesting -smiled in encouragement. But as I spoke, I imagined eyes rolling. DAVID LEASK:Independence: Support for independence has changed the face of unionismldquoNo, they are not paranoid, Mr Assange responded, deadpan. ldquoThe attitude of the UK Government is that this is a national security issue, that Scottish independence is, in effect, a threat to the state.\"This mean that the full capacities of the GCHQ, for example, could be deployed.I sat down. I had a tale to tell.But what is really intriguing, I thought ndash I still think ndash is why nobody ever tries to test whether this theory stands up to much scrutiny.Me  I donrsquot believe it does. Mr Assangersquos logic was not new, his is an old story. Some nationalists have been whispering for years ndash more often that not with an air of satisfied self-importance ndash that it somehow stands to reason that they are targeted by spooks because they want to break up Britain.This spy mania is far from mainstream, especially now that the SNP runs Scotland and its leader is a privy counsellor, able to access intelligence.But it is still thereyou look for it a sort of meta-excuse for political failure.These last few weeks, amid lockdown fever and bitter ndash crazy bitter ndash feuding, it has spewed online again.As the Alex Salmond saga reached its anti-climax in the Scottish Parliament, some Yessers tried to make sense of what journalists call a ldquopsycho-drama by inventing Bond thrillers.Julian AssangeType ldquoMI and lsquoSalmond in to the searchof your favourite social media , and you enter a whole alternative reality.There are supporters of Mr Salmond who donrsquot just believe the former first ministerrsquos as yet un-evidenced allegations of a conspiracy against him by Nicola Sturgeon. They also see a hidden hand behind it: spies.And there are fans of Ms Sturgeon who think Mr Salmondrsquos attacks must be part of some deep state plot to stall or stop independence by hurting his successor.But ask anybody with any real experience of government, of secret policing, and they will tell you the same thing: cock-ups are bigger than conspiracies.ldquoIt is not usually the secret services pulling strings, says Phillips OrsquoBrien, professor of Strategic Studies at St Andrews, ldquoit is human beings screwing up.For Mr OrsquoBrien, Scottish spy conspiracism echoes some of the dysal social media politics in his native United States.ldquoThere are great similarities with the Trump deep staters,rsquo he said. ldquoSome people like to blame nefarious evil forces. Right now that tends to be the deep state or the intelligence services.He has a point. The security services make the perfect target for conspiracy theories. Because their work really is secret and they never challenge nonsense people say about them.And that means nobody can definitively rule out they are up to no good.But maybe instead of askingthe secret services are meddling in our politics, we should be trying to figure out what anybody would have to gain ndash and lose ndashthey were There is little to gain.For starters, secret police are not necessarily going to be any good at politics: spin beats spies.Just going by their ill-informed chat about Scotland, London Tories probably need a Herald subscription, not an agent in Holyrood.And there is a lot to lose.An illegal use of state secret services would be hard to hide ndash a point, to be fair, which Mr Assange made.ldquoIt would be a very dangerous thing for the UK government to use its own intelligence services to interfere here,rsquo Mr OrsquoBrien said. ldquoDo I know for surethey are or not  No.Are politicians capable of dirty tricks  Well, of course they are. Do they need spooks for that  Of course not.That does not mean we should not be vigilant. The policing, intelligence and security services can cross lines, get things wrong and commit crimes just like the rest of us.Think of the undercover cops who had relationships with women in protest groups. Scummy, that was.We need more transparency, more scrutiny of spooks, not less. But here we collide with an unintended consequence of spy paranoia: an actual call to make secret services less accountable.Since , as a quirk of being the third party in Westminster, the SNP has had an MP, currently Stewart Hosie, on the committee which oversees intelligence and security.Last month the work came under fire, from the SNPrsquos own benches. Kenny MacAskill, a former justice secretary, said it was ldquonaive to think secret agents were not operating in Scotland and questioned why Mr Hosie was part of the parliamentary watchdog. This, he said, writing on an anti-SNP blog, looked like ldquolegitimisation by participation.Ask SNP loyalists about Mr MacAskill and they will sound more sad than angry. But he is badly wrong, irresponsibly so.:Not being from Glasgow or Edinburgh gives me broader perspective, saysDavid LeaskThere may be little evidence of spooks interfering in politics. But that does not mean politics should not interfere with spooks. The SNP should be scrutinising spooks, not fantasising about them.Spy mania is toxic and those of us who call it out can expect to be smeared as agents. I have been. So have other journalists. After all, in the logic of the conspiracist,you deny the deep state, you are the deep state.But, as Scotland gets closer to potential independence, we ought to start getting smarter about intelligence.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Around five jobs will be created in the first year, they said.Speaking to The Herald, Mr Nicholson and Ms Thompson, who have worked at five-star hotels, including Inverlochy Castle, said that despite the challenges of the pandemic, the chance to work on their own project at Mingary Castle was too good to turn down.Mr Nicholson said: ldquoWhen we were approached thatrsquos when the vaccine announcement came out, so that kind of helped with the decision a little bit.ldquoWe donrsquot know how well the vaccine is going to do, but with a year of lockdown something has to change soon.Ms Thompson added: ldquoItrsquos obviously coming at a very challenging time, but we both felt ready, and wersquove always wanted to have our own place.ldquoWhether it be a small hotel or a restaurant, wersquove always wanted a place of ours.\"I think it was an opportunity that was really hard to let slip through our fingers, so we decided just to go for itldquoWe had all been through a rough year, and maybe we were all a little bit too optimistic in thinking this year would go back to normal, which it is clearly not going to, but we are still very hopeful for opening in May.Despite the couple pressing on with their venture, they insisted that Covid had been part of their thinking, with the pair admitting they had a few back-up planssocial distancing and other restrictions remained in place.Mr Nicholson, who has won three AA Rosette awards, also explained that the hotel only having four rooms was also beneficial as they did not need to rely on filling up the hotel to stay afloat, and that they had other plans to bolster self-catering offerings in light of the increase of so-called staycations.He said: ldquoWe have a back up planthings fall through, therersquos a self catering part of the castle that can bring in moneythe hotel part canrsquot work, and we have came up with a few dferent scenarios.Covid has also not been the only challenge, with the couple launching their first business in order to lease Milngary. The pair using technology to work around Covid restrictions in completing seminars from Business Gateway and obtaining support through Highland and Island Enterprise.Ms Thompson said: ldquoBecause of Covid a lot of people we have been working with have been on furlough or flexi-furlough so a lot of the development of our programmes have been slower than we anticipated, things like our licensing applications, everything is taking a bit longer than we expected because of Covid.The couple, who have travelled the world together, are also keen to use the project to boost the local area and tourism on the west coast.They hope their venture can create jobs and support local businesses, and also plan to use their own experience in the hospitality industry to benefit their employees.Mr Nicholson praised the owners of Ardnamurchan estate in playing an instrumental role in the plans, saying: ldquoJess met the owners of the castle in her previous role at Inverlochy Castle and they saw the potential of her hosting their castle.ldquoThis is such a beautul part of Scotland, and we want people to come and enjoy it.ldquoWe want to boost tourism in the community and create a top food destination for this part of Scotland."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12382986.jpg?type=article-full","title":"iona-fyfe-scots-language-not-nationalist-agenda","story":"The  census revealed that . million people identied as speaking Scots, yet much of Scotlandrsquos population is unaware that they possess skills in reading, writing and speaking Scots.Scots is part of the West Germanic language family and is a sister language to English with close affinities with Scandinavian languages such as Danish and Norwegian. Scots has four main dialects: Insular, Northern, Central and Southern, but for me, it was just the way folk spoke in their everyday lives.:Scots word of the week: Mither-leidGrowing up in rural Aberdeenshire, I didnrsquot realise that the way people speak ndash in Doric, a vernacular or byleid of Scots ndash was a special and unique trait of the regions people, lore and history. At the time, I was unaware of the similitude of Scots to other European languages, I was unaware of the languagersquos history and the signicance of the literature written in the language, and I was unaware of its desperate need for recognition and promotion.At , I left Huntly to pursue a degree in traditional music at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland in Glasgow, with my principal study being Scots Song. Since graduating in , Irsquove toured in several countries, released albums of Scots Songs which have been played on national and international radio, won the title of Scots Singer of the Year at the MG ALBA Scots Trad Music Awards and won the title of Young Scots Speaker of the Year at the inaugural Scots Language Awards. My career and artistic practice is centred upon my ability to sing, speak and perform in Scots, yet Scots is not a legally recognised official language in Scotland, despite being recognised under the European Charter for Minority Languages.Without legal status as an official language, Scots is not protected under linguistic equality and ersity policies, and companies, organisations and institutions are not held responsible for recognising the language. I became increasingly aware of this in December , when I tried to pitch my new single, a Scots translation of lsquoIn The Bleak Midwinterrsquo to Spoty playlists. The form asked, ldquoWhat languages are the lyrics in  and despite listing every other minority language of the UK such as Manx, Cornish, Gaelic, Irish Gaelic and Welsh, Spoty had omitted Scots from its language list. It dawned on me that mine and several other Scots language musicians, back catalogues of Scots Songs had been incorrectly listed under English. Three months of social media campaigning, an open letter, a motion in the Scottish Parliament lodged by Clare Adamson MSP, and countless emails later, Spoty finally adds Scots as a language.On th March, I released my new single, The Wild Geese ndash the first song to be released on the  correctly listed under Scots Language. Spotyrsquos move to recognise Scots will no doubt raise the profile of the language. It is incredibly important that a global organisation like Spoty has taken steps to recognise a minority language that % of the Scottish population speak, but I feel deflated that it took so much perseverance to pressure the organisation into recognising Scots, when every other UK minority language was already accounted for.This issue can only be solved with the introduction of a Scots Language Act, which would give Scots official status as a language. Over the pandemic, my tours and performances have been cancelled, and my time has been spent working voluntarily with Oor Vyce ndash an association of iniduals with a personal or professional interest in Scots, campaigning for statutory recognition of the Scots language by the Scottish Parliament. Oor Vyce hopes to achieve a Scots Language Act and the development of a Scots Language Board, which will help to advise the government on Scots issues and ensure that Scots is included in future language policies. The board will also advise on how Scots can be included in the mainstream educational curriculum and will develop a national plan for Scots.:Drew Allan: More Scots words  Gaun yirselWith the establishment of a Scots Language Board, comes more opportunities for those who work within the Scots language sphere, as well as enhanced educational opportunities and funding for organisations and iniduals alike to make Scots more immediately visible in society through artistic, creative, academic, educational and community-based projects. Of course, Scots faces many critics. Online trolls are quick to brand the language ldquoSNP nationalist agenda. When in reality the speaking of Scots is not a political statement and should not be politicised nor bound-up in party politics. Language is not a political stick to beat opponents with ndash it is simply our own ldquomither tongue.A Scots Language Act is about creating meaningful change to ensure that speakers can no longer be stigmatised, and they can feel comfortable in the way they naturally speak and that they can access media and content in their own language. If we have more TV presenters and broadcasters speaking in Scots, and normalising the use of Scots, then perhaps the next generation will feel empowered to use their mother tongue in their professional careers. We can inspire the next generation of authors, writers, presenters, broadcasters, journalists, academics, teachers, singers ndash all working in the medium of our national language. It is also about enabling non-native speakers to access opportunities to learn the language, with correct and developed pedagogy.As I look forward and plan to record my second album of Scots Songs, I can only hope that when the world allows me to tour again, I will be performing my songs in a language that is legally recognised, funded and supported by our Government.

But these are far from normal times with large sections of the economy still mothballed, we face the greatest economic challenge in centuries.Even with interest rates at historic lows, headline government debt is heading above pound. trillion: a sum that,paid off at pound, a second, would take more than  years to clear. Since that doesnrsquot include state or most public sector pensions, PFI commitments, carbon reduction costs, promised infrastructure investment and other expenditure that has been promised, the real picture is much worse.If we are not to burden our grandchildren with such costs, a move towards fiscal restraint ndash whether it comes as tax rises, freezing allowances and public sector pay, or spending cuts ndash is inevitable. But to impose them now, when almost every sector of the economy has been brought to its knees, would be disastrous.In the short term, withdrawing government support before businesses have a chance to get back on their feet would not only halt wider recovery in its tracks, close thousands of firms and potentially cost millions of jobs, it would make the expenditure and sacrices of the past year pointless.So the measures across the UK, such as extension of the furlough scheme, the uplt in Universal Credit, and grants to the self-employed are all welcome. For firms, the next two yearsrsquo tax breaks and ldquosuperdeductions ndash which allow them to write off  per cent of capital investments ndash are a real incentive to move aggressively to build and produce growth.There are other areas that merit attention: business rates, even before the pandemic, were wildly out of step with commercial rents, business turnover, decline of the high street and increasing dominance of internet ndash and distribution-based companies. Relief in that sector is a greater priority, and better value, than initiatives such as the stamp duty cut. The best service for those wanting to get on the housing ladder, for the construction sector and the general health of the economy would be to encourage much more building.There are some reasons for optimism despite the hardships endured by many, othershave actually stored up money during lockdown, and there is reason to believe that there will be a strong bounce back in sectors such as retail, hospitality and travel.Partly because we have fallen so badly, the current growth estimates are for four per cent this year, and perhaps as much as twice that in . To put that in context, there has only been one year since the financial crisis when figures reached the levels normal before .In Scotland, business should be provided with clear assurances that Holyrood also recognises the vital importance of enabling that sort of growth without it, there is no recovery, no safeguarding of jobs, no ability to fund public services and repay public debt.

This onslaught against the FM, before the hearing, deterred the other parties and measurably strengthened Ms Sturgeonrsquos position.Those other parties seemed reasonably content while the cry was ldquodeputy heads must roll. They were ready to declare no confidence in John Swinney to prise further legal documents from the Scottish Government. But they were less willing to demand Ms Sturgeonrsquos defenestration before her defence. BRIAN TAYLOR:This is not a civil war in the SNP. This is more vicious and more visceralAnd after  Let us be clear. Nicola Sturgeonrsquos performance throughout her marathon committee hearing was deftly executed thorough, respectful, controlled and capable.She displayed emotion, but not too much. She essayed ironic smiles even a little light banter. Above all, she provided answers: not sufficient answers for her critics but, to use the phrase of the moment, ldquoa stateable case.Plus no slips. No suggestion that she was in any way querying the verdict in Alex Salmondrsquos criminal trial. Mr Salmond was acquitted beyond question.She even appeared to suggest at one point that she could understand, in part, his desire to seek redress for what he feels were egregious wrongs. Just as Mr Salmond made clear that he was not demanding Ms Sturgeonrsquos resignation.However, rapprochement only goes so far. Mr Salmond attacked by proxy, criticising virtually every key member of Ms Sturgeonrsquos coterie in party and government, with the possible exception of her official driver. Meanwhile, Ms Sturgeon averred solemnly that Mr Salmondrsquos behaviour had been inappropriate and challenged him to apologise.So is that it  Is she, with one bound, free  Not so, not so.Let us consider the issues arising. Firstly, the challenge of a cover-up. Among MSPs, there is indignation, some genuine, some contrived, at the sluggish government response to the demand for Judicial Review documents, particularly external legal advice.It is possible to acknowledge that, while also noting that every government, of every political complexion, has protected legal advice for the very good reason that lawyers would not feel able to give full and frank counselthey knew or suspected that each polished phrase would be published.In , as First Minister, Alex Salmond declined to publish legal advice about an independent Scotlandrsquos potential position within the European Union. He told the BBCrsquos Andrew Neil that he could not disclose such material.It subsequently emerged that such guidance was limited to general comments ldquoin terms of the debate, as he put it. Mr Salmond was vigorously defended at the time by Nicola Sturgeon who said ldquoany fair-minded person would understand his comments, in context.So every government protects legal advice. But, having made the concession in principle, in the face of a Parliamentary confidence motion, should Scottish Ministers not have got on with publication in practice Instead, they have delivered an iterative succession of pages, day by day, like a reluctant gambler dealing a poker hand in slow motion.In reality, these complaints will be subsumed by the eventual outcome of all this. So how about talk of a conspiracy  Not sure that flies, either, at least in respect of the FM.In their dossier, the Tories say they do not rely upon such theories. Certainly, Ms Sturgeon dismisses such talk, including within the upper echelons of the SNP. Party officers, she insists, were co-operating with the police, not pursuing a fishing expedition against Mr Salmond.Either way, this does not appear to land upon Ms Sturgeonrsquos shoulders. So how about the ldquosecret meeting with Alex Salmondrsquos former chief of staff, Geoff Aberdein, three days before the talks with Mr Salmond himself to discuss the allegations against him Certainly, Ms Sturgeonrsquos amnesia about this earlier chat appears mystying. I expect she now wishes she had disclosed it more quickly, or corrected the Parliamentary record.But ask yourself this. Cui bono  In whose interests  What did she stand to gain from claimed secrecy  In practice, nothing. Likewise, she says she did not minute the talks with Mr Salmond for fear of encouraging civil servants to act too eagerly on his behalf, which she was not ready to do.:Prince Philip: Is the health scare much ado about nothing  Letrsquos hope soOnce again, these answers will in no way placate critics ndash but they are, at least, arguable. They may point towards a Not Proven verdict on these points.The leak, then, of a complainerrsquos name  Ms Sturgeon is adamant this did not come from her, or her team, suggesting that Mr Salmond already knew one name and searched another on social media.Finally, the procedure for handling harassment complaints and the conduct of the Judicial Review case, brought by Mr Salmond. Here, official endeavours have been calamitous from beginning to end.The complaints against Mr Salmond were lamentably mishandled, with an Investigating Officer who had indefensible prior contact with the complainers. Internal documents were supplied sporadically and late to the governmentrsquos own external legal team.Then the key accusation from critics that the government persisted with the case when it was palpably failing, costing the public purse.Nicola Sturgeon is the head of that government, responsible for all its actions. But is she culpable  The procedure was enacted by civil servants and, ultimately, she pursued the case on the advice of her law officers, while taking account of grave concerns voiced by external counsel.:Salmond inquiry: Most Scots still trust Nicola Sturgeon, by Rebecca McQuillanOn these latter points, the committee may be unable to reach any consensus. The signicant verdict may come from James Hamilton QC who will rule on whether she broke the Ministerial code.These we await. For now, after a successful hearing, Nicola Sturgeon remains decidedly First Minister, free to focus on other matters ndash and to envisage,she cares, six impossible things before breakfast.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

However, like many who were willing to judge the proceedings impartially, I felt Nicola Sturgeon acquitted herself remarkably well on Wednesday, especially given the emotional dimension involved. Perhaps I should not have been so surprised given that she and her predecessor fall within the  most accomplished UK politicians of this century. For a nation comprising eight per cent of the UK population, that too is remarkable.Nonetheless, whatever the calibre of its leader, an effective government relies heavily on capable subordinates. This episode has exposed serious shortcomings from Deputy First Minister down, not just in respect of the handling of the litigation and its aftermath but also in respect of the original investigation itself. While Ms Sturgeon justiably retains strong personal ratings, it will be a good thingthe Scottish public begin to look beyond the capabilities of its leader and start to examine the true calibre of her cohort.Colin Forbes, Glasgow.* MANY seem to think the Nicola Sturgeon Alex Salmond debate is binary ndash that one of them must be wrong.

It was almost two years from the ratication of the Edinburgh Agreement in  to the actual referendum in , so to suggest that a referendum could take place in nine months is merely politicking on his part.I have lived one-third of my le now with the threat of my country seceding from a long-standing political union that has stood for  generations.Mr Blackford is very fortunate to have the middle years of his career during the biggest economic expansion in human history and a period of relative peace . But yet he would cause more chaos for my generational cohort by promoting another independence referendum, during a global pandemic and another economic contraction, despite this being of little concern currently.Perhaps he could do the job he was voted in to do: build a stable Scotland, within the UK, where those with the means can find the opportunity to better themselves, much like he did.David Bone, Girvan.MORE DOUBLE STANDARDSYOU reportthat Home Office chief Sir Philip Rutman has accepted a substantial sumafter launching legal action against the Home Secretary Priti Patel.

It is contained in the National Gaelic Language Plan which is agreed by Scottish Ministers. We welcome Alex Neilrsquos support for one of the key messages in the current plan. It states that retaining an economically active population in island and rural communities where Gaelic is still spoken by the majority of people is critical, and Bograverd na Gagraveidhlig consistently promotes this in its work.Bograverd na Gagraveidhlig takes listening to the ious Gaelic communities extremely seriously. In the last six months alone, we have held a iety of consultations and attended a wide range of meetings with community representatives.Our online consultations included seeking views from Gaelic speakers and those interested in Gaelic on their priorities and concerns for the language. This will inform the development of the next National Gaelic Language Plan. Another was about funding and sought recommendations for potential improvements. A third was an online survey for young people, aged -, followed by a series of focus groups. The last was delivered in collaboration with three national youth organisations, demonstrating our partnership approach. In our most recent stakeholder survey, % of respondents agreed with the view that Bograverd na Gagraveidhlig fulfils its duties effectively and provides support.Shona NicIllinnein, Ceannard, Bograverd na Gagraveidhlig, Inverness.HELP THE POOR GET THE VACCINEPEOPLE in this country are getting their Covid- Vaccine, and our Government has ordered more than enough vaccines to vaccinate us all, yet many countries cannot get enough vaccines because of price and lack of supplies.March  is Peoples Vaccine Day of Action and is also the anniversary of the day the World Health Organisation declared Covid- a worldwide pandemic.We can put pressure on our Government to support the proposed waiver by signing the petition at globaljustice.org or by asking your MP to support the Early Day Motionin the Westminster Parliament.Shelagh King, Galashiels.STUMPED BY CRICKET SCENESWHILST watching the current India v England Test match on Channel  I noted the almost complete absence of face masks being worn by spectators.

but it also led to an assumption that they would be largely immune to a second wave.Manaus was an interesting test case for those who advocated a herd immunity approach.From Resurgence of COVID- in Manaus, Brazil, despite high seroprevalence, Lancet, February Hospitalisations for Covid had remained stable and fairly low for seven months from May to November, following the peak of the epidemic in April when authorities were forced to carve out mass graves to bury the dead.It came as a shock therefore -

though both have since recovered.Genomic testing would later reveal that their infections were caused by the P. iant, which had not previously been detected in the UK.This suggested they must have been incubating the virus at the time they boarded the plane from Brazil.The good news is that, to date, there is no evidence that the P. iant has escaped into the community.Three oil workers tested positive on February , while self-isolating in AberdeenMore worrying, however, is that one in three of the passengers who shared their London to Aberdeen flight were yet to be traced as of Wednesday .Meanwhile, in England -

although the researchers caution that its findings \"should not be generalised to other epidemiological contexts\" where the strain has been found.So far, it has been detected in  countries including Japan, Italy, South Korea, the United States, India, Germany, France and the Netherlands.The ICL study found that the proportion of Covid infections caused by the P. iant went from zero to  per cent in the space of eight weeks.They estimate that it is . to . times more transmissible than the original Wuhan strain thanks to a \"unique constellation of mutations\".For comparison, the UK Kent iant is thought to be around % -

The £ uplt in Universal Credit will continue for another six months, and corporation tax is to rise on profits above £, to  per cent in .Mr Carmichael said: “Today was a #stand still# Budget. There was a lot of hot air and warm words but the Chancellor has clearly put off the hard decisions for later in the year. He is postponing judgement on his intentions but he can only postpone so long.“If and when tax rises come to repair the damage to Government finances, they need to be targeted to those at the top — to big businesses rather than small ones — so that those who are most able will pay their fair share.“I am glad that the Chancellor has, at least, bent to pressure to extend furlough and the Universal Credit uplt, and that the VAT cut for hospitality and tourism will continue for the time being. This is really the least that the Government can be doing to support hard hit businesses which are still waiting for their chance to really recover. What the Chancellor needs to consider – and I shall be raising this point with ministers — is the potential for a long-term cut to tourism VAT. This could be a chance to give solid footing for the sector in building back in the years to come.He added: “News that the support scheme for self-employed people will be expanded to cover some who were previously left out is of course welcome, though we should keep in mind that this leaves millions still falling through the cracks. The Government has had the better part of a year to find ways to support people — there is little excuse left for their inaction.“The Chancellor today has presented a lot of half measures today.

Ms Todd has called on him to consider the increasing vulnerability of Scotland#s Highlands and Islands in his decision-making process.“The data included in the HIE report shows the extent of the inequalities facing communities in the Highlands and Islands and the disproportionate impact on the region,# said Ms Todd, who represents the SNP at Holyrood.“It is crucial that the UK Chancellor uses the upcoming budget to address these growing inequalities and commits to protecting jobs, extending the furlough scheme and plugging the gaps in coronavirus support.“The Chancellor must extend the furlough scheme beyond April and guarantee that it will be in place for as long as it’s necessary.

That appeal has been held up due to COVID- restrictions and remains within the appeals system.With reserves now running low at Cursiter, OIC is now urgently attempting to maintain supply hence the ,-tonne order, and now, this new order.Meanwhile, an internal OIC investigation is currently taking place to understand the methods in which the Glensanda stone was procured, with its findings set to be heard at the next meeting of the council#s monitoring and audit committee.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Centralisation remains the most expensive and most economically damaging option and yet HIAL are determined to continue with it.“The proposal of yet another independent study on generating further economic activity falls far short of what is required here. HIAL should immediately pause this project and commission a genuinely independent report considering the feasibility of an alternative localised model,they refuse to do so then the Scottish Government must step in.“This is a major test of the credibility of the Islands Act which was intended to stop projects like this and ensure organisations considered less damaging alternatives. If organisations are allowed to simply ignore these Assessments then the whole Act will be rendered little more than a PR exercise.”On the issue of staffing he added: “The report also confirms Prospect own survey which found that staff in island communities will not relocate to Inverness. HIAL need to explain how they intend to live up to their promise of no compulsory redundancies as all evidence suggests that widespread redundancies now seem inevitable.#While HIAL has claimed that the report proves that an alternative local surveillance solution is #not viable#, Prospect fundamentally disagrees with this assessment.Mr Avery said: “HIAL’s claim that local implementation is not viable or that this report endorses their position is simply not true. This report states HIAL’s position, it very clearly does not endorse it. Any attempt to claim the contrary is just more desperate spin.“Local implementation of air traffic services including surveillance is how air traffic is implemented at almost every airport across the UK including at HIAL’s own Inverness airport. It is a viable workable and resilient alternative but HIAL refuse to consider it.#Meanwhile, HIAL has promised to engage with local authorities across the Highlands and Islands region as it seeks to deliver #viable solutions# to secure the future of leline air services.The company#s managing director Inglis Lyon, said: “We have always known there would be impacts by undertaking such a signicant and complex change management programme.“To date, there have been no alternative proposals that provide a solution that fully addresses all of the challenges HIAL currently faces.”“We hope that everyone with a vested interest in the long-term future of air traffic services in the Highlands and Islands will work us to deliver viable solutions that will maintain leline services and essential connectivity for generations to come.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Selling from around £ a bottle, the new dram will be available to purchase throughout the UKthis Friday – with some retailers limiting bottles to one per household and others operating on a purely first come, first served basis.The production team at the distillery have been fully operational since January  and blend traditional and contemporary approaches to distilling.Neil Mathieson, chief executive at Mossburn Distillers, the company behind Torabhaig said: “This ‘Legacy’ series will lay down the foundations for the future profile of our bottled whisky and with each edition we will guide your journey with details on the barley, yeast and casks on the back label of the bottle.“For the first, the , we selected only  barrels from our first quarter’s distillation, the spirit having been aged solely in Bourbon barrels that we shipped directly ourselves from the Kentucky distillery, the day they were emptied.”Mr Mathieson added: “What’s three or four years to a whisky maker when traditionally we are ageing spirit for up to  years or longer to see the effect of ageing and barrel choices  Here at Torabhaig, we had to start at the very beginning with looking at the peating levels of our malted barley, the barley ieties themselves and the effect of the harvest.“We followed this by experimenting with yeasts and examining how our mashing and distilling processes could produce dferent flavours as we adjusted the model. We then had to anticipate the ageing cycle in dferent cask sizes and types and regularly taste the spirits as they developed, in order to choose which batches would represent us at the relatively youthful ages of our first bottlings.“This process has produced the first of four bottlings which will straddle Torabhaig’s formative years until they have Torabhaig Single Malt Whisky that has aged ten years in barrel that is to be released in .”The very first Torabhaig bottles were auctioned recently, raising £, for two Skye charities.The proceeds go to Sabhal Mòr Ostaig Development Trust and the Friends of Dr Mackinnon Memorial Hospital.Locals will be able to buy a bottle of Torabhaig through the Misty Bottle, Aros, An Crùbh and Armadale Stores – when they open their new shop later this month."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/BALMACARA-HOTEL-1-1.jpg","title":"exciting times ahead for new balmacara","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineADVERTISING FEATUREHotel manager Juan Santos has overseen the refurbishment and the building of an extension in the last year, with the overall aim of improving the hotel’s star rating to four stars.

absolutely right and proper that the Scottish Government’s energy consents unit have extended the consultation period for the Stornoway Wind Farm planning proposal, to afford the Stornoway Community Council more time to make any representations with regard to any objections they might have.All the statutory consultees have been aware of the development and its environmental impact assessment since being notied as far back as the th of May  .The residents of Stornoway were also ‘leafleted’, grazing committees and councillors informed, and everyone was invited to view the public consultation events held in the town hall.Not a single objection was forthcoming.The conclusion that there was “no public interest in holding a public local inquiry” was, correctly, based on this.A hastily cobbled together Facebook poll, quickly seized upon, concluded otherwise.Stornoway’s own community council was only formed after the initial notications were distributed, thereby missing out, initially, on the opportunity to participate.They should be heard.They are highlighting several impacts on the town area.All of these were covered in the report that appeared before the planning application board, indeed all of the negative impacts of such a large-scale development were highlighted in the submissions , but, with the proviso that the comhairle work with the developer, statutory consultees and the Scottish Government’s energy consents unit to best mitigate these ‘impacts’.As vice chairman of sustainable development, and also a member of the planning applications board and the Action for Arnish group, I could not ignore these benefits.A lot does hinge on this particular application.The consultation deadline is March th.When it comes to visual impacts, down here in the ‘Republic’ of Point we have been subjected to the sight of no fewer than  turbines as we drive towards ‘Gotham’, for the best part of five years.Only three are of any meaningful benefit to our economy and they belong to us.Does this, to a degree, make them easier on the eye EDFhas long been subjected to a well-orchestrated campaign of opposition.The reasons are myriad, historical and complex.That the comhairle, the Stornoway Trust and most other local landowners failed to capitalise on the potential bounty on our own doorstep in the early s is hardly their fault.Blame previous administrations,you must.Yet for having the temerity to be foreign, have a confirmed lease, have a business plan, a grid connection offer and the finance to capitalise on the potential that we so obviously missed out on EDF have been hugely vilied at almost every turn.Of course it would be betterthe island was reaping all of these financial rewards for the complete benefit to the local community economy , but several factors must be taken into consideration.Should the comhairle be looking to build turbines now The dficulty arises with the ability to fund a project on which the comhairle has absolutely no sighting on the energy price which can be realised at the forthcoming Contract for Dference auction.The council needs to be looking to maximise the potential which can be gleaned from the renewables ‘regime’, while minimising its exposure to risk, unplanned spending, or speculation.The time for building turbines, or investigating the possibility of building turbines, was to  years ago and the opportunity was missed.Circumstances change and I’m sure that those trusted with the policy decisions of the comhairle, armed with all the facts they had at their disposal then, made what they considered the correct choice.The council’s current energy strategy is to attempt to generate income for the people of these islands who do not directly benefit from the current crop of excellent schemes, as listed above.The joint venture between the comhairle and the trust seeks to maximise, with no risk to either body, the potential income from their stake in Stornoway and Uisenis wind farms.That being said, the ‘playing field’ has changed signicantly and the days of ‘wine and roses’, currently enjoyed by those fortunate enough to have had the foresight to build historically, will not, in any way shape or form, be comparable to any future, post CfD, landscape.It would be dficult to go to the bank, ask for a loan to buy an ice cream van, without any idea what the market price for ice cream was.So why is the success of Stornoway Wind Farm so crucial The issue of windfarm development in Lewis is a challenging and complex one that requires negative impacts to be weighed up against signicant benefits. It is always a balanced decision that requires a host of issues to be taken into consideration.Here are a few things to consider for those asked to respond to Stornoway Community Council’s consultation.The island grid, supplied by a shaky distribution link from Fort Augustus through Skye, is full to capacity and closed to new connections – it has been for years.SSEN have decided to replace the failed Skye to Harris cable with a like-for-like kV cable.The new kV cable will offer  per cent more export capacity, enough to provide firm connections for our existing community generators .SSEN will not build a second kV cable without solid demand for it, in terms of prospective wind farms with approved planning permission and solid grid connection contracts.This effectively means that the only way to achieve additional capacity for the islands is to back the planned MW transmission link with its MW of ‘headroom’ for future projects.Only the commercial wind farms, Stornoway Wind Farm, Uisenis Wind Farm and Druim Leathann Wind Farm , have the financial wherewithal to underwrite the planned transmission link .Ofgem will authorise the transmission link onlyStornoway Wind Farm goes ahead.• Any attempt to derail Stornoway Wind Farm is an attempt to derail the £ million deep water terminal, since it is premised on a renewables and a hydrogen economy.With no transmission link, no commercial wind farms, no community wind farms, no low cost electricity, continued dependence on imported fossil fuels, an undermined deep water terminal, an undermined Arnish fabrication yard and a hydrogen economy set back by ten years what is the alternative I love my wild and unspoilt vistas, my beaches and my hills as much as the next islander.I’d love the notion of population growth and sustainability, based on gin, tweed, tourism, crofting and salmon farming to be a reality but it isn’t.There needs to be, and I’ve said this before, a ‘mix’ of the strands that make up the fabric of our island#s economy.And we need to add another strand to move in anyway the right direction to reverse the current trend.There are several sides to every argument.We count the peatland, the visual impact and the hen harriers on the one hand and all the rest, outlined above, on the other.We take everything on board and hope that we are making the right choices for the benefit of more than just Stornoway.If there are any better alternatives, they’ve managed to remain hidden from view for far too long."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ARMADALE-STORES-OPEN-1-scaled.jpg","title":"new shop opens its doors in south","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWhen the old shop, post office and petrol station closed in , the Sleat Community Trading board, management and staff expected to be operating out of their temporary container in Ardvasar for six months.Covid caused understandable delays, but eighteen months later the staff have now left their cold and draughty temporary shop behind.Shop and post office manager Mhairi Cousins said: “I can’t praise the staff, board and volunteers highly enough.

We’re not complaining about that — the ferry pays its dues — but we have to find a way of reconciling the effect that has on Ullapool#s tourist trade because the place where visitors congregate to admire the loch and the view is Shore Street.In addition, the -year-old sea wall will be replaced with a higher structure to protect the village from rising sea levels.As part of the pre-application consultation, an online Zoom meeting will be held tonight at pm when the proposals will be presented for the first time and as many people as possible are being urged to take part.To join the meeting people can visit the website: http:www.ullapool-harbour or phone    and enter meeting ID:  to listen in.Anyone who wishes to make representations can do so by contacting Fiona Henderson, Affric Limited, Lochview Office, Loch Duntelchaig, Farr, IV AW, or by email: consultation@affriclimited, by th March ."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ARCHIVE-CENT-ANGUS-OG-6.jpg","title":"chust lovely angus og finds a new home in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe collection of the comic strips were handed over to the Skye and Lochalsh Archive Centre in Portree, in recognition of Angus Òg creator Ewen Bain and his family links to Skye.Ewen was brought up in Maryhill, Glasgow but his father John hailed from Waternish and his mother Flora from Staffin.

Wilfred J.A. Armstrong, BA, took place last Tuesday .Rev. Armstrong sadly passed away on Sunday, February .Second Broughshane Presbyterian Church Minister, Rev. Alastair Beattie conduced the funeral service, with all current restrictions adhered to. In a tribute Rev. Beattie outlined that Rev. Armstrong was born in Londonderry on February , . He was the son of William and Margaret Armstrong. William had a grocery business in the city and Wilfred grew up helping with the family business. The family were members of Great James Street congregation in Londonderry and Wilfred was educated at Foyle College. After school Wilfred studied at Magee University which was then affiliated to the Presbyterian Church. He graduated from Trinity College Dublin, moving to New College Edinburgh, and finalising his ministerial studies at Assembly’s College Belfast. Licensed by the Derry Presbytery in , assisted Rev Borland at Hamilton Road congregation in Bangor while still a student, then served an assistantship in Richmond Craigmillar Church of Scotland. In June  Rev Armstrong was ordained to the ministry and installed minister of Aughnacloy and Ballymagrane congregations in Co Tyrone. He arrived a bachelor boy, but met a girl from Lisnaskea in the county of Fermanagh, called Valerie Graham, and was married in March . After  years in Tyrone Wilfred received a call to be Minister of Second Broughshane Congregation in Ballymena Presbytery. He accepted that call and was installed on September , . He was a valued member of Presbytery, Synod and General Assembly fulfilling all duties required of him. Mr Armstrong was a devoted and faithful Minister. Preaching faithfully from God’s word he was an encouragement to many, and the means used by God to draw others to faith in Jesus Christ. In an era when Missions and Youth Coffee Bar were popular, Mr Armstrong was encouraged to see the congregation grow numerically but especially spiritually. He had a pastoral heart, caring dutully for all the people.He was especially particular about names, and recorded names in his memory, to recall in the future. His pastoral care endeared him to the sick and sorrowing of the congregation and his helpfulness to all was appreciated. During Mr Armstrong’s Ministry, the congregation carried out an extension to the church hall and extended the centre aisle entrance porch to incorporate a Choir Room on the ground floor and a Session Room above. A lover of historical facts and figures Mr Armstrong kept careful written and pictorial records of these projects and of other signicant in the le of the congregation. “I am told by Valerie that he had kept a diary since the age of , quite a compilation of daily facts,” said Rev. Beattie. In his Ministry Wilfred was ably assisted and encouraged by his loving we Valerie, who was known to borrow items from local shops for her husband’s children’s talks. “There was no use of PowerPoint then nor access to the internet and Google. They traveled together to dferent world destinations, including manse and pulpit exchanges on a number of occasions,” continued Rev. Beattie.In , after  years of Ministry in Broughshane, Rev Armstrong retired from active ministry and he and Valerie moved to live in Ballymena at Brigadie and settled into the Ballymena congregation of Wellington. “Retired, but not finished, as together Wilfred and Valerie filled engagements at ious meetings sharing their ‘Le Story’. This included coming to our own Sunshine Hour. Mr Armstrong also assisted the Ministry at Ballee for a time as well as many preaching engagements while able,” outlined Rev. Beattie. “The past few years have been marked by health issues that caused Wilfred to be in hospital on several occasions. Responding to treatment he wouldhome to the tender care of Valerie. With declining health Wilfred was finally called to his heavenly home early on Sunday morning .”Rev. Beattie continued -“As one who was faithful in ministry and in le, he has now entered the ‘joy of the Lord’. With the words of Paul to Timothy he could say, “I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge, will award to me on that Day.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3676503.jpg--.jpg?1614945757000\n","title":"major new factory extension for ballymena based firm","story":"Mid and East Antrim firm Apeer Doors have much to celebrate after successfully completing their new ,ft factory extension.Despite the huge challenges of Covid-, the Ballymena-based door company also managed to increase its workforce through the creation of  additional jobs in .Apeer Doors seen an increase in the demand for their composite doors with people using the time indoors during lockdown to upgrade their homes, and with the projection of more homes being built across the UK, the demand for their product is expected to remain high.Production Director of Apeer Doors, Chris Wilson said: “We started the year strongly, but like many others we were forced to close for a period due to lockdown. “We worked hard during this period to ensure the factory was as safe as possible for our workforce when we re-opened in May, and since then we have seen increased demand for our Apeer Composite Doors.“This enabled us to hire additional personnel and we are determined to continue to grow the business through  and beyond.”The Chair of Mid and East Antrim’s Manufacturing Task Force , Graham Whitehurst MBE said: “Apeer Doors are now one of the largest employers in the Ballymena area and a key member of the MTF.“I was delighted to hear about their success in  and that they have been able to provide employment for  people. “I very much look forward to continuing to support the growth of one of our key local manufacturing companies. “The MTF and Council’s Economic Development Team will continue to work closely with Chris and the team at Apeer to provide any support we can to aid business growth and development.”Through continued investment in digital marketing to help build upon the Apeer door and Lumi window brands, the company hopes to continue to grow throughout .Mid and East Antrim Borough Council’s Manufacturing Task Force was set up in  to mitigate the impact of the closures of leading local employers and provide a robust  for inward investment, increased employment opportunities and economic development.

They must realise that by repudiating the Belfast Agreement of , they are also kicking out that which they and their communities depend on.Ulster Unionist grandee Lord Empey also criticised the LCC#s move.He told this newspaper: I regret that the support for the agreement has been withdrawn at this stage because I believe that is the key to constitution guarantee and indeed that is why those parties supported it back in , and it was endorsed by a referendum at that stage.I understand the frustrations that people feel. We all share them at the moment but I think in a very fast moving situation that we are in, with the implications for the Protocol etc ... it does require a strategic approach from all of unionism, in my opinion.Earlier, a former No  chief of staff warned the protocol undermines the guiding principles of the  accord.Jonathan Powell, who worked for Tony Blair and was involved in negotiations that forged the agreement, said he understood loyalist anger at the protocol, which has led to an economic border in the Irish Sea.Mr Powell criticised the Government#s move to unilaterally delay the full implementation of the protocol, accusing it of unnecessarily poking the EU in the eye when it needed to work with the bloc to find solutions to the trade problems.He said the Government#s actions in extending Protocol grace periods without EU approval were counterproductive at a time when it was important to build relationships, rather than damage them - particularly in regard to Ireland.On Friday the EU said the UK#s move could make it more tricky to find permanent solutions to trade disruption.The European Commission did not rule out ultimately agreeing to the extension of protocol exemptions announced by the UK, but it said those decisions should only be taken on a joint basis.The Commission also confirmed that preparatory work on its legal action against the UK was continuing.Commission spokesman Eric Mamer saidthe EU was to demonstrate flexibility on protocol issues, the UK had to demonstrate it was prepared to implement commitments it had already agreed to.In an interview with Friday#s Financial Times, European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic - who is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the agreement - said the European Commission is now working on infringement proceedings against the UK.But First Minister Arlene Foster accused the EU of belligerence.Belfast Most ReadDisgraced former DUP mayor is likely to be stripped of his MBEMichaela Foundation to close, John McAreavey announcesOutlook#s bright as Louise Small becomes new face of UTV weatherWatch: Sandy Row loyalists speak their mind on Northern Ireland protocolThree PSNI officers injured after police car rammed by lorry Top VideosVideoSandy Row reacts to LCC letter to Prime Minister and Taoiseach VideoCarla Lockhart apologises for inappropriate language in ParliamentVideoMajor police operation as Holyland parties continue into a second nightLatest BrexitViewpointOpinionOpportunity for growth right on Northern Ireland#s doorstepWatch: Sandy Row loyalists speak their mind on Northern Ireland protocolMark BainOpinionBoris Johnson could build bridges with Ireland... without building a bridgeLoyalists withdrawing Good Friday support a mistake that should not promptto violence, warns Powell Latest from Belfast Man taken to hospital after attack by gang of youths in Co AntrimMikel Arteta: Arsenal face complicated route into Europe after Burnley drawResidents want assurances that north Belfast hotel is not housing criminalsYouTuber Zoella announces pregnancyMixing illegal and prescription drugs causing accidental deaths, says leading GP,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He tells Editor-at-Large Gail Walker why he ended up with a juvenile caution, how he coped with the murder of colleagues in the RUC, about his work in Special Branch and the pain of losing his sister Dawn to cancer last year. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseExpert: Jim Gamble FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueExpert: Jim GambleGail WalkerTwitterEmailMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailQ. Your father, James, and mother, Lillie, were in the RAF, and as a boy you travelled extensively as they moved to dferent postings.A. We lived around the UK and, for three years, lived in Singapore where I’d a dingo, an Australian dog, and a spider monkey called Suki. When I was nine, my dad was sent back to Bishopscourt in Northern Ireland and we lived in Newcastle. From there we moved to Wales.Q. You’ve never spoken publicly about getting a juvenile caution... what happened A. I don’t know whether I should be quoted about this... okay, I got into a bit of trouble with the law in Wales. I was  and continually being provoked and bullied by young people on my way home from school about what was happening in Belfast. That led to a confrontation. I was foolish to respond. I received a juvenile caution and part of the condition of that was that I’d leave Wales and stay with my aunt in east Belfast. Later, working in law enforcement, I’d tell the story and joke: “So you take a child with some aggressive tendencies and anger issues and send them back to s Belfast.” Mum, dad and my sister, Dawn, moved back six months later when they got their transfers sorted out. We settled in a council estate in Bangor, where I was very happy. I went to Bangor Boys’ Secondary School. As a young police inspector handing out my first juvenile caution, I told the culprit: “It’s not what you’ve done that matters, it’s what you do next”. Everyone is entitled to make mistakes and everyone is entitled to a second chance.Q. Despite that brush with the law, you joined the Army.A. It was a spur-of-the-moment thing. I was on a train to Belfast with my best friend, Marty Rodgers, a Catholic. Suddenly, we decided to go to the Army recruiting office at Palace Barracks. That was a Wednesday, and the following Sunday night we were on the boat to England, over to Sutton Coldfield. Marty joined the Parachute Regiment but suffered an injury during training, went home and was tragically killed in a motorbike accident when he was just . At Sutton Coldfield, they put you through psychometric tests. My aptitude tilted towards policing, so I joined the Royal Corps of Military Police. After six months’ training in Chichester, I was posted to West Berlin. The wall was still there, so it was an ideal place to do your apprenticeship in policing a ided society. Q. Two years later, you asked to be transferred to Northern Ireland. Why A. I wanted to be nearer family. I was attached to a unit that worked with the bomb squad. I was engaged to Jean, and it seemed a natural progression to join the RUC.Q. You began your policing career as a unormed constable in Andersonstown, before moving to Londonderry, first as a sergeant with the Mobile Support Unit and then in the Strand Road barracks. After a stint as an instructor in the training centre, you were an inspector in Fermanagh before becoming head of Special Branch in Belfast, latterly with the PSNI. Did you fear for your le A. Everyone thinks it will never be them, but you worry about your family. You’d a mirror to check under your car for booby-trap bombs. It was surreal. As an instructor at the end of new recruits’ first week, you’d show them a video called The Next Target. It included footage of families whose lives had been destroyed after a loved one was killed. In some instances, young children too. One story on The Next Target that resonated with everyone was that of the policeman who got into the car with his young, blond-haired son. As they drove off, the car bomb exploded. The child was killed and thrown hundreds of yards from the vehicle, and in the video you could see where that had happened. Usually, four or five recruits didn’tthe following week. Those who stayed shared a close bond. In an organisation under siege, whose members were being hunted down and killed because of the unorm they wore, there was a great comradeship.Q. Did you lose close friends A. You couldn’t be in the RUC and not do so. On the night of the IRA mortar attack on Newry RUC station , when seven men and two women went to work and never went home, I was on patrol in west Belfast. We were called back to the station to be briefed about it by a senior officer. The sense of loss was awful. We were told not to stop anyone or engage with street disorder in case our emotion was such that we over-reacted and let down colleagues. After horrible events, people did awful things. You’d get vicious, cruel, malign phone calls into the station and yet you’d go out in the heart of west Belfast, where people, when they felt no one was looking, would say: “That was terrible. Look after yourself, son”. We live in a country where nothing is black and white.Q. Working in Special Branch must have brought huge pressures.A. It was dficult, complex and very, very complicated. You were combating what was one of the most ruthless terrorist organisations in the world, the IRA, and one of the most bloody-minded outfits, loyalist terrorists. You had a number of assets: technical and human surveillance — either police or Army street patrols — and informers. Analysis of the information they provided would indicate what might happen. Ronnie Flanagan said that we were stopping four out of every five terrorist incidents, but when you got it wrong, the results could be devastating. Often those who worked in Special Branch got no credit for saving Catholic and Protestant lives because you wouldn’t want to draw attention as to how that information came into your hands. Q. Do you think the Troubles will ever give up much of its secrets  A. We need a process where the truth is told, whereby Catholic or Protestant families, families of security force members or others are able to access as much of the truth as they can about what happened to their loved ones. Should files be released  Yes. You can redact details that would identy a human source, but there’s also lots of intelligence that came from other means, where it’s the horse’s mouth that damns the inidual that committed the act. The only people with anything to fear should the Government press play on those transcripts would be some of those who ponticate today about human rights and wrongs but who’d be blushingthe things they said or did were exposed. Let’s have an honest reflection on who did what, where and when, and then draw some kind of line and move on. Until then, we’ll have dferent factions wanting to rewrite the part that they played because, when they look at themselves in the mirror, they can’t face the horrible reality of who they are and what they did.Q. After being promoted to Assistant Chief Constable, you became deputy director general of the National Crime Squad, where you oversaw Operation Ore, a review into the distribution of online child abuse images, then were appointed first chief executive of the Child Exploitation and Online Protectioncentre.A. The experience I had in Special Branch locating missing terrorists paid idends in CEOP. Our precursor, the UK Serious Sexual Offenders Unit, had a % success rate locating missing high-risk sex offenders. When I finished in CEOP, we had an % success rate.Q. Seeing how some abused children must have felt like staring into the heart of darkness…A. It’s… dficult. When you viewed those images, you looked beyond the brutalisation to the furniture in the room to try and get a clue to help you to locate where that child was so that you could rescue them. We used counter-terrorist methodology. I’ve seen man’s inhumanity to man, what organised gangsters will do to others in pursuit of money, what terrorists will do to one another and to innocent civilians, but I’ve never seen anything as brutal, as inhumane, as the images I was exposed to when I was in CEOP.Q. Of course, the most high-profile missing child case you’ve been involved in is that of Madeleine McCann , who went missing in Praia da Luz in Portugal in .A. During the Operation Ore prosecutions, I’d experienced trolling. Someone asked me what kind of person was I to name my two daughters, Holly and Jessica, after the murder victims of Ian Huntley. My girls had been born long before those children perished. But the trolling with the McCann case is on a dferent scale. All those people pouring bile onto the internet about Kate and Gerry are creating a digital swamp that Sean and Amelie, Madeleine’s brother and sister, will have to wade through as they become digital citizens. Q. What do you think of the German suspect, Christian Brueckner A. He’s the best suspect in the  years that I’ve been involved. The circumstantial evidence gives him opportunities, and his previous history provides evidence that he’d be motivated. Only time will tell, but I believe the case will be solved in my letime. Q. You lost your sister, Dawn Coulter, last August to lung cancer.A. Dawn was the salt of the earth. She’d have done anything for anyone. She married a guy from Bangor. They got married, had their family and built their lives in the town. My dad died at  from stomach cancer and mum died at  from a cardiac arrest, so there was just the two of us. We didn’t need to see each other every day, but there was a huge bond. Death during the pandemic was particularly challenging. Dawn’s family and I will be forever grateful for every act of kindness the nursing staff at the Ulster Hospital showed us. She was diagnosed at stage three but moved rapidly to stage four. Fortunately, her husband and I could wear PPE and be with her at the end. We were allowed around  at Roselawn, though much of that is a blur.Q. Are you religious A. At dferent times in my le, I’d have given you dferent answers. Am I a church-going person  No. Do I believe in God  Yes. Like everybody , when something goes badly wrong, I want someone to blame. If there’s no one , God will do. Faith is about hope things can improve for the better. I’ve seen awful things but also amazing things, like people on both sides who suffered in the Troubles but who have forgiven one another and formed friendships. That speaks to the real nature of humanity.Q. You were one of three candidates short-listed for the job of Chief Constable in , when Matt Baggott was appointed. How’s current incumbent Simon Byrne doing A. People say to me “You’d a close call”, but I really wanted it. I worked with very strong Chief Constables, like Jack Hermon and Ronnie Flanagan. Without him, the peace process couldn’t have been delivered in the way it was. Hugh Orde knew what needed to be fixed. George Hamilton understood politics but also the fundamental independence needed to navigate policing in Northern Ireland. Simon has come in at a dficult time and I don’t think he’d in-depth experience of Northern Ireland. He came in to modernise policing, which is always dficult, but I don’t see clarity of leadership or the consistency that’s needed in Northern Ireland. Mind you, who’d want his job in the current environment Q. You run the INEQE Safeguarding Group, which works to make the online world safer for children. A. This business started as two retired people talking about what they might do in someone’s kitchen. We began with two staff and now have . We’re the largest independent safeguarding company in the UK and Ireland. We’ve contracts with the biggest education providers in the country, are delivering the Safer Schools app across Northern Ireland and are signing up a major sporting body. We carried out the review of Oxfam Great Britain and have just finished a review of the Prince’s Trust. Q. Tell us something surprising about yourself A. I’ve a black belt in Jiu-Jitsu. I don’t like TV detective shows like Line of Duty — I’m always complaining that would never happen in real le — but I like Jimmy Nesbitt and am recording Bloodlands, so I’ll give it a go. I’m a big Downton Abbey fan and have watched it three times. I also have a Crossmaglen all-Ireland GAA shirt signed by the team on my office wall. I was a guest at the club and was welcomed with open arms. I learnt a lot too. It’s an environment primarily about family and community. More recently, they asked me to support a bid for European funding to transition the old security force base into something new, and I was happy to do that.Q. Do you feel hopeful for Northern Ireland A. We’ve got to get past where we are. Politics has got to move more to the centre ground. I see myself as a small-U unionist, and I cringe at some DUP politicians, I wish they’d park the unhelpful, provocative rhetoric. I also find it very dficult to listen to the rhetoric from some Sinn Fein politicians that rewrites a narrative. You simply cannot justy the unjustiable, no matter how hard you try. We all need to do what we can to leave the past behind us. We’re facing a more tense period than we have in a long time and I hear lots of people calling for calm heads and for appropriate language, yet in the same sentence they’ll point the finger of blame and provoke. But things have been worse, much worse. We will get through this, too.Belfast Most ReadDisgraced former DUP mayor is likely to be stripped of his MBEMichaela Foundation to close, John McAreavey announcesWatch: Sandy Row loyalists speak their mind on Northern Ireland protocolOutlook#s bright as Louise Small becomes new face of UTV weatherThree PSNI officers injured after police car rammed by lorry Top VideosVideoSandy Row reacts to LCC letter to Prime Minister and Taoiseach VideoCarla Lockhart apologises for inappropriate language in ParliamentVideoMajor police operation as Holyland parties continue into a second nightLatest Northern IrelandMan taken to hospital after attack by gang of youths in Co AntrimMixing illegal and prescription drugs causing accidental deaths, says leading GPFour coronavirus deaths reported as some pupils prepare for school Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Another four deaths reported with further  positive casesMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageLatest from Belfast Man taken to hospital after attack by gang of youths in Co AntrimMikel Arteta: Arsenal face complicated route into Europe after Burnley drawResidents want assurances that north Belfast hotel is not housing criminalsYouTuber Zoella announces pregnancyMixing illegal and prescription drugs causing accidental deaths, says leading GP,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

And, when lockdown ended last year, because of their inability to travel where, very many of them took the opportunity to do so for the first time.They were very pleasantly surprised at what they saw and obviously have formed the opinion that they are going to do so again this year, and they#ve told their friends.With that in mind, we#re gearing up to market ourselves heavily to the Republic of Ireland as soon as their restrictions ease.The vaccination lag in the Republic compared to NI, however, could impact plans for cross-border travel this summer.According to the latest figures, some , people in Northern Ireland have received their first dose of a Covid vaccine, while , have received their second. This means around % of the overall population here have received their first jab.In the Republic, these figures are , for a first dose and , for a second dose. Around % of RoI#s overall population have received their first jab.Alliance councillor Eric Hanvey, a member of BCC#s City Growth and Regeneration Committee, said there are several factors that will be at play regarding the possibility of cross-border travel this summer. The issue really is the common travel area is there, so unless something is done in relation to that, things will stay as they are. It also depends on the government in the south, what they do in terms of Covid regulations and how they might relax them, he told the Belfast .Speaking this week, First Minister Arlene Foster voiced concern over the dfering speeds at which the vaccination programmes are progressing.It#s very clear that we are going to be finished our vaccination programme and the Republic of Ireland will still be in the midst of theirs. That does bring headaches, she said.On Wednesday night, Visit Belfast presented its three-year Covid recovery strategy, #Rebuilding City Tourism#, aimed at driving more visitors to Belfast following the economic hit caused by the pandemic.Visit Belfast laid out a number of targets for the   financial year, including reaching , bed nights for leisure tourism and , bed nights for business tourism, with the projected economic impact Visit Belfast#s plan to be in the region of £m.Belfast Most ReadDisgraced former DUP mayor is likely to be stripped of his MBEMichaela Foundation to close, John McAreavey announcesWatch: Sandy Row loyalists speak their mind on Northern Ireland protocolOutlook#s bright as Louise Small becomes new face of UTV weatherThree PSNI officers injured after police car rammed by lorry Top VideosVideoSandy Row reacts to LCC letter to Prime Minister and Taoiseach VideoCarla Lockhart apologises for inappropriate language in ParliamentVideoMajor police operation as Holyland parties continue into a second nightLatest Northern IrelandMixing illegal and prescription drugs causing accidental deaths, says leading GPFour coronavirus deaths reported as some pupils prepare for school Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Another four deaths reported with further  positive casesMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageKatie Simpson murder accused Creswell #set it up to look like suicide bid#, court toldLatest from Belfast Residents want assurances that north Belfast hotel is not housing criminalsYouTuber Zoella announces pregnancyMixing illegal and prescription drugs causing accidental deaths, says leading GPFour coronavirus deaths reported as some pupils prepare for school Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Another four deaths reported with further  positive cases,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Pat Cullen, director of the RCN in Northern Ireland, described the proposed pay hike as “insulting” and said health bosses were “dangerously out of touch” with nurses and public opinion. It emerged on Thursday that England’s Department of Health wanted to award nurses a mere % pay rise because of the financial impact of the pandemic. The figure was contained in a submission to the NHS Pay Review Body, which advises on the wages of health service staff. Health Minister Robin Swann previously said he must award the same rise to local nurses. The Belfastasked Mr Swannhe agreed with the increase andhe would be willing to break with pay parity. A spokeswoman from the Department of Health said: “Any decision on a pay award for Northern Ireland workers will be taken after the pay review bodies make their recommendations. We do not intend to pre-empt those recommendations. “Our pay award decisions can only be taken in the context of a wider public sector pay policy set by the Department of Finance.” But Ms Cullen said: “Nursing staff will be feeling insulted by the suggestion that they are only worth a % pay rise. “It is clearis dangerously out of touch with nursing staff, other health care workers and the public. “While the Pay Review Body will make its own recommendation, our members have already been voicing their outrage. “The RCN has been clear that this year, of all years, we need a signicant and fair pay rise. “An additional £. a week for an experienced nurse is by no means fair and will do nothing to prevent an exodus from the profession. It is a political decision to underfund and undervalue nursing staff. “Our members will not shy away from voicing their concerns. As a result of this announcement, the RCN Council convened an emergency meeting, voting unanimously and immediately to set up a £m industrial action fund.” Strike funds are used to provide compensation for workers during industrial action. The RCN said it was determined to have the finances available to members should they wish to take action. Covid- hit Northern Ireland weeks after healthcare workers suspended strike action over pay and dangerous staffing levels. Local NHS employees have been growing increasingly frustrated in recent months over what is seen as a failure by Stormont to act on their concerns. It emerged last week that legislation to address dangerous nursing levels would not be passed by the current Assembly. Stormont made a deal with healthcare workers last January that it would implement safe staffing laws to bring about a pause in industrial action. However, the chief nursing officer said there was now not enough time for the law to be passed.This came after healthcare workers waited almost nine months for the Department of Health topay docked from wages during strike action.Belfast Most ReadDisgraced former DUP mayor is likely to be stripped of his MBEMichaela Foundation to close, John McAreavey announcesOutlook#s bright as Louise Small becomes new face of UTV weatherWatch: Sandy Row loyalists speak their mind on Northern Ireland protocolNew Line of Duty will ‘wreck’ viewers’ heads, says Adrian DunbarTop VideosVideoSandy Row reacts to LCC letter to Prime Minister and Taoiseach VideoCarla Lockhart apologises for inappropriate language in ParliamentVideoMajor police operation as Holyland parties continue into a second nightLatest Northern IrelandMixing illegal and prescription drugs causing accidental deaths, says leading GPFour coronavirus deaths reported as some pupils prepare for school Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Another four deaths reported with further  positive casesMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageKatie Simpson murder accused Creswell #set it up to look like suicide bid#, court toldLatest from Belfast YouTuber Zoella announces pregnancyMixing illegal and prescription drugs causing accidental deaths, says leading GPFour coronavirus deaths reported as some pupils prepare for school Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Another four deaths reported with further  positive casesForce used to disperse anti-coup protesters in Myanmar,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Derry woman Martina Keating passed away in  after battling with cancer. Along with others, the Keating family will be remembering a very special lady who is absent on March . They are holding a fundraiser for a local charity that has touched the lives of many people in the city. Donators will also be entered into a draw to win a gt set that can be presented to a mother, granny, aunty, sister, friend or any special lady. Martina’s husband Michael, daughters Natasha and Elisha, and sons Nathan and Jack are still coming to terms with the loss but hold on to many happy memories. googletag.cmd.push Speaking to the Derry News, Natasha paid tribute to her mother saying: “Anyone who knew my mammy knew that she was somebody you could always go to for advice. “She always had a smile on her face and was carrying on. Mammy was just known by everybody and when she smiled she lit up the room.” In June  Martina was helping Elisha gather belongings to move to university when she experienced pain. At first she suspected it was a pulled muscle and went to the hospital. After performing gall bladder surgery doctors diagnosed cancer in her liver and bowel. “It came as a big shock to us all. My mum battled for six months and died at the age of ,” Natasha said. googletag.cmd.push Foyle Hospice supported the family, allowing them to comfort Martina until the end. In particular, one special nurse called Rose Green went above and beyond. Now retired, Rose worked as part of the Community Specialist Palliative Care Team at the Hospice. It is a group of specially trained nurses who provide professional palliative care expertise and support to patients and their families in their own home. Natasha recalled: “Rose arranged everything, we didn’t have to do anything when it came to getting a hospital bed or making sure that my mum was comfortable. “She ended up doubling up as a counsellor for us, she was amazing.     “So we always wanted to give back. “We know that the pandemic has impacted on all local charities and we’d like to help them all. “But we wanted to do it in memory of my mammy for Mother’s Day so that’s why we chose somewhere that did help us, in the hope it can help another family like us.” Martina’s death was the first time that the family was directly affected by cancer. Sadly, her family has experienced untold heartbreak in the past. Natasha said: “My daddy lost his mother to a brain haemorrhage in August , lost his two sisters in a house fire not far from the flower shop he owns in Beechwood and lost his father in a car crash. “It’s a lot of tragedy for one person to go through.” Martina’s death left a chasm in all their lives. “My mum had us spoilt rotten so we had to learn everything, we’ve had the support of family and friends who have been so good. “As a family we are really close and help each other so much. “Even though it has been seven years it’s still quite raw, I don’t think it’s something you can ever get over.” Having witnessed the dedication of hospital staff during her mother’s illness, Elisha trained to be a nurse and is now working on the ward where Martina was treated. As a family they wanted to do something more to recognise the hard work of the Foyle Hospice and Mother’s Day this year provided the perfect opportunity. The prize which will be given away is worth over pound with items including a Michael Kors bag, nomination bracelet, perfume set, rainbow flowers bouquet and beauty hamper. To be in with a chance of winning all you have to do is make a minimum donation of pound. The plan is for the competition to close and winner to be chosen on Mother’s Day.

The team will work in partnership with victims and survivors of Mother and Baby and Magdalene Laundry Institutions to establish the terms of reference for a fully independent investigation. In recent months the Derry News has highlighted the personal experiences of local people who either stayed at the Good Shepherd Home and Laundry in the city or had a mother who lived there. The  of experts announced today to lead an investigation includes local woman,Deirdre Mahon, who isDirector of Women and Children’s Services and the Executive Director of Social Work in the Western Health and Social Services Trust. googletag.cmd.push She is a qualied and experienced Social Worker Youth and Community worker and is passionate about ensuring that the voices of service users are heard, understood and are central to the development and delivery of services. Throughout her  year career, Deirdre has had extensive experience in both direct work with service users, and the management and development of staff. She has been a driving force in the roll-out of trauma informed practice across Northern Ireland. The other experts are, Phil Scraton, a Professor Emeritus in the School of Law,Queens University Belfast. He has an international reputation for research into the rights of bereaved families and survivors, particularly his investigative work into the Hillsborough disaster. googletag.cmd.push And Dr Maeve O’Rourke who is Lecturer in Human Rights at the Irish Centre for Human Rights, National University of Ireland Galway, and a barrister at  Bedford Row, London. She has worked pro bono for more than a decade with iniduals and relatives of those affected by Magdalene Laundries, Mother and Baby Institutions, forced and illegal adoptions, and related institutions and practices in the Republic of Ireland. The appointments follow a statement by the Northern Ireland Executive in January of its intention to establish a victim-centred independent investigation into the operation of the historical institutions between  and  – the date the last institution in Northern Ireland closed its doors.     The Executive also decided that the investigation would be designed jointly with victims and survivors over a period of six months. The Department of Health has also revealed details of a dedicated phone line    and website to enable victims and survivors of the institutions to participate. Anyone with a connection with the institutions can become involved. Information of how to take part is available on theNI Direct website. Information on a range of supports available can also be accessed on the website. Speaking about the appointments, the Health Minister Robin Swann said: “Iam delighted to announce the appointment of Deirdre Mahon, Professor Phil Scraton and Dr. Maeve O’Rourke to work with victims and survivors to establish the terms of reference for an independent investigation into Mother and Baby and Magdalene Laundry institutions in Northern Ireland. I have asked the team to start its work immediately and to report within the six month timeframe set by the Executive for this work.” SHAMEFUL PERIOD First Minister Arlene Foster spoke of the many women and children who were victims of shocking ill-treatment and abuse in Mother and Baby Homes and Magdalene Laundries who have had to wait far too long for their voices to be heard. The appointment of this team of experts to work with victims and survivors in shaping the independent investigation is another welcome step forward in the long fight to break the silence around their suffering. “All three iniduals bring a wealth of experience and expertise in this area and I am confident that, through a process of engagement and working side by side with victims and survivors, the team will be able to shape an investigation that will have their confidence and deliver the truth and justice they deserve,” she added. Meanwhile, Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said:“The harrowing stories of the many women and children who suffered abuse in Mother and Baby Homes and Magdalene Laundries are truly heartbreaking. They were treated appallingly by these institutions and failed on every level. “This is another signicant step towards finally securing justice for the victims and survivors of this abuse, and it is vital that they are at the heart of the co-design process. “I would encourage all victims and survivors to come forward and to make their voices heard so that the team of experts can set about shining a light on this dark and shameful period in our history.” Judith Gillespie, the independent chair of the inter-departmental working group, which had oversight of research by Queen’s University and Ulster University into the historical institutions and made recommendations to the Northern Ireland Executive based on that research, also welcomed the appointments. She concluded: “This is another important step for victims and survivors of Mother and Baby and Magdalene Laundry institutions. For too long their voices have not been heard and the co-design process will be fundamental to addressing that.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Next week the local Trust will mark  months since the first pandemic patient was admitted to the South West Acute Hospital. Over  patients have died in Altnagelvin Hospital and South West Acute Hospital since who had a Covid- diagnosis. That has taken a ‘huge’ toll on families and staff who were with patients in their final moments, a Western Trust Board meeting was told. Chief Executive Dr Anne Kilgallen said that in the midst of the dreadful challenges and trauma experienced, iniduals and teams have grown and developed at pace. googletag.cmd.push Leaders have emerged at every level, and continue to do so, and Director of Human Resources Ann McConnell has played a big part in ‘sowing the seeds for this collective leadership’ well before pandemic, she added. The meeting heard that there are , people who work for the Western Trust and service teams now that did not exist  months ago. The Trust’s Covid Vaccination Teams continue to achieve ‘extraordinary levels of vaccine delivery’, by mobile teams in care homes, supported living facilities and day centres as well as in its three Mass Vaccination Centres. To date, the teams have delivered over , vaccinations. googletag.cmd.push All Care Homes in the WHSCT area have had second doses delivered to original residents who were fit to have the vaccine. In Supported Living facilities, the second dose programme is at an advanced stage. The mobile vaccination teams have also delivered vaccines to users of Learning Disability Day Centres and Day Opportunities as well as to long stay mental health inpatients and plan to deliver to the homeless population in the coming weeks. Dr Kilgallen said: “To successfully organise and deliver a public health programme of this scale and magnitude against a backdrop of uncertainties about supply, personnel and scope reflects the ingenuity, flexibility and problem-solving ability of a erse team nurtured under Ann’s leadership.     “We have relied on the expertise of Ann and of her team, their technical expertise and their strong relationships with our Staff Side colleagues to help us navigate and support our staff. “Those relationships have enabled us to respond to unprecedented challenges, always putting the care and support of our patients and service users at the forefront. “Ann leaves a team and corporate service of which she can be hugely proud. No one person could have achieved what we have achieved in the last  months yet no one person can have been more central than Ann. Those of us who have worked with her know this.” PROUD Trust Chair Sam Pollock echoed those sentiments saying: “You’ve stayed calm and cool. Your performance has just been superb, your support, your insight and way of managing people, bringing out the best in them is just awesome. “Thank you Ann for everything you’ve done. “The administration of the vaccine in Foyle Arena and other centres has been huge. I’ve had loads of compliments passed on to the Trust. “I’m proud of the Trust and the way we’ve administered the vaccine. “We’re way ahead of other Trusts, who’ve struggled, it’s down to your foresight and ability to manage and I want to acknowledged that publicly and wish you well in your retirement, you deserve it.” Speaking at her last Board meeting, Ann McConnell said it was a privilege to be part of the Trust Board having started out as a clerical officer. “It’s something I’ve never taken for granted. I’ve been really fortunate with the teams that I’ve had around me and the people supporting me,” she said. “They all inspire me to do my best and that’s what I’ve done, I will leave the organisation knowing that I’ve done my best in all of the circumstances. “I’m very proud of the vaccination programme even though it caused me many sleepless nights and more hours of my le than any job ever should. “Getting it off the ground in the West was a really challenge because we didn’t have many people on the register wanting to be vaccinators.” She continued: “But actually that programme has been one of the things I’ve been privileged to be part of because there aren’t many HR people who’ve run a service and now I feel like I have which has made a dference to patient’s lives. “I want to thank you all very much, I have been stretched, challenged, and supported lots and I thank you all for that. “I know you will be doing really important work rebuilding services for our population and there isn’t a more important job in the Western area so I wish you all the luck in the world.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Those closest to him insist that the renowned orator will again be on the streets of Derry with is trademark megaphone in hand. Earlier this week, the Derry man announced that he will be resigning from his role as a councillor on health grounds. He was diagnosed with epilepsy about  years ago but it had not hindered his work. However, it was discovered during tests some months ago that he had developed a neurological condition, Ataxia. googletag.cmd.push “This has made it increasingly dficult for me to fulfill my duty as a councillor in the way the people of the Moor DEA are entitled to expect,” he said. Social media was awash with goodwill messages and people sharing fond memories of the tenacious socialist. His partner, Goretti Horgan, thanked the well-wishers but emphasised that he still has ‘a couple of books in him yet’ and ‘will continue to be an active socialist’. “Eamonn isn’t sick but has mobility issues that make being a good elected rep dficult, hence the resignation,” she explained. Those sentiments were echoed by his friend and party colleague on Derry City  Strabane District Council, Shaun Harkin. googletag.cmd.push He commented: “Every tribute Eamonn has received is more than well deserved and hell be very much missed at Council. “However, anyone under the impression Eamonn is retiring will be sorely disappointed. “Ive no doubt Eamonn will, and look forward to seeing, Eamonn continuing to be a thorn in the side of the political establishment and an inspiring champion for justice, civil rights for all and socialism. Onwards Eamonn!” One of the founding members of the Civil Rights campaign, Eamonn is also an accomplished writer, journalist and trade unionist who has been involved in politics for more than  years. Speaking to the Derry News previously McCann believed in the need for ‘radical’ policies in government to ensure that Derry gets its fair share.     “Why are we still so far behind in terms of university education, infrastructure, of living standards, relative rates of poverty – why is Derry still lagging behind after nationalists took control of it  “Both orange and green have had their time, half a century each at running Derry, surely it’s time to try something that might work. “Public money is being frittered away in dodgy schemes which are semi-criminal enterprises. “There’s an awful lot that can be done and I believe in a radical programme for the future which I don’t think any other party has,” he said. McCann will make way for someone  to fill his shoes in council but will remain on the streets as a champion of the civil rights, a defender of the oppressed and an opponent of capitalism which he describes as ‘the never-ending source of all our political ills’.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Long-standing businesses that look out on the roundabout lie silent. googletag.cmd.push  A fresh coat of paint on OBriens bar reflects the sun. A note on the shutters of Raineys bookies directs punters to dial-a-bet. The glass door of Mullins carries a notice declaring no ice cream will be sold until March. Only Emporium Interiors and McCloys have the lights on and the doors open. Metal fencing cordons off the old ivy-covered hotel building at the Diamond. The Town Hall clock has stopped. In the centre of Kilrea, it is eternally half three. On Maghera Street, a number of shop units are empty. An occasional to let sign looks hopefully out from a vacant window. Flat pack furniture lies in boxes on the floor of one unit. googletag.cmd.push A van sits outside Donaghys waiting to be loaded up. Behind the electrics shop, the large car parking space that services the town is well-populated. Many of the visitors have been attracted by one of the towns newest additions. The Little Coffee Box opened just three weeks ago, a converted horse box selling coffee and snacks in this historic town. Ciara McKenna ready to provide the town with coffee and refreshments. For owner Ciara McKenna, lockdown has had a relatively positive effect. “A lot of shops and places arent open, but its been really busy,” she said. “Maybe with cafes not being open, and Kilrea having Portna and Hutchinsons Quay, people can grab something and go for a walk.”     Ciara began baking during the first lockdown almost a year ago, and as her confidence grew, so did her ambition. “Id been doing afternoon tea boxes, and then I got this idea that I wanted to convert a horse box into a wee coffee hut,” she said. “My partner did all the work himself and converted it. We got it off a man in Knockloughrim as a plain horse box and its unreal the way its turned out. “We opened up on the worst weekend, because it was really windy and rainy, and then on the Saturday the snow came. “The snow was heavy, but I couldnt believe how busy we were with how bad the weather was. Every time you look there is a queue. “When you open youd be worriedanyone was going to show, oryouve baked enough, but every weekend Ive had to bake more. “I keep telling myself, because I can move about, thatits not doing well, we can go somewhere , but I hope it wont come to that. “I thinkour stuff is good enough, well still get our customers.” An old-style phone box at the top of the Drumagarner Road. Kilrea has two, with the other at the Diamond. Things are starting to pick up as I head back down through the Diamond and onto Bridge Street. Chatter drts through the open door of McAtamneys as I make my way past. The late John Dallats constituency office sits empty, its signage stripped from above the door. What a dference a year makes. Gym equipment sits in partial shadow in the unit next to the car wash. On down the hill the lights on the school sign continue to flash a warning to motorists. The Bann glistens in the distance, still swollen from the recent rain as it meanders its way around the old Portneal Lodge site. After closing its doors in , the building has been dormant since, with just the picturesque walk around its perimeter left to attract people there. The appearance of a branded pick-up truck at its entrance, and the flashy new sign, however, point to renewed le at the site. Inside the gate sits yet another recent addition to the towns business landscape. Stranded is a burger van with a dference, as owners Adrian Doherty and Ailish Deeney explain. “Its been a bit mad, we thought wed be serving  burgers a night and weve been way busier than we thought wed ever be,” said Adrian. “I dont knowits just because of lockdown, but its good anyway. Were offering something dferent that no one  does round here.” Adrian Doherty and Ailish Deeney launched Stranded Burger three weeks ago. Adrians partner, Ailish, says local reaction to their opening has been hugely positive. “I think the local residents are very happy to see the site being used as well. Its been lying abandoned and people have been abusing it,” she said. “With the bridge, we thought it would be a good place for people passing, and its a nice location beside the river as well, its scenic. “Its something wed always considered, coming from a catering background and being foodie-lovers. Weve always talked about a burger van and this year we took the plunge. “Its been extremely busy, weve got a mad response that we just couldnt believe at all. People are queuing and travelling to come here, so we couldnt have asked for a better response.” The pair, like any other lockdown era entrepreneurs, have had their doubts, but they have planned well ahead, with both their business model and their branding. “It happened so fast we didnt really have time to think about it. We had to get the van done up and we were still doing that on opening week, so it was a whole rush to get everything sorted,” said Ailish. “The name Stranded works well, because we could be stranded anywhere. At the minute its Portneal Lodge, butsomewhere came up where there was demand, we could be stranded there. “As far as competition goes, there is room for everybody and we want everybody to do well, because were all in the same game at the end of the day.” On the way back to the car, I pause at the Diamond, taking a seat outside Mullins. The weather has brought people onto the streets and, as it often does, has them in good spirits. A man makes his way briskly towards Coleraine Street, his dog on a lead in front of him. A woman jogs up the hill as he heads down.  Conversation floats across the street from where three men have stopped outside the bookmakers. Its clear they havent seen each other in a while. Theyre uneasy, maintaining the required distance, but you get the feeling theyd be happy to take a seat and spend the afternoon just watching the traffic go back and forth. The conversation ends. They head off in separate directions, one down Bridge Street, one down Coleraine Street and the other across the Diamond towards Church Street. Late February. Sunshine. Old friends meeting in the streets. A community yearning for normality. As the daily update brings news of mounting vaccine numbers and falling case numbers, you can almost touch the hope. Or maybe thats just the good weather talking.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A note on the shutters of Raineys bookies directs punters to dial-a-bet. The glass door of Mullins carries a notice declaring no ice cream will be sold until March. Only Emporium Interiors and McCloys have the lights on and the doors open. Metal fencing cordons off the old ivy-covered hotel building at the Diamond. The Town Hall clock has stopped. In the centre of Kilrea, it is eternally half three. On Maghera Street, a number of shop units are empty. An occasional to let sign looks hopefully out from a vacant window. Flat pack furniture lies in boxes on the floor of one unit. googletag.cmd.push A van sits outside Donaghys waiting to be loaded up. Behind the electrics shop, the large car parking space that services the town is well-populated. Many of the visitors have been attracted by one of the towns newest additions. The Little Coffee Box opened just three weeks ago, a converted horse box selling coffee and snacks in this historic town. Ciara McKenna ready to provide the town with coffee and refreshments. For owner Ciara McKenna, lockdown has had a relatively positive effect. “A lot of shops and places arent open, but its been really busy,” she said. “Maybe with cafes not being open, and Kilrea having Portna and Hutchinsons Quay, people can grab something and go for a walk.”     Ciara began baking during the first lockdown almost a year ago, and as her confidence grew, so did her ambition. “Id been doing afternoon tea boxes, and then I got this idea that I wanted to convert a horse box into a wee coffee hut,” she said. “My partner did all the work himself and converted it. We got it off a man in Knockloughrim as a plain horse box and its unreal the way its turned out. “We opened up on the worst weekend, because it was really windy and rainy, and then on the Saturday the snow came. “The snow was heavy, but I couldnt believe how busy we were with how bad the weather was. Every time you look there is a queue. “When you open youd be worriedanyone was going to show, oryouve baked enough, but every weekend Ive had to bake more. “I keep telling myself, because I can move about, thatits not doing well, we can go somewhere , but I hope it wont come to that. “I thinkour stuff is good enough, well still get our customers.” An old-style phone box at the top of the Drumagarner Road. Kilrea has two, with the other at the Diamond. Things are starting to pick up as I head back down through the Diamond and onto Bridge Street. Chatter drts through the open door of McAtamneys as I make my way past. The late John Dallats constituency office sits empty, its signage stripped from above the door. What a dference a year makes. Gym equipment sits in partial shadow in the unit next to the car wash. On down the hill the lights on the school sign continue to flash a warning to motorists. The Bann glistens in the distance, still swollen from the recent rain as it meanders its way around the old Portneal Lodge site. After closing its doors in , the building has been dormant since, with just the picturesque walk around its perimeter left to attract people there. The appearance of a branded pick-up truck at its entrance, and the flashy new sign, however, point to renewed le at the site. Inside the gate sits yet another recent addition to the towns business landscape. Stranded is a burger van with a dference, as owners Adrian Doherty and Ailish Deeney explain. “Its been a bit mad, we thought wed be serving  burgers a night and weve been way busier than we thought wed ever be,” said Adrian. “I dont knowits just because of lockdown, but its good anyway. Were offering something dferent that no one  does round here.” Adrian Doherty and Ailish Deeney launched Stranded Burger three weeks ago. Adrians partner, Ailish, says local reaction to their opening has been hugely positive. “I think the local residents are very happy to see the site being used as well. Its been lying abandoned and people have been abusing it,” she said. “With the bridge, we thought it would be a good place for people passing, and its a nice location beside the river as well, its scenic. “Its something wed always considered, coming from a catering background and being foodie-lovers. Weve always talked about a burger van and this year we took the plunge. “Its been extremely busy, weve got a mad response that we just couldnt believe at all. People are queuing and travelling to come here, so we couldnt have asked for a better response.” The pair, like any other lockdown era entrepreneurs, have had their doubts, but they have planned well ahead, with both their business model and their branding. “It happened so fast we didnt really have time to think about it. We had to get the van done up and we were still doing that on opening week, so it was a whole rush to get everything sorted,” said Ailish. “The name Stranded works well, because we could be stranded anywhere. At the minute its Portneal Lodge, butsomewhere came up where there was demand, we could be stranded there. “As far as competition goes, there is room for everybody and we want everybody to do well, because were all in the same game at the end of the day.” On the way back to the car, I pause at the Diamond, taking a seat outside Mullins. The weather has brought people onto the streets and, as it often does, has them in good spirits. A man makes his way briskly towards Coleraine Street, his dog on a lead in front of him. A woman jogs up the hill as he heads down.  Conversation floats across the street from where three men have stopped outside the bookmakers. Its clear they havent seen each other in a while. Theyre uneasy, maintaining the required distance, but you get the feeling theyd be happy to take a seat and spend the afternoon just watching the traffic go back and forth. The conversation ends. They head off in separate directions, one down Bridge Street, one down Coleraine Street and the other across the Diamond towards Church Street. Late February. Sunshine. Old friends meeting in the streets. A community yearning for normality. As the daily update brings news of mounting vaccine numbers and falling case numbers, you can almost touch the hope. Or maybe thats just the good weather talking.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Liam McElhinney and Paul McFlynn are both in agreement regarding a , but insist any guidelines must be adhered to. Last month a letter, signed by  people from a range of sporting backgrounds across Ulster, was sent to the Office of the First Minister and Deputy Minister . It outlined the frustration in their communities and clubs about the neglect of youth sport. “We believe the curtailing of outdoor youth sport is now unnecessary and not supported by either science or best practice,” the letter read. The letter, which asked for immediate action be taken to mandate aof sport in covid safe environments, was only acknowledged yesterday, over two weeks later. googletag.cmd.push A response has been promised, but there seems to be some discrepancy whose remit it comes under. Former Derry and Loup player Paul McFlynn, the Course Director of the Postgraduate PE teaching course at Ulster University, was one of the signatures on the letter. Dr John McSparran, a former Antrim GAA Chairman, and Dr Martin McConaghy – a Sports Medicine Doctor – also put their support behind the letter. “The people who wrote the letter werent doing this for selfish reasons or they werent undermining the risk,” McFlynn told the County Derry Post. Former Derry player Paul McFlynn  googletag.cmd.push “When you look at the detrimental impact not having children involved in exercise and physical activity is having on them, thisis something you should surely be able to do.” McFlynn said those behind the letter had their homework done and had read an article from Marie Murphy, a Professor in Exercise and Health “She was alluding to there being no evidence out there saying about any problems with playing outdoor sport and the transmission rate. If anything, we know the risk is extremely low,” he added. McFlynn, a former PE teacher, said that despite schools currently not open to all pupils, it has no direct relevance to outdoor sport.     “With children being in a classroom all day and it is not ventilated, there is more of a risk and hence thats why schools are closed. “The fact that outdoor transmission is minimal, really and truly kids should be back at sport and thats where itcame from.” He points to pupils not only missing the academic side of school, but the social side and playing with their friends. Measures can be put in place to alleviate some of the stress and pressure with the dficulties they are having without sport. “Sport is definitely something that should be done in a safe way, provided the right mitigations are in place,” adds McFlynn, who now lives in Maghera and coaches Glen Us. “Ones were seeing it on a personal level, the effect it was having on their own kids. My own boys are trying to get outside and they are reaching for an iPad and a phone, you want to get them out and away from that. You can see how easy they can get drawn into something like that.” McFlynn speaks of the focus on mental health and the need to interact with others. “For a lot of kids it is about reconnecting. Some kids will come out of this and they will be suffering from mild anxiety and some even more so” he adds. When he gets a chance to begin coaching again, everything will centre around fun in a safe environment, with all the necessary precautions. “Our emphasis is about getting back out on a pitch and running about free, something they were not able to do with the restrictions,” he outlines. The thought of playing against any opposition, mixing communities or competitive games, shouldnt be entertained until sporting bodies are given the green light to proceed. For McFlynn, the danger will be clubs and coaches who will want to do more, with the fear of falling behind or to steal a march of everyone . “Clubs have got to forget that their teams have missed out on almost a year of football and they are going to be behind in their development. Everybody has lost that. “Unless they have got back to reconnect properly and got back in the social scene, it wont matter what comes after it. Their mind needs to be free from the pressures of competing for as long as possible.” He also states that, should the powers that be signal ato sport in a safe environment, it needs to be clear and clubs need to adopt a strong stance. “Thats the big thing,” McFlynn stresses. “There can be no mixed messages or grey area when we go back. Its a case of having everything done as safely as possible.” He references players without an available lt pooling with others outside their bubble, or even parents congregating to watch, with no social distancing. “That cant happen,” he adds. “The onus is on the clubs and mentors to be responsible and that needs to be overseen by those on a youth committee or the hierarchy of a club. “If this isnt happening, then somebody needs to be strong enough to step in and say this needs to change or theyll call a halt to it.” McFlynns thoughts have been echoed by former Dungiven and Derry player Liam McElhinney, who is urging politicians to bring about ato outdoor sport. McElhinney, a former teacher in St Patricks and St Brigids in Claudy, is now teaching in Rossmar Special School in Limavady and is a local representative for Aontuacute. Liam McElhinney “It’s terrible that our youth have been forgotten about during the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown that followed,” he outlined in a statement to the County Derry Post. While insisting on the importance to adhere to all the guidelines during the pandemic, McElhinney says its absolutely vital that young people are back participating in sport. “Sporting activities will develop important character building and lelong values in children which will have a positive impact in their lives,” he stated. “As a former player and coach, I believe that all sports at youth level needs to be prioritised as society emerges from lockdown – in particular children who are disabled and those from socially deprived areas.” He references experts in physical education being critical of the decision to curtail outdoor sport with no evidence of outdoor transmission. “Young people need their sport now more than ever, as they are rapidly becoming our forgotten generation who have lost so much in their young lives,” added McElhinney, who has coached at club and school level. “It is vital that we resume our sports as soon as possible for both the physical and mental wellbeing of our children. “Sports clubs throughout the island of Ireland will be devastated to learn that despite the gradualto school for our children, there is no change in sight for outdoor sports. Our young sports people need to be brought back sooner rather than later, through structured and organised competition. I firmly believe that the time is now rather than later to ensure the physical and mental wellbeing of our children.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Their mother Marcella taught in New Row Primary School and their uncles – James and Malachy McAfee – played for Ballerin and Derry. They were among five sets of sisters, as the names Pickering, OKane, Totten and Mulholland also featured heavily on the team-sheet. It was a team that, without wiping all before it in the underage ranks, matured to form a senior team that would come to the top and knock on the door of four county finals. “Mary McAuley, she won player of the matchand she was  and a real old hand,” Maura points out. “There was a real mix...our Katie was playing and she was only  or . “It was a mixture of old hands that had been playing camogie for years for Castledawson and some of the younger ones.” The  was littered with players who tasted success at minor level with Derry and on the Ulster College scene with St Marys Magherafelt. Sharpshooter Róisín Pickering hit - in UUJs Ashbourne Cup Final win over UL. A talented bunch was beginning to form. At club level, a minor title in the late nineties brought through five or six players to the senior ranks. It was followed by seasons of frustration with a host of first round exits. “Wed have got beat by Bellaghy, Swatragh and Lavey...we could never get over the hurdle,” Maura explains. Any team knocking on the door of success will have a turning point. Malachy McToal and Tommy Cox took the reigns in the  season that saw Castledawson make their greatest stride to date. Going into their semi-final with Swatragh that year, the Dawson were underdogs. The Davitts had  titles to their name and after a staggering  in succession, they were chasing another five-in-a-row. “We beat them, it was a big scalp,” Maura points out. “They were high and flying and werent expecting it...and to be fair, neither were we.” The result was just the tonic. Katie McAuley scored three goals in an enthralling - to - win. Once Castledawson got their noses in front, they battened down the hatches at the back. It was time to stand up. “We threw everything into the back line to keep them out,” Maura remembers. “You couldnt let that Swatragh team near the goals or theyd have opened you up.” It was a seismic step forward, one to foster belief. Though, thats where their title hopes ended. In the decider, Lavey ran out - to - winners on the way to four titles inside six years. Castledawson just couldnt find their semi-final form and reach the same heights. “As they say, you have to lose a final to win one” offers Maura. The following year, Castledawson werent in the reckoning, yet didnt disappear from the pecking order. In  they ed for another crack at the title. It was their time. *** Paddy Henry senior was taken too soon. Maura McAuley still remembers her sister Únas phone call. It was Saturday, August , , just two years after managing Castledawson to championship glory, and down the line filtered the tragic news that Paddy passed away. “It was awful at the time,” Maura said. “It was such a short time after us winning the championship and although he wasnt with usthat year, well never forget him for what he did. Katie, Úna and Maura McAuley pictured with Paddy Henry senior during the celebrations “He was brilliant and was able to get the best out of everybody,” said Maura of Paddys greatest strength. She remembers after weekends when theyd have been in Dublin socialising, their manager always struck a balance to get his charges back on track for the next challenge. “Hes just  said Ill run the drink out of you and he knew what to do to get you going and it worked,” Maura added. “Others may have taken a dferent approach, but Paddy just had that way with him.” With the experience of having coached football teams around the club, mixed with his infectious personality made him the perfect leader for their ever-improving camogie side. Without the endless array of team meetings that has crept into sport now, Paddy still managed to leave no stone unturned. His son Paddy junior, who won an Ulster minor medal with Lavey the previous season, and Bridie Totten came on board as part of the management. “Young Paddy would have been working with Claireon puck-outs. He was handy with the hurl and hed be firing shots in at her and working with the free-takers,” Maura points out. The two other Henry boys - Christopher and Peter - were also part of the back-room team, who would later help Paddy junior get Castledawsons underage hurling teams get their foot on the ladder. On the camogie front, Castledawson entered the  Ulster League, giving them games against the cream of other counties. Again, it was another ingredient, helping them raise the standard. Despite losing to Swatragh early on in the Derry league, Castledawson went on to win the title and Maura vividly remembers the next training session after their defeat. “He gave us some running after that game, he knew we shouldnt have got beat.” Maura laughs. “Paddy made it enjoyable. We did the hard running and the hard hours.” Later in the year, after a championship semi-final win over Greenlough, Castledawson were one step from realising their dream. Standing in their way were rivals Lavey. The buzz began to kick in around the parish, but the team needed to keep their eyes on the prize. “We knew it was going to be a do die and you had to do what it took to win,” Maura remembers. On the eve of the final, one of the players found the nerves overwhelming her preparations. Paddy seniors attention for detail took another direction, prescribing her an hour in the Thatch and a couple of drinks to take the edge off her anxiety. “It was his way of pacying her and getting her settled...and it worked a treat,” Maura jokes, of their Declan Pilkington moment. It was the last base that needed covered. It was time for Castledawsons date with destiny. They had knocked the door long enough. “We had gotten off to a good start,” Maura remembers of the decider. “Shaunascored two goals and we were doing very well, but of course Lavey came back at us again. “It ebbed and flowed all the way. It wasnt a high scoring match and after Katie got that goal, her  sealed it.” In reports after the game, Castledawsons diamond formation of dropping a player behind midfield was attributed as their master plan. “Paddy came up with that,” Maura reveals. “Katie Pcame back as our defensive midfielder. She dropped back between the full and half back lines, between me and Eileen .” It was their plan for the season. An extra set of defensive handsneeded. “Katiewas told thats your role, shes going to have to defend and push on to support midfield,” Maura explains of their plans. “She came dropping back to help out. Her and Maoliosa Shivers were midfield, they were flying fit and were able to get back and cover and get up the pitch again.” The arduous training sessions and simplistic, yet effective, system, had paid off. Their name was on the cup. But, a Tuesday night county final doesnt fit in with the traditional weekend party slot, of a Sunday night spilling into wee small hours of Monday. “We tried our best,” Maura laughs of their extended celebrations. “We went back to Mary McAuleys house and I remember coming back home at half six the next morning and Daddy was going up to do the milking...he just shook his head at us.” A matter of days later, Rossa were waiting, but the short turnaround ahead of a tilt at Ulster was a bridge too far for the Dawson. The Belfast side ran out - to - winners, on their way to the All-Ireland Final before growing into the machine that would go the whole way in . “It was the Jane Adams show, she was unreal,” Maura conceded. “We had won the Derry championship for the first time and wed go and give it a go.” It was Paddy Henrys last game in charge, telling the squad after the game that he took them as far as he could. A signed Castledawson jersey from  Castledawson stuck together and reached two more finalsbut came up short against Lavey on both occasions and have yet to land their second county title. It leaves a hint of regret, as Maura explains. “The team that we had...we shouldve gone on and won more,” she admits. “To win one, it was special but youd like to have won more, but it wouldve been far worseyou didnt win any and lost in all those finals.” When Cargin set up their camogie club in , the McAuley sisters headed back to their roots and won an Ulster junior title with their native club. “The Castledawson ones always knew thatCargin started up, we were always going to go to our own club.” Maura concludes. But fteen years on, Mauras memories are razor sharp of the night when she led her side into battle and they stood tallest above the rest - the Queens of the Castle.\",\"keywords\":\"camogie,Katie McAuley,Maura McAuley,Paddy Henry,Derry,Castledawson\",\"articleSection\":\"GAA\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"From , Lavey and Swatragh dominated the Derry senior camogie scene.

Of the next  titles, the superpowers won seven each, but in  an emerging Castledawson side annexed their first senior title. Michael McMullan spoke to Dawson captain Maura McAuley as she looked back on their historic success.Light was fading fast, but it was never going to suppress the tension lingering over Swatraghs Davitt Park. You could almost taste the sizzling pressure as the  Derry senior camogie final headed for a dramatic conclusion. The championship had been held up and the decider was prised into an unfashionable Tuesday night slot. Antrim giants Rossa were waiting in the wings, destined to meet the winners the following weekend. For the guts of  minutes, with the game in the melting pot, it looked like Lavey would emerge as champions. The two Shauna Mulholland goals that set Castledawson into a - to - and in cruise control were cancelled out. The momentum had swung full circle. Attracta McPeake and Therese McCann found the net for Lavey, who now led - to - as the race headed for the final fence. googletag.cmd.push In the semi-final two years earlier, Castledawson sunk Swatragh who were going for five in a row but didnt produce the fairytale ending, going down to Lavey in the decider. This year was going to be dferent. It would take until the dying moments, but the girls from the Broagh would get both hands on the cup this time. In the dying moments a Katie McAuley shot found its way into the net to turn the game on its head. In the middle of the pandemonium, she put the icing on the cake with a sweet strike over the bar from a . googletag.cmd.push They werent to be denied. It was Castledawsons moment of glory. Katies oldest sister Maura was stationed at the other end of the field. At full-back, yards in front of goalkeeper Claire OKane, she had a dferent view of that defining goal. “That night...it was so dark,” Maura recalls. “All I saw was the net rippling, I saw it moving and I thought shes got it and we knew then...we knew we were going to do it. “You could see nothing from the other end and Swatragh pitch...it is massive. It was a relief itwent in and you were praying for the whistle at that stage.”     Maura McAuley with the cup after the game With no camogie at the time in their native Cargin, the McAuley sisters - Maura, Uacutena and Katie – crossed the Bann to join Castledawson. Their mother Marcella taught in New Row Primary School and their uncles – James and Malachy McAfee – played for Ballerin and Derry. They were among five sets of sisters, as the names Pickering, OKane, Totten and Mulholland also featured heavily on the team-sheet. It was a team that, without wiping all before it in the underage ranks, matured to form a senior team that would come to the top and knock on the door of four county finals. “Mary McAuley, she won player of the matchand she was  and a real old hand,” Maura points out. “There was a real mix...our Katie was playing and she was only  or . “It was a mixture of old hands that had been playing camogie for years for Castledawson and some of the younger ones.” The  was littered with players who tasted success at minor level with Derry and on the Ulster College scene with St Marys Magherafelt. Sharpshooter Roacuteisiacuten Pickering hit - in UUJs Ashbourne Cup Final win over UL. A talented bunch was beginning to form. At club level, a minor title in the late nineties brought through five or six players to the senior ranks. It was followed by seasons of frustration with a host of first round exits. “Wed have got beat by Bellaghy, Swatragh and Lavey...we could never get over the hurdle,” Maura explains. Any team knocking on the door of success will have a turning point. Malachy McToal and Tommy Cox took the reigns in the  season that saw Castledawson make their greatest stride to date. Going into their semi-final with Swatragh that year, the Dawson were underdogs. The Davitts had  titles to their name and after a staggering  in succession, they were chasing another five-in-a-row. “We beat them, it was a big scalp,” Maura points out. “They were high and flying and werent expecting it...and to be fair, neither were we.” The result was just the tonic. Katie McAuley scored three goals in an enthralling - to - win. Once Castledawson got their noses in front, they battened down the hatches at the back. It was time to stand up. “We threw everything into the back line to keep them out,” Maura remembers. “You couldnt let that Swatragh team near the goals or theyd have opened you up.” It was a seismic step forward, one to foster belief. Though, thats where their title hopes ended. In the decider, Lavey ran out - to - winners on the way to four titles inside six years. Castledawson just couldnt find their semi-final form and reach the same heights. “As they say, you have to lose a final to win one” offers Maura. The following year, Castledawson werent in the reckoning, yet didnt disappear from the pecking order. In  they ed for another crack at the title. It was their time. *** Paddy Henry senior was taken too soon. Maura McAuley still remembers her sister Uacutenas phone call. It was Saturday, August , , just two years after managing Castledawson to championship glory, and down the line filtered the tragic news that Paddy passed away. “It was awful at the time,” Maura said. “It was such a short time after us winning the championship and although he wasnt with usthat year, well never forget him for what he did. Katie, Uacutena and Maura McAuley pictured with Paddy Henry senior during the celebrations “He was brilliant and was able to get the best out of everybody,” said Maura of Paddys greatest strength. She remembers after weekends when theyd have been in Dublin socialising, their manager always struck a balance to get his charges back on track for the next challenge. “Hes justsaid Ill run the drink out of you and he knew what to do to get you going and it worked,” Maura added. “Others may have taken a dferent approach, but Paddy just had that way with him.” With the experience of having coached football teams around the club, mixed with his infectious personality made him the perfect leader for their ever-improving camogie side. Without the endless array of team meetings that has crept into sport now, Paddy still managed to leave no stone unturned. His son Paddy junior, who won an Ulster minor medal with Lavey the previous season, and Bridie Totten came on board as part of the management. “Young Paddy would have been working with Claireon puck-outs. He was handy with the hurl and hed be firing shots in at her and working with the free-takers,” Maura points out. The two other Henry boys - Christopher and Peter - were also part of the back-room team, who would later help Paddy junior get Castledawsons underage hurling teams get their foot on the ladder.

The plans for the site, which is located at  Clooney Road, on a plot between Waterfoot Park and the Waterfoot Hotel, were first submittedto the councils planning department in . The original proposal was to build six houses and six apartments on the land. A number of residents in the surrounding area lodged objections to the plans. In November , a report by one of Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning officers recommended that the planning application for the properties on the land be refused. googletag.cmd.push Also in November , the owner of the site submitted a new proposal seeking planning permission to build six houses on the land, instead of the houses and the apartments. A total of  objections to the housing plans were received by the council. Its planning department has now recommended that planning permission for the new houses also be refused. However, the final decision on the matter rests with councillors on the councils Planning Committee. The application for the Clooney Road site is scheduled to be discussed at a meeting of the Planning Committee tomorrow. At the meeting, a planning officer will explain to councillors why they believe that planning permission for the houses should be refused. googletag.cmd.push Councillors can then either decide to go with the planning departments recommendation to refuse, or instead grant planning permission for the development. In a report on the planning application for the houses, a planning officer said the layout of the proposed housing does not respect the character of the area and adversely impacts existing residential amenity. The report adds: “It has not been demonstrated that the layout has appropriately taken into account the existing trees and vegetation within the site and its boundaries and will impact protected TPOtrees. “There are adverse impacts on the existing amenity of residents in Waterfoot Park in terms of dominance, overbearing and loss of light.     “The access road to serve the development will also impact on mature trees within the site as will the retaining wall at the northern boundary. “The road, turning head and parking are heavily engineered and the proposal is considered over development of the site,” the report adds.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

These developments are crucial to allow our local economy to continue to grow while also creating additional jobs for local people in Mid Ulster. “Mid Ulster has the fastest growing population of any of the  council areas and with that growth comes demand for housing.

The Food Waste Action Challenge this week has guided households through some simple steps to reduce the amount of food going into their brown caddy. It will save them money in the short term and have multiple benefits for the environment in the longer term. Each day, Derry City and Strabane District Councils social media accountswill be posting a range of simple hacks and tips to help reduce their food waste. Advice ranges from home freezing tips to ‘compl-eating’: meals using items many people dispose of with the help of local chef Sean Harrigan of The Sooty Olive restaurant. googletag.cmd.push Waste and Recycling Officer at Derry City and Strabane District Council, Julie Hannaway, hopes the week will encourage everyone to be more conscious of the volume of food they dispose of. “A third of all the food we buy is wasted - thats over % of whats in your shopping basket ending up in the bin and a lot of unnecessary household spending. We are asking people to be more mindful when preparing meals, thinking about appropriate portion sizes per person and we’ll be promoting videos on using up leftovers and canned food in your cupboards to make delicious meals.” Ms Hannaway concluded: Lots of people dont realise it’s safe to freeze food right up to the use-by date and then defrost in the fridge when you want it.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Acknowledging that his departure from the Brandywell  months ago was far from amicable, McClean looks back at his two spells at the club with no shortage of regret. After  appearances under Kenny Shiels in , the Creggan manto Derry City under Declan Devine in , but reoccurring injury problems, amongst other things, saw him play just  more games before leaving to join Glentoran. googletag.cmd.push McClean is enjoying a new lease of le at the Glens, but in the short time since he left the Brandywell, he believes he has done a lot of growing up. “Since I left Derry I’ve become a father, I’m playing football regularly now, I’m injury free and I couldn’t be happier,” he said. “I think whenever I signed back with Derry that was just me trying to prove a point from whenever I was there before. I was thinking ‘I’m back at Derry and I’m going to do this and do that’, but it just didn’t happen. From then to now I’ve matured a lot and I look at things dferently and how I live my le as well, and I would say I’m a much better person.” googletag.cmd.push McClean, still just , looks back at his time with Derry, knowing he would do a lot of things dferentlyhe had the chance. “I do have regrets on how I left things with certain people because I was very, very bitter,” he acknowledged. “Whenever Derry got beat I was finding that amusing even though that’s my hometown club. I was looking forward to them getting beat just because of my own bitterness. I have brushed all of that aside now, I’m happier, I’m in a better place and I wish Derry City all the best and I hope they have a good season.”     McClean has had spells at Derry City, Waterford and Sligo Rovers but he seems happiest at his current club Glentoran, with whom he won the Irish Cup last season. He recently celebrated his th appearance with the club and is much, much happier now that his injury problems are behind him. “From a personal point of view, I’m a lot happier,” he added. “From the minute I walked through the doors at Glentoran, it has literally been a big family. Everyone is pulling in the right direction and it’s unbelievable to be a part of and I couldn’t be happier. “When I was at Derry City, there were a lot of things going on outside football. I had an injury and things between me and the club weren’t going well, so it was best to part ways. “I just want to play football and be happy. I’m not looking at anything . I’m playing football, taking each game as it comes and as long as I’m happy and I’m providing for my child, then that’s the main thing.”  Future Whilst more than happy at the Oval at present, McClean still has a long career ahead of him, and he admits he would not rule out ato Derry City, and making things right at the Brandywell at the third time of asking. “I would never rule it out,” he said. “I pissed it down the drain, the two times I was there. That’s the bottom line. I blamed everyone , but it was my own faults that caused me to leave. I would never rule it out. I love Derry, I’ve supported Derry all my le, and it’s something I wouldn’t say no to. At the moment though I’m just focused on Glentoran and where we’re going.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A council delegation is also seeking a meeting with bank officials.Mr Hazzard described the proposed closure in the teeth of a global pandemic as ldquothe wrong decision at the worst possible time, with serious consequences for local customers and staff.He said: ldquoBank of Ireland has attempted to justy this announcement based on a fall in branch visits over the past  months. This is hardly surprising given the entire population has had its movements signicantly restricted inresponse to a public health emergency.ldquoIn reality, the bank is using Covid- for cover, punishing customers for following public health regulations. This is not just a cynical move, but a slap in the face that will hurt customers, staff and communities. This knee-jerk reaction will leave vulnerable customers without access to essential services.The MP said Sinn Fein supported the call from the Financial Services Union for a moratorium on branch closures until the end of , once the pandemic has ended.South Down MLA Colin McGrath said the Bank of Ireland has been a ldquopillar in the financial institutions of Downpatrick for a generation.ldquoIt is a sad facet of modern le that banking is no longer a face-to-face task like it once was, he continued. ldquoLarger banks are having to adjust their business models as a result of this but it is taking away from our high streets and that is sad.He confirmed that the SDLP Assembly team is liaising with Bank of Ireland to ensure that there is minimal disruption to customers and ldquocredible alternatives in place for those that wish to stay with the bank.Jim Wells MLA said South Down had lost half of its bank branches in the past  years, warning thatthe present trend continues, the constituency will be a ldquobank free zone within the next decade.He said the decision to shut the Downpatrick branch was not a shock as Bank of Ireland had already closed branches in Kilkeel and Rathfriland, describing the trend as ldquo extremely worrying.Downpatrick councillors Oonagh Hanlon, Gareth Sharvin, Dermot Curran and John Trainor have also criticised the planned closure of the Downpatrick branch.Cllr Hanlon accused Bank of Ireland of making a ldquoknee-jerk reaction that cannot be justied with many local businesses and families in Downpatrick left in a very vulnerable position because of this ldquocruel decision. She has urged the bank to reverse its closure decision immediately and commit to a moratorium on closures until the pandemic ends.Cllr Sharvin mdash who proposed the emergency motion at Monday nightrsquos council meeting mdash called on bank officials to urgently clary how they will support customers and workers.ldquoThis move will undoubtedly leave vulnerable and elderly customers without access to essential services. It is also highly disappointing that there appears to have been very little local consultation or stakeholder engagement on this decision, he added.Cllr Trainor said that over recent years there has been a migration of business away from city and town centres to the internet, followed by the collapse of trade in traditional retail centres as a result of the Covid pandemic.Cllr Curran said he was concerned that Bank of Irelandrsquos move leaves Downpatrick with just three banks which will impact on customers and the business community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3March2021-Clampdown.jpg","title":"Clampdown on visitors  ","story":"POLICE are being urged to clampdown on all non-essential travel across the district after tourist attractions and beauty spots were swamped with thousands of visitors last weekend.Despite the continued circulation of the deadly coronavirus, people made the most of the warm weather, swarming to Newcastle, Murlough, Tollymore and Castlewellan forest parks, Delamont Country Park outside Killyleagh, the Quoile River in Downpatrick and beaches and villages dotted along the Lecale coastline.One image of a packed Newcastle Main Street last Sunday posted on social media has shocked local politicians who say people need to continue to exercise social distancing as the virus has not gone away.Mournes councillors Laura Devlin and Willie Clarke have expressed concern about the huge increase in visitors to the district, many of whom are not adhering to public health advice.They insist that there is no room for complacency at this crucial time and have warned that failure to comply with public health advice places others at risk, despite the decrease in new coronavirus cases locally and continued roll out of a comprehensive vaccination programme.Cllr Devlin confirmed that she is so concerned at what happened that she has urged police to deploy additional resources to the Newcastle area in particular, admitting that this would be a ldquodrastic measure to enforce the public health message.She has warned that what happened last Sunday at popular beauty spots and destinations across the district has the potential to destroy local efforts over the winter months to curtail the virus.ldquoThe scenes in Newcastle last weekend had to be seen to be believed, she declared.ldquoWe remain in lockdown and people should only be out and aboutitrsquos deemed essential, or for specic reasons.ldquoI wrote to the First and Deputy First Ministers in the New Year asking that a travel restrictions be implemented, but the  mile from home limit is advisory, not enforceable.ldquoWe are all entitled to our exercise and fresh air and itrsquos vital that we avail of it butwe arrive somewhere and itrsquos too busy, the onus is on us to go somewhere . I have total sympathy for those living right in the thick of this as for many they are prisoners in their own homes.Cllr Devlin confirmed that she has spoken with police asking for additional officers to be deployed to Newcastle, pointing to the need for checkpoints along busy routes.ldquoI think that that the extra visibility of police would make a dference. Whilst this sounds drastic, the scenes from last Sunday have the potential to destroy much of our local efforts over the winter.ldquoWe are hopeful to be near the end of this lockdown and want it to be our last. However, last weekendrsquos scenes are deeply worrying. We know the beauty of our area and depend upon tourism, but not now. Now is not the time.Cllr Devlin said she fears that with the weather improving, the current situation is going to get worse, but hopes that as the vaccination programme continues to roll out, people will feel that bit more secure and safe in their locality.ldquoI would encourage everyone to avail of the opportunity to have the vaccine to protect themselves and others in the community to help us all to get to a better place. It is also important to continue adhering to public health advice, she said.Cllr Clarke raised his concerns about the huge influx of visitors with senior Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials, pointing to recent problems in Newcastle and surrounding areas, including the Bloody Bridge, Murlough beach, Keel Point and Tollymore forest park.ldquoIn recent weeks we have seen a signicant rise in visitors to Newcastle and the growing concern of the community is that many people are too relaxed when it comes to adhering to guidelines on social distancing and face masks, he said.ldquoI have emphasised that there needs to be better co-ordination between police, local council and the Department for Infrastructure. The provision of cones helped deter illegal parking last weekend at the Trassey Road and Bloody Bridge but some of the cones were removed by police. The cones need to be provided all year round.Cllr Clarke confirmed that he has asked the council chief executive, Mrs Marie Ward, to ensure that police are stopping all non-essential travel and are monitoring the districtrsquos tourism hotspots.He added: ldquoI am working with a local landowner at the Bloody Bridge and the local council to potentially provide additional car parking spaces at this popular attraction.ldquoThe lack of compliance to health advice not only puts others at risk, but frontline hospitality staff, retail workers and the community.ldquoLocal residents have made major sacrices to reduce the spread of Covid  across the community and we need to ensure visitors exercise social distancing, wash their hands and wear masks while visiting for essential travel..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3March2021-Daisy.jpg","title":"Daisy Lodge helping families during Covid  ","story":"FOR families living with cancer or mourning the loss of a loved one to the disease, the fact that Daisy Lodge is running at half its normal capacity still makes it a sanctuary ndash especially through the pandemic.Run by the Cancer Fund for Children, the centre on Newcastlersquos Bryansford Road provides short therapeutic breaks for families.The chance of getting a whf of sea air, a walk along the beach and a view of the stunning Mournes is something that all families appreciate. When itrsquos combined with the care and attention that Daisy Lodge gives to them, it means a rare spell of respite in whatrsquos a truly challenging period in their lives.Normally welcoming just over  families through its doors each year, Daisy Lodge resumed breaks last July after having to suspend breaks from mid-March last year due to the spread of Covid-.Resident Services Manager Raphael OrsquoConnor says that while the centre has had a reduced capacity, his staff of  have ensured that familiesrsquo experience are more intensely therapeutic for each short break.He knows that the  families who have been stayed at Daisy Lodge since last summer have really needed and appreciated the break.ldquoWe are dealing with extremely vulnerable client group, children and parents with cancer. Because of their cancer treatment have extremely low immunity, they would be viewed as high risk during normal times, said Raphael, who is a nurse by profession.ldquoWith the Covid- situation, families have felt extremely vulnerable and having a short break here has been a lesaver for a lot of families.He said that the decision to close last March was ldquogutting to him and his staff, but realised that it was based on current advice and policy.Staff were furloughed for four months, although online and digital support was offered to families and the charityrsquos community services team still worked with families in hospitals and at home.However, knowing how valued the breaks were to families, Raphael and his team did a major online consultation with the Department of Health, its board and families to assess the attitude to a re-opening. The response was that % of families were willing to take a short break at Daisy Lodge.ldquoWhat became clear was because of the high need our families were in at that time, getting the break was essential, particularly for families with someone in a palliative condition. While we are not a hospice, families needed somewhere to come to spend those last few weeks to be together, said Raphael.However, before they opened their doors to two families per week in July, Raphaelrsquos team had major work to do.He explained: ldquoWe had to redraft our entire Covid procedure for hygiene, PPE, the donning and doffing of these, temperature checks with a digital thermometer, etc.ldquoOur protocols had to be of a standard comparable to a hospital ward. Overnight we had to become very clinical, which is something we had moved away from as Daisy Lodge was to be an experience away from the hospital ward.One family memberrsquos feedback comment illustrates what the break meant to them.The Covid- pandemic has made navigating le with a cancer diagnosis extremely dficult. Our quality of le is already compromised and the fear of contracting the virus has forced us all into isolation, they said.ldquoDuring our stay in Daisy Lodge we felt confident that we could relax and be together knowing that everything was being done to ensure our comfort and safety. It felt like a refuge, a safe-haven.Raphael remarked: ldquoWe know we are making a huge dferent to the lives of these families and that despite Covid, they have been able to come here and enjoy themselves and forget about it.ldquoWe exist for families with cancer and kids with cancer, we wouldnrsquot be doing this workwe didnrsquot feel passionate about it.ldquoWe know the magic that this place gives families. They leave us walking on air, feeling rejuvenated, feeling that they can cope with whatrsquos ahead. We know we help them on their journey and the feeling that we couldnrsquot do that during the first lockdown, yes, we were all disappointed.The charity was funded by over pound, from the Executive in July in recognition of the role it provides and the impact that the lockdown had on its finances. It requires pound.m per year to provide its services to families across Northern Ireland.Raphael added: ldquoWe plan to continue to aim for this target despite the challenges of Covid- and the impact this has had on fundraising. We have confidence in our dedicated fundraising team but rely now more than ever on the support of the wider community across Northern Ireland.He says he is proud of his team who have risen to every challenge during the last year.ldquoI have a very resilient and diligent group of staff who they go above and beyond for families. Itrsquos the best team I have ever worked with and they deliver time and time again for families, despite all the new changes and new procedures. They retrained, they adapted quickly and our cleaning regime is now second to none.The remaining issue for Raphael is how to deal with the many families who still require a short break.ldquoWe are on the back foot going forward as we know we have a backlog of families needing breaks. When restrictions ease and we are back delivering five or six families a week, we are going to have a greater demand than ever.To find out how to donate to the charity, visit www.cancerfundforchildren donate..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3March2021-Eimear.jpg","title":"Eimear and Gavin nominated for prestigious volunteer accolade  ","story":"TWO local GAA members are in the running for a major volunteering accolade.Eimear Murray, from Loughinisland, and Gavin OrsquoShea, from Ardglass, have been nominated for the Translinkrsquos Young GAA Volunteer of the Year Award.Seven other members of Down clubs have been dominated for the award, which celebrates the outstanding contribution made by young members of the GAA to their clubs and communities throughout the challenges of the Covid- pandemic.Eimear Murray was appointed secretary of Loughinisland GAC last November.In nominating Eimear for the award, the club said: ldquoIt is a huge responsibility and workload in a committee especially at such a young age.

While friends with John and Junior, Alan said he was also proud to have known their father very well.ldquoTo say that Jim was an acknowledged engineering genius is no overstatement, he continued.ldquoJim told me that he served his apprenticeship at Stewartrsquos Motor Works in Downpatrick before World War Two and thought the world of James Stewart whom he referred to as lsquogolden handsrsquo because he could turn his hand to anything.ldquoJim then worked for the former Ulster Transport Authority during the war and opened his Antrim Road Garage in Ballynahinch in late  which he purchased with a loan from a family friend.Alan also revealed that Jim and his son John sponsored him when he used to race cars.He continued: ldquoOnce Jim, or JN as he was known, started to help me with mechanical development, I quickly moved from being a back marker to a front runner in no amount of time. Jim always said that % of winning was done in the workshop before the race meetings.ldquoJim was very much a self-made man with an independent pattern of thought and kept his motorcycling hobby quite separate from his business interests, Alan explained.ldquoWhile he preferred not to align himself with any dealership other than David Brown Tractors, for whom he did development work and sold numerous new and second-hand tractors, he steadfastly refused to repair road going motorcycles.Alan revealed that it was Jimrsquos love of motorcycles and an interest in tuning and modying British machines, a process later adopted by manufacturers like BSA, Norton and Triumph in the s that earned him a much-envied reputation.He said James was ldquoalways extremely modest about his dramatic successes as he was happy developing innovation after innovation in his own workshop.ldquoJim was certainly well ahead of his time when explaining in simple terms that engines had to be enabled to breathe easily to make them perform better, Alan explained.ldquoHis new thinking about breathing, valve and camshaft design, carbureation and compression ratios brought phenomenal output at , rpm from an ordinary production BSA machine when the company was the worldrsquos biggest motorcycle producers in the mid-s, long before the surge of Japanese two-strokes.Many years later, Alan said he still finds it hard to understand that Jim Brown was given motorcycles by leading manufacturers with an instruction to keep them winning at world class level, which is exactly what he did.He also revealed that a lot of Jimrsquos ideas were incorporated into the BSA cc Victor machine that Jeff Smith used to win the motocross world championship in  and .Alan revealed that in earlier years, Jim provided Irish champion road-racer Wilfie Herron with a race-bike, as he did for Ian McGregor, Campbell Gorman and Tom Herron.ldquoHailed as a wizard, he personally tailored the BSA bikes which brought Mervyn McConkey so much success on grass tracks and motocross events throughout Ireland, he continued.The Crossgar man said that when Jim lost interest in the motorcycle industry because of its domination by Japanese-built machines, he turned to Cosworth, who employed him as a consultant.ldquoJim became great friends with Keith Duckworth, the English mechanical engineer famous for designing the Cosworth double four valve cylinder engine and cylinder head, and was also great friends with Sir Frank Williams and Sir Patrick Head from the Williams Formula One team, said Alan.ldquoThrough my friendship with Jim and his we Minnie and their sons John and Junior, I met some wonderful people. Jim was great friends with the Rev Harold Good who latter became the Moderator of the Methodist Church in Ireland, while I helped the Brown family run motorsport events in the Martin and McCormickrsquos quarries in the eighties in aid of the Ballynahinch Methodist Church building fund.Mr Brown passed away in  with a huge number of mourners making their way to Ballynahinchrsquos Lough Inch cemetery, including leading names from the world of motorsport including Frank Williams, Patrick Head and Keith Duckworth.ldquoI will always remember Jim as a great innovative, pioneering engineer who was fired by his own initiative.

That injury would ultimately force him out of the club at the end of the - season after  games.The following year he ed home to Northern Ireland, going on to coach Coleraine. In fact on one occasion, owing to so many injuries in the Bannsidersrsquo team, he even made a playing appearance.A descendant of Joersquos, Peter Toner, who now lives in Cumbria in England, said Joersquos achievements were a source of great pride to his family.ldquoI had a telephone conversation with his late son Gerard [who passed away in ], who was immensely proud of his fatherrsquos footballing prowess, Peter said.ldquoHe claimed that Joe excelled in any position on the pitch.

He came to Perth from Woolwich Arsenal, having already been capped for his country ndash which was Ireland.ldquoA tricky, pocket-sized left winger, he had an unfortunate start to his Muirton career.

However, only the female species of buckthorn exists in Northern Ireland and so concerns of this taking over are exaggerated and unfounded.Cllr Brown said the area containing the buckthorn proposed to be grazed is a natural habitat for many hedgehogs and badgers which will be disrupted and possibly displaced by the proposed grazing.He also said residents are concerned about badger baiting in the area which they fear will be made easier when sets are exposed due to the removal of natural grasses.ldquoThere are also issues around property disputes and Cllr Enright and I feel strongly that Newry, Mourne and Down Council should not be erecting fences until ownership of the property has been established, continued Cllr Brown.He added: ldquoMoreover, the money being spent on this scheme would be much better used to protect the dune-front from erosion using the same beach restoration strategies deployed in Ballyhornan. We would suggest this is a much better use of ratepayerrsquos money and urge DAERA and the council to utilise these other beach restoration strategies instead.Cllr Enright argued that grazing cattle will cause ldquosevere degradation of natural dunes which far outweighs the minimal risk from any invasive species, suggesting that the current proposals will severely impact on the coastal landscape.ldquoPermitting grazing at the seafront facing part of the dunes will only accelerate the massive loss of dunes due to unprotected footfall from thousands of people every year, as has been seen at sites such as Ballyhornan, he contended.ldquoIt is vital that Lyme, sand scutch and marram grasses that form the dunes are protected from footfall as they donrsquot regrow after the second or third time their underground growing tips are walked upon.Cllr Enright said that while there is a need to enclose parts of the dunes to combat erosion caused by human footfall and littering, he and Cllr Brown question the decision to use barbed wire given the large number of children and animals that visit the area.He added: ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council should provide visitors with clear messaging around what parts of the beach they can walk on,andwire has to be used, it should be sheep wire..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3March2021-Ciara.jpg","title":"Portaferry’s Ciara set to miss out on Euros  ","story":"PORTAFERRYrsquoS Ciara Mageean has withdrawn from the Ireland team to take part in the European Indoor Athletics Championships, which begin tomorrow in Poland.In a shock announcement, Mageean said she was taking the decision after recent ldquosetbacks.The -year old has struggled in her two most recent indoor races in Germany and England.ldquoI am just not where I want to be in order to compete in the European Indoor Champs and do myself and the Irish vest justice, she said.Mageean won the bronze medal in the m at the last European Championships in Glasgow two years ago.She said she had decided to opt out of the championships following consultations with her Manchester-based coach Steve Vernon.She said she felt the decision was the right one in order to best prepare for the summer ahead.

True to his word, he informed me right away, sayingPeter Scudamore could do it, so could he.The race saw  of the  entries go to post, with Frankie making the early running. With three fences to go, the leader was Dave Anthony, ridden by John Bright, with Brian Hamilton chasing on John Turleyrsquos Friendless Friend.Anthony then crashed out and Hamilton was unseated from Fearless Friend, leaving Frankie on Killinick Robyn to win from Darragh Cross owner Judith OrsquoGradyrsquos Another Partner, ridden by James Lamb, with Raymond Martinrsquos Kasperova and Paul Parkin third.The best horses that Frankie rode over the years were Jim Gloverrsquos Hopersquos Choice, trained by his father and namesake, Frankie Sr.Frankie Sr also owned and trained young Frankiersquos first winner under rules, Bright Trick, in a Hunterrsquos Chase at Downpatrick in .One of his most notable winners was Joe Rearsquos Palo. Trained by Peter McCreery, it was the result of a big gamble the day that Frankie rode it to success at Navan.His reward that day from Joe, renowned as Downpatrickrsquos ldquobusy draper, was a new suit. I believe he still wears it on special occasions.The following week at Johnnie Grantrsquos Ramble Inn at Ballykilbeg, Frankie threw a big party for all his friends in the sport. I was lucky enough to be invited and it was a great night. Former amateur and top local funny man Terence McKeag was acting as MC. Frankie took to the stage to play the guitar and sing.Thankfully, Frankie has not been lost to the sport as he is now an officer at point-to-points, as well as being the inspector of courses. He is also a qualied steward at meetings north and south.Also at Tyrella in  there was a local winner in the two-winner race with Moving Statue, trained at Banbridge by Leo Young and ridden by Alfie Evans winning for Dromara owner David Hanna.The six-year old geldings race saw Ian Buchanan ride his own Some Day Soon to success and the Douglas and Cromie Maiden race was won by Mrs Stuart Catherwoodrsquos Bad Boy, ridden by Paddy Graffin.In the open race, Pyral, owned and trained by Moirarsquos Therese OrsquoNeill, and ridden by Graeme Martin proved to be too good for the hot favourite Mill Park Bay, ridden by Pat Kelly.At the Warwick meeting on Friday, Downpatrick jockey Caoilin Quinn recorded his first success for an outside stable when he won the racingtv Conditional Jockeys Handicap Hurdle on the   favourite Eaton Miller, trained by R Potter.Despite the fact that the race was for conditional jockeys, Caoilin was again listed on the card as a Mr. He had been a professional at this stage since early-January.This is something that does not make sense as, at present, amateur riders are unable to compete and sadly will not be able to do so at the Cheltenham Festival.They have always been a big feature of the action there, with so many Irish riders involved. Top riders like Patrick Mullins, Derek OrsquoConnor, Noel McParlan, Jamie Codd, and Barry OrsquoNeil are as effective as any professional.They are working with horses every day of the week, so it is a big disappointment for them and many others.Congratulations to Cumbria- based Downpatrick jockey Danny McMenamin on riding his th career winner. He led   shot Archie Brown at the recent Market Rasen meeting.At present, Danny leads the conditional jockeys title race on  winners. He is five ahead of Cork-born Bryan Carver. He started off in pony racing and is based with Nicky Richards, as was Anthony Dobbin..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/12387721.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have been pressing the government to deal with this absurdity. This progress is good news for those impacted but there needs to be more,” she said.Mrs Foster added: “The temporary fix by the government shows they are listening, and aware of the problems being created by the Protocol, but short-term fixes are not enough. Northern Ireland needs permanent solutions, and the protocol needs to be replaced.   \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Whilst we may be permitted to bring plants with soil attached into NI from GB, we are not actually permitted under the current lockdown to be open to sell them”.Ulster Unionist MLA Rosemary Barton welcomed the delay to a ban she described as “one of the most ludicrous outworkings” of the NI Protocol.The party’s spokeswoman on agriculture said: “Today’s news that the UK Government has acted and taken what it describes as ‘temporary, practical arrangements’... will be well received by our local horticultural industry.“Further, the permitting of the movement of plants grown in containers with soil attached from authorised businesses in GB to Northern Ireland, will enable the GB businesses to trade again and the Northern Ireland businesses to stock up for the spring.” The EU is taking legal action, accusing the UK of breaching the protocol. But, writing in Saturday’s News Letter, the NI Secretary Brandon Lewis says the UK acted due to the EU’s “leisurely approach” to protocol problems.Although Prime Minster Boris Johnson promised the unfettered flow of goods from GB to Northern Ireland, that has not been the case to date.While most agri-food goods are currently, or soon will be, subject to extra regulatory procedures to enter Northern Ireland under the terms of the protocol, some have been banned altogether.The list of prohibited goods includes plants or vegetables potted in British soil, or with traces of soil still attached to them. Critics of EU bureaucracy have slammed the protocol stipulations as excessive and disproportionate.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

We know that that will also depend, to some extent, on the presence of the new iant.ldquoI think a cautious approach where we introduce the lowest risk children back to school first, [and] evaluate the impact of that - that will teach us a great deal.

We started getting lots more people approach us, and wersquore now in a great position. Itrsquos been surprising.A host of top DJs including Miaszmafrom Florida, and Austrian duo Divisionand Seculahave signed up to the label, and Incurzion has grown exponentially in Florida, Austria, Germany and Russia.But strangely, Mr King says, he doesnrsquot think the label is known about by many people in Penarth.ldquoI feel wersquore starting to get rewards now for the way wersquove tried to really stand out in what is a saturated market, he said. ldquoWe feel wersquove done that by trying to offer a dferent sound and brand.ldquoOur style is deep and dark drum and bass, dark branding and graphic design ndash almost like horror.ldquoBut most of all itrsquos about bringing on board top quality musicians, and thatrsquos what wersquove managed to do.ldquoItrsquos been a massive shock to see how much interest our music is getting from Florida since Miaszma signed.

Itrsquos quite unbelievable for a small town to have such a big connection, and I think it needs to be celebrated more.As lockdown hit last March, so did all of Incurzionrsquos events, which kept Mr King busy every week.He believes musicians have been ignored throughout the pandemic, which he worries may have caused a mental health crisis in the industry.ldquoAs live events go wersquove been absolutely decimated, he said. ldquoThe financial impact of that on venues and on companies like ours, as well as inidual musicians, has been unbelievable.ldquoBut fortunately for us our digital sales have been through the roof. That might be because people have more time on their hands at home to explore dferent genres, and itrsquos great they feel they want to purchase our music.ldquoBut the major thing for this industry is the live events, wersquore nothing without those, just like every other label and performer.ldquoThe funding has been awful, and the impact this will have on mental health seems largely ignored.ldquoThis is what we do every single week, and to have that stripped away from you for so long is dficult. Itrsquos also our place to network, so to not have that space will have long-term ramications.ldquoI know venues in Cardf that have had next to no support, andit carries on you canrsquot see how theyrsquod survive.With cases going down by the week, he hopes the music industry will be able to start up just in time for those venues and for musicians.ldquoWersquore obviously very eager to get back to le as it was, and to pick up where we left off.To find out more about Penarthrsquos Incurzion Audio, visit https:www.incurzionaudio Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
