The Royal Wedding hits and misses by LIZ JONESThere were no real clangers on the big day. No outrageous hats from Eugenie and Beatrice. No outrageous bottoms threatening to eclipse the bride. There were only two slight faux pas: Amal Clooney threatened to outshine the sun, and the mother of the bride wore mint while the Queen chose lime: almost, almost a colour clash.On the whole, the female guests – particularly the Royals – had put in time and effort to get it right, and had clearly been poring over the springsummer catwalk photos to make sure they were all bang on trend. Hence, there was lots of asymmetric tailoring on show, so much so many assumed Windsor had been built on a hill. The HITS              Pippa Middleton in a £495 print by British label The Fold. Thank the Lord the pleats hide her bottom            Her Majesty was elegant in a Stewart Parvin dress and coat, with Angela Kelly hat             The Duchess of Cornwall in an ice-pink silk Anna Valentine coatdress with flared sleeves            Princess Michael of Kent\u0027s outfit is a bit salmony but she doesn\u0027t look show-offy at allThere was also a riot of hot colours and pastels, and enough florals to fill the stands next week at Chelsea. The length of skirts proved problematical: either a tad too short, a la Eugenie and Joss Stone, or midi length, which looks great on teenage supermodels but a little droopy drawers on normal women.Not too many gloves on show: the Duchess of York, a surprise hit on the day, was a rare fan, with a short navy pair, and the Queen, of course, wore hers.Hats were all proper structures, and not half-baked fascinators. And, thank the Lord, on such a hot day there were plenty of pretty open shoes displaying toe cleavage: not possible if the ceremony had taken place in a cathedral.Heels, though, were as high as the sun in the sky.Rumour has it slippers were handed out later for those who could no longer teeter after yet another glass of champagne             Amal Clooney chose a marigold dress by Stella McCartney with a bow at the back and a train            Singer Joss Stone sported shorter hair and swapped her hippy look for a girly print            Carole Middleton looks very elegant in Princess Diana\u0027s favourite atelier Catherine Walker            Pastel Stella McCartney for Oprah Winfrey, with a Philip Treacy turkey and pheasant feather hat            Countess of Wessex wears ice-blue satin by London couturier Suzannah and hat by Jane Taylor            Meghan\u0027s Suits co-star Gina Torres in a very elegant floral tea dress by Costarellos            Fergie was a picture of elegance on Saturday as she paired a navy skirt suit with a Jess Collet hat and towering heelsThe MISSES            Sofia Wellesley, James Blunt\u0027s wife, is in new season Valentino.

Its musicians have toured and recorded with groups including Take That, Girls Aloud and Sir Elton John.Their set list included My Girl by the Temptations Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I\u0027m Yours by Stevie Wonder Marvin Gaye\u0027s How Sweet It Is and Ain\u0027t No Mountain High Enough Soul Man by Sam and Dave and Knock On Wood by Eddie Floyd.The reception went on into the early hours, with music and cheering heard as far away as Windsor\u0027s Long Walk. Even as the clock struck midnight, guests could be heard singing along enthusiastically to Respect by Aretha Franklin, and Dancing In The Street by Martha and the Vandellas.The newlyweds\u0027 first dance is believed to have followed a similar theme, with Harry and Meghan eschewing a slow song for the 1966 hit Land Of A Thousand Dances by American soul singer Wilson Pickett (not, as has been reported elsewhere, Whitney Houston\u0027s I Wanna Dance With Somebody).The final coaches departed Frogmore House around 3.30am, with insiders reporting that George Clooney was among the last to stagger off the dancefloor, having earlier shown off his moves alongside actor Tom Hardy. Bleary-eyed revellers were offered bacon or sausage sandwiches for the journey home.A select few were then invited to the late-night party which reportedly took place at celebrity haunt Chiltern Firehouse in Marylebone, followed by a private party in a sound-proofed home in Chelsea.

A fresh-faced Serena Williams was one of the few to make it down to breakfast.Rugby player Will Greenwood left with his wife Caroline around 9.40am, followed by Meghan\u0027s Suits co-star Patrick Adams and his children, who left for a flight to LA.Earl Spencer, Harry\u0027s uncle, was spotted at Cliveden House – where the bride stayed the night before the wedding – enjoying Bloody Marys with his family yesterday afternoon. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/05/4C6D7D2100000578-5751779-image-a-58_1526878184151.jpg","title":"Newlyweds Harry Meghan return royal duty fairytale wedding","story":"  Meghan Markle reportedly didn\u0027t talk to her father, Thomas Markle, on her wedding day.

Meghan is the first mixed-race member of the royal family in an extraordinary journey for a girl born in LA to a white father and African-American mother who fought her way through the tough world of showbusiness to land a plum role in the TV series Suits.Harry and Meghan\u0027s big day couldn\u0027t have been more different than royal weddings of the past, especially because the prince was visibly emotional throughout - and guests suggested it was the most erse major event in the Queen\u0027s 66-year reign.The prince had looked tearful when he saw his bride for the first time, grabbing her hand telling her: \u0027You look amazing - I missed you\u0027 before tenderly lifting her veil.The new Duke of Sussex also said \u0027thank you, pa\u0027 after his father Prince Charles walked the now Duchess of Sussex down the aisle of St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor, having stepped in at the last moment for Meghan\u0027s father Thomas.           Harry looked very emotional at points in the service and several others in the congregation were in tears on their happy day          Harry and Meghan hold hands as they walk out of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding ceremony          A sea of smiling faces greets Harry and Meghan as they leave the church after the American-influenced service conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury          Laughter: One of the well-wishers in the crowds makes Meghan laugh and Prince Harry smile as they continue with their 25-minute tour of the royal market town Meghan Markle told wedding guests: \u0027I\u0027ve found my prince\u0027 in an emotional speech after her ecstatic new husband said the support of his \u0027far better half\u0027 meant he could finally be \u0027me\u0027, it was revealed today.The new Duchess of Sussex also thanked the Queen, Prince Charles and other senior royals for welcoming her so warmly to the royal family \u0027firm\u0027.The bride, resplendent in a white evening gown by Stella McCartney, took to the microphone after a private evening dinner thrown by Prince Charles at Frogmore House.  Meghan\u0027s short speech was yet another part of her modernising mini-revolution of the royal family because royal brides usually leave it to the groom to address guests.The 36-year-old, who wore an aquamarine ring which belonged to Harry\u0027s mother beloved mother Princess Diana, ended her short address by declaring her deep love for Harry and said: \u0027I have found my prince\u0027, according to the Daily Mirror.Before she spoke Harry said his wife, brother, father and friends \u0027are the people that make \u0027me\u0027, me, in my Harry life\u0027 before adding: \u0027Now I\u0027m going to hand over to my far better half\u0027.Earlier he is also believed to have told his bride: \u0027I can\u0027t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.\u0027     One source described how Meghan also expressed her gratitude at how welcoming the prince had been to both herself and her mother, Doria Ragland. \u0027She has been so touched by how welcoming the Prince of Wales has been. So is her mother,\u0027 the source said. \u0027Honestly, they are touched beyond belief. It was important to her to make a point of thanking him publicly, although, of course, he knows privately how she feels.\u0027Another source said: \u0027It is often said that he always wanted a daughter and I think he has been really moved by how well they have got on. There is definitely a special connection there. Meghan\u0027s mother means more to her than anything, so it was lovely to see the way he was so welcoming to Doria too.\u0027          Meghan and Harry looked like movie stars after they changed for the evening reception at Frogmore House          Harry and Meghan travelled in a Jaguar converted to electric power, which had a numberplate with Saturday\u0027s datePrince Harry and Prince William have a laugh waiting for MeghanChelsy Davy appears deep in thought as she waits for royal weddingPrince Harry sheds a tear at the altar before marrying Meghan MarkleMan punches pregnant deaf woman and her service dogMan accused of \u0027hitting\u0027 service dog gets attacked by ownerThreat of thunderstorms for the South over Bank Holiday weekendPrince Harry waves at African orphan he bonded with 14 years agoKendrick Lamar stops white fan from rapping because she said n-wordFred the Labraduck carries his nine adopted ducklings on his backBarclays warn of the fraud risks from oversharing informationProperty tycoon\u0027s estranged wife lives in small room in his mansionThe Queen leads the Royal Family for visit to Chelsea Flower ShowPrince Charles had also paid tribute to his \u0027darling old Harry\u0027 in an emotional speech that is said to have left the 600 guests, including Hollywood stars, in tears.Speaking at the afternoon reception at St George\u0027s Hall in Windsor Castle shortly after they married he Charles told of how moving it was to watch youngest son  get married.Charles, who walked Meghan to the altar, finishing by saying: \u0027My darling old Harry, I\u0027m so happy for you.\u0027Harry, 33, is also said to have given an \u0027off the cuff\u0027 speech about how happy he was.He is also said to have turned to his guests and asked: \u0027Can anyone play the piano\u0027 – before Sir Elton John played a medley of Your Song, Tiny Dancer, Circle Of Life and I\u0027m Still Standing.Harry also said Meghan had \u0027navigated everything with such grace\u0027, adding: \u0027We make such a great team\u0027. According to the Sunday Times. Wedding guest Peter Fearnhead, co-founder of African Parks, told the Sunday Telegraph: \u0027When Harry and Meghan came in they stood on the podium and Prince William introduced them.\u0027Prince Charles made a really gracious speech, it was amazingly endearing. He\u0027s got a wonderfully dry sense of humour. Prince Harry was charming about Meghan, they are so clearly in love. We all had a tear in our eye.\u0027 Later he whisked his bride away in an open-top Jaguar to head for a star-studded, champagne-fuelled, black-tie reception for the bride and groom at the opulent Frogmore House in Windsor Great Park on Saturday night.The newlyweds were cheered wildly as they took to the floor with the funky soul classic Land of a Thousand Dances for their first dance at the spectacular royal wedding reception.Comedian James Corden is reported to have launched a dance routine with Harry, his brother William and his father Charles, apparently refereeing a \u0027dance-off\u0027, while George Clooney danced with both Meghan and Kate. After a very modern take on the traditional royal wedding, the late-night revelry followed suit – and those fortunate enough to bag a place on the ultra-exclusive guest list were treated to a night of risque speeches, wild dancing and plenty of stodge to soak up the alcohol.  George and Amal Clooney were the among the huge stars to celebrate with Harry and Meghan with George dancing with the bride and Kate   From left: Priyanka Chopra, Serena Williams and Jessica Mulroney show off the dresses they wore to the royal wedding party          Revellers watch the fireworks display over George III\u0027s former stately where the reception of Harry and Meghan took placeChelsy Davy appears deep in thought as she waits for royal weddingPrince Harry and Prince William have a laugh waiting for MeghanPrince Harry sheds a tear at the altar before marrying Meghan MarkleMan accused of \u0027hitting\u0027 service dog gets attacked by ownerMan punches pregnant deaf woman and her service dogThreat of thunderstorms for the South over Bank Holiday weekendPrince Harry waves at African orphan he bonded with 14 years agoKendrick Lamar stops white fan from rapping because she said n-wordFred the Labraduck carries his nine adopted ducklings on his backBarclays warn of the fraud risks from oversharing informationProperty tycoon\u0027s estranged wife lives in small room in his mansionThe Queen leads the Royal Family for visit to Chelsea Flower ShowExclusive details from inside the evening celebrations reveal that guests – including George and Amal Clooney, Sir Elton John and David Furnish and more glitzy actresses than an Oscars after-party – spent the evening sipping bespoke cocktails, tucking into \u0027dirty burgers\u0027 and candyfloss from outdoor stalls and dancing to a trendy DJ.It was, insiders say, \u0027the party to end all parties\u0027, with a carnival atmosphere in the grounds of the 230-year-old stately home, which once belonged to George III.  Record viewing figures made Harry and Meghan’s wedding the TV event of the year so far.It was watched by a peak of 13.1million just after 1pm on BBC1, making it the biggest peak figure so far in 2018, the broadcaster said. ITV’s coverage peaked at 3.6million.The combined average audience for BBC and ITV was around 11million. But this was lower than the figure for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding in 2011, which had a combined audience of 17.6million – although this included people watching on catch-up. Charles and Diana’s wedding was watched by more than 28million in 1981.Saturday’s FA Cup Final averaged 6.7million viewers and peaked at 8.7million on BBC1. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/09/4C6B70BB00000578-5752413-image-m-23_1526890066091.jpg","title":"Doria Ragland NOT filming interview Oprah Winfrey","story":"Doria Ragland is not planning to film an interview with Oprah Winfrey, it emerged today  It is said Oprah was invited to the wedding as a friend of the couple, a royal source saidThink pink like Oprah in a Stella McCartney midi dressShop the current line here!Achieving best-dressed guest status is no easy feat when you\u0026#39re attending the most anticipated wedding of the year, but we think Oprah Winfrey might be a strong contender for the title!The talk show host donned a custom Stella McCartney midi dress for Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s big day, topping off her look with a bespoke Philip Treacy concertina lace hat with a feather plume.

Dotted throughout the gardens to entertain the guests were outdoor games, including a giant chessboard, fairground performers and stalls offering late-night snacks – from burger and ice cream vans to candy floss kiosks and bars stocked with several types of expensive whisky.Bespoke cocktails were flowing from a \u0027round the world\u0027 bar, whose top offering was the \u0027When Harry Met Meghan\u0027, combining rum and ginger beer – a cheeky nod to the colour of the groom\u0027s hair.Musical entertainment came from DJ Sam Totolee, a celebrity favourite who has previously played at the weddings of both Pippa Middleton and Rod Stewart, and Uma Thurman\u0027s engagement party.Harry is said to have danced \u0027furiously\u0027 to the DJ\u0027s set – which included the controversial drug-themed hit I Took A Pill In Ibiza – at Pippa\u0027s wedding last May, and had put him under strict instructions to \u0027avoid cheese\u0027 and stick to trendy house music and R\u0026ampB.          Harry looked very emotional at points in the service and several others in the congregation were in tears on their happy day         Harry and Meghan exchanged vows and then rings as the couple married after a whirlwind romance               Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland, who the star calls her rock, was in tears ahead of her daughter\u0027s big entrance         Meghan walked halfway through the church before being met Prince Charles at the Quire who took her to Harry         Meghan walks down the aisle in St George\u0027s Chapel at the start of the royal wedding ceremony in Windsor         Meghan, wearing her bridal veil, smiles at her groom Prince Harry as she arrives at the wedding ceremony in Windsor              Meghan smiles broadly during her wedding to Prince Harry at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor         The Archbishop of Canterbury smiles as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle stand at the altar at St George\u0027s Chapel         Harry and Meghan hold hands as they walk out of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding ceremony       Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland (far left) stands next to Prince Charles, Camilla, George, William, Charlotte and Kate on the steps of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding         The train of Meghan\u0027s dress trails down the aisle as she and Prince Harry stand in front of Archbishop Justin WelbyAt one point later in the evening, British actor Idris Elba – who has DJ\u0027d in some of the world\u0027s top clubs – apparently took over for a brief turn on the decks. But that didn\u0027t stop Meghan from making her own musical requests, and she is believed to have been behind the list of Sixties soul songs that were played by covers band Atlantic Soul Orchestra, which calls itself \u0027the country\u0027s hardest-hitting and most authentic soul band\u0027. Its musicians have toured and recorded with groups including Take That, Girls Aloud and Sir Elton John.Their set list included My Girl by the Temptations Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I\u0027m Yours by Stevie Wonder Marvin Gaye\u0027s How Sweet It Is and Ain\u0027t No Mountain High Enough Soul Man by Sam and Dave and Knock On Wood by Eddie Floyd.The reception went on into the early hours, with music and cheering heard as far away as Windsor\u0027s Long Walk. Even as the clock struck midnight, guests could be heard singing along enthusiastically to Respect by Aretha Franklin, and Dancing In The Street by Martha and the Vandellas.The newlyweds\u0027 first dance is believed to have followed a similar theme, with Harry and Meghan eschewing a slow song for the 1966 hit Land Of A Thousand Dances by American soul singer Wilson Pickett (not, as has been reported elsewhere, Whitney Houston\u0027s I Wanna Dance With Somebody).The final coaches departed Frogmore House around 3.30am, with insiders reporting that George Clooney was among the last to stagger off the dancefloor, having earlier shown off his moves alongside actor Tom Hardy. Bleary-eyed revellers were offered bacon or sausage sandwiches for the journey home.A select few were then invited to the late-night party which reportedly took place at celebrity haunt Chiltern Firehouse in Marylebone, followed by a private party in a sound-proofed home in Chelsea. It is not known if the bride or groom accompanied them.Yesterday morning, though the newlyweds – who spent the night at Windsor Castle – were nowhere to be seen, several of the guests appeared rather the worse for wear.A weary looking James Corden was seen checking out of Coworth Park with his wife at 8am, while Jessica Mulroney did not emerge from her £600-a-night room before lunchtime. A fresh-faced Serena Williams was one of the few to make it down to breakfast.Rugby player Will Greenwood left with his wife Caroline around 9.40am, followed by Meghan\u0027s Suits co-star Patrick Adams and his children, who left for a flight to LA.Earl Spencer, Harry\u0027s uncle, was spotted at Cliveden House – where the bride stayed the night before the wedding – enjoying Bloody Marys with his family yesterday afternoon. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle¿s fun-filled wedding reception featured a royal dance-off and boozy \u0027beer pong\u0027 gamesGeorge Clooney danced with Meghan then Kate but Fergie turned him down: Exclusive details from party of the year - Mirror Online"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/14/4C7E0FA500000578-5752699-image-m-12_1526907643960.jpg","title":"Massive sinkhole suddenly opens swallowing three cars Chinese construction site","story":"    Three cars that parked near a construction site are dragged into a sinkhole in east China          The road collapses and opens a 10-foot-deep hole and swallows three vehicles instantlyHorrifying moment girl dangerously balances on a window...End of the birth-control policy: China \u0027plans to abolish all...Baby nearly drowns after his swimming ring flips, leaving...China starts its bid to land the FIRST spacecraft on the...Share this articleAccording to China Central Television, the sinkhole took place at Lin\u0027an district in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province at early hours on May 20.Three vehicles including a black SUV, a white car and a white minivan, fell into a hole where  a massive drainage pipe to be installed in a trench.Nearby residents told Tianqi. com that there were drainage pipe installation works being carried out at the site.Some believed the frequent rain around the region has soften the soil around the construction site and caused the road to collapse.

You couldn’t have scripted a more perfect day, though of course, that’s probably exactly what you didWhat’s the point in being a professional actress if you can’t turn in an Oscar-winning performance for the biggest role of your life?I loved it all.Well, apart from David Beckham chewing gum in the chapel, obviously. Such grotesque and disrespectful impertinence in front of the Queen would have cost him his head during previous monarchies, and I’m not entirely sure it shouldn’t now.It would be impossible to see all the ecstatic headlines about Saturday\u0027s wedding and not get slightly carried away with one’s own sense of self-worthEven your dimwit cannabis farmer nephew Tyler being caught with a knife at a London nightclub in the early hours of Sunday morning couldn’t force your beaming grin off today’s front pages.But there was one banner headline that screamed a rather different message, and one that will have sent a shudder through many a Palace courtier’s spine.‘MEGHAN MARKLE TO FIGHT FOR FEMINISM,’ said the Daily Telegraph, Britain’s most loyal royal paper.Oh-oh.I read on:‘The newly-wed Duchess of Sussex has been given the blessing of the Palace to use her position to fight for feminism as she plans for her life as the newest member of the Royal family.’The official Royal Family website appears to confirm this, highlighting your belief that you are ‘proud to be a woman and feminist.’It adds: ‘From a young age, The Duchess had a keen awareness of social issues. Aged 11, she successfully campaigned for a company to alter their television advert that had used sexist language to sell washing-up liquid. These early experiences helped to shape her lifelong commitment to causes such as social justice and women’s empowerment.’          The official Royal Family website now highlights your belief that you are ‘proud to be a woman and feminist’ in your bioHarry and Meghan look deeply in love as they reveal their...Is this the best photo from the royal wedding? Twitter...Behind the scenes at Meghan and Harry\u0027s \u0027magical wedding\u0027:...Share this articleI remember discussing that very subject with you when we met for a drink in my local Kensington pub during the week you first met Harry.You told me how you wrote to Hillary Clinton demanding she take action and how thrilled you were when the offending advertising agency, Procter and Gamble, changed the commercial’s tagline which said ‘Women all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans’ to now say ‘people’ not ‘women’.‘I’ve always wanted to make a difference,’ you said, as you sipped your dirty martini. ‘My parents always told me if I believed something was wrong to try to fix it.’There was no doubting your genuine passion for this mission statement.I saw it in your eyes that night and I read it in your words when we corresponded with one another.A few months earlier, I’d emailed you after a mass shooting killed eight students at the Umpqua Community College in Oregon.‘What is it with your nation and guns?’ I asked. ‘Why does nobody ever want to do anything?’‘Shameful, I know,’ you replied. ‘It’s so deeply controversial and brings up so many other issues race relations, religious intolerances, etc – so since we can’t solve each of those in one fell swoop, the logical solution would be to have stricter gun laws. And there is resistance. Even by the sheriff in that same little Oregon town. I’m not sure how you sleep at night with that over your head unless you fall into Trump’s school of thought that it’s not the guns but the mental illness. So then why give mentally ill people access to buy guns? Legally? It’s just staggering. I wish more people would make a stand about it.’I was impressed by such an articulate and thoughtful response about a cause very close to my heart.Ironically, the day before your wedding, there was another horrific school shooting in Santa Fey that killed ten more students.This prompted the New York Daily News to scream: ‘They do royal weddings. We do schoolkids’ funerals.’I’m sure you would have liked to comment on that massacre, as you used to comment on many such news stories on your now deleted Twitter account.But of course, now you’re a royal, you can’t.Or rather, you can – but all hell would break loose.‘Meghan whacks Trump over guns’ is simply not a headline anyone at the Palace can ALLOW you to create.And therein lies the biggest problem facing you in your new life every sinew in your newly regal body will be shaking with enthusiasm to tell the world how you feel about vitally important issues like gun control.Yet you will very quickly discover, if indeed you haven’t already, that it’s impossible to go political as a member of the Royal Family.          You have been so outspoken in the past, but you will very quickly discover, if indeed you haven’t already, that it’s impossible to go political as a member of the Royal FamilyAnd that brings me back to your intention to ‘fight for feminism.’On the face of it, this seems a perfectly rational objective for an intelligent, independent, successful woman who in many ways personifies the very ideals of feminism.But I can guarantee you three things if you start poking this bear too loudly:1) The Palace machine, still heavily under the influence of the senior royals, will get very twitchy very quickly – just as they did with Princess Diana.2) That twitchy machine will begin to brief the media with anonymous voices expressing ‘concern’ at your activism.3) The British public, fuelled by the negative media coverage, will soon start thinking, ‘Oh stick a cork in it, Meghan, for goodness sake.’This may all seem horribly unfair to you, but in truth, it’s not.The Royal Family has survived this long precisely because it doesn’t do politics.The Queen has reigned for more than 60 years but nobody has a clue what she thinks about anything.  Remember Meghan, the Queen has reigned for more than 60 years but nobody has a clue what she thinks about anything. Same with her mother. And when Prince Charles does weigh in, he\u0027s ridiculedHer late mother, the Queen Mother, was equally taciturn, once famously articulating this perfect recipe for remaining beloved by the people: ‘Never complain, never explain and rarely be heard speaking in public.’Now, it’s true that Prince Charles regularly fires off angry letters to politicians about issues, but it’s also true that he gets roundly ridiculed for it.And while William and Harry have talked a lot about mental health in recent years, they’ve always been very careful to be non-political in their campaigning.They chose mental health because it affects everyone and is therefore not an issue determined by wealth or privilege.The Princes can’t be called ‘hypocrites’ for saying we should all take mental health more seriously.Your chosen causes of feminism and equality are very different matters.Let’s be honest: there’s nothing remotely feminist or equal about being a Duchess and living in a gigantic Palace.You can’t preach about everyone getting a fair shake when you yourself are getting the most prestigious, privileged and unequal shake imaginable, simply for getting married, to a man.Suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst didn’t fight for your right to wear a tiara to state dinners or have your liveried servants heat your cashmere water bottle at night.So tread carefully, Meghan.          Tread carefully. You\u0027re now riding a tremendous wave of excitement and optimism because you looked fabulous , didn’t put a foot wrong, and married a very popular Prince, but that well of goodwill can dry up fastAt the moment, you’re riding a tremendous wave of excitement and optimism.But that’s because you looked fabulous on your wedding day, didn’t put a foot wrong, and married a very popular Prince.If you now start lecturing us all on equality, while your servants fluff your gold monogrammed pillows and your chauffeur warms up the fleet of vintage Rolls Royces, that well of goodwill may dry up faster than David Beckham’s gum wherever he stuck it in the chapel.And I can assure you that Season 2 of your new life will be a hundred times harder as a result.Don’t be too disheartened though.There is no better feminist role model for you than the Queen who has spent a lifetime keeping her opinions to herself yet is the most respected woman alive.Proof that when it comes to royals and politics, less is more.Kind regards, Piers."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/15/4C79868F00000578-5753667-image-a-9_1526912381432.jpg","title":"Turkeys President Erdogan calls Europes Muslims support him","story":"    Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan speaks during an election campaign rally of his Justice and Development Party (AK Party) in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, on SundayThe presidential and parliamentary polls on June 24 will see Turkey switch to a powerful, executive presidential system that was narrowly approved in a referendum last year.Erdogan sees himself as a \u0027protector of Muslims in former Ottoman dominions,\u0027  Janusz Bugajski, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) told the Stockholm Center for Freedom.    \u0027As European Turks you have always supported us by a wide margin. Now we need your support again in the elections on June 24,\u0027 Erdogan told a rally in a Sarejevo sports hall, where supporters waved Turkish and Bosnian flags.Ahead of the 2017 referendum, ministers travelled to countries with big Turkish communities -- including Germany and the Netherlands -- to urge support for the change, but were stopped from campaigning by authorities citing security fears.Erdogan nevertheless said last month he was expecting to hold a campaign rally in a European city.          Some 15,000 supporters gathered to attend the AKP\u0027s rally ahead of the 24 June snap elections in Turkey          About three million Turks living abroad are eligible to vote in the election\u0027At a time when renowned European countries claiming to be the cradle of civilisation failed, Bosnia and Herzegovina showed by allowing us to gather here that it is a real democracy not a so-called one,\u0027 he told the crowd.Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who heads a right-wing coalition opposed to Turkey joining the European Union, said last month Erdogan would be barred from \u0027trying to exploit\u0027 Europe\u0027s Turkish communities.Germany, home to about 3 million people of Turkish origin, says it will not allow foreign politicians to campaign on its territory ahead of elections.Earlier in the day, Erdogan pledged a multi-billion euro investment in a motorway connecting Belgrade and Sarajevo.Thousands of Turks came from Germany, the Netherlands and Austria, and from across the Balkans for the rally.\u0027Turkey is our mother nation,\u0027 said Coskun Celiloglu, a Macedonian student of Turkish descent. \u0027We came to Sarajevo just for one day to support our saviour Erdogan.\u0027The most popular -- and isive -- politician in recent Turkish history, Erdogan has ruled for 15 years, overseeing a period of rapid economic growth. But a widespread crackdown against his opponents has led rights groups and Western allies of the NATO member to voice concerns about Turkey\u0027s record on civil rights and Erdogan\u0027s growing authoritarianism.On Saturday, Turkey\u0027s state-run Anadolu agency reported there had been tip-offs about a potential assassination attempt against Erdogan while he visits the Balkans.Asked about the report, Erdogan said: \u0027This news reached me and indeed that is why I am here ... Such threats and operations cannot deter us from this path.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/14/4C807C8600000578-0-image-m-25_1526910118740.jpg","title":"Driver caught eating takeaway meal wheel cyclist catches up","story":"    A driver was seen on camera eating while in the driver\u0027s seat, as a furious cyclist approached him after a close passGesturing to the driver, the cyclist says: \u0027You, that close.

Experts said last night the rest of the gap may be down to entrenched disadvantage in some regions.Sir Peter Lampl, founder of the Sutton Trust, a social mobility charity, said: ‘These figures paint a worrying picture of a consistent and pervasive regional ide in access to university.‘Talent isn’t dependent on where you grow up, so it’s just not right that your chances of studying certain subjects at university are. We have to do more to widen opportunities for talented teenagers in areas like the North East to access our best universities.’          Universities are still seeing many more people from affluent areas than poorer communities despite claims higher education is for everyone. Schools facing problems in deprived areas are not as able to produce children ready for higher education, it is claimedThe data shows the largest regional gaps in admissions were in subjects which lead to high-earning careers. In business and administration, 12,645 places went to Londoners, compared with 1,445 to those from the North East. And in mathematical sciences, 1,520 places went to Londoners, compared with 190 to those from the North East.The figures come amid continued debate about a North-South ide, with concerns raised about opportunities for young people living in parts of the North of England.          A huge 1,585 medicine and dentistry university places went to Londoners or 24 per cent of admissions while only 245 places or 4 per cent were filled by those from the North EastGeoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the figures ‘reflect a familiar and deeply concerning pattern’.He added: ‘Schools in disadvantaged areas frequently face extremely challenging circumstances, struggling to recruit and retain teachers and leaders. These areas and their schools need more targeted support. Their young people need to believe they can succeed.’The Department for Education said: ‘Universities should be open for everyone with the talent and potential, regardless of their background or where they live. More people than ever before are going to university and entry rates for 18-year-olds from the North East increased by 26 per cent between 2010 and 2017.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/14/4C80E55100000578-0-image-m-10_1526910801534.jpg","title":"Meghans sister calls morally religiously right thing reunite family","story":"    Samantha Markle (pictured left) has claimed Meghan should \u0027do the morally and religiously right thing\u0027 by inviting her into her lifeSamantha called on the Duchess of Sussex to \u0027do the morally and religiously right thing\u0027, adding that their separation should \u0027ride on her conscience\u0027.\u0027I watched the bishop talk about love and unity and forgiveness and I hoped it would strike a chord within Meghan.\u0027I feel a religious and moral obligation to be open to her and not be vindictive or isolating or hurt.Harry and Meghan look deeply in love as they reveal their...Meghan\u0027s snubbed sister Samantha Markle accuses her mother...Share this article\u0027This should ride on her conscience as a moral obligation to at some point communicate with me and be united rather than ided – as that was the whole message.Samantha cashed in Meghan\u0027s wedding by watching her half-sister wed from her home in Florida - alongside a television crew in a paid-for appearance.Her partner Mark Phillips, 60, suggested the appearance was earning her a five-figure sum.Samantha Markle appeared on TV repeatedly ahead of her half-sister\u0027s wedding despite not seeing her for years\u0027You can\u0027t go in there,\u0027 he said outside his home. \u0027She is making big money with an exclusive TV interview.\u0027Samantha also took the chance to lash out at the crown, insisting their family dramas were far greater than the Markle\u0027s.\u0027Well the royals had generations of scandal in their own family.\u0027You\u0027ve got inbreeding, you\u0027ve got substance abuse, you\u0027ve got alcohol abuse, you\u0027ve got infidelity.\u0027She also attacked the royal family for their decision not to give her father a coat of arms - unlike the other fathers of commoners who marry into royalty.Samantha\u0027s offer to build bridges with the Duchess is a huge U-turn for the wheelchair-bound Markle.She also claimed Meghan\u0027s mum Doria Ragland \u0027hogged the limelight\u0027 at her daughter\u0027s wedding.           Samantha made a number of controversial statements in the weeks leading up to the wedding          The Duchess of Sussex\u0027s half-sister also claimed Doria Ragland, the bride\u0027s mother, had \u0027hogged the limelight\u0027 at the ceremony          Samantha Markle appeared on Loose Women and Good Morning Britain in the weeks before Harry and Meghan tied the knot  Ready to broadcast: A satellite truck was parked outside Samantha\u0027s Floridia house during the weddingShe has been accused of cashing in on her half-sister\u0027s fame by writing a book about her entitled The Diary of Princess Pushy\u0027s Sister.She added Meghan has made her feel as if her family is not worthy by \u0027excluding\u0027 them, suggesting this was against the tenets of her baptismal vows.She added if Meghan has been in the Queen\u0027s church she should practice what she preaches.She also revealed Meghan\u0027s father Thomas, 73, who two weeks ago suffered a heart attack is now being secretly cared for in LA.He is reportedly taking blood thinners.She called on Prince Harry to fly Thomas over once he is back to full health in order that he is able to fulfill his lifelong dream of visiting Buckingham Palace. Meghan Markle\u0027s sister pleads for her to reunite troubled family and jet shamed dad over for Buckingham Palace visit"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/13/4C784C7700000578-0-image-m-12_1526906461724.jpg","title":"Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich told prove wealth legitimate","story":"Roman Abramovich will have to prove his wealth is legitimate after Whitehall launched a war on oligarchsRoman Abramovich will have to prove his wealth is legitimate after Whitehall launched a war on oligarchs.The billionaire Russian owner of Chelsea football club is effectively banned from Britain until he can show his money is clean.Other super-rich oligarchs in Britain also face being caught up in the clampdown on foreign cash deemed ‘not conducive to public good’.It follows months of tensions between the UK and Russia in the wake of the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury.The Government blamed Russia for the attack, with Theresa May describing the incident as ‘despicable’ and expelling a number of Russian diplomats.Last night Britain’s tough stance on foreign money sparked a furious backlash from the Kremlin.

Mr Abramovich was one of his early supporters, recommending him for the top Kremlin job to Boris Yeltsin when the ailing leader was looking for a successor.According to the late oligarch Boris Berezovsky in evidence to the High Court in London, Mr Abramovich enjoyed significant political influence in Moscow in the second half of the 1990s.In October 1999, he attended Mr Putin’s birthday party. Soon afterwards, Mr Abramovich allegedly bought Mr Putin, then the prime minister, a $50million (£37million) yacht. ‘The request came from Mr Putin,’ Mr Berezovsky said in evidence.In 2003, Mr Abramovich bought Chelsea for £60million. Two years later, he was involved in a much larger transaction when he sold his oil company, Sibneft, to state-run Gazprom. He got $13billion (£10billion).He began spending time in London, where he owns a 15-bedroom Victorian mansion on ‘Billionaire’s Row’ in Kensington, bought in 2009 for a reported £97million and now worth at least £150million.

You would never catch her expressing an opinion in public — but she has her own way of making her views clear.So it is perhaps no coincidence that the Queen saw fit to confer upon Meghan Markle the title of Duchess of Sussex on the occasion of her marriage to Prince Harry.After all, there is no better county in Britain more suited to this most politically correct of new royals.It plays host to Brighton and Lewes, spiritual homes to those members of the liberal intelligentsia for whom Hampstead and Islington have become a trifle too reactionary.So what better title to confer on the couple who have just staged the most ‘woke’ wedding in royal history.For those unfamiliar with this fashionable expression, ‘woke’ denotes a person whose sensibilities are perfectly attuned to the modern way of thinking. That is to say, someone who is rigorously respectful of iniduals’ life choices and cultural traditions, scrupulously virtuous in both thoughts and deed — and who sees each new day as an opportunity to spread the gospel of inclusivity and ersity.It’s fair to say that the Royal Family has never been terribly ‘woke’.InjusticeSound asleep and snoring loudly might be a better way to describe their general attitude to political correctness, especially in the Duke of Edinburgh’s case.But Meghan and Harry are here to change all that, and their wedding was only the beginning.Less than 24 hours after saying her wedding vows, a biography of the Duchess of Sussex was put up on the royal website, underlining the selfless nature of her existence and her burning desire to oppose injustice in all its forms.Above all, it cites her ‘keen awareness of social issues’ and tells us she is ‘proud to be a woman and a feminist’.It also speaks of her ‘lifelong commitment’ to ‘social justice and women’s empowerment’.These are all deep preoccupations in the mind of the new duchess, the website informs us.But then we kind of knew that already, did we not? After all, Meghan and Harry seem to have spent the entire period of their engagement proselytising on such right-on issues.          Britain\u0027s Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, center, in Windsor Castle surrounded by their little loved ones.

And there was the request that instead of wedding gifts, donations could be given — among other worthy recipients — to a charity that empowers women in urban slums.Meghan and Harry’s big day was, as much as anything, an exercise in making sure the entire world knew exactly how much they cared about everyone as well as each other.The ultimate royal wedding souvenir... for sale on eBay:...\u0027Do the right thing, Meghan\u0027: Royal bride\u0027s sister calls on...Share this articleEverything about it was scrupulously politically correct, from the hand- embroidered flowers on her veil (representing all 53 countries of the Commonwealth) and the choice of a non-polluting electric battery-powered car (albeit worth a very uninclusive £350,000) in which Harry drove them to the after-party at Frogmore House, to the dress itself, a £200,000 creation designed by the first British woman to head a Paris couture house.Even the flowers were locally sourced. As if that weren’t enough, Meghan took herself down the aisle (an audacious look-at-me move which is apparently a feminist triumph), succumbing only briefly to tradition to take Prince Charles’s arm — though note that he was not ‘giving her away’ — and wrote and delivered her own speech at the reception.But perhaps the strongest statement of all was the people in St George’s Chapel, the guests and performers.The American preacher Michael Curry who, with his iPad and Episcopal passion, blew away the cobwebs the brilliant young cellist, Sheku Kanneh-Mason, who held us all spellbound during the signing of the register the wonderful Kingdom Choir gospel ensemble, led by Karen Gibson.          An official photograph released by Kensington Palace shows Meghan and Harry surrounded by their loved ones, including the Queen and Prince Philip AdmireNot to mention all the representatives from various charities espoused by the royal couple.And then the celebrities, there for their roles as charity do-gooders as much as their glamour: David Beckham, Oprah Winfrey, Elton John, Amal Clooney. Everywhere you looked, a festival of ersity and inclusivity, not a note out of place. It was perfect.Almost too perfect, some might say.Because for all the gushing tributes, there was something just a little ostentatious about all the sincerity.Don’t misunderstand me: I think that Harry and Meghan make a wonderful couple, and I am sure they will bring nothing but benefit to the Royal Family. And I admire their commitment to doing good in the world.But sometimes one gets the sense that they are ever-so-slightly just a little bit pleased with themselves, a little too keen to convey their selfless dedication to those less fortunate than they are.To be fair, this is a common affliction of the modern age.The days when royals such as Princess Anne just went off quietly and got on with their charity work without really mentioning it to anyone apart from the odd horse are, sadly, long gone.And it is hard to imagine a future monarch behaving like the Queen, full of warmth and generosity towards her subjects, yet at the same time able to maintain that all-important mystique that still surrounds the monarchy and makes it so compelling.For all the positives of Harry and Meghan’s all-star union, this is my one worry. That in seeking to show the world what a wonderfully modern couple they are, they will unintentionally undermine the institution of monarchy — and risk turning the whole thing into a circus of virtue-signalling.And the problem with that is that it becomes less about the people they wish to help, less about the causes and issues that Meghan is so passionate about — and all about them.Already with the wedding, I couldn’t help feeling that there was a sense that it was as much engineered to cast the couple in a certain beatific light as it was to honour those involved.There is no question that, as royal weddings go, this broke all the moulds in terms of overcoming barriers of class and race.          Feminist and activist Meghan Markle will not stop her charitable work when she begins royal duties, she confirmedElitistAt the same time, though, it also felt strangely elitist, as though they were simply replacing one exclusive club — the aristocracy — with another, Hollywood celebrity.The trick to any kind of modernisation is being able successfully to blend the old with the new without alienating either.To understand how and when to respect certain traditions and not to be subversive just for the sake of it.There is a lot about the Royal Family that remains sacred to the people of Britain, however irrational that can sometimes seem.Let us rejoice at the evolution of monarchy but let’s also not turn it into a glorified lifestyle blog for guilt- ridden millennials.It is wonderful that Meghan and Harry have such a shared passion for doing good in the world. And I have no doubt that, together, they will prove to be a great force for change.I just wish they would be a little less #MeToo about it all."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/19/4C8209A300000578-0-image-a-8_1526927832119.jpg","title":"Range Rover driver 37 lands record 172 POINTS licence","story":"    Abdful Ayeghbajeje racked up an astonishing 172 points on his licence on the A127 near Southend after breaking the speed limit 27 times along the road (file photo)Masked gunmen with Kalashnikovs open fire on a group of...Manchester bomber’s brother who is accused of playing \u0027key...Share this articleThey also imposed fines totalling £17,8230 and ordered him to pay nearly £2,500 in costs. They handed him a total of 172 points for the offences which were committed on the A127 near Southend between October last year and January 2018.Investigating officer Roy Keyes, of Essex police\u0027s Casualty Reduction Investigation Team, said: \u0027Ayeghbajeje\u0027s vehicle was registered in Belgium, so initially it was difficult to track him down. \u0027But following some good work and a chance meeting with him during a roads policing operation in Southend, we had all the evidence we needed to bring him to court.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/15/20/4C48B86F00000578-0-image-a-8_1526411585923.jpg","title":"Married man offers door door sperm delivery service 65 children hopes reach 100","story":"    Clive (pictured) has fathered 65 children - with 14 more on the way - and hopes to reach 100The married 62-year-old delivers sperm - his own - to willing recipients free of charge.He happily gives up whole days to drive from his family home in Burton, Staffordshire, to wherever he is needed.On arrival, Clive parks in a nearby street before climbing into the back of his van.There he fills a syringe with his product before clambering out and ringing on the recipient\u0027s doorbell.How \u0027rebel\u0027 doctor who helped 49-year-old patient become...Seventeen British sperm donors father more than 500...Share this articleA tip, he says, is to keep the donation in the crock of your arm so as to keep it warm.He then usually engages his recipient in a few second of idle chit chat before jumping back in his van.Often, he says, they are nervous, and this helps to put them at ease.\u0027I know this is probably unusual but for me, by doing it in the van there is far less involvement, less emotional attachment,\u0027 he says.Since his adventures in donation began he has fathered 65 - with another 14 on their way.

Look, you can see her little face,\u0027 De la Luz said of the scans          Currently the oldest verified mother in the world, Maria Del Carmen Bousada De Lara (pictured) was 66 years and 358 days old when she gave birth to twin baby boys in 2006De la Luz said some of her children were not happy with the news that she was pregnant, saying they told her she was too old for \u0027those things\u0027.She has an appointment with a gynaecologist on July 18 and she said she is expecting to have a caesarean-delivery because of her age.Bousada de Lara previously admitted that she had lied to physicians about her age when seeking in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment at a clinic in California.She then went on to become the world\u0027s oldest documented mother, surpassing the record established in 2005 by Romanian mother Adriana Iliescu, who was also 66. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/05/21/11/wire-3037784-1526898609-303_87x84.jpg","title":"Syria says capital completely secure IS ousted","story":"A Syrian army tank advancing through a street in Hajar al-Aswad in the push against the final ISIS militants in the city          Bombs exploding over rebel-held areas of the city as government forces shell enemy positionsSyria\u0027s war erupted in 2011 with protests against President Bashar al-Assad, including in the capital.The following year, the government began losing control of parts of Damascus and placed a crippling siege around Yarmuk, which lies in the capital\u0027s south.The army\u0027s announcement came hours after a tenuous evacuation deal saw hundreds of IS fighters and their relatives quit Yarmuk, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is not dead as rumors...Syria claims victory in the war on ISIS: Terrorist fighters...Terrorist recruiter\u0027s burka-wearing wife who refused to...Share this articleThe government has denied reaching a deal with IS.

You couldn’t have scripted a more perfect day, though of course, that’s probably exactly what you didWhat’s the point in being a professional actress if you can’t turn in an Oscar-winning performance for the biggest role of your life?I loved it all.Well, apart from David Beckham chewing gum in the chapel, obviously. Such grotesque and disrespectful impertinence in front of the Queen would have cost him his head during previous monarchies, and I’m not entirely sure it shouldn’t now.It would be impossible to see all the ecstatic headlines about Saturday\u0027s wedding and not get slightly carried away with one’s own sense of self-worthEven your dimwit cannabis farmer nephew Tyler being caught with a knife at a London nightclub in the early hours of Sunday morning couldn’t force your beaming grin off today’s front pages.But there was one banner headline that screamed a rather different message, and one that will have sent a shudder through many a Palace courtier’s spine.‘MEGHAN MARKLE TO FIGHT FOR FEMINISM,’ said the Daily Telegraph, Britain’s most loyal royal paper.Oh-oh.I read on:‘The newly-wed Duchess of Sussex has been given the blessing of the Palace to use her position to fight for feminism as she plans for her life as the newest member of the Royal family.’The official Royal Family website appears to confirm this, highlighting your belief that you are ‘proud to be a woman and feminist.’It adds: ‘From a young age, The Duchess had a keen awareness of social issues. Aged 11, she successfully campaigned for a company to alter their television advert that had used sexist language to sell washing-up liquid. These early experiences helped to shape her lifelong commitment to causes such as social justice and women’s empowerment.’          The official Royal Family website now highlights your belief that you are ‘proud to be a woman and feminist’ in your bioHarry and Meghan look deeply in love as they reveal their...Is this the best photo from the royal wedding? Twitter...Behind the scenes at Meghan and Harry\u0027s \u0027magical wedding\u0027:...Share this articleI remember discussing that very subject with you when we met for a drink in my local Kensington pub during the week you first met Harry.You told me how you wrote to Hillary Clinton demanding she take action and how thrilled you were when the offending advertising agency, Procter and Gamble, changed the commercial’s tagline which said ‘Women all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans’ to now say ‘people’ not ‘women’.‘I’ve always wanted to make a difference,’ you said, as you sipped your dirty martini. ‘My parents always told me if I believed something was wrong to try to fix it.’There was no doubting your genuine passion for this mission statement.I saw it in your eyes that night and I read it in your words when we corresponded with one another.A few months earlier, I’d emailed you after a mass shooting killed eight students at the Umpqua Community College in Oregon.‘What is it with your nation and guns?’ I asked. ‘Why does nobody ever want to do anything?’‘Shameful, I know,’ you replied. ‘It’s so deeply controversial and brings up so many other issues race relations, religious intolerances, etc – so since we can’t solve each of those in one fell swoop, the logical solution would be to have stricter gun laws. And there is resistance. Even by the sheriff in that same little Oregon town. I’m not sure how you sleep at night with that over your head unless you fall into Trump’s school of thought that it’s not the guns but the mental illness. So then why give mentally ill people access to buy guns? Legally? It’s just staggering. I wish more people would make a stand about it.’I was impressed by such an articulate and thoughtful response about a cause very close to my heart.Ironically, the day before your wedding, there was another horrific school shooting in Santa Fey that killed ten more students.This prompted the New York Daily News to scream: ‘They do royal weddings. We do schoolkids’ funerals.’I’m sure you would have liked to comment on that massacre, as you used to comment on many such news stories on your now deleted Twitter account.But of course, now you’re a royal, you can’t.Or rather, you can – but all hell would break loose.‘Meghan whacks Trump over guns’ is simply not a headline anyone at the Palace can ALLOW you to create.And therein lies the biggest problem facing you in your new life every sinew in your newly regal body will be shaking with enthusiasm to tell the world how you feel about vitally important issues like gun control.Yet you will very quickly discover, if indeed you haven’t already, that it’s impossible to go political as a member of the Royal Family.          You have been so outspoken in the past, but you will very quickly discover, if indeed you haven’t already, that it’s impossible to go political as a member of the Royal FamilyAnd that brings me back to your intention to ‘fight for feminism.’On the face of it, this seems a perfectly rational objective for an intelligent, independent, successful woman who in many ways personifies the very ideals of feminism.But I can guarantee you three things if you start poking this bear too loudly:1) The Palace machine, still heavily under the influence of the senior royals, will get very twitchy very quickly – just as they did with Princess Diana.2) That twitchy machine will begin to brief the media with anonymous voices expressing ‘concern’ at your activism.3) The British public, fuelled by the negative media coverage, will soon start thinking, ‘Oh stick a cork in it, Meghan, for goodness sake.’This may all seem horribly unfair to you, but in truth, it’s not.The Royal Family has survived this long precisely because it doesn’t do politics.The Queen has reigned for more than 60 years but nobody has a clue what she thinks about anything.  Remember Meghan, the Queen has reigned for more than 60 years but nobody has a clue what she thinks about anything. Same with her mother. And when Prince Charles does weigh in, he\u0027s ridiculedHer late mother, the Queen Mother, was equally taciturn, once famously articulating this perfect recipe for remaining beloved by the people: ‘Never complain, never explain and rarely be heard speaking in public.’Now, it’s true that Prince Charles regularly fires off angry letters to politicians about issues, but it’s also true that he gets roundly ridiculed for it.And while William and Harry have talked a lot about mental health in recent years, they’ve always been very careful to be non-political in their campaigning.They chose mental health because it affects everyone and is therefore not an issue determined by wealth or privilege.The Princes can’t be called ‘hypocrites’ for saying we should all take mental health more seriously.Your chosen causes of feminism and equality are very different matters.Let’s be honest: there’s nothing remotely feminist or equal about being a Duchess and living in a gigantic Palace.You can’t preach about everyone getting a fair shake when you yourself are getting the most prestigious, privileged and unequal shake imaginable, simply for getting married, to a man.Suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst didn’t fight for your right to wear a tiara to state dinners or have your liveried servants heat your cashmere water bottle at night.So tread carefully, Meghan.          Tread carefully. You\u0027re now riding a tremendous wave of excitement and optimism because you looked fabulous , didn’t put a foot wrong, and married a very popular Prince, but that well of goodwill can dry up fastAt the moment, you’re riding a tremendous wave of excitement and optimism.But that’s because you looked fabulous on your wedding day, didn’t put a foot wrong, and married a very popular Prince.If you now start lecturing us all on equality, while your servants fluff your gold monogrammed pillows and your chauffeur warms up the fleet of vintage Rolls Royces, that well of goodwill may dry up faster than David Beckham’s gum wherever he stuck it in the chapel.And I can assure you that Season 2 of your new life will be a hundred times harder as a result.Don’t be too disheartened though.There is no better feminist role model for you than the Queen who has spent a lifetime keeping her opinions to herself yet is the most respected woman alive.Proof that when it comes to royals and politics, less is more.Kind regards, Piers."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/15/4C77614C00000578-5753665-image-a-110_1526913292811.jpg","title":"Harry Meghan plan one night mini moon jet Ireland","story":"    Unlike other newlyweds, Harry and Meghan will not be jetting off on a honeymoon straight away      Be a beautiful bride like Meghan in Clare Waight Keller for GivenchyClare Waight Keller for Givenchy Haute CoutureHead to the Givenchy website herePrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s big day is finally here and we haven\u0026#39t been this excited for a dress since the Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s wedding back in 2011.

Mr Abramovich was one of his early supporters, recommending him for the top Kremlin job to Boris Yeltsin when the ailing leader was looking for a successor.According to the late oligarch Boris Berezovsky in evidence to the High Court in London, Mr Abramovich enjoyed significant political influence in Moscow in the second half of the 1990s.In October 1999, he attended Mr Putin’s birthday party. Soon afterwards, Mr Abramovich allegedly bought Mr Putin, then the prime minister, a $50million (£37million) yacht. ‘The request came from Mr Putin,’ Mr Berezovsky said in evidence.In 2003, Mr Abramovich bought Chelsea for £60million. Two years later, he was involved in a much larger transaction when he sold his oil company, Sibneft, to state-run Gazprom. He got $13billion (£10billion).He began spending time in London, where he owns a 15-bedroom Victorian mansion on ‘Billionaire’s Row’ in Kensington, bought in 2009 for a reported £97million and now worth at least £150million.

You would never catch her expressing an opinion in public — but she has her own way of making her views clear.So it is perhaps no coincidence that the Queen saw fit to confer upon Meghan Markle the title of Duchess of Sussex on the occasion of her marriage to Prince Harry.After all, there is no better county in Britain more suited to this most politically correct of new royals.It plays host to Brighton and Lewes, spiritual homes to those members of the liberal intelligentsia for whom Hampstead and Islington have become a trifle too reactionary.So what better title to confer on the couple who have just staged the most ‘woke’ wedding in royal history.For those unfamiliar with this fashionable expression, ‘woke’ denotes a person whose sensibilities are perfectly attuned to the modern way of thinking. That is to say, someone who is rigorously respectful of iniduals’ life choices and cultural traditions, scrupulously virtuous in both thoughts and deed — and who sees each new day as an opportunity to spread the gospel of inclusivity and ersity.It’s fair to say that the Royal Family has never been terribly ‘woke’.InjusticeSound asleep and snoring loudly might be a better way to describe their general attitude to political correctness, especially in the Duke of Edinburgh’s case.But Meghan and Harry are here to change all that, and their wedding was only the beginning.Less than 24 hours after saying her wedding vows, a biography of the Duchess of Sussex was put up on the royal website, underlining the selfless nature of her existence and her burning desire to oppose injustice in all its forms.Above all, it cites her ‘keen awareness of social issues’ and tells us she is ‘proud to be a woman and a feminist’.It also speaks of her ‘lifelong commitment’ to ‘social justice and women’s empowerment’.These are all deep preoccupations in the mind of the new duchess, the website informs us.But then we kind of knew that already, did we not? After all, Meghan and Harry seem to have spent the entire period of their engagement proselytising on such right-on issues.          Britain\u0027s Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, center, in Windsor Castle surrounded by their little loved ones. (From left back row) Brian Mulroney, Remi Litt, Rylan Litt, Jasper Dyer, Prince George, Ivy Mulroney, John Mulroney front row, Zalie Warren, Princess Charlotte and Florence van Cutsem          Meghan Markle\u0027s official page launched on the Kensington Palace website says she will continue with her charity work And for anyone who had not yet cottoned on to Meghan’s Mission, Saturday’s wedding ceremony will have made it crystal clear.There was the invitation to a former gang leader among 2,000 ‘ordinary’ guests invited to the wedding itself. And there was the request that instead of wedding gifts, donations could be given — among other worthy recipients — to a charity that empowers women in urban slums.Meghan and Harry’s big day was, as much as anything, an exercise in making sure the entire world knew exactly how much they cared about everyone as well as each other.The ultimate royal wedding souvenir... for sale on eBay:...\u0027Do the right thing, Meghan\u0027: Royal bride\u0027s sister calls on...Share this articleEverything about it was scrupulously politically correct, from the hand- embroidered flowers on her veil (representing all 53 countries of the Commonwealth) and the choice of a non-polluting electric battery-powered car (albeit worth a very uninclusive £350,000) in which Harry drove them to the after-party at Frogmore House, to the dress itself, a £200,000 creation designed by the first British woman to head a Paris couture house.Even the flowers were locally sourced. As if that weren’t enough, Meghan took herself down the aisle (an audacious look-at-me move which is apparently a feminist triumph), succumbing only briefly to tradition to take Prince Charles’s arm — though note that he was not ‘giving her away’ — and wrote and delivered her own speech at the reception.But perhaps the strongest statement of all was the people in St George’s Chapel, the guests and performers.The American preacher Michael Curry who, with his iPad and Episcopal passion, blew away the cobwebs the brilliant young cellist, Sheku Kanneh-Mason, who held us all spellbound during the signing of the register the wonderful Kingdom Choir gospel ensemble, led by Karen Gibson.          An official photograph released by Kensington Palace shows Meghan and Harry surrounded by their loved ones, including the Queen and Prince Philip AdmireNot to mention all the representatives from various charities espoused by the royal couple.And then the celebrities, there for their roles as charity do-gooders as much as their glamour: David Beckham, Oprah Winfrey, Elton John, Amal Clooney. Everywhere you looked, a festival of ersity and inclusivity, not a note out of place. It was perfect.Almost too perfect, some might say.Because for all the gushing tributes, there was something just a little ostentatious about all the sincerity.Don’t misunderstand me: I think that Harry and Meghan make a wonderful couple, and I am sure they will bring nothing but benefit to the Royal Family. And I admire their commitment to doing good in the world.But sometimes one gets the sense that they are ever-so-slightly just a little bit pleased with themselves, a little too keen to convey their selfless dedication to those less fortunate than they are.To be fair, this is a common affliction of the modern age.The days when royals such as Princess Anne just went off quietly and got on with their charity work without really mentioning it to anyone apart from the odd horse are, sadly, long gone.And it is hard to imagine a future monarch behaving like the Queen, full of warmth and generosity towards her subjects, yet at the same time able to maintain that all-important mystique that still surrounds the monarchy and makes it so compelling.For all the positives of Harry and Meghan’s all-star union, this is my one worry. That in seeking to show the world what a wonderfully modern couple they are, they will unintentionally undermine the institution of monarchy — and risk turning the whole thing into a circus of virtue-signalling.And the problem with that is that it becomes less about the people they wish to help, less about the causes and issues that Meghan is so passionate about — and all about them.Already with the wedding, I couldn’t help feeling that there was a sense that it was as much engineered to cast the couple in a certain beatific light as it was to honour those involved.There is no question that, as royal weddings go, this broke all the moulds in terms of overcoming barriers of class and race.          Feminist and activist Meghan Markle will not stop her charitable work when she begins royal duties, she confirmedElitistAt the same time, though, it also felt strangely elitist, as though they were simply replacing one exclusive club — the aristocracy — with another, Hollywood celebrity.The trick to any kind of modernisation is being able successfully to blend the old with the new without alienating either.To understand how and when to respect certain traditions and not to be subversive just for the sake of it.There is a lot about the Royal Family that remains sacred to the people of Britain, however irrational that can sometimes seem.Let us rejoice at the evolution of monarchy but let’s also not turn it into a glorified lifestyle blog for guilt- ridden millennials.It is wonderful that Meghan and Harry have such a shared passion for doing good in the world. And I have no doubt that, together, they will prove to be a great force for change.I just wish they would be a little less #MeToo about it all."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/19/4C8209A300000578-0-image-a-8_1526927832119.jpg","title":"Range Rover driver 37 lands record 172 POINTS licence","story":"    Abdful Ayeghbajeje racked up an astonishing 172 points on his licence on the A127 near Southend after breaking the speed limit 27 times along the road (file photo)Masked gunmen with Kalashnikovs open fire on a group of...Manchester bomber’s brother who is accused of playing \u0027key...Share this articleThey also imposed fines totalling £17,8230 and ordered him to pay nearly £2,500 in costs. They handed him a total of 172 points for the offences which were committed on the A127 near Southend between October last year and January 2018.Investigating officer Roy Keyes, of Essex police\u0027s Casualty Reduction Investigation Team, said: \u0027Ayeghbajeje\u0027s vehicle was registered in Belgium, so initially it was difficult to track him down. \u0027But following some good work and a chance meeting with him during a roads policing operation in Southend, we had all the evidence we needed to bring him to court.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/15/20/4C48B86F00000578-0-image-a-8_1526411585923.jpg","title":"Married man offers door door sperm delivery service 65 children hopes reach 100","story":"    Clive (pictured) has fathered 65 children - with 14 more on the way - and hopes to reach 100The married 62-year-old delivers sperm - his own - to willing recipients free of charge.He happily gives up whole days to drive from his family home in Burton, Staffordshire, to wherever he is needed.On arrival, Clive parks in a nearby street before climbing into the back of his van.There he fills a syringe with his product before clambering out and ringing on the recipient\u0027s doorbell.How \u0027rebel\u0027 doctor who helped 49-year-old patient become...Seventeen British sperm donors father more than 500...Share this articleA tip, he says, is to keep the donation in the crock of your arm so as to keep it warm.He then usually engages his recipient in a few second of idle chit chat before jumping back in his van.Often, he says, they are nervous, and this helps to put them at ease.\u0027I know this is probably unusual but for me, by doing it in the van there is far less involvement, less emotional attachment,\u0027 he says.Since his adventures in donation began he has fathered 65 - with another 14 on their way.

Bush lifted some sanctions. But when talks collapsed the Yongbyon cooling tower was quickly rebuilt and the reactor restarted.In the intervening years, with diplomacy going nowhere, North Korea went on to test five more nuclear devices and develop missiles it said was capable of reaching the United States.To experts, North Korea dismantling nuclear site is like destroying evidence - CNN"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de3df45169b92725accd6a9cb93ce479b79cd04b/0_0_2672_3508/master/2672.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c68985f91a9232a9fe8f8802a1f4765 1010w","title":"data big tech eu regulation gdpr","story":"This is the week the EU brings in new regulations to control how organisations can use your data. You might be sick of the re-subscribe emails you’re getting from everyone, but these new rules are aimed at forcing all organisations to gain genuine consent to use your personal information. They introduce concepts such as the “right to be forgotten” into law, and the penalising of those who don’t comply.While certainly not perfect, this is the biggest ever attempt by governments to get to grips with the huge new powers that digital technology hands to big business. Tech corporations are among the richest and most powerful in the world, and governments are struggling to keep up with their ever expanding power. GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is one part of the answer, passed in the face of fierce opposition from big tech.But a big tech fightback is already under way, with corporations looking to use trade deals to preserve and expand their vast global power. And they have an ally in the British trade secretary, Liam Fox, who speaks passionately about the need to erge from EU rules, singling out data rules as a possible area for action. The “e-commerce agenda” – which aims for a “free flow of data” across the globe – is at the cutting edge of trade policy. It was a major item of discussion at last year’s World Trade Organisation summit – where it failed because most developing countries opposed it – and is being included in new trade deals such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Trade in Services agreement.Few would deny that we need rules to control digital trade. From the Cambridge Analytica scandal to the role of Amazon in undermining high-street retail and Uber’s impact on workers’ rights, big tech is transforming our world, and doing so in ways that defy standard regulation. The problem is that the e-commerce chapters are – far from controlling big tech and making it work for the many – actually cementing the power of a few big players into global rules for ever.Under today’s trade regime, anything that gets in the way of a corporation doing what it wants is labelled a “trade barrier”. The EU is focused on preventing big tech moving your data overseas, where more lax regulations could govern its use and abuse. But Donald Trump and Liam Fox label the EU’s behaviour as protectionist.The issues at stake aren’t limited to personal privacy. New technology has outrun society’s ability to control it. Vast fortunes have been made as a result, and corporations are impinging on our lives in ways we could never previously have imagined. Consider India, a country that is rightly interested in developing its own technology sector. Like all infant industries, this will need to be planned through an industrial strategy and, to some degree, protected from mega-corporations that can simply blow new companies out of the water. It will also need looser intellectual property laws, to allow developing countries to learn from the big players. But this will all be impossible under some of the rules being proposed under the e-commerce agenda, which includes, for example, rules that prevent the need for big tech companies to have any sort of local presence in the countries they’re operating in.That makes regulating and taxing these companies much more difficult. It also means it’s impossible for developing countries to insist on technology or skills transfer. In effect, big business can profit from a market without providing jobs or skills or knowhow or taxes, or having to worry about new regulations.Two weeks ago it was announced that Walmart was buying a controlling stake in Indian online retailer Flipkart. This is big news because India has resisted domination by major western supermarkets, which it fears could wipe out its local and national retailers. But by buying an online retailer, Walmart could have found a way round India’s successful retail regulation. This would proliferate under e-commerce rules.It gets worse when you remember that many of these corporations are “rent-seekers” to a large degree. They don’t make things, but rather provide online platforms that they charge rent to use. This is a model for the extraction of wealth. Companies such as Uber and Airbnb get huge commissions from the incomes of low-paid taxi drivers and accommodation owners in countries such as Uganda and Nepal. Small businesses at the very end of the value chain are subsidising fat-cat salaries in Silicon Valley.The problem will only get worse, because every year the size of the digital economy increases, which is why big tech wants to write the rules so its power can expand over ever greater sections of the economy. Rather than inspiring new, collaborative means of organising society, these rules shore up the power of private monopolies to stamp out alternatives.Over the past 30 years trade rules have been used to secure greater monopoly power for the richest businesses on earth – big pharma and big agriculture to name just two. If we want the economy of tomorrow to be more democratic and erse, we need to fight big tech now.We need global rules for digital trade and e-commerce – rules that prevent monopolies and add to our ability to tax and regulate big business. But that’s the opposite of what’s on the table. Rather than buy into Fox’s free-market approach, let’s remember that data has been described as the “new oil” of the global economy. Like any extractive industry it must be regulated for the benefit of people and the planet.

With mounting emotion, he speaks with trepidation about the future of his career: “Lincoln freed the slaves but was killed. Martin Luther King did the I Have a Dream speech and he was murdered. Hollywood has seen a couple of murders, too. The mindset is: sit tight, we’ll get you. Retaliation is real. You say something now but there will be backlash against anybody who comes forward.”A year ago, the notion that the name Terry Crews would inspire anything but universal positivity would have seemed surreal. The former NFL player – who transitioned into acting in 1997 – is the embodiment of the well-worn term “gentle giant”. He has used his imposing physicality for comedic effect in films such as the agreeably dumb White Chicks, Friday After Next, Get Smart and Mike Judge’s prescient Idiocracy, where he played the reality-star head of state President Camacho. Crews has also utilised his linebacker physique in more visceral projects, including playing one of the sprightlier members of Sylvester Stallone’s OAP action ensemble The Expendables. “I’ve done a lot of movies to make the white superstar look good,” comments Crews, 49. “I’ve done movies where I got beat up by guys who could never touch me.”As well as being a regular on sitcoms such as Everybody Hates Chris, Arrested Development and Are We There Yet?, he’s perhaps best known for his five seasons as hulking-but-weepy desk sergeant Terry Jeffords on Brooklyn Nine-Nine. These are not the credits of a controversial figure. But on 10 October last year, five days after the New York Times’s first exposé on Harvey Weinstein, Crews sent a chain of tweets detailing his experience of what he says was sexual harassment at the hands of a then-unnamed Hollywood agent, whom he accused of grabbing his crotch at a party hosted by Adam Sandler. “I saw my social media and men specifically were calling these women gold diggers and opportunists who just wanted a pay day. And it had happened to me. I’m reading all these guys calling these women all these names and I was like: ‘I can’t let this happen.’ I would have been the biggest farce ever. I’m just going to say what happened to me and let everybody else be the judge.”Even though the Weinstein exposé saw the end of numerous high-profile male entertainment industry careers, behind and in front of the camera, William Morris Endeavor allegedly took a different stance. (Crews claims he reported the incident at the time to his agents but William Morris disputes that he reported the incident to it immediately.)“I went to Ari Emmanuel, the head of the agency,” says Crews, “and I printed out a letter that he wrote when he wanted Mel Gibson blacklisted from Hollywood for antisemitic remarks. And I took that same letter, crossed out ‘Mel Gibson’, put in ‘Adam Venit’, crossed out ‘antisemitic remarks’ and put in ‘sexual assault’. I gave him the letter and said: ‘You know what you have to do.’ And he said: ‘It’s different, we have to deal with this in a different way.’ I said: ‘Is the only thing that can get you kicked out of Hollywood, antisemitic remarks? Where is murder on the list?’ So I fired him. I fired the agency and I told my wife that we had to be ready to never work again.”The agency says that when it heard about Venit’s alleged conduct he was immediately suspended without pay and when he returned to work he was demoted. Crews made a complaint to the police about Venit but the prosecution did not file charges Venit’s defence to the lawsuit is that is was merely drunken horseplay not sexual. Crews has subsequently filed a civil suit against Venit, which has a court date of July next year.Crews’s initial fears for his career have so far proven unfounded. He is already ensconced in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, playing X-Force member Bedlam, both in the upcoming Deadpool sequel and an X-Force spin-off. “I have not gone broke,” he assures me. “New opportunities are coming simply because it’s a new day. It’s almost like the reconstruction when you have the emancipation proclamation and slavery is over. Now you have to deal with the new rules.” His mood darkens. “I did have some backlash. Avi Lerner, who is the producer of The Expendables, had the nerve to call my manager and say that if I dropped the case against William Morris, I could avoid problems on the set of the next Expendables sequel. And I’m going: ‘What problems? Why would that even be a topic of conversation as regards my employment?’ Turns out Sylvester Stallone is represented by Adam Venit. He’s connected to so many people in this business that it’s going to affect me.”He continues: “I’m getting support now, which is awesome, but what happens in two years? What happens in three years when no one remembers, when people have all moved on?” He drops his voice and gives an ominous stare. “Agents are like Catholic priests,” he says. “If they’re good, the whole community loves them. But when they’re bad, it gets as evil as it can ever get. An agent can rape a client but he got her a show so she has to pay him. The guy who molested me, I have to send him a cheque every time I do a job. A guy can molest you and then sue you for not paying him!”Until recently, Crews was regarded as an affable presence. Now, like Brendan Fraser and James Van Der Beek, he is acknowledged as a voice against toxic masculinity and an advocate for harassment victims. I ask Crews if he feels what’s happened to him is in some way predestined: “I feel like this whole thing is the reason why I’ve been put on Earth. The silence allows this stuff to breathe and grow and I want to shine a light on it because it’s everywhere. It was in sports, in business, in politics, in religion. Anywhere there’s success, there’s temptation. I tell people this is not a witch hunt, it’s a fumigation. And I’m going to tell you something right now: I have forgiven Adam Venit,” he insists. “That’s the only way I can be free. He messed up. We all messed up. But we have to be held accountable.”Deadpool 2 is out now "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d6eaf0d93e10c4b3e092cbf729f9cb31ba655a3/0_174_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09deca6e98989c8f630c44c3bd43a239","title":"damian hinds academy policy whim schools michael rosen","story":"I was riffling through some news reports on education the other day and came across something that must have shocked you to your core. Your permanent secretary at the Department for Education, Jonathan Slater, was up before the Commons public accounts committee. I can well imagine you were keen to know what was said, and even keener to know if your own permanent secretary was on-side with what you Tories have been doing in education for the past eight years.The Labour MP Gareth Snell asked your guy: “Is there any evidence that rescuing underperforming schools via forced academisation provides better value for money than a rescue package inside the local authority?”This is a question many of us have been asking for years, particularly in the hundreds of schools where parents and teachers have opposed forced academisation, (though I see in the press that the government is now soft-pedalling on forcing schools). Parents, teachers, pupils, ex-pupils and indeed the whole country is entitled to know whether this flagship policy has done what it set out to do, and whether other methods could have been used at much less cost.I might add here that turning schools into academies has involved much more than cost. At its core it involves changing the public ownership of schools into 125-year leasehold properties where the leaseholders (the academy trusts) can run the school site, manage the pay and conditions of its staff how they want, and conduct business on site if it can be shown to benefit the school. One consequence is that academies are employing untrained staff and at the other end of the scale, leadership teams can pay themselves eye-watering salaries.Meanwhile, back at the committee, how did your man answer the question?To translate: he has no way of proving that turning a school into an academy was or is a fail-safe way of improving it, nor whether a failing school could have been improved without conversion.Let us remind ourselves of the huge upheaval, time, effort and cost of converting hundreds of schools, and your chief wallah can’t commit himself to say that it was worth it.Snell then asked your man for “quantifiable, tangible evidence” that academisation provided better value for money for schools rated “inadequate” than did local authority support. Your official said, “I can’t prove that … nobody could.”This, then, has been government policy by whim and dogma. No evidence, no proof, either before, during or after to back it up.Now, I would have thought that your permanent secretary might have been a little deflated at this point, but no, back he came with: “international evidence” showed that turning schools from “good” to “great” involved de-centralising powers to those schools, and that the purpose of conversions was to help needy schools to “pair up” with schools that could help them.This was a pathetic effort at clawing back some credit for a mind-blowingly expensive experiment, as if the only way to “decentralise” was to run the country’s schools from your office. Then, the Labour committee chair, Meg Hillier, picked up on your secretary’s last point: “There are other ways of pairing up – federations, families of schools, school improvement areas.”I expect that the moment you read about this exchange you leapt into action, banning all future forced academisations, putting out a memo to all schools warning them that turning their school into an academy is no guarantee that it will improve, and that you deeply regret the draconian actions of your predecessor, Michael Gove, in\u0026nbspforcing so many schools down this path."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0905544f17235e7acd62998c5d3071f8e68814af/0_66_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad5fdcdc8e7072b8052837af9ddb7da4","title":"uks new air pollution strategy hugely disappointing says labour","story":"Consultation proposes reducing pollutants, including particulates from wood burners and ammonia from farms – but does little to tackle diesel emissionsA new clean air strategy published by the UK government has been criticised as “hugely disappointing” by the Labour party. Other groups said it did little to tackle the dirty diesel vehicles that are the main source of toxic air in urban areas.The new strategy, announced on Tuesday by environment secretary, Michael Gove, aims to crack down on a wide range of pollutants. These include particulates from wet wood and coal burning in homes, ammonia emissions from farms and dust from vehicle tyres and brakes. Ministers also want to give provide personalised pollution alerts to people and give local authorities new powers to cut pollution, all subject to public consultation.The government said the new action would reduce the costs of air pollution to society by an estimated £1bn every year by 2020. The health costs of toxic air are currently estimated at £20bn a year, by the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.The new clean air strategy is a response to an EU directive on cutting harmful emissions. An air quality plan, published in July 2017, is related to a separate EU directive on cleaner air. The latter plan was condemned as “woefully inadequate” by city leaders and “inexcusable” by doctors, and was ruled illegally poor in February, the third such high court defeat for ministers.On Thursday, the government suffered another legal blow, with the UK referred to Europe’s highest court over its failure to tackle nitrogen dioxide pollution, which mostly comes from diesel vehicles.Gove said: “Air quality has improved significantly since 2010 but 60 years on from the historic Clean Air Act a clear truth remains – air pollution is making people ill, shortening lives and damaging our economy and environment.“This is why we are launching this clean air strategy, backed up with new primary legislation,” he said. “It sets out the comprehensive action required across all parts of government to improve air quality.”However, Sue Hayman, the shadow environment secretary, said: “It’s hugely disappointing that despite being dragged through the courts time and again on its inadequate air quality plans, the government is dragging its feet by announcing yet another consultation.” She said Gove had issued more than 25 consultations since the 2017 general election, but none had yet produced new laws.James Thornton, the CEO of the environmental lawyers ClientEarth who have defeated ministers three times in court, said: “Road transport is still the main source of illegal air pollution in our towns and cities. We need a national network of clean air zones (CAZs) to take the most polluting vehicles out of the most polluted areas.” The government’s own research shows CAZs, in which cars are deterred from city centres by pollution charges, are by far the most effective solution to air pollution. But ministers refused to make them compulsory, instead making them a voluntary and last-resort option for local authorities. Greenpeace and the British Lung Foundation both backed the call for CAZs. Paul Morozzo, at Greenpeace, also said proposed new powers for local government looked like ministers passing the buck: “It looks like local authorities are being handed responsibility without the clarity on where the resources will come from.”Ammonia from manure and fertilisers on fields blows into cities and is a significant contributor to particle pollution. Ministers want to require farmers to invest in better slurry control and fertiliser application, perhaps supported by grants from a revised farm subsidy scheme."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0245832c054dc42f128b43079060c563ed2782d/0_347_5217_3130/master/5217.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00381cfb02b53056c5d3bd8569cf2a4f","title":"gaspar noe six people walked out of climax no i usually have 25","story":"The director’s violent, sexually charged films repel as many viewers as they entrance – but at Cannes, almost everyone loved his latest, LSD-soaked dance drama Climax. So where did he go wrong?The Cannes equivalent of a Sunday service is the 8.30am screening of Gaspar Noé’s Climax, in a basement cinema beside the casino. Once inside, the congregation (all sleep-deprived, many hungover) are treated to the complete matins, a kind of prolonged grand-mal seizure set to music. There’s sex and there’s violence. There’s coke-snorting and mouth-frothing. A corridor is patrolled by a lumbering giant wearing a fright wig and a kilt. A utility closet contains a hysterical child screaming about cockroaches. And then, near the end, we get a sermon printed on the screen in letters 10ft tall. “Death is an extraordinary experience,” it says.The Franco-Argentine director has grown used to outraging audiences, driving punters from the theatre like a shepherd chasing his flock. But here’s the thing: Climax is promptly greeted by almost uniformly glowing reviews. Critics are claiming it’s his most fully realised, purely exciting film to date. And now, for perhaps the first time in his life, it’s Noé’s turn to be outraged. He says: “I must be doing something wrong. I have to take a long holiday and rethink my career.”We meet in a big marquee on the beach, open at the far end to let the sea air blow in. At the age of 54, Noé still has the self-conscious air of a disreputable young thug. With his shaven head, beetle brows and cigarette permanently on the go, he’s like a villain from a 1950s Tintin book. But he insists he’s pleased to be in Cannes and delighted to be screened in the more rambunctious surrounds of the Directors’ Fortnight sideshoot, away from the glare of the main competition. “I wouldn’t have won anything anyway,” he shrugs. “This year’s jury is so moralistic and consensual.”Variety magazine calls Noé “an artist of scandal”, which sounds about right. His brutish 1998 debut I Stand Alone, about a murderous butcher, notoriously threw in a 30-second countdown before the carnage began, as if the film itself were a rollercoaster climbing to the top of a loop. It’s essentially been downhill at great speed ever since, hurtling through the harrowing rape-revenge drama Irreversible (which critics duly renamed Unwatchable), swooping between the floors of a Tokyo love hotel in the fabulous Enter the Void, and plunging towards flesh in his 3D sex film Love. He never thinks of an audience when making a film, he says. The focus is always on his own enjoyment. When the approach works, it’s infectious. When it doesn’t, we recoil.Purportedly based on a 1990s news story, Climax opens like Step Up and then goes full Cabin Fever. It’s about a band of limber street-dancers, rehearsing in an abandoned boarding school, who make the mistake of drinking from a punch-bowl of sangria that’s been dosed with LSD – meaning the film’s second half plays like an extended nightmarish freak-out (or perhaps an artistic extrapolation of the first half’s dance routines). The director points out that, back when he was a kid, it was always sangria he would use to get his fellow classmates drunk. “It was my first shamanistic act,” he says. “And I was the shaman.”Noé’s previous few features have been lush, long and noodling, like prog-rock albums with lavish gatefold sleeves. But Climax was written as a one-page outline and shot in two weeks, with its cast of non-professional actors plucked from Parisian voguing balls and YouTube dance videos. Clutching the hand-held camera, Noé enjoyed losing himself among them, like a drunk uncle at a teenage party, aping their movements to the point where the film’s frame spins in circles and turns upside-down like Diana Ross. “I’m not interested in constraining human beings like rats in a laboratory,” he says. “Here, you’re a rat among the rats.”Does he like dancing himself? “Love dancing. Love the physical sensation of dancing. If you were to ask people their three favourite activities, they’ll normally say talking, eating …” He gropes for the third. “Smoking. But in my case, it’s making love, swimming and dancing. But the climactic moments of my life have really always involved dancing. Back in Paris, I go to clubs all the time. I forget myself when I dance.”The director was born in Buenos Aires, the son of Luis Felipe Noé, an artist and intellectual. He spent his childhood bouncing between continents, first to New York and then later – fleeing Argentina’s 1976 coup – to Paris. “Yeah, I was only in New York from the age of six months until five years old,” he says. “But my very first memories are all of New York. I remember my first rainbow on a beach in New York. I remember jumping on a bed in New York. We used to live in an apartment on Bleecker Street and I remember peeing on the people walking below the balcony and being told off by my parents. ‘Don’t pee on the people!’” Some critics would argue he’s been doing this ever since.Noé talks at length about his father, who now lives back in Buenos Aires. He’s 85 and he’s still cranking out paintings, working every day. Noé says there was recently a retrospective of his father’s work at the city’s Museum of Modern Art and 5,000 people queued to get in on the opening day. “He’s crazy creative, he’s like David Bowie. And my father always says that the only thing that makes an artist good is working. Whenever I’m in trouble – and I get in trouble a lot – he tells me, ‘Hey, just concentrate on the work. It’s the only thing that matters.’”I’d read that one day he’d like to make a kids’ film and he admits that this is actually a promise he made to his dad, who wants him to shoot a movie that can be enjoyed by the widest possible audience. “My own love for cinema began at the age of seven,” says Noé, “when I saw 2001: A Space Odyssey. It blew my mind. I was obsessed with it. So I wish I could make a movie that speaks to kids the way that one spoke to me.”Does he have children of his own? “No kids,” he says. “No kids, no abortions. I’m not pro-life but I’m not pro-death.” He laughs embarrassedly and reaches for his cigarette. His mother, it transpires, died a few years ago. Noé sat at the bedside and held her when she went and the experience left its mark. He’d spent his whole life in a hedonistic, self-absorbed funk. Now all at once, he found himself brought up short. “I’m more melancholic than I was before. When your mother dies in your arms, your perception of life changes. I think the whole thing is just a fleeting illusion. It doesn’t last – and if there is any paradise or hell, it’s right here, right now. Also, I used to have this mental disease called collectionism.”Called what? “Collectionism. I used to collect everything. Comic books, posters, records, whatever. But the moment my mother died, I stopped being possessive because you never own anything anyway. Even her books and her dresses – they had no more meaning, because they were nothing to do with her any more. I didn’t want any of it.”It sounds to me as if he’s mellowing but he insists it’s the opposite. He’s enjoying the present, living in the moment, at least as far as his body allows. Obviously, he can’t party at quite the same pace he maintained in the past, when he’d down a bottle of vodka before heading out on the tiles. If he does that now, he suffers blackouts. He can’t remember the night, can’t recall how he got home. Aside from that, he says, he’s fine. He lives much the same as he ever did, swaggering ever onward through a perpetual adolescence. He says: “You know what the difference is between 20 and 40? Ask me the difference.”Go on then, what’s the difference? “Twenty kilos,” he says, and laughs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/953f8353ad81e2b27257d9d6308527f3aa951905/0_108_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=433c8693f5f41485de215eddc840d75e","title":"jurgen klopp desire delivers liverpool dreams","story":"Jürgen Klopp believes Liverpool’s bravery, work-rate and desire for a sixth European Cup can compensate for Real Madrid’s greater experience when the sides meet in the Champions League final. Saturday’s contest in Kiev will be Real’s fourth Champions League final in five years, with Zinedine Zidane’s holders aiming to lift the trophy for a third consecutive season. No club has won a hat-trick of European Cups since Bayern Munich in 1974, 75 and 76.Liverpool’s recent European record pales by comparison but having reached a first final in 11 years with several exhilarating performances and scored a competition record 40 goals en route, their manager is confident his team’s virtues can prove decisive in Ukraine.Klopp refused to be drawn on whether Real should be favourites but said: “They are more experienced, that is a fact. If there is a market for experience they should sell it because then they would be even richer. Experience is very important in life but it is not the only thing. It is important to be more experienced but youcan level it with desire, attitude, work-rate and that is what I love in football. We made our own experience.“We are not as long together as Real Madrid because they play these finals pretty much with the same team so as a group they are very strong. That is all fact, but it is still football and we have a chance and let’s give it a try. Let’s go there and try to perform on a level which maybe people would say is not possible for us but it is possible.”Klopp added: “We did all the things we need to do plenty of times already in the Champions League campaign and now we need to do it again. Real Madrid is a really good football team but we are a really good football team. We are full of desire and we really work for our dreams.”The Liverpool manager expects his team to play without fear against Real having thrived on the pressure of reaching the final and next season’s Champions League on the last day of the Premier League season with an injury-hit squad. He also cited brave attacking displays against Manchester City and Roma in the quarter-finals and semi-finals respectively as reason to approach Kiev with optimism.Klopp added: “We had a lot of pressure and a lot of expectations in the last few weeks. Each game we drew we wanted to win. I said all that rubbish after West Bromwich Albion only because I was really angry we didn’t win. I am not a psychologist but if somebody would tell me constantly that everything is different in the next game then I would get nervous.“We have to handle it like an opportunity because it is an opportunity. You cannot go into a football game knowing you can lose it. I experienced that plenty of times but I am still a happy person. Life goes on. We will show the players why it makes so much sense to be brave. It was not easy to be brave against Manchester City and against Roma but we did it. The moment we tried to defend the result we were almost out. I am in a good mood. I am really looking forward to the game. Unlike the Brighton one, I would buy a 1-0. This game I really want to play.”Long-term absentees Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Joël Matip were the only senior players missing from training on Monday as Liverpool stepped up preparations for Kiev while Emre Can, along with Adam Lallana, significantly increases Klopp’s midfield options for the final.“The mood is very good for the club, for us and for the boys because we finished the season in the best way,” said the manager.“We felt really good and then having time to prepare for the game is really good. We could do a lot of things and didn’t have to compress it into two or three sessions.“We could do a lot of things in training. We have three more sessions and then we will be best prepared for the game. We feel good and think we deserve to be where we are because the boys showed up in the campaign.“It was very exciting and now we want to bring it to the best possible end.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/371ecd6bcf5acd92cea91f7b4678172cd78d4bbd/0_146_3999_2399/master/3999.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29930763813e01c2401419a237120b32","title":"manuel pellegrini set to be confirmed as west ham new manager","story":"• Chilean agrees £7m-a-year deal after talks with David Sullivan• Pellegrini will be given full control of transfers at London clubWest Ham United have appointed Manuel Pellegrini as their new manager after concluding negotiations late on Monday night.Pellegrini has signed a three-year deal worth up to £7m a year after meeting with David Sullivan, the co-owner, who had promised that the club would make a “high-calibre” appointment after parting company with David Moyes last week.Newcastle United’s Rafael Benítez was high on the London Stadium club’s four-man shortlist and Sullivan also interviewed Shakhtar Donetsk’s Paulo Fonseca last Monday. Benítez’s contract contained a £6m release clause, however, and Fonseca ended up agreeing a new deal with Shakhtar. Unai Emery, who is set to join Arsenal, proved elusive after leaving Paris Saint-Germain and that made Pellegrini the frontrunner to replace Moyes.Claudio Ranieri was also in the running after being dismissed by Nantes but the Italian was always regarded as a risk and that left Pellegrini as the most qualified candidate. The 64-year-old, who won the Premier League with Manchester City in 2014, had spent two years working for Hebei China Fortune and was on £10m a year with the Chinese Super League Club. West Ham were unsure about agreeing to pay him the same figure but Pellegrini, who has been given full control of transfers, has accepted a lower wage that will still make him one of the most expensive managers in the league. The Chilean flew in from China after leaving Hebei China Fortune over the weekend and will name Rubén Cousillas as his No2.“I am delighted to welcome Manuel Pellegrini to West Ham United,” Sullivan said. “He is one of the world’s most respected football coaches and we look forward to working with him. It was important that we appointed someone with knowledge and experience of the Premier League, who already has an understanding – not only of the teams and players we face – but of West Ham United and our ambitions.“Manuel brings a reputation for attacking football and getting the best out of his players. We believe he will attract new talent to the London Stadium as well as improving the current squad. Above all, he is a winner, who knows what it takes to succeed at the highest level and is driven to continue that success. Manuel is the first West Ham United manager to have a Premier League title on his CV, and we believe that his experience, quality and proven record of taking teams forward quickly will ensure that he is successful here. We have listened to fans who asked us to be ambitious. We hope they agree it is an exciting appointment.West Ham are looking to revamp their recruitment director and are interested in appointing Málaga’s Mario Husillos as their new head of recruitment. The Argentinian worked with Pellegrini at Malaga. However, Leicester City’s Eduardo Macià is another candidate for a role which has been vacant since Tony Henry was sacked in February.West Ham, who will need to give Pellegrini funds to strengthen an unbalanced squad this summer, will hope their new manager can give them some stability. Moyes replaced Slaven Bilic as manager in November and saved the club from relegation but the atmosphere was often toxic and supporters aimed protests at the board during the 3-0 defeat to Burnley at the London Stadium in March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a615eed5430bd525439490f42888c032c8fc3917/246_51_3727_2236/master/3727.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69b955f478914f1d4a4e46ed32bc679a","title":"unai emery arsenal psg neymar","story":"The tactically astute and well prepared Spaniard will find a more receptive audience in the Emirates dressing room than with an unruly PSG squadNeymar is not one for ‘homework’, but that didn’t stop Unai Emery. “We are analysing some videos with him to see how he can grow,” said Emery last year, “especially in his positioning and how to work with his colleagues.” While Emery’s quiet meticulousness may have proven crucial in the past, spending 12 hours looking over videos for every game, with hindsight his persistence with the Brazilian should be regarded as having been a little optimistic.While Neymar may have balked at the idea of incessant videos, reportedly complaining to the Paris Saint-Germain board about the Basque technician’s demands, Emery might find his new audience in north London to be more receptive. He is a supremely detail-orientated and tactically astute coach, and although this style of management did not play out well in Paris, the Arsenal squad will experience a heightened level of structure in their preparation. “Emery put on so many videos I ran out of popcorn,” former player Joaquín quipped, “he’s obsessed by football, it’s practically an illness.”Where Arsène Wenger’s teams may have descended into the painfully one-dimensional, Emery’s outlook is one of nuance and precision, which may well suit Arsenal’s developing team rather more than the entrenched, haughty collection of Parisian stars.Crucially for Arsenal’s philosophy as a club, Emery, despite rampant short-termism in Paris, managed to maintain a degree of focus on youth. His development of Adrien Rabiot from an inconsistent, naive ball-playing midfielder to the physical, confident, box-to-box marauder he is at his best today should be applauded. While the introduction of 22-year-old French centre-back Presnel Kimpembe, now arguably PSG’s best defender, and Argentine international Giovani Lo Celso is also a credit to Emery’s faith in youth and his ability to evolve talent.The 46-year-old\u0027s managerial career began in Spain\u0027s second ision and has taken him to Russia, France and major European honoursWhile Arsène Wenger is being unveiled at Arsenal, Emery settles in at Toledo in Spain\u0027s second tier after leaving his first club, Real Sociedad. Emery, a left-sided midfielder, also turned out for Racing Ferrol, Leganés and Lorca Deportiva before a knee injury ended his playing career at the age of 32.Emery is offered the manager\u0027s position at Lorca Deportiva after his knee injury, and goes on to lead the team into Spain\u0027s second ision. In his first full season, Lorca miss promotion to La Liga by just five points.Emery comes to the attention of Spain\u0027s big clubs after guiding Almería to their first promotion to La Liga, and securing an eighth-place finish in the top flight. He is snapped up by Valencia in the summer of 2008.Emery replaces Ronald Koeman at cash-strapped Valencia and sets about returning the club to the Champions League. He leaves Valencia in 2012 after three consecutive third-place league finishes.The first blot on Emery\u0027s managerial copy book comes in Russia, where he lasts just six months at Spartak Moscow, and is sacked after a 5-1 derby defeat to Dynamo.After returning to La Liga with Sevilla in January 2013, Emery leads them to three consecutive Europa League titles. Sevilla beat Liverpool 3-1 in Basle to complete the hat-trick in the manager\u0027s penultimate game in charge.PSG finish second to Arsenal in their Champions League group, and then thrash Barcelona 4-0 in the first leg of their last-16 tie. On the verge of a European breakthrough, they lose the second leg 6-1 and crash out. PSG also lose out to Monaco in the French title race.Emery wins Ligue 1 and both Cup competitions in France to take his trophy haul at the club to five, but another last-16 Champions League exit leads to his departure at the end of the season.Despite the success he enjoyed with a more counter-attacking 4-2-3-1 set-up with Sevilla, Emery was reluctantly forced to switch to a more possession-based 4-3-3 at PSG after early attempts to move Marco Verratti into a No 10 role failed and the dressing room pressured him into reverting to the favoured formation which Laurent Blanc and Carlo Ancelotti had previously practised. The combination of detailed tactical insight and counter-attacking brought about a glorious, unprecedented hat-trick of Europa League titles at Sevilla, a record that appealed to PSG, a club obsessed with European success. His time with Valencia also proved fruitful, a trio of third-place finishes between 2010 and 2012 being highlights before their recent lean period.Nevertheless, despite five trophies in two seasons in Paris, Emery’s stay in the French capital has been characterised by mishaps that fall somewhere between unfortunate circumstances and outright errors of judgment. Player power has long been an endemic issue, ingrained during the Zlatan Ibrahimovic era. Neymar’s arrival, and the club’s subsequent pandering to him, has only played into the idea that the PSG squad is particularly unruly. Emery, however, while willing, was unable to address this.When Neymar and Edinson Cavani’s relationship exploded following a squabble over who should take responsibility for set-pieces at the beginning of season, with Thiago Silva reportedly having to separate the two strikers after the home game against Lyon in September, Emery said that they could “sort it out themselves” rather than decisively asserting his authority.PSG’s squad in the Qatar Sports Investments era has proven prohibitively cliquey and, the Brazilian contingent became so strong over the summer, with the additions of Neymar and Dani Alves, that Emery was discouraged from removing a failing and noticeably aging Thiago Silva as captain. Another example of weak man-management was illustrated with the cases of both Rabiot and Ángel Di María, who over the last year have succeeded in forcing him to play them once again in their preferred positions, despite the Spaniard’s efforts to remove them from the deep-lying midfield role and right-wing respectively.Understandably, Emery received severe criticism for the now infamous “remontada” defeat to Barcelona last year. Here however, it seems he was a victim of a lack of mental fortitude in a squad, which he admittedly failed to address himself. PSG under QSI have long lacked heart and the Qataris have struggled with, or even ignored, the significance of the club’s identity. PSG’s lack of gumption in potentially era-defining Champions’ League ties seems rooted in a sense that while winning is important for the squad, winning for PSG is not, and when put under pressure, they dramatically wilt.The 6-1 defeat at the Camp Nou was not a product of an omnipotent Barcelona display but willed into existence by sheer determination, a drive Emery, Blanc and even Ancelotti have been unable to foster. The ferocious press and intensity of the 4-0 win in the first leg, Emery’s doing, evaporated, Thiago Silva’s leadership was non-existent and unfathomable mistakes were made, all largely beyond Emery’s control. He has also been forced to operate in something of a box at PSG, constrained not just by his unruly squad, but also by the club hierarchy, with little say in player recruitment policy, leading to a ludicrously top-heavy squad.Whether Emery is the antidote to the furore that has surrounded Arsenal during Wenger’s final years in charge or the correct choice at such a crossroads is debatable, but Emery will certainly improve Arsenal’s players and mould the side into being far more tactically streetwise.His stoic, measured demeanour is comparable to Wenger’s, particularly with the press. As a result, he too will be unable to act as a lightning rod to draw attention away from any negative coverage or stimulate supporters with a fiery personality. However, in contrast to the PSG dressing room, Emery is likely to discover a more malleable and open-minded audience in England, which will suit his style.At Valencia, Emery’s video ‘homework’ was delivered via USB drive. When he suspected one player was not following his advice, Emery gave him a blank drive. “Did you watch it?” Emery asked. “Yes, don’t worry boss,” came the reply. Emery may not be charismatic, but his stint at PSG must largely be viewed as an anomaly in an otherwise successful managerial career, built upon tenacious hard work and strokes of occasional tactical genius.“Arsène who?” was the famous headline when Arsenal last hired a new manager in 1996, and Emery’s appointment will ask more similar questions of the Frenchman’s successor than Arsenal fans might have hoped when this day came. But if the squad commits wholeheartedly to Emery’s modus operandi, then both club and manager have a genuine chance to disprove the doubters and show that they deserve to be mentioned amongst the bracket of Europe’s best."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d028a50090872cdd677924eadb422a6f5423efd7/0_0_2114_1268/master/2114.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c81c29b2dee18230a1fdf3dfbaa00f0b","title":"unai emery set to replace wenger arsenal manager","story":"Arsenal have moved to appoint Unai Emery as the successor to Arsène Wenger. The club have conducted a thorough recruitment process as they look to replace Wenger – their manager of almost 22 years – who departed at the end of the season and Mikel Arteta had been considered as the favourite for the past week or so.However, the signs on Monday were that Emery, the former Paris St-Germain and Sevilla manager, was set to be chosen. The club have spoken to him and a decision is expected to be confirmed later in the week.Emery is a safer bet in terms of his experience and, in the end, it is this factor that has swayed the decision of Ivan Gazidis, the Arsenal chief executive, who has led the recruitment drive. Arteta, the former Arsenal player, who is now a member of Pep Guardiola’s coaching staff at Manchester City, has not yet managed a club whereas Emery has been in the business since 2005, when he cut his teeth at Lorca Deportiva in his native Spain.The 46-year-old has gone on to take charge at Almería, Valencia, Spartak Moscow, Sevilla and, most recently, PSG – clubs of mounting profile – and he has impressed Gazidis, even though he is not fluent in English.The 46-year-old\u0027s managerial career began in Spain\u0027s second ision and has taken him to Russia, France and major European honoursWhile Arsène Wenger is being unveiled at Arsenal, Emery settles in at Toledo in Spain\u0027s second tier after leaving his first club, Real Sociedad.

PSG also lose out to Monaco in the French title race.Emery wins Ligue 1 and both Cup competitions in France to take his trophy haul at the club to five, but another last-16 Champions League exit leads to his departure at the end of the season.Emery is happy to work within the management structure that Gazidis has put in place at the Emirates Stadium – in which there are prominent recruitment roles for Raúl Sanllehí and Sven Mislintat. He enjoyed eye-catching success at Sevilla, where he won three consecutive Europa Leagues, and he won the championship at PSG in this past season, although his relative failure in the Champions League, in the shape of a last-16 exit against Real Madrid, cost him his job. He has been replaced by Thomas Tuchel – the one-time Arsenal target.Arteta had a meeting with the Arsenal hierarchy last week and he was confident that he would get the job. Guardiola had said he would not stand in Arteta’s way and talks had progressed to the point where the potential make-up of his backroom staff had been discussed.Arteta ticked plenty of boxes for Gazidis, who was looking for somebody to represent the club’s values, including giving youth a chance, and play fast and attractive football.Gazidis had made it clear he was not afraid to make a left-field appointment, noting on the day Wenger’s departure was confirmed that the Frenchman had not been “on many people’s radar screens” in 1996.But Emery, too, ticked the boxes and, crucially, he came to look like less of a gamble. It is understood that Arteta was told his lack of experience came to count against him. Gazidis is not a man synonymous with risk-taking. After careful consideration, analysing each argument from every conceivable angle, he has come to see Emery as the outstanding selection.The new manager is expected to have around £50m, plus money generated from sales, to spend on reshaping the squad, which is broadly in line with what Wenger was granted, annually, in recent seasons. It is not a lavish budget and it is clear that the new man’s coaching skills will have to be up to scratch from the outset.Santi Cazorla, the Arsenal midfielder, had been linked with a possible player-coach role under Arteta but he has now left the club upon the expiry of his contract. He has not played since he injured his achilles in October 2016, although he remains determined to carry on as a player.Gazidis said: “Santi is always one of my favourite players to watch. His natural ability with both feet, his speed of thought and movement were central to our best performances in recent years. He plays with a joy and freedom which is very rare. We wish him well for the future and thank him for his important contribution to our club.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2c560fbfd13545b29fd7456c8cb3abad3c2b08f/945_895_3820_2292/master/3820.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd820a2e924e2f3656d872d869670daa","title":"gareth southgate names harry kane as england captain for world cup","story":"Gareth Southgate has announced the Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane will captain England at this summer’s World Cup in Russia.The 24-year-old will lead England into their 15th World Cup in June.

The swell of unexpected hope experienced by the English coincided with the blossoming of Gascoigne’s rare and fragile talent they rose together, they fell together – quite a bit sooner than either would have liked – and frankly everyone’s still a bit bitter about it.Gascoigne had started only one international before an effervescent performance in a friendly against Czechoslovakia in April 1990 catapulted him into the first team for good, or at least for as long as his knee was good. And like his team he kept improving. His display against Germany, at least until the 99th minute, had been superlative.“I straightened up and turned to the ref,” Gascoigne continued in his book Glorious: My World, Football and Me. “He’s gone for his pocket. Suddenly I can’t hear anything. The world just stops apart from the bloke in black. My eyes follow his hand, to the pocket, then out with the card. There it is, raised above my head. I looked at the crowd, I looked at Lineker, and I couldn’t hold it back. At that moment I just wanted to be left alone. I didn’t want to talk to anyone or see anyone. My bottom lip was like a helicopter pad. I was devasted.”“My heart sank the moment the referee took out the yellow card,” said Bobby Robson. “My heart hit my shoes. Because I realised instantly, that was the final for Paul Gascoigne, out. And that’s a tragedy – for him, me, the team, the country, the whole of football. Because he was so good, and he was superb in this particular match. The bigger the game, the better he got.In all Lineker won 80 caps for England, returned from the 1986 World Cup with the Golden Boot, won the major cup competitions of England and Spain and scored 243 times for a variety of clubs including Everton, Tottenham and Barcelona. But for all the goals and the glory more than anything he is remembered for the time someone else was booked and he made a face at his manager. “Out of everything in my career, the moment people ask me about most often was when Gazza got booked in that semi-final,” he has said. “I could see his bottom lip was going. I think it says a lot about Bobby that it was him I turned to, to ask him to have a word. I didn’t know that the moment would be caught on camera.”Robson believed that the Germans had pressured the referee into showing the card. “He flew in at the boy, upended everything, and the German bench all stood up, which unfortunately I think affected the referee,” he said. “We don’t allow players to do that. We say, ‘Sit down, it’s got nothing to do with you.’ They all jumped up and it made it worse for Paul. It was only half a booking.”The referee whose decision to wave a yellow card was to prove key to England’s World Cup elimination spoke to  about the incident in 2014 – his first interview with a British newspaper.“Listen, there was no controversy,” insists José Roberto Wright. “The lad tackled an opponent from behind and nowadays he could even have been sent off. It was none of my business if Gascoigne already had a yellow card – my job was to apply the laws of the game. He tried to argue with me and apologise, but I told him in English that it was a bookable offence. Then I got on with the game.”The booking that brought Gascoigne to tears, ended his hopes of playing in a World Cup final and left him so emotionally drained that he withdrew from the decisive penalty shoot-out – Chris Waddle replaced him, fatefully – might be considered somewhat controversial in England, but was not seen in the same light elsewhere. In 1990 Wright was named the best referee in the World Cup by the International Federation of Football History and Statistics, and later that year named the best official on the planet by the World Referees’ Federation.“I didn’t see him crying or all that commotion,” says Wright of Gascoigne. “It wasn’t until later that I saw footage of the game and noticed how upset he was. Years later I read that Gascoigne’s tears were some kind of watershed moment in English football, that it helped people fall in love with the game once again.”In England hearts skipped a beat with every wobble of Gascoigne’s bottom lip. As it turns out he was not to be the last Englishman to shed a tear that night, and player and fans bonded in a display of lachrymose unity. A few months later he was named Sports Personality of the Year. “I don’t know anybody who dislikes Paul Gascoigne,” Robson wrote in his autobiography. “The affection we all felt for him added to the poignancy of his booking. As we went into the second period of extra time, I had said to Paul, ‘Look, I know you can’t play in the final but what you can do is make sure all the other lads can. Just concentrate on that.’ This was in the heat of the battle. Now, I can appreciate how crushed Paul would have felt had we beaten the Germans that night in Turin.”Time has proven that Gascoigne’s behaviour in Turin was not borne of juvenile petulance but the result of one small fissure in a fractured mind. For all their very different characters and wildly erse levels of experience, it is nevertheless telling to contrast Gascoigne’s reaction to his booking to that of Michael Ballack, the midfield inspiration behind a poor Germany side’s run to the final in 2002. Gascoigne received his second caution of the tournament with 20 minutes of extra time to play in his semi-final and the scores level Ballack with 20 minutes of normal time to play in his semi-final and the scores level. Both knew they no longer had a chance of appearing in the final, but while the Englishman was of limited use from that moment onwards, Ballack scored his side’s winner within four minutes and celebrated without reservation. In the crucial moments before the shoot-out in Turin, most of the England manager’s time was spent not with the five designated takers but with Gascoigne, coping with the midfielder’s emotional disintegration.In England the only player to receive any significant criticism for his role in the defeat in Turin was Peter Shilton, the 40-year-old goalkeeper, who made several decent saves in open play but in the shoot-out decided to delay ing until each kick had been taken, and got nowhere near any of them. “You should have bloody gambled,” Pearce shouted in the dressing-room after the game.Having wept his way to a string of product endorsements and a lucrative column in The Sun, some – including the referee who booked him – would expect that with the passing of time and the accumulation of money Gascoigne’s grief might have subsided. “The tackle was bad, and if I hadn’t booked Gascoigne I would have lost control of the game,” says Wright. “But I must say I was surprised he got so upset about it. I’ve never met him again, but I’m sure now he’d agree with me about the incident.”If the interview Gascoigne gave to the Observer in 2002 is anything to go by, that seems extremely unlikely. In it Gascoigne was asked what he thought, with the benefit of hindsight, about Berthold. “He was a dickhead. He was a tall man with a mouth like a fish. I remember all the details of his face. He was a wanker and a cheat,” Gascoigne said. “When I made that tackle, I missed him and the ball. He ed, as Germans do, to get me booked. When I see that game and I see that guy e, I wish I had the chance now to play against him and take the piss out of him on the pitch and, if I got the chance, tackle him properly – and this time really properly. Because if I’m going to get a yellow card I would rather be for a proper foul. And it would be if I played against him again.”But Berthold had retired by the time Gascoigne faced Germany for the second and final time, in the Euro 96 semi-final. Again the Englishman was booked, and again his side lost on penalties – though on this occasion he took one, and scored. He would never again play in the finals of an international competition.For Gascoigne and the rest of the England team, and indeed their nation, each passing year makes the memories of this game both more sweet and more bitter. In what is now almost half a century since their one World Cup win they have rarely produced such a convincing performance in a match of such magnitude, and that it failed to bring any reward still bridles, particularly with the knowledge that only an unconvincing Argentina team – who had four players of their own suspended for the final – stood between the winners of this game and the World Cup trophy.“The Germans scored a fluky goal and then nothing,” said Mark Wright. “The only genius Germany showed was from the penalty spot,” said Terry Butcher. “We were the better team. We battered them,” said Gascoigne. “I consider ours to have been one of England’s best performances in the last 25 years,” said Robson. “It’s the one thing I look back on and regret,” said Lineker. “It still rankles. We were within a whisker of a World Cup final. We’d have won it too. Argentina were shot.”To some, the British beatification of the beaten represents a disturbing acceptance of failure and acts as a barrier to success. And this match is hardly unique – it stands on any list of England’s finest all-time World Cup performances alongside the brilliant displays in defeat against both West Germany and Brazil in 1970, and more besides. But what, in the end, is the difference? It’s not as if the team’s display in Turin would have been any better or worse had Pearce and Waddle scored from the spot and Olaf Thon missed. If a team succeeds in entertaining and inspiring us, it hardly matters whether they return home with their chins on the floor or with medals round their necks. Though one day it might be nice if we got to witness the latter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1553f3db2bc71f1cf4d8b1b5db816d3b7f7a4ab1/516_282_3680_2208/master/3680.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0894a5a8e3c6d6035e7fc36ee9a4c523","title":"manchester united womens side casey stoney manager","story":"With her standing in the game and experience, the former England captain would be the ideal candidate to lead United’s relaunched women’s sideAfter weeks of quiet rumblings, it is now being widely reported that the announcement that former England captain Casey Stoney will be the manager of the new Manchester United women’s team is imminent.When United revealed their intention to relaunch a women’s side and bid for entry into the new Women’s Championship (second tier) for the 2018-19 season, it was clear that the job would be highly sought after.United will not be confirming the news until the Football Association reveals the league status of the teams that have applied in the second round for the Women’s Super League and Women’s Championship, expected on Sunday. The FA have confirmed that there are up to four places available in tier one and five in tier two. With 15 teams fighting it out for those nine places, there is likely to be disquiet if United are handed a spot at the expense of a longer-established team. Yet they are not the only side who are benefiting from the changes. Other teams will be moving up, with Brighton \u0026amp Hove Albion having already been granted a move into the top flight.In 2014, when the Women’s Super League structure was revamped and expanded, Manchester City were parachuted into tier one at the expense of Doncaster Rovers Belles. It is a move which still causes consternation, yet few would question the evident benefits of City’s investment in women’s football in recent years.With professional women’s football now on the cards, the introduction of a team from one of the biggest and most widely supported clubs in the world will have many positive implications, and with the women’s game very much still at the beginning of a journey, memories of the start will likely be short.How United go about setting up their team will help, and bringing in Stoney is a very smart move for the club, Stoney herself, and women’s football in England.While the 36-year-old’s managerial experience is limited to a brief spell as player-manager at Chelsea in 2009, she has slowly worked her way through her coaching badges, has led training sessions with development teams at Liverpool – where she ended her playing career – and has been vital to Phil Neville as an assistant coach in his first few months in charge of the Lionesses.Stoney knows football and is brilliant at reading the game, but she also knows the women’s game inside out. During a lengthy playing career which included spells at Arsenal, Charlton, Lincoln, Chelsea and Liverpool, she has experienced it all, from winning trophies to clubs folding. Stoney is also a proven leader having captained many of the sides she played for, alongside raking up 130 caps for England, preceding Steph Houghton as captain of the Lionesses and leading Team GB at the 2012 Olympics.United handing such a well-liked and respected member of the women’s football community, pinpointed by many as a future England manager, the chance to build a squad from scratch will earn them considerable credit. They are taking a chance on her potential and have picked her from a rumoured four-strong shortlist.They also stand to benefit greatly from her profile, both from a marketing point of view – Stoney is a role model and was one of the first gay players in the women’s game to speak publicly about her sexuality – and on the pitch. The respect she garners professionally will mean she has no problem recruiting talent to her new project.For Stoney, this is an opportunity that would be hard to rival. She has the chance to build from the bottom up, without the baggage accumulated by previous managers, at a club with resources and a top-class youth set-up already established. If United are granted the tier-two license they’ve bid for, Stoney has the profile to recruit players from tier one and abroad to balance a squad being built to not just earn top-flight status but be able to compete for trophies.There are a host of former United academy prospects who have gone on to leading clubs such as England and Manchester City midfielder Izzy Christiansen, Everton defender Gabby George, 18-year-old City forward Ella Toone, Liverpool’s Ellie Fletcher and Emily Ramsey, Juventus’s Katie Zelem and Chelsea keeper Fran Kitching, and there may well be an attempt to lure some of them back to their roots.The one down side to the potential move is the short-term loss to England. Though there can be little doubt this is a appointment that will have been supported by Neville. He will certainly miss Stoney’s experience but having her managing at what will likely become one of the biggest women’s teams in the country is something England will hopefully eventually benefit from.• Arsenal’s late attempt to unseat Manchester City from next season’s Champions League failed as the Cityzens beat Everton 3-0. Arsenal thrashed Bristol City 6-1 but finish a point behind Manchester City in third. Chelsea looked like they had thrown away the chance to finish the season unbeaten when goals from Jess Clarke and Niamh Charles saw them 2-0 down at Liverpool. Eni Aluko pulled one back - the Blues’ 100th goal of the season- before Ji So-yun scored twice to hand Chelsea victory and an invincible season.• Women in Football has launched a campaign aimed at changing the landscape for women working in the industry. The #WhatIf campaign encourages businesses and iniduals to pledge a way in which they could contribute to an improvement for women and girls in the industry.

Dzsenifer Marozsan had a penalty saved by PSG goalkeeper Christine Endler in the 70th minute. Meanwhile, their opponents in the final, Wolfsburg, won the DFB Pokal (German Cup) 3-2 on penalties against Bayern Munich after a 0-0 draw. Caroline Graham Hansen scored the winning kick in front of 17,692 fans. However, Wolfsburg will no doubt be ruing having to go to extra time and penalties ahead of Thursday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e7d4184da16db822c94e6b752f632cf444e13c3/0_0_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91b0718305133404facfd333c04ed2ce","title":"while the city sleeps london after hours a photo essay","story":"Photographer  Sean Smith captures the city at night, from cabaret stars to road maintenance workers, homeless people to fire wardensPhotographer  Sean Smith captures the city at night, from cabaret stars to road maintenance workers, homeless people to fire wardensIn the changing rooms backstage at Proud Cabaret in London, half a dozen performers are crammed together preparing themselves for the evening’s shows. As one liberally applies eye makeup, another fills the air with a cloud of hairspray. There are nipple tassels, high heels, leather and wigs. It’s 8pm and the night is about to begin.“There’s always a buzzing atmosphere while everyone prepares for the doors to open,” says Fiona Jay-Brown, one half of the acrobatic duo Deux Ailes. “There are a lot of performers so it does get very busy backstage but we all do our best to get the show on the road. There’s rarely a backstage panic. Whether it’s missing tit-tape or hairspray running out, we all help each other out.”Over at the Houses of Parliament, the scene is quiet and the politicians are long gone. Fire officers Eddie Brennan and Paul Chambers sweep through the House of Lords, past the empty benches, along more than three miles of corridors and down into the bowels of the famous structure, patrolling for potential fire hazards.“It’s a world heritage-listed building and I don’t want to go down as the next Guy Fawkes!” quips Brennan.Drawn from the London Fire Brigade, Brennan and his colleagues oversee numerous government buildings in the area. This past year they have investigated more than 200 alarms and reports of fire “but, touch wood, we haven’t had to fully evacuate the palace in the four years I’ve been working here,” he says.Much of the current palace was built following the devastating fire of 1834. The architect, Charles Barry, used brick, stone and iron to try to minimise the risks of another catastrophe but in the interiors he and Augustus Pugin used vast quantities of highly flammable materials.That said, Brennan notes that people present the greatest risk. “You’ve got people laying data cables next to old plumbing and it’s all out of sight, out of mind you find people propping the fire doors open and forgetting to switch off stoves and heaters and lamps. Even after the latest round of modifications, the palace will always be vulnerable to fire.”Further down the river, another London landmark, Tower Bridge, is also staffed at night. The bridge is raised around 850 times a year for registered vessels with a mast or superstructure of nine metres or more.Tower Bridge was the largest and most sophisticated bascule bridge ever built when it was finished in 1894. The lifting mechanism was originally operated using steam to power the enormous pumping engines these days the hydraulics are driven by oil and electricity while the upper walkway – now a function space with a glass floor offering views directly over the Thames – is lit in vivid pink.With the roads relatively free of congestion, Transport for London begins night maintenance work at the Upper Thames Street tunnel. Opened in 1970, the tunnel carries approximately 35,000 vehicles each day and needs routine repairs every three months.Westminster has become a European hotspot for homelessness, with more and more people moving to the heart of London in search of hope, opportunity and support. By nightfall, not all have managed to get a roof over their heads.The Connection at St Martin’s, next to Trafalgar Square, provides help for approximately 4,500 people a year its night centre accommodates up to 45 people every night – or more during severe weather – on a short-stay basis.“Most of our clients have complex issues so our approach is to help them deal with trauma and help them to gain independence and get their confidence back,” says The Connection’s night centre manager, Paul Symonds.“They’re really relieved to get indoors at night, to have a nutritious hot meal and to get their heads down. It’s like a pool of tranquility while you’re surrounded by the bright lights and madness of central London.”Symonds adds: “You meet the most interesting characters you could ever hope to meet – that’s the joy of the job. I’ve always felt it a privilege really.“We do have our challenging moments with people dealing with addiction and mental health, but generally it’s very fulfilling.”While London sleeps, Spitalfields night market comes alive with traders buying and selling goods. Around 750,000 tonnes of produce passes through the market each year and is shifted by 233 forklifts and about 2,000 employees.The market has been on its present 32-acre site near Hackney Wick since 1992 though its royal charter dates back to 1682 when Charles II granted permission for a twice-weekly market for flesh, fowl and roots.Peter Durber began trading at the market in 1983. “It’s still busy and bustling but it’s evolved to be a very different market over the years,” he says. “It was predominantly white trade with Jewish influence but now there’s a very large ethnic influence which has kept it alive and reflects the ersity of London.”Durber works 12 hours, six nights a week, starting at 3am. “Any sane person would look at the hours we work and think we’re all crazy,” he says. “It’s a bit of a beast but I enjoy what I do and when you have a buzz and you enjoy what you do, the time goes very quickly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bbaf697f9e02adc82dff1a07b81eadf8a6a789f/4_518_4572_2743/master/4572.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28e6046cedd259b0f240883b31d00694","title":"ruby tandoh barbecue recipe malted milk chocolate raspberry smores","story":"This fun dessert is a simple, delicious and delightfully messy way to end the dayYou don’t want fussy desserts on a barbecue day.

But beneath the shock and satanism, there’s sharp social commentary on slavery and spiritual freedomThe musician’s merch table is, to most people, the place where you buy T-shirts, albums and ephemera. At a big arena show there might be grotesquely overpriced satin jackets, or other such tat. The whole point is you part with money for something you will probably discard. When Zeal and Ardor – the musical project of 29-year-old Swiss-American Manuel Gagneux – started touring, they offered something different. Something free, something permanent: fans can get their flash branded with a red hot iron.Have any of Gagneux’s fans actually done it? “Eight people have.” Gagneux laughs at my expression of horror. Why would they do that? “It baffles me, also.” Where do they do it? In the venues? “The venues aren’t too enthused about it.” I imagine not. There must be all sorts of health and safety issues. “Oh, it’s a really hot iron, so it’s pretty sterile. And we disinfect right after. It’s more of an outside-the-venue deal.” Do you wield the iron yourself? “I did the disinfecting and asking ‘Are you sure?’” So who actually applies it? “The artist who actually forged the thing. He’s also the merch guy. So he might be talking it up to people. Oh God, this is a lawsuit waiting to happen.”The idea of anyone wanting red-hot iron pressed into their skin as a souvenir of a gig is horrifying enough, but it’s further complicated by the nature of what Zeal and Ardor is. It came about when Gagneux – the son of a Swiss biologist father and an African-American jazz singer mother – was messing about on the internet forum 4Chan, asking for different genres from which he would then create a song. “One day, some person suggested black music, in different terms” – they used the N-word – “and black metal”. From that sprang the central idea of Zeal and Ardor: what would have happened had the slaves of the deep south turned to satan instead of God?That proposition is explored across two extraordinary and brilliant albums, 2016’s Devil Is Fine, and the forthcoming Stranger Fruit – in which blastbeats and squalling guitars are topped by Gagneux’s self-penned spirituals, modelled after the folklorist Alan Lomax’s field recordings, in which he sings in a remarkable bluesy voice his songs of praise: “He go by many names  Devil is kind  We gonna go home to the flames  Devil is fine.”So the Zeal and Ardor brand isn’t just some particularly grisly piece of body art. It’s a symbol of slavery. “The intent was that no one would ever do it. Because that’s the whole thing: you don’t want this brand. If you do, you’re just an idiot who is following, not thinking for yourself.” He shrugs. “If they want to underline my statement, that’s fine with me. But eight people is enough. If they don’t get the symbolism, let’s not encourage them.”Gagneux insists there’s more than just novelty to what he does. He sees links between the two kinds of music he’s melding – “the emotional extremism of it, but there’s also the thematic thing where Christianity was imposed on the Norwegian people and they rebelled in very dubious ways in the 1990s, and Christianity was also imposed on the American slaves.” Mind you, Norway was Christianised by Olaf II around 980 years before Burzum, Mayhem and the rest inspired the church burnings of the early black metal era.Gagneux had what he accepts was a privileged upbringing in Switzerland (“Of course there was a bit of racism, but it doesn’t compare to being afraid of being shot in the street”), which means that eyebrows have been raised about whether his work is cultural appropriation. “Yeah, but I’m culturally appropriating in two directions.” Maybe, but culturally appropriating metal isn’t a hot issue. There’s no #blackmetallivesmatter movement. “Yes, but that’s why those people are so strict about their music, isn’t it?” he says, noting that parts of the black metal community are furious about him corrupting their music. “I think whether something is cultural appropriation is dependent on intent. Strictly speaking, are Asians allowed to use the circle of fifths? That’s a western thing. It goes into these ridiculous places, and it has a weird tint of auto-segregation. If you make something exclusive to your culture, it’s super regressive.”Does he think he would have got more criticism were he white? “Definitely.” And would that have been fair? “No. It doesn’t have anything to do with what I am. I didn’t have a hand in my ethnicity, so why does that give me the right to do something or not?” The release of Stranger Fruit – the title referring to the Billie Holiday song and the fact that the bodies of black people no longer swing in the wind, but bleed out in the street – meant Gagneux had to postpone repaying a long-owed debt to Swiss society. Several years ago, rather than going for his annual period of national service, he went, instead, to New York for a couple of years. “They weren’t too thrilled when I came back. I contacted them to say we might have to sort something out, and they were furious that the person at the airport didn’t pick me out.”He paid a fine, and last year did civilian service, working with children. He was due to undertake another stint this year, but the government has allowed him to postpone. “It’s pretty loosey goosey. So next year I’m working in an old folks’ home.” Maybe, however, he shouldn’t bring up the subject of Satan. Or treat the residents to an evening of his music. Just fire up the fondue and he’ll be fine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a284a8dbc309c457735a9fc418d2713e0ca6a7d5/0_0_4148_2396/master/4148.jpg?w=880\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=73acbee3531c8155a5f56d6ba56dbf35 1760w","title":"theresa may brexit customs backstop very limited circumstances","story":"Remarks follow Boris Johnson saying Brexiters expect PM to avoid triggering mechanismTheresa May has said that her backstop plan to keep Britain aligned to the customs union beyond 2020 would only apply in a “very limited” set of circumstances as Brexiters ratcheted up pressure on her over the future customs relationship.The prime minister said nobody wanted the UK to resort to the option despite persuading her “war cabinet” to sign up to new proposals last week, marking rare progress on Brexit after weeks of deadlock.Her remarks come after Boris Johnson issued a thinly veiled warning that he and his fellow Brexiters would still expect May to deliver a deal on customs that avoided triggering the backstop, one of the sticking points in talks with Brussels.The foreign secretary said that leave supporters who feared betrayal over future customs arrangements should understand that the prime minister was “very clear that this is not an outcome we desire”.The environment secretary, Michael Gove, told an event organised by the Policy Exchange thinktank: “The whole point about the backstop is that it’s intended not to be implemented, but it’s there just in case.” May rejected the EU’s version of the backstop, which would involve keeping Northern Ireland in the customs union to avoid a hard border, in February when she told parliament no prime minister would accept the UK being so ided. However, some in Westminster believe that if Brussels accepts the UK’s alternative plan, which would retain key aspects of the customs union if a solution to the Irish border problem has not been found, it could become the post-Brexit norm. A customs union is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group. By doing this, they can help avoid the need for costly and time-consuming customs checks during trade between members of the union. Asian shipping containers arriving at Felixstowe or Rotterdam, for example, need only pass through customs once before their contents head to markets all over\u0026nbspEurope. Lorries passing between Dover and Calais avoid delay entirely.Customs are not the only checks that count – imports are also scrutinised for conformity with trading standards regulations and security and immigration purposes – but they do play an important role in determining how much friction there is at the border. A strict customs regime at Dover or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would lead to delays that will be costly for business and disruptive for travellers. Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as car making could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised.In a speech in Macclesfield on Monday, May said: “What we’re proposing is an alternative backstop proposal, but nobody wants this to be the solution that is achieved. “We want to achieve the right solution through our overall relationship with the European Union. If it is necessary, it will be in a very limited set of circumstances for a limited time. But we are working on achieving that commitment to Northern Ireland through our overall relationship with the European Union.”The cabinet remains deadlocked over the final customs arrangement Britain that should pursue and HMRC officials believe neither model under consideration will be ready to implement the end of the transition period in December 2020.It remains unclear whether the EU27 will accept the government’s version of the backstop plan, which would see the UK continue to apply EU tariffs to imports but leave it free to strike new trade deals.Meanwhile the prime minister and Jeremy Corbyn will be in Manchester on Tuesday on the first anniversary of the Manchester Arena bombing.Writing in the Manchester Evening News, the prime minister said: “The targeting of the young and innocent as they enjoyed a carefree night out in the Manchester Arena on May 22nd 2017 was an act of sickening cowardice.“It was designed to strike at the heart of our values and our way of life in one of our most vibrant cities with the aim of breaking our resolve and iding us.“It failed, for such appalling acts of wickedness will do nothing but strengthen our resolve to defeat such twisted ideologies and beliefs.The resilience and determination shown by Manchester in the 12 months since is testament to that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/574470022ee4a071b94a85b39fcc80b46f3e2050/0_89_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f1bb440ad88f3072e6dfaf4e7f93ab8","title":"tony blair says he did not know about belhaj libyan rendition case until after he left office politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenMichael Gove, the Brexiter environment secretary, told the Today programme this morning that any Brexit “backstop” that keeps the UK in the EU’s common external tariff should only apply for a “short time”.The government has agreed to have a “backstop” to avoid the imposition of a hard border in Ireland after Brexit in case its preferred means of avoiding a hard border - a good trade deal, or new customs technology - don’t work.Last week it emerged that ministers have agreed that the backstop would involve the UK remaining bound by the EU’s common external tariff for a period after December 2020, when the transition ends. Brexiters are unhappy about this, because it would be akin to keeping the UK in the customs union after the transition, although No 10 argues that technically the UK would have left. But Gove and other cabinet Brexiters agreed to the plan as a last resort option.In his Today interview Gove said that what was envisaged was just “a temporary infill”. Asked what temporary meant, he said:It means what it says on the tin. That temporary means not permanent. It means for a short period of time. I’m not going to pre-empt the eventual position that we take after we have negotiated with the European Union and with Ireland ...The very nature of a backstop, everyone agrees, is that it should be a temporary infill to bridge the position. In the same way as when you move house, a bridging loan is meant to be temporary, but, whether that’s weeks or months, we don’t know precisely.Iain Duncan Smith, the former work and pensions secretary and another Tory Brexiter, said last week the proposed backstop should not apply for more than two months. Theresa May said yesterday it would apply only “in a very limited set of circumstances for a limited time”.Peers yesterday abandoned their attempt to force a new public inquiry into the media industry, following weeks of parliamentary ping-ping between the two houses of parliament. Opposition politicians forced the government to make a number of concessions, while the Conservatives only won several close votes thanks to the support of Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist party.However, press regulation supporters are now pinning their hopes on one final tactic: a judicial review of culture secretary Matt Hancock’s decision to cancel the second part of the original Leveson inquiry.Press regulation campaigners argue his decision to cancel an already-announced public inquiry was irrational, unfair, and that the open consultation on dropping the second part of Leveson was undermined by the Conservatives’ election manifesto commitment to do exactly that.I covered what Tony Blair said in his Today interview about the Abdel Hakim Belhaj case earlier. (See 9.12am.) This is what he said about Brexit.At the moment we’re in a halfway house. We are in favour, apparently, of staying in a customs union, which will disappoint the most ardent leavers, but we’re not actually in favour of staying in Europe’s economic areas, which is necessary if you want frictionless trade. And so many people who voted remain will then feel less than enthusiastic about Labour ...My sense is that we are in the position now of neither pleasing the remainers nor the leavers.Essentially both parties have got the same problem, which is the central dilemma at the heart of the negotiation is this. You stay close to Europe to minimise economic damage, in which case you abide by Europe’s rules, in which case people say what’s the point. Or you break free from Europe altogether, a clean break, in which case the economic damage is considerable and people say what’s the price. There is no resolution to that dilemma. At some point the government will have to come forward with a proposition. And I think the sensible thing for the Labour party to do is to say, look, if we say we want a jobs first Brexit, that means we stay close to Europe’s economic area. And if people then say what’s the point of leaving, you say the final decision should be taken by the British people if they want to proceed on that basis.Whereas I think that ambiguity probably did serve Labour well at the last election - even though I didn’t agree with it, it may have in the short term served us well - I don’t think it works any more today. Asked what had changed, he said things had “moved on” since last year. He also said:What is different is the quality of our understanding of what the central choice at the heart of this negotiation is.If the Labour party were to say to the country, ‘Look, we’ve looked at this, we’ve had this negotiation, what everyone now understands is that it’s much more complicated than we ever thought, there is this dilemma at the heart of of it, we think the only way to minimise economic damage, as business and industry and many others are saying, is to keep close to Europe, we agree then it poses a great dilemma’ ... But the way of resolving that is the Labour party then to say, ‘That’s why, therefore, parliament should make its decision but finally the decision should be taken by the people, who originally voted for Brexit and mandated this negotiation’.I think that would be a winning position for two reasons. First of all, you would actually mobilise that remain vote. But, secondly, you would be saying to the leave people, ‘Look, ultimately you can take the decision’ ...You could build a coalition between those people who voted remain and those people who voted leave but would understand that they are ultimately going to get the choice as to what happens.It’s a pretty extraordinary situation. You’ve got a government that’s in a state of considerable disarray, huge problems with the health service, problems on law and order, problems across the spectrum, and we’re not even ahead of the Conservatives in the opinion polls. Tony Blair was on the Today programme talking about a report that his thinktank, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, has published today about Brexit and customs.Here is the report. And here is a commentary on it by Blair himself.Tony Blair was on the Today programme this morning. He was mostly talking about Brexit - more of that later - but towards the end Mishal Husain pointed out that it was his first interview since the government apologised to the Libyan dissident to Abdel Hakim Belhaj and his wife, Fatima Boudchar, for the role the UK played in their rendition in 2004. Belhaj was tortured and Boudchar, who was pregnant when kidnapped and mistreated, was paid £500,000 by the UK government in compensation. Husain asked Blair would he would like to say about the case. The exchange did not last long, but it was edgy and Blair’s answers were surprising - not least because they beg more questions than they answer.Here are the main points.No. This case wasn’t brought to my attention. There are a lot of things in this case, some of which have been out in the media, some of which have not. There’s been a settlement of the case. I’m content to go along with the government’s apology in relation to it. It’s not something I dealt with myself when I was in government. I think that’s all I can say.This has been subject to a long legal process. I have gone along with what the government has done, which was issue the apology. I did not actually know myself about this case until after I left office. So I’m content to go along with that apology. And that’s all that’s frankly sensible for me to say.Of course I’m sorry for any mistreatment that’s been given to people. How on earth would you ever justify that. By contrast Jack Straw, who was foreign secretary at the time, admitted he did know about the case, or at least about some aspects of it. Here is the statement he issued on the day of the government’s apology.Here is the agenda for the day.8am: Theresa May chairs a political cabinet, followed by a normal cabinet meeting at 9.30am.10am: Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee.

They routinely trigger profoundly negative personal, financial, health and behavioural outcomes,” the study concludes.Despite claims by ministers in recent years that rigorously enforced conditionality – including mandatory 35-hour job searches – incentivised claimants to move off benefits into work, the study found the positive impact was negligible.It calls for a review of the use of sanctions, including an immediate moratorium on benefit sanctions for disabled people who are disproportionately affected, together with an urgent “rebalancing” of the social security system to focus less on compliance and more on helping claimants into work.In the “rare” cases where claimants did move off benefits into sustained work, researchers found that personalised job support, not sanctions, was the key factor. With few exceptions, however, jobcentres were more focused on enforcing benefit rules rather than helping people get jobs, the study found.“Although some examples of good practice are evident, much of the mandatory job search, training and employment support offered by Jobcentre Plus and external providers is too generic, of poor quality and largely ineffective in enabling people to enter and sustain paid work,” it says.For those people interviewed for the study who did obtain work, the most common outcome was a series of short-term, insecure jobs, interspersed with periods of unemployment, rather than a shift into sustained, well-paid work.Sanctions generally delivered poor outcomes, including debt, poverty and reliance on charities such as food banks, the study found. Often imposed for trivial and seemingly cruel reasons, they frequently triggered high levels of stress, anxiety and depression.“The outcomes from sanctions are almost universally negative,” said the director of the study, Prof Peter Dwyer of the University of York.The study found that, in many cases, the threat of sanctions had the unintended effect of encouraging a “culture of counterproductive compliance and futile behaviour” among some claimants, who learned “the rules of the game” rather than becoming genuinely engaged with work.Claimants with chaotic lives – who were homeless or had addictions, for example – reacted to the “inherent hassle” of the conditionality system by dropping out of the social security system altogether. In some cases, they moved into survival crime, such as drug dealing.Low-paid workers on universal credit who were subject to so-called “in-work conditionality” – a requirement for them to work more hours or face sanctions - in some cases elected to sign off, foregoing rent support and tax credits, to avoid what they saw as constant, petty harassment from jobcentre staff.Welfare conditionality – the notion that eligibility for benefits and services should be linked to claimants’ compliance with certain rules and behaviours – has been progressively embedded into the UK social security system since the 1990s, although the scope and severity intensified dramatically after 2012.Sanctions are imposed when claimants supposedly breach jobcentre rules, typically by failing to turn up for appointments or applying for enough jobs. They are effectively fined by having their benefit payments stopped for a minimum of four weeks (about £300) and a maximum of three years.At its peak in 2013, under the then secretary of state for work and pensions, Iain Duncan Smith, there were more than a million sanctions. Between 2010 and 2015, a quarter of all people on jobseeker’s allowance were sanctioned, with the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) issuing £132m in sanctions penalties in 2015.Sanctions fell to 350,000 in 2016 as a series of critical reports emerged questioning their effectiveness and calling for changes, including from the all-party work and pensions select committee, the DWP’s social security advisory committee and the National Audit Office. A fresh inquiry by MPs into sanctions is under way.The Economic and Social Research Council-funded welfare conditionality study was carried out between 2013 and 2018 by researchers at six universities. It included repeat qualitative interviews over two years with 481 welfare service users in England and Scotland as well as interviews with 57 policy experts and 27 focus groups.Dalia Ben-Galim, the policy director at the single parents’ charity Gingerbread, said: “Rather than threatening single parents with sanctions and widening the ‘conditionality’ agenda, it would be much more valuable to enable the conditions to support employment such as affordable childcare, access to flexible work and personalised support through job centres.”“We tailor requirements to inidual cases and sanctions are only used in a very small percentage of cases when people fail to meet their agreed requirements set out in their claimant commitment.”Labour’s shadow secretary for work and pensions Margaret Greenwood said: “The current sanctions system is immoral and ineffective. It is not helping people into employment and at the same time is leaving vulnerable people on the brink of destitution, without any source of income for long periods.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfa557fe09edce198afe76d838b5c31d1828e997/5_0_5319_3192/master/5319.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e890db8dd82e14357952661d8361b403","title":"the truth about obesogens can dust and chemicals make you fat","story":"Researchers suspect that taking your shoes off, getting rid of carpets and dusting can prevent chemicals building up that may affect our hormones – and our waistlines. But is it good science?However, experts are sceptical, particularly in the light of one report this week. It has made the bold claim that “removing shoes when entering the house and swapping carpet for wooden floors could help people stay slim”, citing a talk by researchers at the universities of Aveiro and Beira Interior in Portugal, who have suggested that preventing obesogens accumulating in the house by frequently sweeping and dusting could stop us gaining weight.As Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, says: “For some medical reasons, such as protection against allergies, yes, it’s advised to keep a dust-free home and so, too, is removing shoes to avoid bringing in dirt from outside, but these things will not make you a healthy weight. Only a balanced diet and regular exercise will do that.”It is not the first study to moot the idea of the existence of obesogens. Earlier this year, researchers at Harvard University suggested compounds called perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) – widely used in products such as stain repellents and known to have a number of negative effects on human health – might lead to weight gain.Others have voiced concerns that it isn’t even clear whether the level of supposed obesogens in house dust would be enough to affect the body anyway. “I think this is one of the cases where the researcher’s statement that “further studies are needed” is particularly important,” says Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University, who points out that while some of these chemicals have been shown to enter our diet, it’s not yet clear if they contribute to obesity in humans and to what degree – even if effects are found in some animals. But, he adds, other factors are more likely to be behind the rise in obesity. “We have very detailed evidence from innumerable studies, including dietary intervention studies, that show unequivocally that our change of diet – increased fatsugarcalorie consumption – and lifestyle – less exercise – in recent decades has caused the obesity crisis,” he adds. “Ultimately, no matter how obesogens or anything else might reset energy regulatory systems, you cannot get fat unless you consume the calories.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea5c9edd10142de8da8cdff3b3e18bc2fa290140/136_520_4449_2669/master/4449.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e62089d8d78c158d10dae4b1a22f3e4","title":"own limited edition print sports photographer eamonn mccabe","story":"The award-winning sports photographer Eamonn McCabe, a former  head of photography, looks back at his favourite sporting images from the 1970s and 80s.

He believes its lines are now more relevant than everLast summer, I went to the Playground theatre in west London to discuss the first stage production of my play Shirleymander about Shirley Porter and the “homes for votes” scandal of the 1980s. When I arrived at Latimer Road tube station, a short walk from the theatre, I smelled the tainted air, saw the blackened husk of Grenfell Tower, and knew immediately that this would be the right play in the right place.Seventy-two people died in the fire that broke out at Grenfell on 14 June 2017. Over the weeks that followed, the newly opened theatre, which is in a converted bus depot, became a space where traumatised locals could meet and talk, vent and grieve. The organisation Grief Encounter held workshops there, giving counselling and support to some of the many families directly affected by the fire. The long dark shadow of Grenfell falls over the Playground theatre now, as it does over Kensington and Chelsea borough council and local and national housing policies going back decades. Ten years ago, I read Andrew Hosken’s compelling book Nothing Like a Dame about Shirley Porter’s two catastrophic terms as leader of Westminster council, when she pursued policies that (in Hosken’s words) “consumed communities, reputations, lives and hopes and eventually herself”. In 1986, the Tories came within a whisker of losing this flagship London borough to Labour. Shocked by this, Porter embarked on a secretive and illegal scheme to ensure it could never happen again. She moved likely Labour voters (disabled, homeless, elderly and poor people) out of marginal wards and enticed in Tories. She put families with young children into two decaying, asbestos-contaminated tower blocks. Senior council officers were sucked into this gerrymandering conspiracy and corrupted. The atmosphere in City Hall at the time was toxic.Porter’s plot worked. In 1990, the Tories won Westminster by a landslide. In 1991, John Major made Porter a dame for “services to local government”. A decade later, following an investigation by the district auditor, she paid more than £12m to settle a surcharge imposed on her. I was struck by the drama inherent in these events. The insolence and inhumanity of wealth and power. Viral corruption bleeding down from the top, tainting all it touched. The ultimate, if far from inevitable, triumph of justice and decency. The character of Porter herself seemed a gift to a playwright: autocratic, bullying, possessing vast wealth and boundless energy, yet riddled with insecurities haunted by her late father, the barrow boy who founded Tesco. I loved the shape of the story. In Porter’s spectacular rise and fall I saw the same hubristic arc found in Shakespearean tragedy. Dame Shirley seemed to me Macbeth with shoulder pads. Richard III in a pink velour leisure suit. I wrote a version of the play for Radio 4. It went out in November 2009. Reviews described it as a tragic comedy, a comedy-drama. I’m fine with that. Porter’s story is full of heartlessness and hurt but there’s humour in it, too: a touch of the ridiculous to certain situations and characters cracking jokes on the edge of the abyss. If the audience in the Playground theatre never laughs out loud, I’ll be deeply disappointed. Though I hope the laughter will feel queasy at times, and catch in their throats. By 2015, I realised that the policies once pursued by Porter in Westminster are now being carried out by councils and developers across London and beyond. The motive has changed – in the 80s it was political advantage, now it’s money (so perfectly legal) – but the effect is the same: suffering and social cleansing. Poor families are shunted into accommodation that’s squalid and unsafe, while more suitable homes are sold off as investment properties. Young couples can no longer afford to live where they were born and raised. Perfectly liveable council estates, with long-established communities, are razed and “redeveloped” into luxury apartments.Over the past three years, barely a week has passed without some fresh news item that rhymes with the “homes for votes” scandal. So last year I felt the time had come to revisit Shirleymander. It was never my intention to rewrite the play to shoehorn in today’s headlines, but I didn’t need to. Lines I wrote a decade ago about events in the 1980s are now more relevant than ever. Obviously, I’m not blaming Shirley Porter for the tragedy that befell the residents of Grenfell Tower. But I believe her calculated callousness, that saw homeless people swept up like so much litter, reveals the same mindset that allowed “years of neglect” (in Sadiq Khan’s words) to result in the horror of the Grenfell fire."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5423ad310656a204e98ddd730f8523fc72844b18/0_89_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac9bfd50eeeb7ac4eb77669d26d278d6","title":"european parliament livestream mark zuckerberg appearance facebook","story":"Facebook chief initially agreed to closed-door meeting, but will now speak publiclyMark Zuckerberg will appear publicly before the European parliament on Tuesday, ending a terse standoff with the institution, but further inflaming tensions with the House of Commons, which has repeatedly requested an appearance from the Facebook founder.The president of the European parliament, Antonio Tajani, announced on Monday morning that Zuckerberg’s appearance would be publicly livestreamed, following criticism that the Facebook chief executive had initially managed to persuade the body to meet him behind closed doors.“I have personally discussed with Facebook CEO Mr Zuckerberg the possibility of webstreaming meeting with him,” Tajani tweeted. “I am glad to announce that he has accepted this new request. Great news for EU citizens. I thank him for the respect shown towards EP.”Zuckerberg is scheduled to appear in front of the parliament’s conference of presidents at 5.15pm BST. The conference consists of the leaders of the parliament’s eight main political groups. Also in attendance will be the Labour MEP Claude Moraes, who chairs the European parliament’s home affairs committee, and Tajani.The European parliament appearance may help thaw relations between Facebook and the EU, but it has further antagonised the British parliament, which has been repeatedly requesting that Zuckerberg appear in front of its digital, culture, media and sport select committee as part of an investigation into fake news.Damian Collins, the chairman of the DCMS committee, said: “The Facebook data breach was executed in the UK and the data went to a UK company, affecting more than 1 million UK users.“The UK parliament therefore should be able to question Mark Zuckerberg about this and the lessons to be learned from it, and we remain open to him giving evidence.”Collins and the committee suggested a number of questions the European parliament should ask Zuckerberg, based on unsatisfactory answers given by one of his deputies, Mike Schroepfer, in April.“If Mark Zuckerberg chooses not to address our questions directly, we are asking colleagues at the European parliament to help us get answers,” Collins said “Particularly on who knew what at the company, and when, about the data breach and the non-transparent use of political adverts which continue to undermine our democracy.”As long as Zuckerberg remains outside Britain, there is little the committee can do to compel his testimony. However, it has discussed the prospect of issuing formal summons against the Facebook founder and other iniduals who refuse to give evidence. If continually ignored, those could ultimately lead to arrest for contempt of parliament."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba0ba12e8f640eaeed6184f1214935a6ce3bdae0/89_7_555_333/master/555.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe3ea48cbd2910ce4606bb9c79654413","title":"silicon valley pastor gregory stevens wealth liberals","story":"Gregory Stevens resigns after tweets about Palo Alto, slamming tech industry greed and empty social justice promisesA Silicon Valley pastor has resigned from his church after calling the city of Palo Alto an “elitist shit den of hate” and criticizing the hypocrisy of “social justice” activism in the region.Gregory Stevens confirmed Monday that he had stepped down from the First Baptist Church of Palo Alto, an LGBT-inclusive congregation, after his personal tweets calling out the contradictions of wealthy liberals in northern California surfaced at a recent council hearing. In emails to the , the 28-year-old minister detailed his “exasperation” with Palo Alto, a city in the heart of the technology industry, surrounded by severe income inequality and poverty. “I believe Palo Alto is a ghetto of wealth, power, and elitist liberalism by proxy, meaning that many community members claim to want to fight for social justice issues, but that desire doesn’t translate into action,” Stevens wrote, lamenting that it was impossible for low-income people to live in the city. “The insane wealth inequality and the ignorance toward actual social justice is absolutely terrifying.”He later added: “The tech industry is motivated by endless profit, elite status, rampant greed, and the myth that their technologies are somehow always improving the world.”Local headlines about Stevens, who has faced intense backlash from residents and city leaders, labeled his tweets “nasty”, “vile”, “unsavory” and “unholy”, highlighting posts in which he called Palo Alto “disgusting” and said: “I hate ‘social justice’ in Palo Alto. What a fucking joke.” Local critics had surfaced Stevens’ tweets while opposing an effort by the church to get permits to allow new community activities in the space. His old tweets were geared to “small group of progressive ministers and Leftist political activists”, he said, adding that he had vented his frustrations in “an unprofessional and often hurtful way” and was resigning to “minimize the negativity” facing the church.But, he later added, “I think rage and anger toward oppression and injustice is a Biblical calling on our lives.”The underlying messages to Stevens’ tweets, however, touched on continuing tension in Silicon Valley, where some of the world’s wealthiest companies and entrepreneurs have pledged to better the world through innovations, yet working class families and poor residents struggle to afford the most basic necessities. The region has one of the worst homelessness crises in the country and a huge shortage of affordable housing, forcing tens of thousands of low-income workers to commute more than 50 miles to work.Stevens, who is queer and has lived in Palo Alto for nearly three years, noted that his church was located in one of the richest neighborhoods in the city, with houses worth anywhere from $5m to $15m. “Jesus was a homeless Jew who said it was harder for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven than for a camel to get through the eye of a needle,” he wrote, adding: “It is very difficult to do Christian ministry, a ministry that calls us to fight with and for the poor and marginalized among us, in the midst of an enclave of wealth and power.”He argued that the church’s rich neighbors could afford to “feed and house” all the homeless people in Palo Alto and surrounding cities, but instead focused on passing laws that further criminalized this population, encouraging police to harass those sleeping outside or in cars. The city had also made it hard for the church to provide meals for the homeless by requiring costly permits, he said. In his email to the , Stevens was also outspoken about the harms of the tech sector, accusing Facebook of “completely destroying (through rapid gentrification) the historical black and brown East Palo Alto neighborhood”, which is adjacent to the tech company’s Menlo Park headquarters and not far from his church. “The working class does not benefit from these ‘advances’, but cook, clean, and baby sit rich babies before heading off to home on long hours of public transit.”Stevens said he was originally drawn to the church because of its “progressive Baptist theology”, noting historical Baptist figures such as Nat Turner, who led a slave revolt, and Martin Luther King Jr. He said he was also inspired by the local pastor, a gay man who had fought for years to be ordained. But Palo Alto, he said, “wanted nothing to do with actual justice and was more so interested in guarding their enclave of power and wealth”, adding: “If the wealth inequalities are not addressed, any talk about climate change, homelessness, and migrant rights is in vain.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa064e804025eedffabff6bc754b5311e7210010/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8636606b3b7e30bc02b88b28a28bc973","title":"dundee on lonely planet best in europe hotlist 2018 emilia romagna cantabria","story":"The Scottish city has a top 10 slot on this year’s list – along with Emilia-Romagna and Cantabria – as the guidebook publisher looks to reflect concerns about overtourismThe “thriving, creative” city of Dundee has been rated as one of the best places in Europe to visit this year by Lonely Planet. The travel guide publisher has attempted to tackle the issue of overtourism in its annual holiday hotlist, by highlighting lesser-visited destinations across the continent.Dundee is Scotland’s fourth largest city and is sixth on Lonely Planet’s Best in Europe 2018 list. It earned the spot for its “head-turning” urban redevelopment, including the transformation of its historic waterfront and the opening of a new branch of the V\u0026ampA this September .Lonely Planet describes it as an “exciting moment” for a city that has often been overlooked by visitors to Scotland, and praised its “nationally important museums and attractions” and “dynamic, creative spirit”.The number one spot went to Emilia-Romagna in Italy. The region was picked out as an alternative to Tuscany, Campania and Veneto, and for its emergence as one of the best foodie spots in the country. Emilia-Romagna is the home of ragù, Parma ham, balsamic vinegar and Parmesan cheese. Recently Bologna, the regional capital, saw the opening of the world’s largest culinary theme park, Fico Eataly, where visitors can sample all manner of local cuisine. Other picks on the list included the wild beaches, mountains and “enchanted” villages of Cantabria, Spain (a far cry from the overcrowded attractions of Barcelona and the Costa del Sol) and Kosovo, which boasts “dramatic hiking trails, Ottoman-era history and a growing cultural scene”. “There is growing concern over the increase in tourism to popular European destinations, particularly over the busy summer months, so with this list we wanted to show that there are a wealth of incredible alternatives to discover across Europe,” said Lonely Planet editorial director, Tom Hall.

No wonder Oprah raves about itA few years ago my husband and I rented a bungalow in the Californian mission town of San Luis Obispo. We lived next to a firefighter and an octogenarian cowboy named Webb. There were annual block parties, potluck suppers, a coveted tomato growing prize (the champion donning a flowing silk cape, parading around our cul-de-sac). Saturday nights at the Sunset Drive-In, one of the few remaining outdoor cinemas in California, we swung our legs from our car boot, wrapped in blankets, radio tuned in for the movie. On the giant screen a cola bottle sang and danced with a tub of popcorn. We couldn’t believe our luck.But, as the song goes, nothing ever lasts forever. When word got out we were moving, Webb came by with a bottle of moonshine. “Goddamn,” he said, leaning against his farm truck, shaking his head. “Los Angeles?” He had a demonic view of big city life. This was a bad business. Webb gazed into the middle distance in the direction of his cattle ranch. Why in the world, he pondered, would anyone be stupid enough to leave San Luis? It was a good question. San Luis Obispo (SLO) is often used as a refuelling point for motorists cruising up and down scenic Highway 1, which runs along California’s Pacific coastline, and is home to the world’s first motel, originally called the Milestone Mo-Tel. Perhaps no surprise, then, that most visitors tend to just stretch their legs or stay a night at the uber-kitsch Madonna Inn on the outskirts before motoring on. This is a crying shame because this dreamy college town, once named the happiest place in America by Oprah Winfrey, should be a destination all of its own.On a warm autumn morning, I dodge Friday traffic and catch the early train from LA to revisit old friends. As we draw close the landscape is mesmeric: golden hills, vineyards, citrus groves, craggy peaks. The leisurely speed of the train, which teeters along the precipitous Californian coastline before arcing inland towards San Luis, feels fitting to the relaxed pace of life in SLO, a town with a laid- back attitude. Nothing much seems to have changed. In Scout Coffee, locals – in no hurry to get to work – sun themselves in the window of the airy cafe. Like me, the owners, Sara and Jon Peterson, moved to the area on a whim. “I’m from the midwest,” Sara tells me. “I remember stopping through here when I was in college and we got a sandwich from this tiny health food store which blew my mind.” She gestures towards the leafy avenue of shops. “I thought it was the coolest town.”Round the corner on the main drag, Higuera Street, freshmen from California Polytechnic State University on the edge of town are having a guided tour. The street is wide and shady, the ficus trees knitting into a canopy overhead. One student ducks down a passage to make his mark on SLO’s most baffling attraction, Bubblegum Alley, a walkway so stuccoed with gum it’s almost Pollock-esque. By nightfall, inhibitions gone, most of the freshers will end up at SLO Brew, the largest music venue in town which doubles as a brewery. As locals we used to roll our eyes at the students’ drunken antics – a neighbour found one asleep on her sofa – but the truth is they gave us something to grumble about.SLO Brew has a number of large, loft-like suites for rent, my home for the night. Each plush apartment comes furnished with a ukulele and, mercifully, a jar of complementary earplugs. Which is lucky because I’ve persuaded two friends to join me on a pre-dawn hike up nearby Madonna Mountain (the sort of early bird, outdoor activity that SLO natives pride themselves on). At 5.30am we’re not the first to hit the trail. Joggers’ torches flicker on the hillside ahead of us as we corkscrew 1,300 feet to the top, scrambling the last few meters to the boulder tipped peak just as the sun rises. The town below is cupped by the surrounding hills, flaxen in autumn, turning a lush emerald in late winter, almost implausibly green. My favourite time of year is spring when Californian wild flowers bloom, spray-painting the fields neon orange and pink. A herd of cattle grazing on the far hillside is a reminder that this is cowboy country. (The annual Mid State Fair in nearby Paso Robles hosts a sweltering 12-day hoedown in July, complete with turkey racing, rodeo, corn dogs, tractor pulling and cow milking demos.)From the summit I can see at least two of the Nine Sisters chain of volcanic mountains and hills. It’s thanks in part to these long-extinct volcanoes that produce grown around San Luis Obispo is so good. The first time I visited SLO’s Thursday evening market, my husband and I sat on the pavement and devoured an entire punnet of strawberries shiny as patent leather. The weekly event feels more like a street party. Smoke billows above racks of BBQ ribs chefs yell orders and rattle their utensils. Tri-tip, a sirloin cut, is the local speciality but I love the grilled artichoke, which comes with a pot of warm garlicky butter.Down from the mountain I grab a breakfast burrito at vegetarian café Linnaea’s, excellent fuel for some window shopping. San Luis Obispo is not known for high- end fashion, it’s more a shorts and T-shirt kind of place, but it has a few gems. Design store, Len Collective, has a tempting selection of textiles and chic clothing. Another favourite is Ruby Rose with its secondhand treasures: vintage cotton smocks, cowboy boots and mid-century furniture. The rainbow striped building next door is the HQ of Pipsticks, a sticker emporium, whose industrial storefront makes stationary feel hip. In the summer months, when students depart and temperatures rise, SLO has a languorous feel. Locals and tourists alike head to the beach. Nearby Morro Bay has some excellent waves but from May to October the star attractions are humpback whales. Boat tours from the harbour get you surprisingly close (we once had a humpback circling our boat). Just south of SLO, Avila Beach has slightly warmer water and mellower waves for swimming, though the real draw is the Olde Port Fish Market. In a shed at the far end of Port San Luis Pier, fishmongers cook up fresh crab while you wait. Best of all, beneath the pier are piles of snoozing sea lions, close enough to see their whiskers twitching. Before I catch my train home I take one last stroll through the Mission plaza, blinding white in the late-afternoon sunshine, past City Hall and the candy-striped front of Frank’s Famous Hot Dog’s, towards my old neighbourhood. Home from feeding his cows, Webb pulls up his truck. “Look what the cat dragged in. Get over here.” He gives me a long, vice-like hug. There is an exchange of news: babies born, heifers sold, the price of a tank of petrol. Just over the hill cars glide along Highway 1 and disappear into a golden horizon. It’s no surprise that America, a nation built on migration, has such love for the open road. But leaning against Webb’s bonnet, chewing the fat, I have to wonder, what’s the big hurry?• Amtrak’s Pacific Surfliner service runs daily from Los Angeles to San Luis Obispo (5 ½ hours, $42 each way) "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4968eabfd3644381de81b1bb2026c7a1e0477ae/0_0_3788_2273/master/3788.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46d88dc49988e54ac30aa3d0a8073419","title":"hawaii puna geothermal venture power plant shut down as lava nears geothermal wells","story":"Crews cap wells at Puna Geothermal Venture plant on Big Island as lava from Kīlauea volcano flows on to site Lava from the erupting Kīlauea volcano on Hawaii’s Big Island has flowed on to a geothermal power plant site, forcing workers to shut down the facility to prevent the uncontrollable release of toxic gases.The plant’s wells run 6,000 to 8,000 feet (1,829-2,438 metres) underground to tap into extremely hot water and steam used to run turbines and produce electricity. “County, state, and federal partners have been collaborating closely to monitor the situation and work with PGV to ensure the safety of the surrounding communities,” county officials said. The risk to the power plant marks the latest challenge facing authorities as they cope with what geologists rank as one of the biggest upheavals in a century from one of the world’s most active volcanoes. The latest explosive eruption at the Kīlauea summit occurred shortly before 6pm local time on Monday, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory reported. “The resulting ash plume may affect surrounding areas,” it said.The plant has been closed since shortly after lava began erupting on 3 May through newly opened fissures in the ground running through neighbourhoods and roads on the far eastern flank of Kīlauea. Within a week, some 60,000 gallons (227,124 litres) of the highly flammable chemical pentane, which was stored at the plant, were moved from harm’s way. The state said last week it was pumping cold water into the wells and would cap them with iron plugs. About three miles (5km) to the east of the plant on the coast, noxious clouds of acid fumes, steam and fine glass-like particles billowed into the sky as lava poured into the ocean from two flows cutting across Highway 137, one of the main exit routes from the eruption zone. Laze – a term combining the words “lava” and “haze” – is formed when erupting lava, which can reach 1,093C (2,000F) reacts with seawater. It is potentially deadly if inhaled.“If one were to be near the laze, because of the various acids, it would be corrosive to the eyes, the nose and respiratory tract, and the skin,” Dr Alvin Bronstein, from the Hawaii state department of health, told journalists on a conference call. Laze killed two people when a lava flow reached the coast in 2000, and authorities warned residents to stay clear of it. Another hazard was the potential for methane gas explosions as searing lava neared pockets of rotting vegetation, igniting traces of the flammable gas given off by the decay. “These are quite a big hazard in vegetative areas and the explosions can occur well away from the lava flow itself,” USGS geologist Janet Babb said. Geologists say Kīlauea’s eruption, which has already produced around two dozen lava-spewing fissures, has now entered a more violent phase, in which larger volumes of molten rock are oozing from the ground and traveling farther than before. At least 44 homes and other structures have been destroyed in the Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens area of the Puna district, and a man was seriously injured on Saturday when a plate-sized chunk of molten rock shot out of a fissure and struck him on the leg. Two thousand people have been ordered from their homes due to lava flows and toxic sulfur dioxide gas, levels of which have tripled in the last two days, according to civil defence officials. The Hawaii National Guard has warned of more mandatory evacuations if further highways are blocked."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f92346c8ca4bffdf7a430cb63308b380556142fa/121_1004_1228_737/master/1228.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02b33ce72cd6eb5bcbe99f742d8bc877","title":"rod gidwitz us belgium ambassador nominee","story":"Ron Gidwitz, who helped fund president’s campaign, faces court case over Illinois project condemned by Obama and othersA major financial backer of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, who once owned a housing estate in which low-income tenants were said to endure “inhumane” living standards, has been nominated as the US ambassador to Belgium.Ron Gidwitz, a 73-year-old businessman from Chicago gave Trump and other Republicans $700,000 in 2016, and acted as the presidential candidate’s campaign finance chair in Illinois. He will now undergo a month in a US state department “ambassadorial school” before making the move to Brussels.There is a certain amount of relief in Belgium that the nomination has been made at all – more than a year after the last US ambassador left the country’s embassy in Brussels.But Gidwitz could yet prove to be a controversial pick in the mould of Pete Hoekstra, Trump’s ambassador to the Netherlands, who was forced to apologise over his suggestion that immigration from majority Islamic countries had created “no-go zones” in the country.In 2013, Gidwitz told a court that he would not invest in the complex as it would be equivalent to a charitable donation, and if the owners had wanted to make charitable donations, there were better options.The housing project was eventually taken over by the city of Joliet. But in a continuing related court case, Gidwitz was forced to acknowledge that politicians including the then senator Barack Obama had complained about “inhumane conditions” on the project, where there was said to be an overwhelming stench of urine.Gidwitz admitted to a court in 2017 that a girl had fallen from a window and died during a hot summer when the building’s air conditioning was malfunctioning and broken window screens had not been replaced, the Chicago Tribune reported.He also admitted that a tenant was stabbed to death in a laundry room when security was not upgraded and that a shot man may have lain dying in the building’s courtyard for an hour before police were called, the Tribune reported. Security staff were said to be too scared to approach people entering the estate.The mayor of Joliet has described the 356-unit complex of high-rise apartments as “unsafe and dangerous, a public nuisance and a blighted area”. A judge subsequently agreed that the standards were “deplorable”. Guy Chipparoni, a spokesman for Gidwitz, defended the Gidwitz family’s management of the apartment complex and said other visitors “left with a much different impression of the property and of the people who live there” from that expressed by the Joliet mayor and other critics. “Millions of dollars have been invested in unit improvements, infrastructure and security, as well as in the residents, through a wide variety of social services and continuing education programs,” said Chipparoni.Gidwitz, co-founder and partner at the private equity firm GCG Partners, was a loyal fundraiser to Trump and is reported to have brokered a meeting between Trump and wealthy Republican donors at the Chicago Trump Tower before the 2016 election.Responding to his nomination for the role in Brussels, Gidwitz said: “I have never done anything politically that I wanted anything for, other than to help people who needed to be helped. I really never asked for a job.“I didn’t even ask for this one ... What’s really exciting about it is it’s so different. It’s going to be something that I’ve never done before. I’ve traveled extensively overseas but never lived overseas. I’ve had volunteer jobs but I’ve never had one quite as serious. There aren’t very many quite as serious as this.”Gidwitz, a chairman emeritus of Boys \u0026amp Girls Clubs of America, which provides after-school clubs, added that Belgium was at “the centre of Europe in terms of what’s going on. Nato’s there. The EU is there. Belgium has been a great ally of ours for 150 years. And from my standpoint, my French isn’t great, but at least I can speak some French.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a05cd4c489f6b8494e5ca7b600ebe4090123bca8/0_270_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9677fc644fed07e90a366db00d3cbd4c","title":"italy populist coalition set to name political novice as pm nominee","story":"Anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and anti-migrant League name lawyer Giuseppe Conte as Italy’s next leaderItaly’s president is today in talks as the country awaits news about whether an unknown law professor without any political experience will be approved as the next prime minister.The country’s two populist parties – the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S), and the anti-migrant League – announced a joint agreement naming Giuseppe Conte, 53, a lawyer and M5S member, as the next leader of the eurozone’s third largest economy, after Matteo Salvini of the League, and Luigi Di Maio, of the M5S, ruled themselves out.Conte requires the approval of the country’s president, Sergio Mattarella, who met with Salvini and Di Maio on Monday evening and will hold further meetings on Tuesday.The deal came after weeks of intense negotiations between Salvini and Di Maio, who are attempting to cobble together a government based on their shared views. The parties’ agenda calls for sweeping fiscal changes, a more confrontational stance against Brussels, and a tougher approach against migrants, including the creation of detention centres across the country.“We obviously want a country that puts the interests of Italians first. We are ready to go, no one has anything to fear,” Salvini said following his meeting with Mattarella.Late on Monday, Mattarella asked the two speakers of parliament – but not Conte – to meet him on Tuesday at the presidential palace to continue consultations. After weeks of negotiation, when it seemed only an election over the summer might end the political impasse, the reality of the rocky road ahead and the elevation of a populist government to lead one of the EU’s largest countries seemed to hit home.Fitch, the ratings agency, warned that the incoming populist government could pose a risk to Italy’s credit profile, and there was heavy trading in equity and bond markets amid questions about the groups’ Eurosceptic policies.In Brussels, Conte’s nomination to be PM was met with puzzlement. “Nobody knows who he is and he is not even a high-profile academic,” said one EU official, noting that even Italians had been joking that the man who could be their next prime minister was less well-known than his namesake, the Chelsea FC manager Antonio Conte. Lorenzo Codogno, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics, said: “He will have no experience in government and he will be effectively catapulted into the job without having named the cabinet or decided the programme. I am not saying he is a puppet, but the powers he will have are limited.”Codogno, a former Italian treasury official who participated in EU councils, said the EU was deeply concerned about the new Italian government. “There are a lot of worries: it is the first country in the eurozone with a populist government,” he said. If the government followed through on reports of a €100bn financial stimulus without describing how they intend to pay for it, Rome would have to ask for more flexibility from EU eurozone rules, he said.“If that happens it is likely to lead to a very confrontational situation with Europe and the commission,” Codogno said. “If you have a government behaving like a maverick, financial markets can move and if they move a lot they can cause a crisis, they can enter into a situation where a shock in financial markets can occur again.”Given Conte’s lack of political experience, analysts on Monday said decisions on key ministerial positions would probably reveal the government’s intentions. Salvini, who is staunchly anti-migrant and has touted a plan of mass deportation for undocumented people, has been touted as a possible interior minister, with control of the country’s migration policies. Di Maio has been touted as labour minister.“A lot of promises they’ve made are utterly unrealistic, and they will have to pick their priorities,” said the analyst and author Wolfango Piccoli. The new government has also inherited some difficult problems, and will need to find €12.5bn euros in the budget to meet EU budgetary commitment. They will also have to agree a plan on Alitalia, including a possible partial nationalisation of the Italian airline, and will have to make staff decisions on a host of big public institutions, like the Rai broadcaster.Piccoli predicted that one of the few agenda items that will hold the M5S and the League together will be their shared criticism of Brussels, which is likely to object to the incoming government on issues ranging from the budget, to migration, to its desire for stronger ties with Russia.Conte, a law professor at the University of Florence, is Di Maio’s personal lawyer and the mastermind behind the anti-establishment party’s pledge to abolish more than 400 “useless laws” that it claims will cut bureaucracy and free up the economy.He also said during the election campaign that Italy’s anti-corruption laws needed to be tightened and major school changes introduced.The professor, originally from the southern region of Puglia, was previously aligned to the left before joining M5S.Mattarella will need to ratify the choice of prime minister, the proposed programme of policies and cabinet lineup before a government can be sworn in. It will then face a vote of confidence in both houses of parliament."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e47e241d1fb200009ed9e364c16a22cc6559b441/0_99_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4afedc083b0e10e409840657822b7aef","title":"meet bon and pon the japanese retirees making coordinated outfits cool","story":"Couple have more than 700,000 Instagram followers and are launching their own line in Japanese department store The perfect match: Bon and Pon in picturesWhether they’re standing next to a work of art, against an ocean backdrop or in front of their home, doesn’t seem to matter. The hundreds of thousands of fans who have turned an ordinary Japanese couple into online megastars are really interested in only one thing: what they are wearing.Bonpon511 – otherwise known as Tsuyoshi and Tomi Seki – have attracted a huge following since they started posting Instagram photos of themselves decked out in coordinated clothes in late 2016. But they are not your average Instagram stars. The couple, who are in their 60s, appear almost daily in an array of outfits incorporating similar styles and colours. The simplicity of their sartorial choices has earned them praise from fashion commentators and adoration among their almost 720,000 followers. The playful images, taken with an iPhone mounted on a tripod, also communicate the obvious pleasure they derive from each other’s company, 38 years after the college sweethearts married.A year on from the Yahoo! Japan article that helped their Instagram images go viral, the couple have published two books celebrating married life and have been the subject of numerous articles in Japanese newspapers and magazines.Next month they will launch their own range of clothes and accessories, in collaboration with a designer, at the Japanese department store Isetan Mitsukoshi.They have their daughter to thank for their unlikely celebrity, Tomi told the  from their home in the north-eastern city of Sendai. “She took photos of us and posted them on her own Instagram account. She received lots of comments so suggested that we start our own account.”Their Instagram handle combines their nicknames as children with their wedding anniversary on 11 May, which they marked this year by appearing in Gingham check, accompanied by the familiar hash tags #over60 and #greyhair.They have always had similar tastes in clothes, but it was Instagram fame that prompted them to coordinate more closely, even during lazy days at home and trips to the supermarket.“But it’s not just about coordinating our clothes,” said Tsuyoshi. “We try to choose outfits that complement our surroundings.”Much of their wardrobe comes from Uniqlo and other high street chains – a no-frills approach they believe has contributed to their popularity. “Of course we’re happy to be described as style icons in the media, but that’s not really how we see ourselves. We wear simple, inexpensive clothes that anyone can buy,” said Tomi.Outfits aside, they hope to convince other older couples that retirement should mark the start of a second life – the title of one of their books.“Now we’re on our own and finally have the time to do all the things we didn’t have the time to do when we were raising a family and working,” Tomi said. “We want to show that retirement can be a lot of fun, especially if you find something you enjoy doing together.”The couple met at a festival when they were both students at an art school in Tokyo. Tsuyoshi went on to work in design and marketing, while Tomi chose to stay home with their daughter.Each of their photos attracts tens of thousands of likes and universally upbeat comments in Japanese, English and other languages.“We’re overwhelmed by the number of comments, although we’re unable to understand all of them,” said Tsuyoshi “But we’re extremely grateful to everyone who takes the time to post.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/900773bd925318671ec2fa7bd82c1bb19424abf9/0_108_1620_972/master/1620.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16a8ec48baa58335c528dbaa4bf59774","title":"mh370 australian official refutes theory that pilot ditched aircraft","story":"Investigator says captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah was probably unconscious when MH370 crashed into Indian OceanThe official in charge of Australia’s search for MH370 has rejected new claims that the pilot was conscious in the flight’s final moments, saying even with emergency oxygen, decompression sickness would have knocked him out within minutes. At a Senate estimates hearing in Canberra on Tuesday, Peter Foley from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau outlined a possible theory – which he stressed was one of many – for the plane’s disappearance four years ago.The official explanation from the ATSB and Malaysian authorities is that the captain, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, was unconscious when MH370 crashed into the Indian Ocean, resulting in a steep e.The program’s experts said Zaharie depressurised the plane to incapacitate passengers and other crew through hypoxia (oxygen deficiency), and used an emergency air supply to stay conscious. He then repressurised the plane for the rest of the journey.On Tuesday, Foley said this was “plausible”, but Zaharie himself would have been knocked out by the sudden pressure change. “What they fail to understand is that while you don an oxygen mask and prevent the worst of the hypoxia situation, you are flying an aircraft at 40,000 feet. You are taking an aircraft from sea level to Mt Kosciuszko in 20 minutes, then you are talking it, over the course of a couple of minutes, to the height of Mt Everest plus 1,000 feet. You’ll get decompression sickness too.”He said a similar situation happened to a cargo aircraft in 1994, documented by the US National Transportation Safety Board.“During the climbout the flight crew was unable to pressurise the aircraft, and the captain elected to proceed with the flight. The crew donned their oxygen masks and shortly thereafter the captain became incapacitated from decompression sickness. The first officer took command and they landed the plane.”He said this occurred “within several minutes”. “The pilot in this particular aircraft was 51 and overweight. The pilot in command of MH370 was 53 and overweight. I’m not saying that happened and I hate to speculate, but that is one plausible scenario.” However, senator Rex Patrick continued to press Foley on the possibility that the plane was in a controlled descent.“Today we have an analysis of the flap that tells us it is probably not deployed,” Foley said. “We have an analysis of the final two transmissions that say the aeroplane was in a high rate of descent. We have 30 pieces of debris, some from inside the fuselage, that says there was significant energy at impact ... We have quite a lot of evidence to support no control at the end.”He added that the ATSB had spoken to experts who supported the controlled descent theory, including former Boeing 777 instructor Simon Hardy.“We haven’t ever ruled out someone intervening at the end. It’s unlikely.” Foley has been the ATSB’s director of the search for MH370 for the last four years.

Here is all you need to know about the dismantling of Punggye-ri.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un first disclosed plans to close the nuclear test site at Punggye-ri during a summit with South Korean president Moon Jae-in in April. It has been part of a wider charm offensive to portray the regime in Pyongyang as the driver of dialogue and progress. The closing ceremony will take place between 23-25 May, depending on the weather.All of North Korea’s six nuclear tests were conducted at the site under Mount Mantap in the north-eastern interior of the country. The most recent was in September 2017, when Pyongyang claimed to have tested a hydrogen bomb and caused a 6.3 magnitude earthquake that was felt across the border in China.North Korea has allowed a handful of international journalists (but none from South Korea) to watch the closing ceremony. Notably absent are experts or inspectors who can study the test site up close. The visit will also include a stop in Wonsan, a tourist destination North Korea is hoping to promote to outsiders, a sign that the invitation is not about international transparency alone.Closing the site will follow a series of steps during the “ceremony”, including “making all tunnels of the test ground collapse by explosion completely blocking entries removing all observation facilities, research institutes and structures of guard units on the ground”, the North’s foreign ministry said in a statement.In the weeks leading up to the decommissioning, several buildings and sheds around the test site were razed, according to satellite images and analysis by monitoring group 38 North. The photos also showed construction of a new structure, which is likely to be a platform to allow visiting journalists to witness the explosions that will shut the entrances to the site.“They had probably done a lot of damage to the site with the last test, so might as well get credit for a tunnel you don’t want to use,” said Vipin Narang, a politics professor who focuses on nuclear proliferation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “They’re also sanitising the site, removing buildings so we don’t know what they did there and making sure no one with technical expertise is able to inspect the area.”A study by Chinese geologists in April said the site had partially collapsed and was perhaps unusable, although Kim appeared to rebut those claims, saying there were still two tunnels in good condition.“It is meaningful as a diplomatic gesture, especially since it’s being done in advance of the summit and of having an agreement in place,” said Jenny Town, the managing editor of 38 North. “It also signals to actors like China that provocations are unlikely in the near future, which can help repair relations that have soured over the past year of unrelenting testing. But at the same time, it is still a very small piece of the puzzle that doesn’t affect the North’s core nuclear capabilities or arsenal.“Simply put, they can stop testing because they have finished development and don’t need to test any more. Ultimately, it’s still just a first step down a long and difficult road if true denuclearisation of the peninsula is to be achieved.”Kim is not doing anything that is against his interests in an attempt to placate the US, Narang said, adding he believed the North could have other test sites.But Pyongyang has made it clear it no longer needs the proving ground, with Kim announcing in his New Year speech that the North’s nuclear arsenal was complete.The regime also admitted conducting “subcritical” nuclear tests last month, which allow scientists to test weapons without causing an atomic chain reaction or explosion.Well, kind of. There is a sense of déjà vu among veteran North Korea watchers. A similar spectacle was arranged in 2008, when the North blew up a cooling tower at its Yongbyon nuclear reactor. The symbolic step resulted in sanctions relief and led Washington to remove North Korea from a list of state sponsors of terrorism. But negotiations eventually collapsed and the reactor was used to manufacture nuclear material.

Photograph: Cyril ByrneHowever, Mr Keegan said the council did not have the right to take a judicial review of the board’s decision. The deadline for any party to apply for a judicial review of the case is Tuesday.The board last month granted permission to Crekav Trading for 104 houses and 432 apartments on former playing fields east of St Paul’s College on Sybil Hill Road in Raheny, despite receiving more than 1,000 objections.The application was made under the new Strategic Housing Development “fast track” planning system. This allows applications for schemes of more than 100 homes to be made directly to An Bord Pleanála, bypassing the local authority decision phase.Local authorities, while no longer decision makers for these cases, are required to submit their views to the board. Mr Keegan, on behalf of the council submitted that permission should be refused due to the potential impact on migrating geese, and the loss of playing pitches as a community facility. Mr Keegan has told councillors the board’s decision could have legal implications for the city development plan.“My recommendation, based on planning advice, was the board should not have granted this,” he said.The council will seek legal advice on whether it needs to change the development plan to afford better protection for the green spaces of institutional lands, he said.“The intention is to get legal advice as to what are the implications, and are there any measures we could take to protect the development plan.”However, Mr Keegan said the council had already received legal advice that it did not have “locus standing” or legal standing to take a judicial review of the board’s decision. Several councillors had called for the council to initiate judicial review proceedings against the board.A spokesman for the board said it does not comment on decided cases.Crekav bought the 15 acres of land from the Vincentian Order, trustees of St Paul’s College, for a reported €17 million in 2015. It subsequently applied to the council to build 107 houses and 274 apartments on the land, but withdrew this application to seek a larger scheme through the new fast-track system."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3502274.1526843650!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"in muff we pray for the president in culmore the queen","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tArchdeacon Robert Miller at Muff Church of Ireland in Co Donegal. Photograph: Trevor McBride. “When I’m in Muff we pray for the President, and when I’m in Culmore we pray for the Queen.”For Archdeacon Robert Miller, that is the only difference between his parish in Donegal and his three in Derry.The rector of Christ Church, St Peter’s and Culmore in Derry City, and Muff in Co Donegal, Archdeacon Miller laughs at the idea of having an “international ministry” given the cross-Border nature of his work.With Brexit looming, he admits there is uncertainty among some in his parishes around what may come, but he says that for the church “the Border doesn’t really exist”.“I have joked that I hope I won’t need my passport to go to Muff on a Sunday morning,” he says, “but the reality is that we’ve been here before with Border checkpoints and crossings and during that time Muff and Culmore related and worked together, so I would be hopeful that whatever happens, we’ll manage.”Culmore is about 3km from Muff. The journey between the two takes less than five minutes and only the changing road signs and a poster erected by the Border Communities Against Brexit campaign group, marking the Border’s location, suggest that you have moved from Northern Ireland to the Republic.There may be complications down the line if a political agreement on Brexit is not reached but Archdeacon Miller says the Church of Ireland existed long before there was any Border.“We predate partition, and the reality then was that the Church of Ireland had to negotiate something that was imposed upon it and which put a Border between some of its dioceses,” says Archdeacon Miller.“But the Church of Ireland is a church of the whole island, and whilst obviously we acknowledge the secular way in which the island is ided, the Church of Ireland operates as a whole-island church.“If you talk to people they’ll say that the reality of the matter is that at partition a line was drawn on a map – and especially during the Troubles things were very, very difficult – but the relationships existed and persisted.”Archdeacon Miller ministers to about 330 families across the four parishes. He says his responsibility is to provide pastoral support for his parishioners throughout the challenges posed by Brexit.“I don’t do down the uncertainty, because certainly for people who are farming, or people whose business causes them to go back and forth across the Border, or even those who work in one or both of the currencies and then have to cross the Border, all of this causes uncertainty for them,” he says.“Each generation will have its own challenge, and in some ways our challenge is Brexit.”The archdeacon says that while it is not the church’s role to have an opinion on Brexit, its responsibility is to react to people’s concerns.“In terms of peacebuilding, you’re always aware that a change in the status quo at the minute could be a difficult thing,” he says. “For people who have lived on the Border for 40-plus years of troubles, that would be a concern if there was an attempt to reimpose it, but it does seem that it will be a soft Border.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3503528.1526934314!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"westminster committee urges may to take more active role in north","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May was urged by the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee at Westminster to take a more active role in Northern Ireland’s affairs until devolved institutions there are restored.  Photograph: EPAThe Northern Ireland Affairs Committee at Westminster has called on Theresa May’s government to take a more active role in the affairs of Northern Ireland until the devolved institutions there are restored.In a report, Devolution and Democracy in Northern Ireland – Dealing with the Deficit, to be published on Tuesday, the committee also urges an early return to talks to restore the Executive and Assembly.“Karen Bradley is right to make restoring power-sharing devolved government in Stormont her first priority. However, while the political impasse continues the list of policy obstructions and project delays grows and becomes more serious,” committee chair Andrew Murrison said.“We believe the Secretary of State is correct to insist that any decisions from Westminster align with the principles of the Good Friday Agreement. Helpfully, some GFA-compliant guidance already exists. For example, the Hart Report makes policy recommendations that were broadly welcomed across the community.“Elsewhere, the Secretary of State will need to develop stronger ways of engagement and consider new measures to secure adequate scrutiny. Our recommendations include a committee system at Stormont as a temporary expedient pending restoration of the Executive.”Some members of the committee, including Labour’s Kate Hoey and the DUP’s Ian Paisley, have criticised the way the Belfast Agreement operates and the report calls for a consultation between London, Dublin and Belfast on how it might be improved. The report suggests that such a consultation should review how the power-sharing system works and if and how it should be changed.“The Good Friday Agreement has had a transformative effect on Northern Ireland. However, its institutions have collapsed and even if restarted tomorrow would likely remain fragile,” Dr Murrison said.“With the involvement and consent of the whole community in Northern Ireland, we have to consider if they can be more robust and how improvements can be made, as envisaged in the agreement itself. We must investigate every avenue to secure long-term stable government. For political stalemate to become the new normal is unthinkable and unacceptable.”-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"More than 40 foreign women sentenced to death in Baghdad after 10-minute hearingsMilitary commander criticises US secretary of state who set out hardline stance on TehranAt least 11 people have reportedly died in the country after eating toxic mushroomsAssad\u0026rsquos forces say they have secured the area after pushing out Islamic State militantsOnce hated by the US and tied to Iran, the Shia cleric\u0026rsquos bloc won the most votes in electionsTwenty-nine countries approved probe, 14 abstained, and US and Australia voted againstImages of eight-month-old Layla Ghandour shocked the world and triggered a fresh disputeHamas official says 50 of the 60 people killed in Monday\u0026rsquos violence were membersMonday\u0026rsquos carnage triggered defensiveness, shame and served-them-right defianceGuatemala one of only a few nations to back Trump decision to recognise city as Israel\u0026rsquos capitalMajority of United Nations members criticise Israel\u0026rsquos response to protests in GazaPalestinians mark \u0026lsquoNakba\u0026rsquo, Israeli minister is unconcerned about prospect of war crimesMinister says 20 people managed to swim to safety after incident on Godavari riverKilling of Palestinians after diplomatic steps may derail US\u0026rsquos professed peace amibitionsOne Palestinian killed on Tuesday as far smaller numbers protest on \u0026lsquoNakba\u0026rsquoCoveney should have told envoy to \u0026lsquopack his bags\u0026rsquo in wake of Gaza violence, says DohertyMany young protesters acted in desperation against a backdrop of impoverished livesPalestinian officials say 1,200 injured, 450 by live fire, as US embassy opens in JerusalemIsraeli bullets and bloodshed in Gaza as Palestinians insist they \u0026lsquohave to fight\u0026rsquoViolence and Palestinian deaths are result of lack of strategic vision in US foreign policy"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3503426.1526927646!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tory brexiteers should hope for another election and soon","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSir Ivan Rogers, who resigned as Britain’s diplomatic emissary to the EU in January last year. Photograph: Thierry RogeEPAIt was a long, repetitive exercise that kept the British establishment waiting some of them willing it on, some of them concealing distaste. Bishop Michael Curry’s sermon at the royal wedding was a truer metaphor for Brexit than any journalist has coined these past two years.As the second anniversary of the referendum nears, there is more exasperated checking of watches left to go. A transition period from membership to non-membership will run until the end of 2020. The latest answer to the customs impasse is continuation of the status quo until 2022, when new technologies might fix the problem. By then, the process of exit will rival the second World War in length. If a technical solution does not emerge, Britain’s holding pen could become a permanent home.There is also a new immigration system to decide, as well as the UK’s freedom of manoeuvre on state aid and other regulatory matters. Whatever Britain does in these areas could affect the terms it secures in the trade talks that constitute yet another avenue of negotiation with the EU. In all likelihood, London will be haggling with Brussels over one thing or another indefinitely, much like the Swiss. Ivan Rogers predicted this future when he quit as Britain’s diplomatic emissary to the EU after the referendum.It is not clear that Britain will turn on Brexit as young voters replace old. Demography is not destiny. Even if it were, it is slow to work. All the same, Leavers should worry about the passage of time. The drop in European immigration that is already showing up in data could blunt the public’s main grievance against the EU. Endless negotiations could themselves accustom voters to a kind of rolling semi-membership. If a clean exit is to happen, it has to happen before long.At the risk of riling Brenda of Bristol, the voter whose fatigue at hearing the news of last year’s general election became a viral hit, the best hope for Tory Leavers is another election, and soon. A plan leaked over the weekend envisages a vote of no-confidence in prime minister Theresa May, before an autumn date with the electorate, perhaps under the leadership of Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary and committed Leaver.A new election is not certain to fix the Leavers’ central problem, which is the shortage of parliamentary numbers for their preferred exit. But the potential is there. Two favourable circumstances obtain right now that might not in a few years. One is material. The economy is still growing, with wages rising ahead of inflation. If the business cycle turns before Britain leaves, the animal spirits behind Brexit could weaken. A downturn has the power to frustrate Brexit in a way no human factor can. It is one thing to vote Leave, and another to leave while the economy is fragile.The other tailwind is political. The opposition Labour party still wants to leave the single market. As stable as this seems, Leavers cannot treat it as an immovable fact of politics. They are in parliamentary trouble because the opposition line is already softer than it was at the turn of the year. If it softens much more, a hard exit becomes a fringe prospect.In other words, this apparent rough patch for Leavers is, on second glance, much better than things might be in the near future. The Conservatives are in reasonable shape after the local elections this month. Some voting-intention polls have them ahead. Other surveys show that voters trust them over other parties to negotiate exit.Most Tories dismiss the weekend speculation out of hand. A snap election seems implausible. But the same was true five minutes before May called one last spring, at which point such insurmountable barriers as the Fixed Term Parliaments Act were breezily surmounted. Given the delicate balance of forces in the House of Commons right now, it would take a small shift in their favour to smooth the way to a clean exit.The Eurosceptic dread was never a formal annulment of the decision to leave. No government could do such a thing without inciting half the nation. Their real nightmare is a prolonged exit that ultimately obscures the difference between leaving and staying. This explains their impatience to leave now, and to elect a parliament to that end.On the balance of probabilities, they will fail. May should see out the year, and the process of exit. But that balance is finer than generally believed, and liable to change with events. The parliamentary deadlock is real. The answer is the long grass or to consult the country. Voters who were not exasperated by last year’s election might yet have their patience tested with a fifth major democratic event in as many years.

Where the honeymoon could bePrince Harry and Meghan Markle have little time to recover from their fairytale wedding as they head straight back to work this week after an emotional ceremony that captivated the nation and a star-studded reception.Unlike other newlyweds, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not be jetting off on a honeymoon straight away - instead, they will be back on royal duty, carrying out their first official engagements as husband and wife.On Monday, the Duke and Duchess thanked everyone who took  part in the wedding celebrations as they released three official photographs.In one of the wedding photographs taken by Alexi Lubomirski the newlyweds are shown in a romantic pose on the east terrace of Windsor Castle still basking in the excitement of their wedding.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex on the east terrace of Windsor CastleIn another image Harry and Meghan are pictured with the Queen, Duke of Edinburgh, Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the bride\u0027s mother Doria Ragland and the young bridesmaids and pageboys, including Prince George and Princess Charlotte.The new Duke and Duchess of Sussex are pictured with the Queen, Duke of Edinburgh, Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the bride\u0026#39s mother Doria Ragland and the young bridesmaids and pageboysThe couple, who exchanged vows in a ceremony watched by millions across the world on Saturday, are due to attend a Buckingham Palace garden party on Tuesday as part of the Prince of Wales\u0027s 70th birthday celebrations.It will mark the beginning of a new life for the Duchess, who has already spoken of her desire to hit the ground running in her role as a full-time member of the Royal family.Shortly after the couple were proclaimed husband and wife at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor, Kensington Palace\u0027s social media pages and the royal family\u0027s website had been updated to reflect their newest member.And the Duchess has been given the blessing of Buckingham Palace to use her position to fight for feminism, as she is expected to announce which charities and campaigns she will support when she returns from her honeymoon.Royal wedding day pictures: Best photos from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#039s ceremony and receptionHowever, a biography of the Los Angeles-born Suits star on the monarchy\u0027s official website suggested she will use her role to champion feminist causes. It described her lifelong commitment to working to promote social justice and women\u0027s empowerment, carrying a quote in which she declares: I am proud to be a woman and a feminist.The Duchess, who is reported to have broken with tradition to give a speech of her own at the wedding reception, has worked with a number of charities in the past, including UN Women and World Vision. She will continue working with the Royal Foundation alongside Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.A visit to Australia is in the diary for October, for the 2018 Invictus Games, while other trips abroad this year are said to be in the pipeline.But despite their hectic schedules, the couple seized the opportunity to spend some time away from the public eye on Sunday.After two receptions hosted by the Queen and Prince of Wales on Saturday - with some guests said to have continued partying well after Frogmore House closed its doors - the royal newlyweds left Windsor Castle on Sunday afternoon for some well-earned privacy.Only the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were seen returning home to Kensington Palace on Sunday evening.Guests of the royal couple had celebrated the couple tying the knot at an evening reception at which Idris Elba turned DJ and danced into the small hours with fireworks and a playlist of soul classics.The newlyweds are said to have eschewed a slow first dance for livelier tunes, from 1960s R\u0026ampB to the dance hits of the 1980s. They are said to have chosen I Wanna Dance With Somebody as an opening number, with guests treated to a sit-down dinner after a long day in front of the cameras at Windsor Castle.The grand finale of the royal wedding saw 200 people join a black-tie dinner and evening celebrations at Frogmore House. Fireworks from the Frogmore House party lit up the night sky over WindsorThe Prince of Wales staged the black-tie evening dinner for the couple, who arrived in a environmentally-friendly 1968 Jaguar E-Type Concept Zero that ran on electric power.As well as family members including Princess Beatrice and Eugenie and the Earl and Countess of Wessex, evening guests included George and Amal Clooney, Tom Hardy, and Idris Elba, who was said to have taken a spin on DJ decks. But the fun did not stop when Frogmore House - the famous royal home loved by Queen Victoria - closed it doors, as some guests are said to have staged an after party at top London hot spot Chiltern Firehouse.In their first official engagement as husband and wife, the Duke and Duchess will attend a 70th birthday patronage celebration for the Prince of Wales.The outdoor event marks the heir to the throne\u0027s milestone birthday - which falls in November - by recognising Charles\u0027 patronages and military affiliations as well as others involved in charities supported by the royal.The Duchess previously said she wants to hit the ground running on becoming a full-time member of the Royal family.The couple will not immediately leave for their honeymoon, but remain in the UK for a period of time before taking the traditional break. Countries such as Botswana - which offers stunning wildlife, breathtaking scenery and, importantly, privacy from prying eyes - could be top of the list.But the couple may first spend a few days in Ireland, according to reports, making their inaugural overseas trip as a married couple to the Republic, while their honeymoon is put on hold for a period.Botswana is a place the Duke loves and knows well, and he reportedly whisked his fiancee to the southern African country in 2017 to mark her 36th birthday.Cutest pictures of Prince George, Princess Charlotte and more young royals at the weddingThe Duke and Duchess had exchanged vows in front of 600 guests including the Queen and more than 30 members of the Royal family.Famous faces such as US chat show queen Oprah Winfrey, tennis champion Serena Williams, actor George Clooney and his barrister wife Amal Clooney, Sir Elton John, David and Victoria Beckham and actor Idris Elba were also in St George\u0027s Chapel.Sir Elton, who sang at the funeral service for the Duke\u0027s mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, performed at the lunchtime reception. An estimated 100,000 people turned out to see the couple as they sat in an open-top Ascot Landau for a carriage procession through Windsor.The most stylish guests from Prince Harry\u0026#039s wedding to Meghan MarkleMeanwhile, British designer Clare Waight Keller, who was spotted arranging the Duchess of Sussex\u0027s veil and train just before she processed into St George\u0027s Chapel, said soon after the ceremony Harry rushed up to praise her efforts. She said: He came straight up to me and he said \u0027oh my God, thank you, she looks absolutely stunning\u0027.Asked about the moment Meghan was able to look at herself dressed and ready in the mirror on Saturday morning, Ms Waight Keller said: She was just glowing, adding She was absolutely radiant.Our Fashion News Director, Bethan Holt writes how high street brands will capitalise on the \u0027Meghan effect,\u0027 and where to find the best royal wedding-inspired dresses.Every decade has its own style identity and the general consensus eight years into the 2010s is that sleek minimalism will be the look of our time. How appropriate then that the new Duchess of Sussex’s Givenchy Haute Couture and Stella McCartney wedding gowns should encapsulate this look so elegantly....

Harry moved into Nottingham Cottage shortly after. An aerial view of Kensington PalaceIt is the smallest of Kensington Palace\u0027s multiple residences, residing in a part of the grounds that once housed important members of staff.

The apartments are even suspected to share a secret door.The royal brothers will remain as neighbours at Kensington PalaceInitially however, the new Duke will have a cousin for a neighbour: Princess Eugenie and her fiancé Jack Brooksbank recently took-up residence at Ivy Cottage after announcing their engagement in January this year.That wedding will also take place at St George\u0027s Chapel, in Windsor, on October 12.Among the 200 guests invited to the evening reception at Frogmore House were senior members of the Royal family.

This unlikely pair tag-teamed with Huw Edwards (solid, dependable, a bit boring), who appeared to have been on a pre-wedding diet.

The New York Times\u0027 website is blocked in China.Joshua Rosenzweig, East Asia Research Director at Amnesty International, said: “Today’s verdict against Tashi Wangchuk is a gross injustice. He is being cruelly punished for peacefully drawing attention to the systematic erosion of Tibetan culture.To brand peaceful activism for Tibetan language as ‘inciting separatism’ is beyond absurd.”Many Tibetans in China accuse the government of religious repression and eroding their culture, as the country’s majority Han ethnic group increasingly moves into historically Tibetan areas.China rejects this, saying Tibetans enjoy religious freedom. Beijing points to huge ongoing investment it says has brought modernisation and a better standard of living to Tibet.Reports said that Mr Tashi could be released by 2021, five years after his arrest. He is expected to appeal the sentence, which was handed down by a judge in the western city of Yushu in Qinghai province.He told his trial that he does not support Tibetan independence, although he wants ethnic minorities to be able to freely express their own language - a right that is supposedly guaranteed under Chinese law.Please review our commenting policyHow Meghan and Harry\u0026#39s official wedding photographs capture the importance - and joy - of the dayMeghan Markle and Prince Harry wedding speeches: The most moving lines and best jokesInside the royal wedding evening receptionNottingham Cottage: The Kensington home where Meghan and Harry live as a married coupleRoyal wedding latest news: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry delay honeymoon to go straight back to workManchester attack anniversary marked with national silence as Ariana Grande tells victims \u0026#39thinking of you all today\u0026#39RP should be celebrated, not derided, says broadcaster Jonathan MeadesNottingham Cottage: The Kensington home where Meghan and Harry live as a married coupleRoyal wedding latest news: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry delay honeymoon to go straight back to workPolice told to lose their fear of chasing moped gangsCuba plane crash death toll rises to 111 as one of three initial survivors diesRamadan 2018: Why Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranHow high is air pollution in your city and how does it compare to the most polluted cities in the world?Australian archbishop most senior Catholic to be convicted of covering up sex abuse of altar boysMeghan Markle\u0026#39s half-sister \u0026#39insulted\u0026#39 by decision not to give father a coat of armsHow Meghan and Harry\u0026#39s official wedding photographs capture the importance - and joy - of the dayThe hospital garden helping victims of the Manchester Arena bombing to healA Very English Scandal, episode 1 review: Hugh Grant is both charming and bone-chilling in this brilliant take on the Thorpe affairInside the royal wedding evening reception: Idris Elba turned DJ as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle danced to 1980s hits and R\u0026ampBSir Anthony Hopkins: \u0026#39Am I a grandfather?

Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said the government’s initiative was “nowhere near enough”.He said: ”Schools in disadvantaged areas frequently face extremely challenging circumstances, struggling to recruit and retain teachers and leaders, and too often labelled as failing by a draconian accountability system which stigmatises them.“Schools cannot on their own turn round deeply entrenched disadvantage. These communities also need social and economic programmes which support families and provide more opportunities for secure, well-paid employment. Their young people need to believe they can succeed.”UK news in picturesUK news in picturesMarcio and Andreia Gomes, parents of Logan Gomes, arrive for a commemoration hearing at the opening of the inquiry into the Grenfell Tower disaster, in London.Brackley Town celebrate after winning The Buildbase FA Trophy Final after they beat Bromley on penalties at Wembley Stadium.Actress, Meghan Markle, reaches Prince Harry at the altar in St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle for their wedding service.Workers from the Covent Garden branch of TGI Fridays on a picket line outside the restaurant as they strike in a dispute over pay.

Shares in the group tumbled almost 3 per cent on the news.The retailer said the 100 stores earmarked for closure includes those that have already shut this year, and 14 stores announced today. The company said: “Alongside relocations, conversions, downsizes and the introduction of concessions, these closures will radically reshape M\u0026ampS’s clothing \u0026amp home space.”The group has struggled to improve the performance of its clothing business in particular over recent yearsThe next 14 Clothing \u0026amp Home stores that will close or are proposed for closure in 201819 as part of the transformative programme are:Bayswater, Fleetwood Outlet and Newton Abbot Outlet – all three of which will close by the end of July 2018Clacton and Holloway Road – which will both close by early 2019 to coincide with new nearby Food stores openingDarlington, East Kilbride, Falkirk, Kettering, Newmarket, New Mersey Speke, Northampton, Stockton and Walsall – all nine of which are proposed for closure and will now enter a period of consultation with all 626 affected employees.

Closing stores isn’t easy but it is vital for the future of M\u0026ampS. “Where we have closed stores, we are seeing an encouraging number of customers moving to nearby stores and enjoying shopping with us in a better environment, which is why we’re continuing to transform our estate with pace.”M\u0026ampS was expected to announced up to 40 store closures this week, ahead of publishing its annual results on Wednesday.Last month, the group said it was closing one of its distribution centres in September, putting a further 450 jobs in danger.You can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

This was not expected.But the salamanders face extinction in the wild, due in no small part to demand for the amphibians as luxury food.In a second study, Samuel Turvey from the Zoological Society of London found that populations of this once-widespread species are now critically depleted or extirpated across all surveyed areas of their range, and illegal poaching is widespread.Science news in picturesScience news in picturesLayers long thought to be dense, connective tissue are actually a series of fluid-filled compartments researchers have termed the “interstitium”. \u0026#13Working in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, a team led by archaeologists at the University of Exeter unearthed hundreds of villages hidden in the depths of the rainforest. \u0026#13More than one in 10 people were found to have traces of class A drugs on their fingers by scientists developing a new fingerprint-based drug test.\u0026#13The storm bigger than the Earth, has been swhirling for 350 years.

They then saw a high-speed flare get thrust out, escaping from the rim of the black hole. Scientists have seen black holes killing and swallowing stars. And the jets have been seen before.But a new study shows the first time that they have captured the hot flare that comes out just afterwards. And the flare and then swallowed star have not been linked together beforeA British scientist has uncovered the fossil of a dog-sized horned dinosaur that roamed eastern North America up to 100 million years ago. The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in AsiaBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain. Specific parts of the brain do show sex differences, but inidual brains rarely have all “male” traits or all “female” traits. Some characteristics are more common in women, while some are more common in men, and some are common in both men and women, according to the studyLife may have come to earth 4.1 billion years ago, hundreds of millions of years earlier than we knew. The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars. Scientists have long speculated that Recurring Slope Lineae — or dark patches — on Mars were made up of briny water but the new findings prove that those patches are caused by liquid water, which it has established by finding hydrated salts.Earth could be in danger as our galaxy throws out comets that could hurtle towards us and wipe us out, scientists have warned. Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occurScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”. Florida State University professor of biological science Greg Erickson said: “It creates this natural question. How did they survive up here?”Illustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close together, Mr Overstreet said. This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.In fact, some of the five newly identified species may already be extinct in the wild.The overexploitation of these incredible animals for human consumption has had a catastrophic effect on their numbers in the wild over an amazingly short time , Mr Turvey said.  Unless coordinated conservation measures are put in place as a matter of urgency, the future of the world\u0027s largest amphibian is in serious jeopardy.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Best before labels will be removed from popular lines such as apples, potatoes, tomatoes, lemons and other citrus fruit and onions, among others.The supermarket said its decision was based on research by the National Federation of Women’s Institutes (NFWI) which found that less than half of respondents understood what ‘best before’ dates mean. Best before date labels are added by retailers as a quality indication, and show that food might not be at its best but is still edible. Use by labels indicate that there is a safety risk if food is eaten after a certain date.The Food Standards Agency states that “the best before date, sometimes shown as\u0026nbspBBE, is about quality and not safety. The food will be safe to eat after this date but may not be at its best.”“We know some customers may be confused by the difference between ‘Best Before’ and ‘Use By’ dates on food and this can lead to perfectly edible items being thrown away before they need to be discarded,” said Tesco’s head of food waste, Mark Little.“We have made this change to fruit and vegetable packaging as they are among the most wasted foods, he added.“Many customers have told us that they assess their fruit and vegetables by the look of the product rather than the ‘Best Before’ date code on the packaging.”The move follows a pledge by Tesco last year to end edible food waste by March 2018. Chief executive Dave Lewis said in December 2017 that the supermarket would become the first UK retailer to stop throwing away food suitable for human consumption, and challenged rivals to make a similar effort. “If Tesco can make this work, with all of our different stores across the country, then why can’t everyone?” he said.“So long as that food is fit for human consumption, I’d much prefer it to go to people than landfill or animal feed, or fuel.”You can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

We had a celebration for the prince. There were many, many pigs. We had many, many people come who wanted to celebrate.”Strange island: Pacific tribesmen come to study BritainWith the atmosphere further lifted by kava, a drink made from a plant root said to have sedative and mood-enhancing qualities, the celebration seems to have been even more joyous than those for the duke’s 89th birthday on June 10 2010.That was when it had been prophesied that Prince Philip would come to Tanna to be with his people, living in a hut and hunting wild pigs with them.The slight disappointment that the dukeMessiah was a no-show on that occasion was mitigated by the fact that British gap year student Marc Rayner, 18, was on hand to act as a stand-in.As a stickler for protocol, the duke would doubtless have been glad to hear that Mr Rayner adopted formal dress by wearing a nambas, a slightly more extensive version of the penis sheaths that Tanna men wear in everyday life.“They are a wonderful people and I didn’t want them to feel let down,” said Mr Rayner.  “I stepped in to explain that the prince\u0027s many responsibilities prevented him from visiting in person - but that he would one day rest in spirit on the island.”As it is, however, although Tanna is the home of the so-called “cargo cult” known as the Prince Philip Movement, the duke – in bodily, if not spirit form – has never set foot on the island, one of 82 in the Vanuatu archipelago.The closest he came was in 1974, when he visited the Vanuatu capital Port Vila on the royal yacht Britannia with the Queen.Chief Jack Naiva, one of the paddlers of a traditional war canoe which greeted the royal yacht, was quoted as saying: I saw him standing on the deck in his white uniform.

But the cults reflect quite logical and rational attempts to make sense out of a social order that appears senseless and chaotic.”  He outlined how South Pacific populations with “highly developed cultures” had been subjected to “enormous social stress and strain” by the arrival of Europeans with “cargo” – Pidgin English for trade goods – and frightening technological power.With the 19th Century traders came missionaries, who thought it would be clever to try to make Christian ideas like the Second Coming more palatable by tacking them on to existing South Pacific beliefs.The result, however, seems to have been that instead of Christinaity, beliefs grew up that a local hero or god would come to initiate paradise on Earth and bless the people of the South Pacific with the riches of the white man’s cargo.Worsley explained that the seizure of islanders for work on the plantations of Australia and Fiji left them disinclined to swallow whole the missionaries’s teachings: “The splendid vision of the equality of all Christians began to seem a pious deception in face of the realities of the colour bar, the multiplicity of rival Christian missions and the open irreligion of many Whites.“They found that acceptance of Christianity did not bring the cargo any nearer. They grew disillusioned.”Prince Philip asks \u0027Is that a terrorist?\u0027 after seeing bearded manPrince Philip believed in nuclear disarmament, letters revealPrince Philip \u0027told Blair’s team to f*** off’ over Diana’s funeral96 Prince Philip gaffes in 96 yearsThen the Second World War came to the Pacific.On Vanuatu the appearance of so many troops and so much US military hardware seems to have boosted the “John Frum Movement” that had begun in the 1930s, and was still going strong in 1960 when David Attenborough visited to be told about a Messiah figure: “’E look like you. ‘E got white face. ‘E tall man. ‘E live ‘long South America.”On Tanna, the John Frum Movement seems to have morphed into the Prince Philip Movement some time in the 1950s or 1960s.One theory is that people on Tanna noticed the respect with which British colonial officials spoke of the Queen, and aligned Prince Philip with their traditional belief that the son of the mountain god would travel over the sea, marry a powerful woman and eventually return to his people.  One Tanna elder has suggested that the Prince Philip Movement will not die with him but be passed on to his children, and his children\u0027s children (Getty Images  WPA Pool  Pool)And at the time the duke\u0027s retirement, it was also suggested that the Prince Philip Movement would not die with him.Tanna elder Chief Tom Numake was quoted as saying: “Just because he has retired, it doesn\u0027t just stop.“It will be passed on to his children, and if they have children then it will continue on through them. The followers don\u0027t just see it as Prince Philip but that it will continue going on through the bloodline.Which does now rather suggest that in the unlikely form of Prince Harry, Meghan Markle has just got herself hitched to a husband who might one day, just possibly, come to be seen, as the Messiah, not a very naughty boy. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle weddingor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He is still wearing his Dr Martens and his ceremonial chain.“It’s a good accessory,” he smiles.Asked how he feels about the global reaction to his now famous official inauguration photo, Councillor Magid Magid’s response is as unorthodox as the image itself.Lord Mayor of Sheffield Magid Magid (Chris Saunders)“Mate… f*****g hell…” he tells The Independent, still apparently struggling for words. “It’s been surreal. Mad. I wasn’t expecting any of this.”The 28-year-old’s election as the South Yorkshire city’s official first citizen last week made headlines around the world. He has received messages of goodwill from people as far and wide as New York and Syria. ITV News anchor Charlene White declared on Twitter that she might be “a little bit in love”.This is partly because of who he is and what he’s achieved. Councillor Magid is not only the city’s youngest ever lord mayor – and the first from the Green Party – he is also a Muslim former Somalian refugee who arrived in the UK at the age of five, unable to speak English.And it is partly because of that picture. In it, amid the shadowy, gilded confines of Sheffield’s Victorian Town Hall, he squats – complete with ceremonial chain, Dr Martens boots and wide-eyed smile – high on a balustrade.‘If me doing this – as a black, Muslim immigrant – can spark someone to go out and change their bit of the world, that’s my job done’That Councillor Magid – who once appeared on Channel 4 reality show Hunted – is different there is no doubt.He was elected here after being nominated by his three Green Party council colleagues. When I later ask one, Alison Teal, why they put him forward, her response is simple. “He’s charming and magnetic,” she says. “I’ve never met anyone who doesn’t like him. He’s a born lord mayor.”The main message he wants to get across during his year in post is one of inspiring others.“If me doing this – as a black, Muslim immigrant – can spark someone to go out and change their bit of the world, that’s my job done,” he says. “That, and to get people talking about Sheffield, about what a brilliant, erse city it is.”The strange story of Sheffield’s tree massacreAt his inauguration, he entered the chamber to Star Wars music and thanked his mum for “putting up with all my shit” growing up.“I was a handful,” he explains today. “Typical teenager. The important thing was thanking my mum because she’s the reason I’m here, her courage and determination for a better life.”It was his mother, Amina Deria, indeed, who took young Magid – along with his older sister Hanan Mah – out of war torn Burao in northern Somalia. After six months in an Ethiopian refugee camp, they arrived in the Burngreave area of Sheffield where she worked as a cleaner.“To me,” he says, “it’s always been home.”He did well enough at school and, after some time out in which he climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, went to the University of Hull to study marine biology. There, he was elected president of the students’ union.“I cared about issues but I was pretty naive about politics,” he says. “I remember a hustings, someone asked if I was going to join a picket line. I was thinking: ‘What the fuck is a picket line?’ But I gambled and said, ‘Yeah, of course I am’, and there was a round of applause.”Around 2015, alarmed by the rise of Ukip and anti-immigration rhetoric, he joined the Greens back in Sheffield where he was working in digital marketing. He was elected to the city council a year later.“This rising xenophobic language affects me and my loved ones,” he explains. “There’s that expression that if you don’t do politics, politics will do you. I just felt I couldn’t sit on the sidelines and let that language go unchallenged. It legitimises racism and it needs to be tackled. I wanted my voice in the debate. Local politics was a way to do that.”Among his main beliefs are devolved local power, free education, an end to PFI and the creation of a republic.Now, as lord mayor, he will, as convention dictates, act as a city figurehead. “I had a white tie dinner last night,” he tells me. “I went to hire the suit – £120! I was saying: ‘I want to hire it, not buy it.’”But he plans to open the role up too. He promises to go to more events involving underrepresented communities, and wants magicians and musicians to perform in council meeting intervals – as a way of encouraging more people to interact with local democracy.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesMarcio and Andreia Gomes, parents of Logan Gomes, arrive for a commemoration hearing at the opening of the inquiry into the Grenfell Tower disaster, in London.Brackley Town celebrate after winning The Buildbase FA Trophy Final after they beat Bromley on penalties at Wembley Stadium.Actress, Meghan Markle, reaches Prince Harry at the altar in St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle for their wedding service.Workers from the Covent Garden branch of TGI Fridays on a picket line outside the restaurant as they strike in a dispute over pay.

The tragedy is the price the country will pay for Labour’s failure to lead.”The warning comes as a succession of polls show the Conservatives edging ahead of Labour, despite their deep Brexit isions and a sluggish economy.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesBrexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

That’s not going to change whether you have a one-child policy, a two-child policy or a 200-child policy\u0027China is planning to abandon all policies restricting the number of children people can have, according to a report, in a move that would draw to a close one of the world’s longest, most ambitious and most controversial social experiments.The one-child policy was introduced in 1979 before it was relaxed to two children in 2016, and the Chinese government claims it prevented 400 million births.Critics dispute that figure, saying China’s birth rate was already falling anyway in line with other developing countries, and that all the policy did was encourage alarming rates of female infanticide and other abuses.China’s building programme ‘riskiest environmental project in history’Bloomberg News quoted government sources as saying the new policy would be dubbed “independent fertility”, and that the change could come as soon as this year, or by 2019 at the latest.And while there was no official confirmation or indeed comment from China’s National Health Commission, the report came on the same day as an article by the state-run Xinhua news agency which eulogised “how much China has changed over the past 40 years” since the one-child policy was introduced.The article quotes a 63-year-old man as saying he gladly volunteered to have only one child at a time when the policy was needed “to cope with increasing population pressure”. Average salaries have grown, Xinhua says, and the food shortages of the 1970s and 1980s are a matter for “history”.If China’s state media are preparing the ground for an announcement, they may have to move fast – an initial feasibility study suggesting there would be some “limited” economic gains from lifting child limits was presented to Chinese prime minister Li Keqiang in April, according to Bloomberg.US-China trade war ‘on hold’ as America backs off on tariffsChinese air force lands bombers on island in disputed South China SeaChina launches its first home-built aircraft carrier‘Made in China’ label helps archaeologists solve 800-year-old mysteryChinese tourists ordered to remove controversial T-shirts at airportChina owes much of its recent economic boom to a demographic bonus, with a young population providing cheap labour, but that balance has now shifted. The State Council has said around a quarter of China’s population will be 60 or older by 2030, up from 13.3 per cent in 2010, and an ageing society is putting a burden on pensions and services.   Coming so soon after the shift to a two-child limit, any change will inevitably be seen as a climbdown, an admission that relaxing the rules has not boosted birth rates in the way the government hoped, says Professor Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London.He told The Independent he didn’t think the new policy would have much impact either. “People are not having children in China because they cannot afford them. That’s not going to change whether you have a one-child policy, a two-child policy or a 200-child policy.”So what will be the legacy of the one-child rule? Most statisticians argue that China’s birth rate was already falling dramatically when it was introduced, making it difficult to assess just how big an impact it had.   Prof Tsang points to the so-called Greater China territories of Hong Kong and Taiwan, where the policy was never implemented, but where fertility rates are among some of the lowest in the world.One impact that can be measured is on child mortality. A UN report in 2011 found that in the 1970s 60 boys per 1,000 were dying before the age of one, compared with 53 girls. By the 2000s, the ratio had flipped – 21 boys to 28 girls.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Mr Najib’s critics have previously accused his wife of financing her expensive shopping habit with public funds.Mr Singh declined to say who the raided apartment belonged to but he confirmed that the search was “conducted in relevance to our 1MDB investigations. Anti-corruption police also carried out simultaneous raids at several other locations, including his former office as prime minister, an official residence and Mr Najib’s own home, where police seized more handbags and clothes following a 20-hour search.  Mr Singh said police were trying to crack open a safe in Mr Najib’s house.  Police search former prime minister Najib Razak\u0027s home in Kuala Lumpur as part of a corruption probe after billions of dollars were siphoned off from a state fund (REUTERSLai Seng Sin)Mr Najib has denied any wrongdoing and his lawyer denounced the long search at his home as harassment.The police raid marks an extraordinary turn of events a week after Mr Najib’s coalition was defeated in a general election he was expected to win – putting an end to the coalition\u0027s 60-year rule.

Ever since that day, the two men have operated hand in glove to their great mutual advantage.Putin, 65, went on to become president and now, in the first year of his fourth term, is reputed to be Russia\u0026rsquos wealthiest man.BEN STANSALLAFPGettyAbramovich bought \u0026ldquothe cheapest insurance policy in history: Chelsea Football ClubAbramovich, meanwhile, is the 13th richest person in Britain with a fortune of \u0026pound9.3billion, a property portfolio including a \u0026pound125million house on London\u0026rsquos smartest street, a flotilla of no fewer than seven superyachts \u0026ndash among them the \u0026pound300million Eclipse \u0026ndash and a Boeing 767 as his private jet.Oh, and there is the little matter of a high-flying Premier League football club called Chelsea on which he has lavished no less than \u0026pound2billion in the past decade alone.The foundation of this great wealth was an oil company called Sibneft that the 51-year-old acquired in partnership with another \u0026ldquobiznisman called Boris Berezovsky under the rigged privatisations of Russian state-owned mineral assets in the mid-90s which created a charmed circle of billionaires who became known as the oligarchs.No surprise then that when Putin needed someone to mastermind the creation of a political party to support him as he geared up for the presidential election of 2000 following Yeltsin\u0026rsquos retirement, Abramovich was the inidual he turned to.                Chelsea news: Why Abramovich is not happy with Conte - Mario MelchiotThe younger man proceeded to put together from scratch a new party called Unity, which went on to win 23 per cent of the vote, just one per cent less than the communists who were then still riding high.Putin himself coasted to victory shortly afterwards after making the crowd-pleasing decision to re-invade Chechnya following a series of terrorist outrages attributed to Chechen operatives.It wasn\u0026rsquot long before the newly elected president was rounding on the oligarchs whom he accused of meddling in politics, dodging their taxes and making sweetheart deals with corrupt officials.Within months Berezovsky \u0026ndash who was attacking Putin via his TV station ORT \u0026ndash and another media oligarch, Vladimir Gusinsky, had been hounded into exile and the richest of them all, Mikhail Khodorkovsky had been arrested and jailed.Levent KisiAnadolu AgencyGettyAbramovic\u0027s luxury mega yacht, EclipseIt is said that one of Khodorkovsky\u0026rsquos miscalculations was to go into his first meeting with Putin as president wearing a polo neck rather than a jacket and tie and to then swing his feet on to the head of state\u0026rsquos desk, lean back in his chair, clasp his hands behind his neck and ask, \u0026ldquoSo Vlod, how are we going to run Russia together?It is inconceivable that Abramovich would betray such hubris. Unlike many of his fellow oligarchs, he never forgot that the president owned the jails and when Putin says \u0026ldquoJump! Abramovich is the sort of man who would say \u0026ldquoHow high? He even agreed to become governor of Chukotka, a godforsaken province in Russia\u0026rsquos far east just 60 miles across the Bering Strait from the US state of Alaska. In the days of the Soviet Union, Chukotk\u0026rsquo\u0026rsquos proximity to Alaska meant that it was seen as strategically important. Russians were lured east with offers of three times their Moscow salaries to build roads and run hospitals and power stations. But after the communist system imploded everything went to rack and ruin.Abramovich told one visitor: \u0026ldquoUp here it\u0026rsquos reindeer for breakfast, reindeer for lunch and reindeer for dinner. The first course is reindeer, the second course is reindeer, and it\u0026rsquos reindeer for dessert. It\u0026rsquos funny but it\u0026rsquos true.SWNSRoman Abramovich\u0027s \u0026pound125million Kensington homeHe duly set about revitalising the local infrastructure reputedly spending hundreds of millions on overhauling energy systems and public services. Despite this level of brown-nosing, Abramovich clearly still felt insecure. In 2003, he purchased what one Moscow-based businessman called \u0026ldquothe cheapest insurance policy in history: Chelsea Football Club.At a stroke he became a household name in the UK and has earned the devotion of thousands of Blues fans for splashing out millions on top players such as Didier Drogba, Eden Hazard and \u0026Aacutelvaro Morata.As a result, if the Russian government moved against him they could be assured it would create headlines around the world and Downing Street would be all the more inclined to grant him political asylum.By now Abramovich was free of the taint of any association with Berezovsky, having bought his 50 per cent share of Sibneft from him for a bargain basement \u0026pound1billion in 2001. Valery SharifulinTassAbramovich never forgot that the president owned the jailsWhen I interviewed Berezovsky at his Mayfair office in 2004 he said: \u0026ldquoAbramovich told me that if I didn\u0026rsquot sell, Putin will destroy the company. Asked if he would sue, he replied: \u0026ldquoNo, I think now it\u0026rsquos useless.But seven years later he changed his mind and launched a High Court action alleging blackmail, breach of trust and breach of contract and sought over \u0026pound3billion in damages.After the most expensive private prosecution in British legal history, the judge threw out Berezovsky\u0026rsquos suit and awarded costs to the defendant. A year later, Berezovsky allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself.By now Abramovich had sold Sibneft, accepting a \u0026pound9.75billion offer from the state-run energy conglomerate Gazprom in 2005. As the American-born Russia investor William Browder once told me: \u0026ldquoThe richer you are, the more vulnerable you are. When six guys own 60 per cent of the assets of a country, ultimately they aren\u0026rsquot going to get to keep it.\u0026ldquoAbramovich\u0026rsquos great epiphany was to realise that and sell everything he could possibly get out of. It\u0026rsquos better to have $10billion in cash than $20billion in assets that are vulnerable to confiscation.The Times reported in 2008 that court papers showed that Abramovich had admitted paying billions of dollars for political favours and protection in the course of securing his share of the country\u0026rsquos mineral wealth.A related allegation named Putin himself. In 2016, the respected BBC programme Panorama reported that the oligarch had given Putin a \u0026pound25million yacht.Given all this background, it is not surprising that Abramovich\u0026rsquos name appears in a list of people believed to be benefiting from the Putin presidency published by the US Congress at the end of January.More surprising, perhaps, is that it has taken this long for the British authorities to act by apparently refusing to renew his visa.\u0026bull Dominic Midgley is co-author of Abramovich, The Billionaire From Nowhere-----------------Billionaire Roman must explain his wealthChelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich will have to provide evidence about the sources of his vast wealth to be allowed back into the UK under a tough new visa scheme, write David Maddox and Macer Hall.The revelation has come after Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson hinted that there could be a crackdown on prominent Russians with close ties to President Vladimir Putin being allowed into the UK.The Russian billionaire missed his team\u0026rsquos victory in the FA Cup Final over Manchester United at Wembley because his Tier 1 investor visa had run out and he was unable to re-enter the country. But Downing Street has revealed that he has been caught up in tough new visa requirements introduced in 2015 to force the super rich to show that their money is legal and not from criminal sources.The same rules mean that all 700 of the super-rich Russians currently entitled to live in the UK as well as others who use the 40-month investor visa are being looked at to see if they meet the new requirements.The review does not affect Mr Abramovich directly because his visa ran out while he was outside the UK.The Prime Minister\u0027s spokesman said: Work is under way in terms of reviewing Tier 1 investor visas. In 2014-15 we took action to tighten up this route, including the introduction of new powers to refuse applications where there are reasonable grounds to believe funds have been obtained unlawfully. As a result applications reduced by 84 per cent.We are taking another look at how the route operates and are undertaking further checks on investors who came to the UK through this route before the reforms were introduced.The new measures were brought in to tackle potential criminal activity and money laundering.SAUL LOEBAFPGettyPresident Trump has issued a list of Russian iniduals and companies to face sanctionsMeanwhile, Mr Johnson last night hinted at further measures to crack down on prominent Russians in Britain with links to the Kremlin following the revelation that Mr Abramovich has not been issued with a new UK visa.The Foreign Secretary, visiting Argentina yesterday, refused to comment on the news that the multibillionaire is unclear about his application for a new entrepreneurial visa being granted.But Mr Johnson signalled that the Government was studying other measures to target associates of President Putin as a result of the diplomatic freeze following the Salisbury nerve agent poisoning. I think it\u0027s very difficult for me to comment on inidual visa issues it would be totally wrong of me to do so, said the Foreign Secretary.There is a broader question about what the UK can do to crack down on people close to Putin who may have illicit or ill-gotten wealth and as you know we have a statute that allows us to use unexplained wealth orders against them, but we live under the rule of law so whatever happens must be done in accordance with the rules and the law, he added.Mr Johnson said tougher sanctions on Russia imposed by US President Donald Trump appeared to be having some effect. The truth is actually that I think the effect of some of those sanctions particularly on some iniduals has been very marked and I\u0027ve noted that, but we have our own systems and our own approach and we have to do it in accordance with the law and accordance with the evidence, he said."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/brexit-news-uk-eu-customs-union-theresa-may-ireland-border-963342.jpg","title":"Brexit news negotiations UK EU Brussels Theresa May customs union Irish border","story":"Brexit news: Negotiations resume in Brussels after Theresa May\u0027s customs compromise The Prime Minister offered a new \u0026ldquobackstop proposal while attending the EU\u0026rsquos Western Balkan summit in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia in a bid to once again move along halted negotiations of the UK and EU\u0026rsquos future relationship.Westminster\u0026rsquos new proposal involved keeping Britain locked to the EU\u0026rsquos customs union until the Irish border question is truly satisfied, however, this isn\u0026rsquot well received by the British Government\u0026rsquos Brexiteers.The EU had initially proposed just keeping Northern Ireland in the customs union, creating a goods border in the Irish Sea, but this was rejected by Mrs May, leaving negotiations in limbo.After a meeting with Mrs May, Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar said he believed his British counterpart had made real progress in moving Brexiteers in her Cabinet closer to accepting the need for a backstop.This has once again heralded the opportunity for talks on the future relationship after Mr Varadkar admit he feared negotiations could completely breakdown with Britain closer than ever to leaving the EU without a deal because of the border issue.While it is not expected for Mrs May\u0026rsquos proposal will be based out this week, as Government officials have refused to comment on the matter, talks will cover many technical elements of the orce.An official agenda, released by both the EU and UK sides, says meetings will be held from Tuesday to Thursday to discuss the \u0026ldquofuture relationship and the \u0026ldquowithdrawal agreement\u0026rsquos remaining issues.The European Commission\u0026rsquos chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier admit there is still around 25 percent.

But this was noticeably a different crowd from William and Kate’s wedding in 2011.There were more black faces, more brown faces, and more of a sense the entire nation felt included in a way they never did in the past.“She will modernise the Royal Family,” said Val West of Staines, Surrey. “There are millions of us who have been living in mixed-race families for years. The Windsors have joined us in the 21st century.”The last time an American divorcee married into the Royal Family, the British monarchy had a meltdown.This time, it might be the American divorcee who saves them.But you had to wonder if Meghan Markle TRULY understands what she’s getting into. She will be scrutinised like no other woman for the rest of her life.The fact she is 36 and has had a life — Diana was 19 when she wed Charles and died at 36 — will hold her in good stead, as will marrying a man clearly crazy about her.But there will be unimaginable pressure on Meghan to keep smiling, to keep hugging, to make the fairytale come true and — oh yes — produce a baby before she turns 40. So, even on this happiest of days, you had to fear for the bride.Because on Saturday we watched a once-obscure actress cement her place as without ­question the most famous woman on the planet.And you have to worry, just a ­little, about Harry. Like his brother, Harry sometimes seems a tad sulky about the constant, never-ending interest in his life.Behind the charming smiles, the younger royals too frequently seem to lack the stoic sense of duty the Queen has displayed for a lifetime, as though being born into the Royal Family is a heavy burden — when of course it is also a fantastic privilege.And you can’t dream of the quiet life when you just married the Grace Kelly of the 21st Century, a woman who blends regal charisma with Hollywood va-va-voom like nobody else alive. But this was not a day for nagging doubts.This was a day for believing Meghan and Harry will have the happy-ever-after they deserve, that the boy and girl from broken homes will build a home that lasts.The build-up to this special day has been difficult.Arranging your wedding day is never easy when you come from a dysfunctional, divorce-riven family full of bat-crazy relatives — and that’s just Harry!But thoughts of the sad past melted away in the sunshine. In 1947 Churchill called the Queen’s wedding “a flash of colour on the hard road we travel”.Windsor on Saturday made you believe we have not changed as much as we may have feared. The last was George V when he married Princess Victoria Mary of Teck at St James’s Palace in 1893.Harry had to get special permission from the Queen to keep his facial hair.As he is no longer a serving officer, Her Majesty had to give the OK for him to wear his military uniform.Since it is customary to be clean-shaven when in uniform, it is believed that her permission also covered Harry’s facial fuzz.Historian Hugo Vickers said: “Theoretically the Army don’t like it.”Along with brother Wills, Harry was in the frock coat uniform of the Household Cavalry’s Blues and Royals.They were hand-tailored by royal outfitters Dege and Skinner, of Savile Row in central London.A Royal Crown on his shoulder indicated Harry has been promoted to Major since leaving the Army as a Captain in 2015.He would have had the honour bestowed on him by The Queen, who can promote members of the Royal Family in line with their peers because they hold military appointments.On his left chest Harry displayed his Pilots’ Wings, awarded when he served with the Army Air Corps as an Apache helicopter pilot.His medal ribbons were the Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order Afghanistan with rosette The Queen’s Golden Jubilee and Diamond Jubilee. These were our people on the streets of Windsor. Men like Ray Brown, dressed as Uncle Sam — his friend Janet Butterfield was in a Union Jack dress — who had travelled all night from Yorkshire to cheer on the Long Walk.And Grace Gothard, from London out of Ghana, who wore a homemade dress she wore to Kate and William’s wedding.And you had to admire their patriotism, their good-natured humour, the quiet fortitude it took to be on those streets for hours.And this is our country, you realised, the real country that exists beyond the soft, sneering elite in Westminster. These decent, patriotic, polite people who are so often ignored are the best of us.We are often told this country is bitterly and permanently divided.But on Saturday in the spring sunshine of Windsor, it felt like those cheering crowds held up a mirror to the nation’s soul. And we did not seem divided at all.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She stormed: “I remember Diana, the Princess of Wales taking her young sons out at night to see the street-sleepers.“This week we have had stories of Windsor’s street cleaners cleaning the street homeless, who had their possessions compounded, while keen monarchists sleep out in their clothes so they can cheer on the Royal parade.“I can’t believe she would have remained silent on £30m spent on security for a Royal carriage ride around Windsor while street homeless are so cruelly displaced.”And pointing out that Kensington is the joint poorest ward in London and that their health is getting worse, she added: “what does her youngest son think of that?”The Kensington MP, whose constituency covers Grenfell tower, accused the Royals of not doing enough to help those affected by the tragic blaze which killed 71 people last summer.Ms Dent Coat said it was a “lovely idea” to use the hundreds of rooms in Royal palaces to house the homeless.It is estimated that the Royals help Britain take in £500m every year in tourism revenues from their estates and buildings.And they spend their time helping dozens of deserving charities, including Help for Heroes, organising the Invictus Games and promoting mental health campaign Heads Together.Ms Dent Coad sparked uproar last September for pouring scorn on Prince Harry’s military record – saying “Harry can’t actually fly a helicopter”.Speaking at a fringe event at Labour Party conference, she said: “He tried to pass the helicopter exam about four times and he couldn’t get through it all – so he always goes for the co-pilot. So he just sits there going ‘vroom vroom’.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, Harry’s acted.They all talked about modernising the Royal Family. Harry has actually done it with a bride and a wedding service like no other.“Love,” Bishop Curry told us in his extraordinary sermon — which spoke in accents unheard of in polite English churches — “love can change this world.”It’s sure changed the Royal Family. Ms Markle, it is worth repeating, is mixed-race, American, of uncertain religion, an actress, divorced and with a sexual history.In the past any one of these would have rendered her deeply doubtful as a royal bride and the combination would have ruled her out entirely. But the times they are a’changing.The stigma of divorce was still powerful as late as the 1990s, which is why it took so long to dissolve the disastrous marriage of Harry’s parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana.But their divorce, and Charles’s subsequent remarriage to Camilla, acted as a sort of earthquake which brought all the remaining conventions of royal marriages — virginal brides, nice English girls, no divorce — tumbling down.Which, in a nutshell, is how the Royal Family came to get Meghan.But why did Meghan want to become royal? The short answer is that she wanted Harry. But so did lots of other women, who all baulked at the prospect of becoming royal.Not Meghan. Indeed, she seems to have embraced it as passionately as Harry himself.As an actress, of course she wasn’t fazed by the publicity that had so put off Harry’s earlier girlfriends. But there’s more to it than that.At university she took a double major in theatre and international studies — which was her real love.She became an intern in the American embassy in Argentina. She took the exam to enter the US State Department, which is the equivalent of our Foreign Office.It was only when she failed the notoriously difficult test that she turned to acting.Moreover, the moment she enjoyed success and fame with Suits, she used it to leverage her entry on to the international stage as “Global Ambassador” for World Vision Canada, among many other good causes.In other words, acting was not her vocation. It was only a means to an end.And that end is much better served by her marrying Harry, becoming royal and using her fame — and his — to serve the issues, particularly women’s issues, she is so keen on.So you could say that Harry — the eternal boy-man — is marrying his mother, since Diana used her fame too.But Diana did it in opposition to her estranged husband. Meghan aims to do it in partnership with Harry and at the very heart of the Royal Family.And she’s proving astonishingly adept — is it those actressy skills again? — at winning over the British establishment.Back in the 1930s, the Archbishop of Canterbury was the deadly foe of Wallis Simpson, King Edward VIII’s divorced American bride, and led to his abdication.Today, Archbishop Justin Welby is Meghan’s best friend. Indeed, he’s practically three in a bed with the couple.There’s chemistry, of course. But there’s also calculation on both sides.Welby wants to use Meghan, who as an American does religion as well as touchy-feely, to spearhead a religious revival among the young.The Royal Family also want to buy into her as an international brand.Which is why the Queen appointed Harry Commonwealth Youth Ambassador.Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKKeeping the Commonwealth going in the face of the overwhelming indifference of British politicians of all parties has been the greatest personal achievement of the Queen’s long reign.And she capped it by ruthlessly stage-managing Charles’s acclamation as her successor as Head of the Commonwealth at the most recent Commonwealth Conference.That was the constitutional bit sorted out.Harry’s appointment addresses the equally important question of PR.Meghan and Harry are the model modern couple: Mature (well, she is), bi-racial,bi-cultural, international, do-gooding, fashion-conscious and media-savvy to their fingertips.They are the perfect face of a modern monarchy at home and ideal Global Ambassadors for Brand Windsor abroad.And, come to think of it — which I’m sure the Queen and her advisers have done — they are the perfect Global Ambassadors for post-Brexit Brand Britain as well.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It showed this country is world class.The sub-plot, of course, was the emotional union between the damaged children of two broken families.Fans have long yearned for Prince Harry to find happiness after the roller-coaster life and shocking death of his fabled mother, Princess Diana.They have warmed to a young man who transformed himself from a mixed-up kid to a likeable soldier, helicopter pilot and champion of war-damaged Invictus casualties.As for his bride, Meghan Markle is the glamorous star of hit TV series Suits, who dreamed as a child of becoming a princess.Best of all in this age of right-on political correctness, she is the daughter of a charming African-American mother and an Emmy-winning Hollywood lighting specialist.The House of Windsor is now truly multicultural.It is also hip.Our amazing sovereign, at 92, and doughty Prince Philip, 96, both heading for their royal telegrams, are the Queen and King of Cool.Where else in the world would you see an Elton John double act with Windy City preacher Bishop Michael Curry?This was a truly uplifting occasion, worn lightly by a once-stuffy Royal Family.Nobody does it better when it comes to choreographing mounted cavalry, trumpets, banners and horse-drawn carriages with an electric-powered E-Type and a vintage Rolls-Royce.All underscored by a sense of humour, as Harry and his supportive brother William exchanged banter at the altar of Windsor’s historic St George’s Chapel.Even the weather turned out in tribute, bathing Windsor Great Park’s glorious greenery in spring sunshine.There may have been some muffled coughs over Markle family squabbles but they were nothing compared with the torrid dramas leading to the Queen’s own “annus horribilis”.The world has become used to British pageantry.But this Royal Wedding was a timely reminder that Britain is not just a small island with a fading history on the edge of Europe.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex ride in a carriage down The Long Walk back towards Windsor Castle after getting married in St Georges Chapel, WindsorThe 21st-century United Kingdom is an unrivalled brand on the global stage.The world was witnessing more than mere pomp and circumstance.This was UK plc on international parade, joining hands with the global community in a way no other nation can match — even the mighty USA.Had Meghan married into the family of a French or American president, a German Chancellor or a Kremlin tsar, would anyone have tuned in?Neither China nor Russia could captivate so many friendly eyeballs.The Olympics might do it.But London 2012 revealed Britain is best on these occasions, too.On Saturday, Britain proved it is capable of reaching out to a world beyond borders.Harry and Meghan’s marriage bonded the UK indelibly with the US.If the new Duke and Duchess have kids, they will be American citizens — as well as British due to Harry’s lineage — and will eventually be liable to American tax.Importantly, this wedding had special significance for the 2.5billion citizens of 52 Commonwealth countries, especially in Africa and the Caribbean, who swear allegiance to the Queen.My Australian in-laws were constantly on the phone from Sydney this weekend, all thoughts of becoming a republic abandoned, to discuss the finer points of royal protocol.But this event was watched from lands with no current ties to Britain — South America, the Far East and the Gulf States.It was a showcase of modern Britain forever adapting to change, the key to our success as an outward-looking nation.There was a clear hint of defiance, too. This steely couple were doing it their way.Our Brexit negotiators — on both sides of the argument — should take note.That big wide world, viewing us in high definition on Saturday, is where Britain’s future lies.These are our markets.The audience liked what they saw and they want some of what we’re having.In marketing terms alone, it was priceless.Too often we underestimate our strength and standing.We have developed an absurd inferiority complex.We’ve been led to believe we are too weak and puny to stand alone on the global stage.Yet we are among the world’s greatest economies, second only to Germany in the EU.We are a nuclear power with a real professional army which has helped keep the peace in Europe, and have an envied place on the UN Security Council.Republican lefties despise all this stuff.They smear Britain’s record as a brutal colonial power while ignoring our global lead in abolishing slavery.Disturbingly, some Conservatives seem to agree the UK is washed up and past its prime.Since we cannot run our own economy, they say, we should hand the job to unelected bureaucrats in Brussels.These, remember, would be the same Brussels flunkies who created the euro, wrecked the economies of member states and put millions of unemployed young people on the scrap heap.Most of those workless youngsters gratefully upped sticks and moved here.I wonder why?Saturday’s Royal Wedding showed we are in the Premier League.Now the world is watching, perhaps with slightly less enthusiasm, as another British saga lurches towards its climax — another broken family consumed with jealousy and bent on revenge.The cast is familiar — the statutory drunk, a bully who prefers to talk with a gun in his hand, some characters who would prefer a car crash to a happy ending.Can we stop the bickering and reach a good Brexit deal?Why can’t the Leavers and Remainers put the country first, join hands, bury their differences and take a vow to work together to serve the national interest?Inspired by the Royal Wedding, by the poem Invictus, we can rise above petty differences.“We are the masters of our fate: We are the captains of our soul.”Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Oh well.Most married couples leave it 18 months before they reach that arrangement.But on that bombshell it was on with the Royal Wedding, which normally divides the nation into two distinct camps.There are the royalists, who have great fun watching all the pomp and pageantry on television.And the republicans, who have great fun hating all the pomp and pageantry on television.So the only real choice to be made, for all of us, is: Which channel?Personally, six hours of a photobombing Kay Burley giving it the full Partridge on Sky News was a punishment that’s way beyond me, as was five hours of the E! channel gang ­yelling: “Oh my God. Wow!”ITV was never going to be anything less than thoroughly professional in the hands of Julie Etchingham and Phillip Schofield, once he shut up about Holly Willoughby, so I went with the Beeb, where Naga called it a night shortly after announcing Prince Harry was now: “The Duke of Essex.”Oi! Oi! “Sussex rather.” Oh. Pity.The real surprise for some of you, though, might have been discovering that to give it an informal vibe, ­alongside Kirsty Young, BBC1’s 9am-and-beyond coverage was now being fronted by the strangely contorted ­figure of Dermot O’Leary — the former host of ITV’s The Marriage Ref.A show that may have been the ­perfect rehearsal for most royal ­weddings, but probably not this one.They weren’t alone, obviously.The Beeb had the joint surrounded, in fact, by among others Huw Edwards, ­fashion expert Jo Elvin, who was “across the dress” (as clueless as the rest of us), Alex Jones, Ore Oduba and Anita Rani, who performed the ­essential task of repeating what the other person had just said.Ore: “First glimpse of the dress, it’s going to be a moment.”Anita: “It’s going to be a moment.” Traditionally, of course, on these great state occasions, the moment TV crews start interviewing other TV crews is the cue for the coverage to descend into flannel, repetition, idle speculation, cliche (“Excitement’s ­building”), imponderable questions and outright stupidity.On Saturday, by slight contrast, the trigger was actually the arrival of Oprah Winfrey and the first trickle of celebrity guests, who had a clearly ­nervous ­Dermot asking: “When the invite says ‘hats’, does that mean hats are an absolute given?”“Absolutely, it does,” said Kirsty, slapping him down testily.It got progressively worse with each arrival as well.So by the time Amal Clooney wafted in alongside husband George, who was dressed as one of Modern Romance, even basic motor tasks seemed beyond some of the BBC team.Kirsty: “It can be difficult to wear a hat, can’t it?”Jo: “I think so, yes.”In fairness, it should also be stated this idiocy was certainly not restricted to the BBC.I switched over to ITV during the ­arrivals and heard Meghan’s old drama teacher, Gigi Perreau, say: “This is incredible and we’re right there. Well, we’re here but we’re also there, so it’s fabulous.”It’s just the nature of the beast.With so much time to fill, everyone will say these things.Only the BBC, though, could possibly leave me feeling queasy with the choice of one of its Royal Wedding experts.This was left-wing “social commentator” Afua Hirsch, who was privately educated and has led a life of unimaginable advantage, compared to most of us, but is also a professional victim who thinks pretty much ­everything is “racist”, wants Nelson’s Column torn down and wasn’t about to drop her agenda with such a large audience at her mercy.“While I have felt alienated by the inherited privilege,” said Afua, who’s enjoyed more than most, “my own struggles with identity have made me appreciate the need for cultural ­continuity.“So while I didn’t relate to the Royal Family, I did relate to that need for a sense of tradition.”Quite a brass neck, isn’t it, speaking out against the whole concept of the Royal Family, while simultaneously using them to increase your TV profile, as Afua had been doing all week.Instead of telling her so, or pointing out Harry’s ex Chelsy Davy had arrived while she was guffing away, a nodding Dermot said he could listen to Afua “all day”.A claim I doubt, frankly.Indeed, I reckon he’d have been throwing himself off Windsor Castle’s ramparts before breakfast if he’d tried.No one else, I suspect though, was listening to a single word she said.Nor will they have needed Afua’s lofty approval to enjoy a day filled with so many memorable events, including Bishop Michael Curry’s fiery address to the congregation, the ­reappearance of the Duke of Edinburgh and Meghan’s Rolls-Royce ­hurtling up the Long Walk past 100,000 Union Flags like it was being driven by Richard Hammond.These are all magical moments you’ll possibly want to watch again — and if you do, having sat through both start to finish, I’d probably recommend the ITV version.It had the better ­historic detail, was never in any danger of missing Chelsy Davy’s arrival and rounded everything off nicely as well.Over on the BBC, meanwhile, Kirsty did it by searching for profundities and going where angels feared to tread.“Something has travelled between Harry and Meghan that might be the next page of the story, where they give us a gorgeous little product of their union which we might enjoy too . . . ?”Though not if Naga’s honeymoon arrangements are to be believed, they won’t.Obviously.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Later, I went back with him after he had built a night school for the boys, and asked over a cup of tea: “Why are you doing this, Harry?”He replied: “This is the most important thing I do.”It tells you everything about who his mother was.Inside the Chapel, the hymn was Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer, which was played at Princess Diana’s funeral and one of her favourites.Di’s sister Lady Jane Fellowes delivered the only reading. Listening to it was Sarah, the Duchess of York, who had not been invited to other recent royal weddings.Inviting Fergie was a brilliant thing to do. During Diana’s troubled times every Sunday she would drive down to Berkshire to have lunch with Fergie, spending the afternoon talking about their divorces.Outside in the Chapel courtyard were 2,000 people from Harry and Meghan’s charities, including servicemen who have lost limbs.Harry is following Diana’s hugely successful campaign to stop landmines by working with those who have been wounded by IEDs.When Harry was flying back from one of his tours of Afghanistan he shared the plane with three soldiers who were in a coma.He realised these soldiers, if they recovered, would have limbs missing and facing a life of misery — which is why he inspired them with his support for the Invictus Games.And Harry and Meghan asked guests to make donations to the Children’s HIV Association.Harry has clearly never forgotten how his mother took the stigma out of Aids by embracing sufferers, including babies in Brazil.And then there was the ring. On Saturday night Meghan was wearing the emerald-cut aquamarine ring Diana first wore in 1996.Harry once told ITV’s Tom Bradby: “I wanted to do something that would make my mother proud.” He succeeded on Saturday.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I might only have a slim chance.According to Sky News, the mum-of-one added: There is something called clemency.Give me that for the sake of my baby. She hasnt seen her father for over two years now.I would ask the judge today to close this new case and give me parole, so that I can go home and have another baby and have a normal life.The judge said he would address her case as a priority.Earlier, her husband Richard said they were holding our breath after she appeared in the Iranian court on Saturday.She has been told she faces new charges of spreading propaganda and is likely to be convicted.And Boris Johnson today insisted the Foreign Office is working on a daily basis to free her.The 40-year-old charity worker appeared at the hearing where she was presented with a 200-page document and told she needed a new lawyer.Richard, speaking to The Sun Online, dismissed the so-called evidence against her.He said: Most of it seems to be press cuttings of our campaign, its not ‘evidence’ of her having done stuff.”Despite the new hearing the couple are still in the dark as to what happens next.Richard said: “Our experience of the court process so far is that it hasn’t been very positive so there’s a bit of holding our breath this time.“In terms of what happens next? Who knows.”During the hearing Judge Salavait warned her that she was likely to be found guilty and dismissed her lawyer and gave her just ten days to find a new one.The couple have been given some hope as the court allowed Nazanin to phone the British embassy for the first time since being in prison.Richard said: “The court case happened on Saturday, which made us pretty low. Then there was the phone call on Sunday which made us more upbeat.“The fact that she was allowed to call is a good thing. It’s very easy for me to over-read things and get confused.”He added the response of the embassy had been quite cautious - I guess they were trying to get their bearings on why this was allowed.”Richard added that he hoped the Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson would do everything in his powers to help.He said: “We’ll try and meet with the Foreign Office this week and work out what’s going on and we will want the Foreign Secretary to do what he can.That would be an intervention. One of the things we asked before was for him to try and visit her and to make it really clear that the UK was standing by her.“We also asked that the Government protest – the ambassador protesting and the Foreign Secretary protesting, which would be a more serious level.“The gravitas of the Foreign Secretary can make a difference.”“I’d like him to do what he can. It’s not for me to tell him how to do it.”Speaking during a trip to Buenos Aires today, Mr Johnson insisted his officials are dedicated to helping the British mum.He told reporters: I can tell you absolutely sincerely that there is not a day that goes by in which we are not working in the Foreign Office on every single one of the incredibly sad consular cases that we have - and particularly the difficult cases we have in Iran.But he claimed it would not help Nazanins case to give regular updates - adding that Mr Ratcliffe should be reassured by the attention the Foreign Office is giving to her ordeal.During the hearing Judge Salavait told her she was likely to be found guilty.Human rights body Amnesty International described the judges comments of a likely conviction over the new charges as another body blow.Kerry Moscogiuri, Amnesty International UK’s Campaigns Director, said: “This is yet another body blow for Nazanin.The latest developments in the case come at a time of heightened tensions between Iran and the West after Donald Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal recently, breaking with US allies in Europe and potentially worsening the crisis in the Middle East.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo signalled today that the United States would take a hardline against the Islamic Republic, saying the US would impose the strongest sanctions in history if the countrys leadership did not change its foreign and domestic policy.The actions of the US though has led to a split with its European Union allies, including Britain.Mr Johnson attempted to salvage the nuclear deal by holding crisis talks to thrash out a last-minute deal in the hope that Tehran did not ditch the deal.Nazanin has been held in Iran on spying claims since 2016, when she was arrested during a holiday with her daughter Gabriella.Nazanin was originally arrested at Tehran airport on April 3, 2016.After being detained for over five months, initially in solitary confinement for 45 days without access to a lawyer, Nazanin was sentenced to five years in prison in September 2016 after being convicted of “membership of an illegal group”.She is currently being held in Tehrans Evin Prison.Members of Nazanin’s family visited prosecutors for an update on her case earlier this month, and according to Mr Ratcliffe they say she is being used as a bargaining chip.He said she told him of the development in a 5.30am phone call on May 14, and added: I have no clue why they have started all this nonsense again. They know Boris is coming.Please take me out of this, please. My parents have had enough. I want my daughter back. She needs both of us. So tell the world. Enough of this nonsense."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000407928594.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"roman abramovich vladimir putin relationship russia yacht","story":"The Chelsea owner, 51, and his business dealings are under the spotlight once again after his UK visa was delayed amid a government probe into Russian oligarchs living in Britain.Known for his “stealthy” and often ruthless business acumen, Abramovich has amassed a fortune of £9billion thanks to his close ties to the Kremlin and in particular President Vladimir Putin, 61.After meeting future business partner and Kremlin insider Boris Berezovsky in 1993, Abramovich was able to forge alliances in the Yeltsin government including with Putin.He and former car dealer Berezovsky were able to buy Siberian oil giant Sibneft for less than $200 million (£148 million) in an auction which is alleged to have been rigged.But it was his relationship with then-Prime Minister Putin which enabled him to consolidate Russia’s warring aluminium industry between himself and a small number of other oligarchs.The mega deal – made in February 2000, three months before Putin became the country’s President – would transform Abramovich’s life and business portfolio.A Putin biographer described the ex-KGB spys relationship with Abramovich as being similar to that of a father and favourite son, reports The Times.In 2016, it was revealed that the billionaire was able to gift the Kremlin strongman a £25million superyacht named Olympia.Putin is said to have maintained the luxury boat using state funds.In 2012, a high court judge said Abramovich had “very good relations” and privileged access to Putin.The oligarch, who purchased Chelsea football club in 2003, was in court after Berezovsky accused him of forcing him to sell his Sibneft shares for a cut price.But despite acknowledging Abramovich’s strong relationship with Putin, judge Mrs Justice Gloster said his influence on the government’s decision-making was “limited.She said: There was no evidential basis supporting the contention that Mr Abramovich was in a position to manipulate, or otherwise influence, President Putin, or officers in his administration, to exercise their powers in such a way as to enable Mr Abramovich to achieve his own commercial goals.I am prepared to assume that, on occasion, President Putin may have taken his views into account when making decisions, but the suggestion that Mr Abramovich was in a position to pull the presidential strings was simply not borne out by the evidence.She ruled in the Chelsea owners favour calling him courteousand frank while accusing Berozovsky of being an inherently unreliable witness.Orphaned at four, and adopted by his uncle, Abramovich left school at 16 and briefly studied engineering before joining the army.After working as a mechanic, he started his own business becoming a market trader in 1980s Moscow selling toys such as rubber ducks.At the age of 25, he is accused of “procuring financial gain by means of fraud” by allegedly forging three million kilograms of diesel in 1992.The fuel, carried by five railway tankers and worth 3.8bn roubles (around £400million), was “emptied and appropriated”, reports the .The rumours surrounding the diesel tankers have never been substantiated.By the early 1990s, Abramovich reportedly set up and liquidated at least 20 companies in industries as diverse as tyre retreading and bodyguard recruitment.But it was during a Caribbean holiday in 1993 where he would meet Kremlin insider Boris Berezovsky and forge one of the most significant relationships of his career.Abramovich admitted in court that he paid Berezovsky a total of $2.5bn for political access inside President Boris Yeltsins 1990s government.In the mid-90s, the pair were able to buy Siberian oil giant Sibneft for less than $200 million despite the firm being valued at $15billion (£11billion) in 2003Through Berezovsky, Abramovich was able to forge an alliance with Yeltsin ally Vladimir Putin."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000407971109.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"royal wedding official photos meghan markle prince harry

the American actress standing by her royal husband, the Queen and her yoga instructor mother.Highlights from the Royal WeddingAnother more relaxed photograph shows the newlyweds sitting on some steps, with Prince Harrys arm protectively around his new wife as they both beam with delight hours after being declared man and wife.In a statement from Kensington Palace, the newlyweds said: The Duke and Duchess would like to thank everyone who took part in the celebrations of their Wedding.They feel so lucky to have been able to share their day with all those gathered in Windsor and those who watched on television across the UK, Commonwealth, and around the world.In the third photograph, Prince Harry and Meghan can be seen sitting on the floor in Windsor Castle - surrounded by their adorable bridesmaids and pageboys, including Prince George and Princess Charlotte.Fifth-in-line to the throne Charlotte particularly seemed to be at home in front of the camera, with the three-year-old having been on sparkling form all day.And big brother George seemed to appear slightly more comfortable as he stood with the couple, giving a cheeky grin in the snaps.Meanwhile, two-year-old Zalie Warren appeared to be distracted in both photographs.The toddler stared off into the distance while the other members of the bridal party posed for the camera.But while the photographs have been flooded with compliments, some fans have noticed a bizarre optical illusion in two of the snaps thanks to mirrors in the drawing room.The photographs come just days after Prince Harry married Meghan Markle in front of a star-studded crowd from the Queen to the Clooneys.The Prince, who has previously revealed that he knew Meghan was the one for him the moment they met, hadnt hesitated to propose to the US actress.And the pairs whirlwind romance came to a head over the weekend when Meghan married her very own Prince in the romantic ceremony that broke with tradition and celebrated the couples modern relationship.The wedding ceremony saw the couple seal the deal with a sweet kiss in front of Windsors St Georges Chapel.Prince Harry couldnt take his eyes off his new wife, who stunned in a simply elegant white gown by Givenchy designer Clare Waight Keller.The new Duchess of Sussex completed her look with Queen Mary’s diamond bandeau, made in 1932 - on loan from the Queen.Meanwhile, Prince Harry has been praised for his humility and commitment for choosing to wear his regiments Blues and Royals uniform with the rank of Major, instead of his generals uniform.More than 100,000 people turned out in Windsor to greet the newlyweds as they made their way through the town after the ceremony.The thousands of people who were in Windsor in person - plus the millions of viewers who tuned in around the world - were left melting at the couples adoring relationship.From Harry whispering I missed you to Meghan when she arrived at the altar to the flowers he had picked for her bouquet the day before, every moment of the wedding was filled with the couples unique identity and love for each other.Wedding watchers hailed Prince Harry and Meghan, saying the couple had thrown the Royal Family into the 21st century with their modern ceremony that included a gospel choir and charismatic American bishop. Ingrid Seward, Editor in Chief of Majesty Magazine, told The Sun Online: Theres never been a royal wedding like in modern history.It was certainly a departure from tradition and and bodes well for the future of the modern monarchy.Their wholly modern ceremony was a far cry from Royal Weddings of previous generations and showed the Monarchy mirroring modern Britain.Mixed-race divorcee Meghan, 36, was embraced with open arms by her in-laws — a welcome not extended to previous newcomers to the family."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/cen-pregnantelderly-01.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"worlds oldest mother maria de la luz mazatlan

It can become a very disabling disease."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000407986374.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"prince harry and meghan arrive

persuade officials to allow him back into the UK for six weeks now in a process that used to only take three weeks, it was revealed last night.The 51 year-old oil tycoon is believed to have been

Johnson also signalled they could face a fresh round of personal sanctions for being close to Putin.Revealing the clampdown, the PM’s official spokesman said: “Work is under way in terms of reviewing Tier 1 investor visas.“In 2014-15 we took action to tighten up the Tier 1 investor route, including the introduction of new powers to refuse applications where there are reasonable grounds to believe funds have been obtained unlawfully.“We are currently taking another look at how the route operates and are undertaking further checks on investors who came to the UK through this route before the

“to crack down on people close to Putin who may have illicit or ill-gotten wealth”.Pointing to new US sanctions recently slapped on Putin’s cronies, Mr Johnson said: “The truth is actually that I think the effect of some of those sanctions - particularly on some individuals - has been very marked and I’ve noted that”.The Kremlin refused to discuss Mr Abramovich’s embarrassment, but branded a

So the inescapable conclusion is that Mr Livingstone has jumped before he was pushed. After left-wing activist Marc Wadsworth was expelled for bringing the party intro disrepute for comments towards the Labour MP Ruth Smeeth a few weeks ago, the disciplinary panel would probably had found against \"Red Ken\" too.Critics of Mr Corbyn claimed earlier this year that he had hounded out Labour\u0027s former general secretary Iain McNicol, awarded a peerage on the eve of the Royal Wedding last week, and that his replacement, former Unite official Jennie Formby, was a stooge.But to be fair to the new general secretary, in the short time since she succeeded Mr McNicol both Marc Wadsworth and now Mr Livingstone have gone, suggesting she has made a swift impact and confounding those critics who claim the Labour leadership has failed to tackle anti-Semitism.As a result, his one-year suspension was extended by another year.It was then that the Labour MP John Mann confronted the former London mayor in front of reporters in Westminster, accusing him of being a \"Nazi apologist\".Mr Mann, who chairs parliament\u0027s All-Party Parliamentary Group Against Antisemitism, chased Mr Livingstone up the stairs at the Westminster offices of Sky News, shouting and calling him a \"f****** disgrace\", which resulted in extraordinary TV pictures showing the clash.This year, the anti-Semitism row in the Labour Party has become more damaging.An unprecedented demonstration by Jewish organisations, supported by dozens of Labour MPs, filled Parliament Square and there was evidence that the row robbed Labour of taking control of Barnet Council in the elections on 3 May.After the Parliament Square demonstration, the leaders of the same organisations held a meeting with Mr Corbyn in Westminster, but immediately dismissed the talks as a missed opportunity.The first demand of these Jewish groups - and the so-called \"moderate\" Labour MPs who joined them in Parliament Square in March - was the expulsion of Mr Livingstone from the party.Some of Mr Livingstone\u0027s strongest critics are disappointed that he was not put through the formal disciplinary procedure and expelled, claiming that would have made his return to the party impossible, while resignation leaves the door slightly ajar.In his resignation statement, Mr Livingstone said he recognised he had caused offence and upset in the Jewish community. \"I am truly sorry for that,\" he said.But he said he does not accept the allegation that he has brought the Labour Party into disrepute, nor guilty of anti-Semitism. That suggests he is unrepentant and remains defiant. Mr Livingstone has, of course, quit the Labour Party before, when he stood as candidate for London mayor as an independent after he was denied the Labour nomination by a plot by Tony Blair to install Frank Dobson instead.Four years later he was back in the Labour fold, though, after a humiliating climbdown by Mr Blair, who declared tongue-in-cheek: \"I always said that Ken would make a good mayor.\""},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/8234c85d3080366e8983f8440b8953f8f9d07052b09b53175f8cb71cf547ecba_4317116.jpg?20180522092832 ","title":"live sky news reports from north korea nuclear site","story":"He added that the fact North Korea has allowed journalists, not weapons inspectors, to witness the dismantling of the site is significant because of the global publicity.The Sky News crew had its satellite phone confiscated by North Korean officials as they landed at the \"shiny new airport\" in Wonsan, which is \"more like a resort\".

New legislation will mean that only cleaner fuels and stoves will be sold for domestic heating, curbing polluting smoke and soot, under plans being put out for consultation. And councils will be given new powers to bring in clean air zones to tackle poor air from sources such as wood burners, for example limiting what people can burn or bringing in no-burn days, and from diesel-powered machinery. The clean air strategy is intended to cut the cost of air pollution to society by \u0026pound1 billion a year by 2020, and by \u0026pound2.5 billion a year by 2030. The aim is to halve, by 2025, the number of people living in areas where tiny particles known as particulate matter or PM2.5 are above safe levels set by the World Health Organisation .  These tiny particles can be breathed into the lungs and get into the bloodstream, causing health problems including heart disease, strokes and lung cancer. Officials say almost two-fifths (38%) of PM2.5 comes from domestic wood burners and open fires, which just 7.5% of homes have. The strategy also aims to tackle another part of the problem, ammonia from farming, by requiring farmers to invest in equipment and measures to reduce emissions from things such as slurry spread on fields. Under the plans, farmers will get support to bring in the equipment through the new system of agricultural payments for delivering public benefits, which is being devised to replace European subsidies after Brexit. But campaigners say more action is needed on other major sources of air pollution, in particular transport, to curb illegal levels of air pollution.  The Government is being taken to court by the European Commission over its failure to meet legal limits for harmful pollutant nitrogen dioxide, which should have been met by 2010, and has faced repeated legal action over the issue. During a visit to Imperial College London to meet air quality researchers, Environment Secretary Michael Gove admitted the Government had to do better on pollution and said it was important to tackle all sources of dirty air. The latest strategy comes after Government announcements on measures to tackle pollution from transport, including phasing out the sale of new conventional petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2040. Mr Gove said: It\u0027s critically important we make progress there, but it\u0027s also important we deal with other sources of air pollution, whether that\u0027s from slurry and manures spread on agricultural land or whether it\u0027s from wood burning or other ways people generate domestic fuel and power. I don\u0027t imagine many people will be aware of the way in which wood burning or the way in which agricultural pollution contributes to material in the air which doesn\u0027t just cause health problems, but limits life expectancy.

Ian McKenzie, a key figure in the battle between centrists and the left in south London, is being probed after the tweet from January 2016 was circulated online. The decision was mired in confusion early this morning after one Labour source said Mr McKenzie was suspended, only for a second senior source to say he was not.  Labour sources then confirmed Mr McKenzie had been suspended after all after he received an e-mail telling him at 9.25am. Mr McKenzie also stood down from his role as advisor to the new mayor of Newham Rokhsana Fiaz last night. The 2016 tweet from Ms McKenzie\u0027s account, now deleted, said: Emily Thornberry is too old for ISIS. They won\u0027t make a sex slave of her. They\u0027ll behead her and dump her in a mass grave.  Ms Thornberry is the Shadow Foreign Secretary.  Eighteen months later, in an apparent reference to the row, Mr McKenzie tweeted: Oh my God. \u0027I think it would be a very very bad thing if ISIS killed Emily Thornberry. The very idea disgusts me.\u0027 How\u0027s that? Another tweet in December 2015, which had not been deleted by this morning, had suggested a female commentator might agree sex slavery to one man only, provided he didn\u0027t sell her on or insist on gang rape.  The tweets were unearthed after Mr McKenzie plunged into a row with the left slate in Lewisham East, which is having an upcoming by-election. Constituency party chairman Mr McKenzie had warned Labour chiefs were trying to take away party democracy by imposing a shortlist on members. In the end, however, two centrist candidates stood and one of them, Janet Daby, triumphed over her Momentum-backed rival. After the vote Mr McKenzie took to Twitter to slam the left slate for trying to rig the selection.

The Environment Secretary made the comments - later branded tasteless and racist on Twitter - as he launched ‘Onward’ at a boozy reception in Parliament with Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson. He joked on Monday night: “Looking around this evening, an evening when we have five speeches, white wine, a warm room, we’re inevitably reminded of weddings. “And indeed as I came in and the canap\u0026eacutes were being handed out someone said it is a bit like a wedding reception. “I did think for a moment, yes it was. “Because you have this amazing woman from an exotic background, who turns heads, and who is transforming a staid and traditional institution by sheer force of charisma on the one hand.  “And then you’ve got a lad who’s occasionally walked on the wild side, done some naughty stuff, but at last has a chance for redemption.” He went on to compare himself to two famously terrible celebrity husbands, both of whom have been accused of being physically or psychologically abusive in their relationships. He said: “In talking of course about weddings, about partnerships, it’s a pleasure of course to be here, particularly for me, with Ruth. “And spending some time on the same platform with Ruth, I feel rather like Ike to Tina Turner - or Sonny to Cher. He paused, then after laughter and sharp intakes of breath, he added: “I know where the real talent lies.” Ike Turner was married to singer Tina from 1962 to 1978.  They divorced after a violent argument, after which the Private Dancer singer publicly accused him of violent spousal abuse throughout their relationship.  In a 1985 interview, Ike admitted: “Yeah I hit her, but I didn\u0027t hit her more than the average guy beats his wife.” Cher and Sonny Bono were one of the most iconic couples of the 1970s, shooting to superstardom with their duet ‘I Got You Babe.’ But behind closed doors, Cher has since described him as a “terrible husband”, and listed the reason for their 1974 divorce as “Involuntary Servitude.” In 1999, she explained: “He was like the father. You know how you can be frightened of your father even if he doesn’t ever do anything? It wasn’t like, I mean, he never hit me, never really yelled at me. He could be tough, though.  “He could just be real tough in that kind of horrible, tough Sicilian way. I couldn’t stand on my own two feet and talk back to him. That was my problem. I could just never ever talk back to him, and so I never got any of my needs met that weren’t what he felt they should be.” Ms Davidson had earlier joked that the best way to present the modern face of the Conservative Party was to invite the “pregnant lesbian” to speak.

The twins, who both had the same genetic condition, went for Personal Independence Payment (PIP) assessments at different times and one was approved, while the other was rejected. Last month the Work and Pensions select committee found that for at least 290,000 claimants of PIP and Employment and Support Allowance (ESA), 6% of all those assessed, the right decision on entitlement was not made first time around. Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs at Work and Pensions questions raised individual cases where people were having issues with PIP and ESA, including one suffering with epilepsy and another with an inoperable brain tumour.  Labour MP Emma Reynolds, speaking in the Commons, said: I\u0027ve been helping identical twins who have the same genetic condition involving learning disabilities and associated health problems, both were assessed for PIP at different times by different assessors, one was granted PIP and one was rejected. This case has now been resolved but can\u0027t the minister see that the system is totally unfit for purpose and needs overhauling?  Work and Pensions Minister Sarah Newton drew scoffs from the Labour benches when she told MPs the fact the case was resolved showed the system was working. She said: The very fact that the case has been resolved shows that the system is working. It\u0027s very important to me that we make the right decision the first time and I\u0027ve set in place a whole series of improvements to PIP, we have followed the advice given to us by the independent review of PIP and are working at pace to make the necessary changes.  A number of MPs raised the high level of successful appeals by those looking to claim PIP and ESA, with around two thirds of all appeals overturned in favour of the claimant. Ms Newton said she was absolutely determined to ensure the right decision is made every time, and said: There have been 3.1 million PIP decisions made and 9% of those have been appealed and 4% of those have been overturned. But MPs kept on raising individual cases to the minister. Lib Dem Layla Moran said a constituent with a rare inherited disorder had received the old Disability Living Allowance (DLA), but since turning 16 was scored zero in every category on her PIP assessment. Would the minister consent to meet with me and my constituent so we can iron out this clear case of computer says no, the Oxford West and Abingdon MP added.  Labour whip Jeff Smith said he had two cases where constituents with serious and deteriorating cerebral palsy both scored zero points on their PIP assessments. In both cases, the constituents require round the clock care, and yet both are forced to appeal the PIP decisions, he said. Does the minister think it\u0027s acceptable that people with serious and deteriorating disabilities are being forced to go through the courts to get the support they deserve? His Labour colleague Clive Efford (Eltham) added: My constituent was called back early for a Personal Independence Payment assessment. The assessment made no reference to the fact he has an inoperable brain tumour, which has led to him having intractable epilepsy and Parkinson\u0027s disease. Can the minister explain why he was recalled for an assessment?  Labour former minister Angela Eagle said her constituent of working age had suffered two strokes and has now been diagnosed as suffering from vascular dementia.

The capital\u0027s fire brigade have said residents in more than 100 tower blocks should no longer stay put in the case of fire. A spokeswoman for the London fire brigade confirmed the owners of 101 residential blocks over 18 metres tall had been told to change their advice to residents. In the event of a fire, the advice has changed from “stay put” to “simultaneous evacuation” after work to inspect the safety of their cladding systems. It is a huge change with the standard advice that residents should “stay put” if a fire breaks out which was repeated after the Grenfell Tower Tragedy last year.  Asking an urgent question on Grenfell Tower, Labour\u0027s John Healey said that there was confusion about advice given by different fire services. He told MPs: Many people will have learned only yesterday that the London fire service has fundamentally changed its safety advice to residents in blocks still wrapped with the same Grenfell-style cladding. In place of “stay put” if a fire breaks out—strong advice given for decades to all residents in all tower blocks across the country, including those in Grenfell Tower—the London fire brigade now says “get out” directly. And he asked ministers to clarify the position to reassure all those living in high-rise blocks.  Do all fire brigades now give the same advice? Do all residents in all blocks with unsafe cladding know that? I say to the Minister that more action, more clarity and more urgency are required from the Government. When will the Secretary of State publish a clear national statement on evacuation policy?\u0027 he asked. Other MPs joined his call for clarity.  Brentford and Isleworth MP Ruth Cadbury said: What are the Government doing to ensure that residents of these high-risk buildings are made aware of the new arrangements about leaving in the case of a fire? And she said that residents in her constituency had not got the message.  Eight months since the change of policy there, she said. Residents of the privately owned Blenheim block in Hounslow have still not been given evacuation instructions or had a fire drill, and the only people who left the building when several fire engines turned up at one of several recent fires were the paid fire marshals. While Labour MP Karen Buck said: The “stay put” policy has been a recognised element of fire safety for a long time, and those of us who have thousands of residents in high-rise towers in our constituencies now want clarity from the Government.  She asked whether residents were supposed to know what type of cladding was on the outside of their block. My understanding is that the London fire brigade has changed its policy for blocks with particular types of cladding, but are residents expected to know what kind of environment they are living in before deciding whether to stay put or to leave? she said.

Critics of Brexit have seized on the admission by the PM as further proof of the downsides of quitting the bloc. The Prime Minister said maintaining a deep science partnership with the EU after the UK leaves in 2019 was in the interest of both Britain and the trading bloc. Euratom, formally the European Atomic Energy Community, is responsible for regulating the nuclear industry across the continent, disposing of waste, safeguarding the transport of nuclear materials, the mobility of workers in the sector, as well as nuclear research and development. The organisation has been responsible for nuclear safety and security in Europe since 1957. But Brexit legislation to leave the EU also means withdrawal from Euratom, a separate legal entity governed by EU institutions, because under the European Union Act 2008 the term EU includes Euratom.  Ben Bradshaw a Labour MP and supporter of the People’s Vote campaign for a referendum on the Brexit deal, said: “Belatedly, the Government seems to be waking up to the fact that breaking our links with European science and innovation programmes would be extremely damaging. “Any attempts to limit the damage are of course welcome, but the prime minister remains committed to delivering a hard and destructive Brexit which will sever many of our ties with Europe.” In a speech at the Jodrell Bank Observatory in Cheshire, she said she was willing to discuss a deal with the EU as soon as possible over access to the agency, which Britain has been a member of since 1973. She also signalled that current immigration rules for foreign students at British universities would remain in place post Brexit, saying the UK will always be open to the brightest and the best researchers to come and make their valued contribution.  Mrs May said: The United Kingdom would like the option to fully associate ourselves with the excellence-based European science and innovation programme, including the successor to Horizon 2020 and Euratom R\u0026ampT. It is in the mutual interest of the UK and the EU that we should do so. Of course such as association would involve an appropriate UK financial contribution, which we would willingly make. In return we would look to maintain a suitable level of influence in line with that contribution and the benefits we bring. The UK is ready to discuss these details with the (European) Commission as soon as possible.   Withdrawal from Euratom was announced in notes accompanying the bill to trigger Article 50 in January 2017.  At the time, broadcaster and physicist Brian Cox condemned a decision as parochial idiocy. The desire to align the UK with Euratom was welcomed by businesses and trade unions. Sue Ferns, senior deputy general secretary of the Prospect trade union, welcomed the announcement but said questions remained. She said: Firstly, how do they intend to turn the Prime Minister\u0027s warm words on the contribution of EU scientists to the UK into concrete reassurances for the short term and eventually into a migration system that continues to allow the free exchange of people and knowledge across the continent? And on Euratom, if the Government can accept that an association for R\u0026ampD is advantageous to the UK, why do they continue to insist that such an association is legally impossible in other areas, for example nuclear safeguards?  Stephen Phipson, chief executive of manufacturers organisation EEF, added: This clear commitment from the Prime Minister should provide reassurance to current programme participants negotiating their involvement in the next framework programme.

Charlotte Randall, 19, revealed she had stretchmarks all over her body after her weight ballooned to 15st 10lbs.  She stopped eating in public out of worry she would be branded greedy and began to starve herself. Charlotte was left humiliated at Thorpe Park when a rollercoaster seatbelt would not fit over her size 18 frame. The teenager always dreamt of studying performing arts at university but feared that at nearly 16st she’d spend her life confined to ‘big girl’ roles. Eventually Charlotte confided in her mum about her crippling body confidence issues ahead of an upcoming beach holiday.   Her mum persuaded her to join Slimming World with her and she swapped her diet of chocolate and takeaways for salad and stir fry.  Now, a year and a half after joining, Charlotte has been named Slimming World’s young slimmer of the year 2018. Charlotte’s mum and brother are also Slimming World members and the trio have lost a total of 13 stone between them. Now she finally feels confident enough to pursue her life-long ambition of singing and dancing on stage. Charlotte, from Worthing in West Sussex, says: “My weight held me back a lot in my college studies. I was always the shy one hiding at the back in baggy clothes, and I’d never put myself forward for roles.  Now I attend extra dance lessons outside of college and even had the confidence to take part in a dance competition recently.” The 5ft 10in part-time student, who also works in retail, says she was always the biggest and tallest in her class throughout primary and secondary school. However, it was in her teenage years that she really began to worry about her weight after she gained 4st 7lbs in 12 months when she met her partner of two years, Scott Miller. She says: “I gained the weight so quickly that I had stretchmarks all over my body. I was so embarrassed and ashamed. Hating my body absolutely consumed me and I’d spend hours looking up ways to lose weight online. I didn’t like eating in public because I thought people would think I was greedy, so would often starve myself all day and only eat when I got home and was alone or with just my boyfriend.”  Charlotte suffered numerous embarrassing incidents because of her weight including her trousers ripping in public and being given a seatbelt extension on a rollercoaster at Thorpe Park because the belt couldn’t close. Secretly Charlotte, who is a vegetarian, tried fasting, shakes and other quick fixes to slim down. However, everything she tried left her feeling so hungry that she’d soon give up, and she usually ended up gaining more weight than she lost. After booking a holiday abroad though, Charlotte was so worried about feeling uncomfortable on the beach that she confided in her mum Petula Bladen, who was a member of Slimming World, about the way she was feeling and agreed to join her at their local group. Charlotte says: “It was really hard for me in the beginning because I was only 17 and the youngest in the group. I was embarrassed because I felt that I shouldn’t have let myself get to this point at such a young age.  I shouldn’t have worried though because everyone was so friendly. Now I absolutely love going to Slimming World every week and I really enjoy hearing how everyone else has got on. My consultant Robyn has been amazing too – I like that she doesn’t just talk to us about food, she really cares about why losing weight is so important to us. It’s not just about how we look but how we feel too.” While Charlotte has lost 4st 10lbs, dropping from 15st 10lbs to 11st and a size 18/20 to a 10/12, she says it’s the change on the inside that’s most dramatic. Not only is she more confident in her singing, dancing and acting, she also feels more comfortable talking to people, doesn’t hate looking in the mirror anymore, enjoys going out with Scott more and loves shopping. Charlotte has also conquered her fear of activity: “I used to hate anything sporty because it would make me red and sweaty and I was too ashamed of my size to go to a gym – I thought everyone would stare or laugh at me, but now I’ve joined a gym and I love it. It makes me feel strong.”  Her weight loss has inspired others too, with Charlotte’s brother James, 20, joining his mum and sister at Slimming World – and between them they’ve lost a total of nearly 13 stone. Charlotte says: “Wednesday night is our family night now. We go to Slimming World and then we have a healthy meal together. I love it. “People are always amazed at how much I eat now and I’ve definitely learned that following a healthy and balanced plan is a much better way to lose weight than starving myself. I used to work in a fast-food restaurant so I’d often snack on junk food, which made me feel sluggish and bloated. Now I snack on fruit and love cooking homemade curries and stir-fries. I have so much more energy, and I’m achieving my goals without feeling hungry or guilty about what I’m eating.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dundee named one lonely planets","story":"NewsDundee named one of Lonely Planet\u0027s best places to visit in Europe for 2018 - so where else makes the list?Lonely Planet\u0027s writers praised a creative scene that \"increasingly attracts some of the UK\u0027s most visionary talent\"\u0026nbspShareByNatalie EvansLucinda Cameron04:26, 22 MAY 2018NewsDundee has been named in the top 10 places to visit in Europe (Image: Photographer\u0027s Choice)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDundee has been named one of the best places in Europe to visit this year by travel guide Lonely Planet.

Samantha, 53, who has the same father as the new Duchess of Sussex, has appealed to Meghan to reunite the family after years of estrangement. She told The Sun : “I watched the bishop talk about love and unity and forgiveness and I hoped it would strike a chord within Meghan. “So if that was real and if I were to define a principle to all of this then it would be that we all just work for a peaceful resolution and reunion as a family. “I feel a religious and moral obligation to be open to her and not be vindictive or isolating or hurt.”  She said dad Thomas Snr, 73, is being treated in Los Angeles after heart surgery, and described him as “happy and proud” after seeing the wedding on TV. Samantha said the speech by Bishop Michael Curry had prompted her desire for reconciliation. Nevertheless, she had earlier accused Meghan\u0027s mum of \u0027cashing in\u0027 on the wedding by leaking photos.

About two dozen journalists from Western and Chinese news organisations arrived in North Korea today to see the dismantling of the Punggye-ri site. Technical experts, however, have not joined them even though the United States has called for a permanent and irreversible closure that can be inspected and fully accounted for. Isolated North Korea\u0027s offer to scrap the test site was seen as a key concession in months of easing tension between Pyongyang and its long-time bitter rivals, South Korea and the US.  Tunnels at the site are to be destroyed and the area around it shut down. But there have been concerns about the high profile move. Jenny Town, managing editor of the 38 North website that provides analysis on North Korea, told the : Simply put, they can stop testing because they have finished development and don’t need to test any more. Ultimately, it’s still just a first step down a long and difficult road if true denuclearisation of the peninsula is to be achieved.”  The improving diplomatic environment has hit a rocky patch, with North Korea threatening last week to pull out of a planned June 12 summit in Singapore between leader Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump. South Korean president Moon Jae-in was scheduled to meet Trump in Washington later today, as US officials try to figure out whether North Korea, which has pursued nuclear and missile programmes in defiance of UN sanctions, is serious about negotiating a deal on denuclearisation. Journalists from the Associated Press, CNN, CBS, Russia Today and Chinese state media outlets were among those seen checking in at Beijing Capital International Airport to catch the Air Koryo flight to North Korea.  Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said the group had arrived at the airport in the east coast city of Wonsan. Numerous other news organisations, including Reuters, had also sought to cover the shutdown of the North\u0027s nuclear test site but were denied invitations. South Korea expressed regret that its journalists had not been included after earlier being invited.  Nonetheless, the government pays due attention to the fact that the North\u0027s pledge to dismantle the Punggyeri nuclear test site, an initial measure for denuclearisation, is proceeding as planned, and expects that such action to lead to the successful hosting of the North Korea-U.S. summit, South Korea\u0027s Unification Ministry said in a statement. Last month, Moon and Kim held a historic summit at the Demilitarised Zone separating the two countries. North and South Korea are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.

Little Florence Van Cutsem, three, was seen without her flowers in the official royal wedding pictures, released yesteday.   Bride Meghan is centre stage in one of the three photos, surrounded by her bridesmaids and page boys and with new husband Harry sat behind her.  But Harry\u0027s goddaughter Florence is the only of the girls who isn\u0027t holding flowers, despite having some during the St George\u0027s Chapel ceremony - and the reason why could be rather sweet. What seems a mislaid bunch was not quite as it first appeared.  The mystery of the flowers can be answered by rewinding to the wedding just a few hours before the picture was taken. It was Florence\u0027s fellow bridesmaid Ivy Mulroney who appeared to have forgotten her bouquet as she walked behind the bride down the aisle. However, the four-year-old\u0027s empty hands served a very special purpose.   She entered the chapel hand-in-hand with sisters Remi and Rylan Litt, aged six and seven, as the group approached the alter. The flowergirl then drops their hands, freeing her up for an important role - to hold Meghan\u0027s bridal flowers for her.  The bride, wearing a Givenchy dress, is seen bending down and handing her bouquet to the little girl, who then follows the rest of the party to their seats. Later in the day, it would seem Ivy did get her own flowers - though it looks as though they may have been taken from Florence. Official photos from Kensington Palace show the young American sharing Florence\u0027s bunch, and later the latter had none, as she sat empty-handed. In a royal tradition spanning nearly 100 years, Meghan\u0027s bouquet was placed on the tomb of the unknown soldier in Westminster Abbey.

Lucy\u0027s Law is demanding a ban on the sale of puppies by pet shops and other third party commercial dealers, a trade fed by cruel puppy farms in the UK and abroad.  George Eustice, minister at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, gave a huge hint that Lucy\u0027s Law could become a reality, saying: “The Government considers there is merit in exploring this further”. He added that a final decision would be made after it has looked at the responses to the public consultation that closed on May 2. In a dramatic day for the campaign, Lucy\u0027s Law supporters including the Mirror handed the petition which has incredibly topped 143,000 signatures to Ten Downing Street. Campaign founder and award-winning vet Marc Abraham, standing outside Number Ten, said: “It\u0027s amazing how far we\u0027ve come with no resources, just compassion and empathy and making dogs the priority “I\u0027m incredibly proud of my team and everyone for signing and sharing the petition, change is long overdue and you are all making it happen.” The campaign is named after Lucy, a Cavalier King Charlies Spaniel saved from a rescue centre. Lucy was taken in by Lisa Garner and died in 2016.  “It\u0027s very emotional today because it\u0027s a day to remember Lucy and all she went through and but we\u0027re so close to change, it\u0027s that final push,” said Lisa, who now cares for another rescue dog, Plum Pudding. “Dogs lives are literally hanging in the balance, all the other Lucy\u0027s out there still need to be saved. “I never thought it would come as far as it has and it\u0027s all stemmed form one little dog called Lucy who I saw on a rescue centre website looking so tiny and vulnerable.” Also handing over the petition was Beverley Cuddy, editor of Dogs Today magazine. “I\u0027ve been writing about the third party sales of puppies for 28 years and this is the best shot we\u0027ve ever had of ending it,” she said. “This is our big chance today to put right something that\u0027s been wrong for decades.”  Another stalwart campaigner in Downing Street was Linda Goodman of CARIAD – Welsh for “beloved” and standing for Care and Respect Includes All Dogs. “I\u0027m incredibly hopeful,” she said. “Sometimes it\u0027s been like banging your head against a brick wall but now it feels like there\u0027s a door in the wall.” The astonishing success of the petition triggered a debate in Parliament, led by Scottish Nationalist Martyn Day, who told how an estimated 80,000 puppies are sold through third party dealers each year in the UK. “The sale of puppies through commercial third party dealers both sustains and is dependent upon the existence of puppy farms, where puppies are bred for maximum profit and minimal regard for animal welfare,” he said. He called the Lucy\u0027s Law e-petition “probably the most popular dog welfare petition the Government has seen in all time, I would extend my congratulations to all involved.”  Caroline Lucas for the Greens added: “One of the reasons this policy is so popular is that not only does it make good sense from an animal protection point of view, it\u0027s much easier to enforce that the current situation.” Lucy\u0027s Law has cross-party support, with Labour\u0027s Ann Clwyd telling MPs: “While we carry on talking, debating and procrastinating, dogs are suffering every minute of the day. “How much longer must they wait for us to end this barbaric third party puppy dealing? “I support Lucy\u0027s Law and if you really care, you will too.” Conservative Andrea Jenkyns said: “The public remain na\u0026iumlve to the horrors of the puppy farming trade, this is why legislation is necessary, not just to protect the puppies but their mothers too, and also the public from facilitating this abhorrent trade.”  Lisa Cameron, SNP, told how Lucy was exploited to within an inch of her life as “a breeding slave” before being rescued and becoming the mascot for all commercial breeding dogs. “The voices against Lucy\u0027s Law have now gone and paled into insignificance, we are speaking with one voice today, there is universal support for Lucy\u0027s Law. “For those organisations who say \u0027we\u0027d like a ban but not now,\u0027 I say, why not now? “If we wait a minute longer, more dogs like Lucy suffer absolutely appalling consequences.

Eight-year-old Saffie was one of 22 people killed in the suicide bombing at Ariana Grande’s concert a year ago today, while some 800 were injured. The victims of crazed terrorist Salman Abedi will be honoured in events across the nation, including a service at Manchester Cathedral and a mass singalong featuring more than 80 choirs. And Saffie’s dad Andrew, 44, said: “There are a lot of good people out there and we have been \u0026shyoverwhelmed by the love and support shown. “When an atrocity like this happens and people say, ‘This is wrong and we will support you’ it is a lovely feeling and it does help you in your darkest hours. We could not have done without the public and the support we have had. The support has been heartfelt and genuine and has come from across the world. It is lovely to know people were touched by Saffie and to feel their love for her.”  Saffie had gone to the concert with mum Lisa, 49, and sister Ashlee Bromwich, 25, who both suffered serious injuries in the blast. Lisa was told of her daughter’s death after waking from a coma. In the weeks that followed, the family’s chippy in Leyland, Lancs, became a sea of tributes to Saffie. But they have since moved, to a location they prefer not to reveal, as the memories were too painful. Speaking for the first time about their decision to relocate, Andrew said: “Our life, our home and our business were in Leyland and Saffie was such a huge character and a massive part of it. “To go back to that without her and to have those memories would have been too hard. Saffie spent a lot of time with customers and was known and loved in the area. Even walking around Tesco would have been difficult as we would have been expecting to see Saffie at every corner.  “We don’t ever want to forget Saffie but being in Leyland the memories would have been too painful. “We just wanted a fresh start – not to start again. There is no starting over after something like this. But to move away somewhere new and do our best to support each other.” Andrew said they had “seen the worst of human nature with what happened” but added: “Nothing will ever bring Saffie back but knowing the public is behind you restores your faith in human nature.” Paying tribute to his daughter, he said: “Saffie was the sort of person who just stopped people in their tracks. She was a \u0026shybeautiful young lady and not a day went by when we weren’t stopped by people complimenting her. “Saffie had a wicked sense of humour and this magic of capturing people.  “Saffie ruled our household – and she still does. We talk about Saffie all the time. We want to keep Saffie’s spirit alive so she is with us all the time.” Andrew is also full of pride for how son Xander, 12, has coped with their ordeal. He said: “Xander has had to move to a new area, left behind his friends and started a new school – all on top of losing his baby sister. “What happened is going to affect him for the rest of his life but he is keeping his chin up the best he can. Xander is a remarkable young man and we are very proud of him. We draw strength from each other.” The family this week finished a JustGiving appeal that raised \u0026pound11,000 to have a new kind of rose created in Saffie’s honour, with help from the Royal Horticultural Society. Lisa said the tribute, to be sold around the world to raise charity cash, would help her girl “live on for ever”. Many of Islamic State supporter Abedi’s victims were young people and 10 of those killed were under 20.  Prince William and the Prime Minister will attend the service at Manchester Cathedral tomorrow to remember them all, during which there will be a national minute’s silence at 2.30pm across Government buildings. The invitation-only event has been arranged for the families of those who lost their lives, first responders and civic leaders. But the public will be able to watch on a big screen in nearby Cathedral Gardens. The service will also be screened at York Minster, Liverpool politan Cathedral and Glasgow Cathedral. Tomorrow evening, The Manchester Survivors Choir, made up mostly of parents and children, will sing at the Manchester Together One Voice event in the city centre. Thousands of people are expected to join the mass singalong, for which more than 80 choirs will unite. They will be led by Dan McDwyer, the choirmaster who directed Parrs Wood High School in Didsbury in their moving tribute at the One Love Manchester concert. And church bells will ring out across the city at 10.31pm – the exact time the shrapnel-packed bomb was detonated at the arena. Anguished Paul: I\u0027d always stay yo help A year on from the Manchester bombing brave Paul Reid still bears the mental scars. The 44-year-old father was just yards from the foyer when the bomb went off. He gave life-saving first aid and used his own clothes to keep the victims warm. He calmed the youngest victim – eight-year-old Saffie Roussos – before helping her onto a makeshift stretcher.

Meghan, 36, got married to Prince Harry in a star-studded ceremony in Windsor Castle watched by millions across the world.  The new Duchess of Sussex is already very different from other royal brides, being an American actress, mixed race and a divorcee. The Queen became the heir to the throne after her uncle, Edward VIII, decided to abdicate because he was in love with American Wallis Simpson, a divorcee, and was not allowed to marry her.  In an interview with Good Morning Britain Burrell , who served as Princess Diana\u0027s butler, said it was Meghan\u0027s colourful past which could cause problems for some of the royals steeped in tradition.  He said: “She is all of the things that the royal family is frightened off. “She’s mixed race, she’s American, she’s a divorcee and that is everything that we have to embrace to move forward.” Burrell also said that Diana would have loved Meghan, before adding: “There will be ripples in the royal pond, yes there will, and things will happen but I think she’s steady, she’s solid, she’s a good person to enter the royal family. “She’s served her apprenticeship in Hollywood on that stage, now she’s entered the world stage and joined the cast of the biggest soap opera on the world.”   Burrell, who has been accused of cashing in on his connection to Prince Harry\u0027s late mother, was at the royal wedding as an adviser to US media.  Dressed in a grey wedding suit, Burrell was seen inside St George’s Chapel, where the ceremony took place. However, due to his stormy relationship with the royal family many questioned why he was there. Burrell has infuriated Buckingham Palace after betraying the family\u0027s trust with a series of headline grabbing stunts - and even starred in I\u0027m A Celebrity: Get Me Out Of Here. In 2001, police arrested Burrell and raided his home in Cheshire over claims he had taken items belonging to Diana, Prince William and Prince Charles.

Dr Vaishnavy Laxman, 43, who had been nearing the end of a 24-hour shift on a maternity unit, should have given the 30-year old patient an emergency Caesarean section as the premature infant was in a breech position. But she instead attempted to carry out the delivery naturally and tragedy struck when the doctor urged the patient to push whilst herself applying traction to the baby\u0027s legs. The manoevre caused the infant\u0027s legs, arms and torso to become detached leaving the head still in his mother\u0027s womb. Two other doctors subsequently carried out a C-section on the woman to remove the infant\u0027s head. It was \u0027\u0027re-attached\u0027\u0027 to his body so his mother could hold him before she said goodbye. It is claimed the mother was not even in established labour at the time.  At the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester, consultant Laxman wept as she relived the bungled procedure and said the youngster would have died had a c-section been carried out. She said: \u0027\u0027I was trying to deliver a live baby, I was trying really hard, possibly too hard. I did not intend to harm mum or the baby. I am distraught at the outcome and I am very sorry it did not come out the way I meant it.” The tragedy occurred on March 16 2014 whilst Laxman was working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee with a team of other doctors. The woman\u0027s waters had broken early at 25 weeks and upon examination her unborn baby was found to have a prolapsed cord, was in a breech position whilst the mother\u0027s cervix was around 4cm dilated. It can be 10cm fully dilated. Laxman had started work at 8.30am the previous day and went home at 6pm for five hours before returning to the hospital at 11pm. She was told about the patient at 2am and was subsequently paged at 8.30am to take a look at her when her condition became more critical. She told the tribunal: “The plan was for the baby to be delivered by a Caesarian section and I went down to the labour suite to discuss the situation. I spoke to the patient saying I was sorry for the rush and and I remember saying the baby was quite small and I was going to examine her.  “When I examined the patient I found that the uterus was quite small and I found the cervix was about 4cm dilated. I asked the patient to push to see if I could deliver the baby vaginally and I remember going through various options available with the patient. \u0027\u0027I remember thinking should I try to deliver this baby. I still believe we had a very good chance of having the baby using other options than a C-section but we had to act fast. \u0027\u0027I thought with a C-section we might not have a live baby and it would have been a difficult procedure. This was her first pregnancy and she had a ruptured membrane. I thought it was possible to deliver the baby vaginally and I asked mum to push. \u0027\u0027The bottom of the baby came out quite easily and when this happened I thought it was going to be possible. I started to encourage the patient to push. Whilst she was pushing I applied some traction to the baby’s feet so I could deliver the baby. She was doing well. “After two to three pushes the baby’s bottom had been delivered all the way up to its chest. After that there was some difficulty in delivering the arms. The arms were behind the baby’s neck. I tried a manoeuvre to release the arms. I lifted the baby’s head and rotated the body 90 degrees to tether the arm and then rotated 180 degrees to tether the other arm.  \u0027\u0027The arms were then delivered and I went to deliver the baby’s head, I was trying to flex the baby’s head but I didn’t feel the baby move and the cervix started to close. I tried to deliver a couple of times and asked for help. I said it was head entrapment by the cervix.\u0027\u0027 Laxman said she to tried to cut the cervix but the incision had no impact. She added: \u0027\u0027The patient was quite distressed by this point and she was verbally in pain. I remember her saying “you need to stop, you can’t carry on” and she was given general anaesthetic. “We made another cut to the cervix and I used my index finger to flex the baby’s head to deliver the baby was using traction to deliver the baby. But at some point between the general anaesthetic and the decapitation, the baby died - I’m not sure when. \u0027\u0027I was told the neck was tearing and that’s when I knew the baby had died.\u0027\u0027 Under cross examination she said: I did have experience with this. But I have never had everything with one patient before, it was a lot of complications. “I just wanted this baby out the quickest way possible.

John Purcell, 72, and his daughter, Catherine Purcell junior, 35, denied and were cleared of the manslaughter of their wife and mother, Catherine Purcell senior. But the father and daughter were on Monday found guilty of neglecting the disabled great-grandmother, who died while being eaten alive by maggots, t he Liverpool Echo report s. Paramedics found the victim’s body at the house she shared with her daughter in Shacklady Road, Kirkby, on Sunday, July 24, 2016.  Prosecutors said the 68-year-old died in a “cesspit of her own faeces and bodily fluid”, which chemically destroyed her mattress and bed. David McLachlan, QC, prosecuting, said the reaction burnt the skeletal victim’s skin and her infected body was then fed on by maggots. He argued during that the pair knew she was dying, but failed to seek medical aid, which three weeks beforehand would have saved her life. A post-mortem examination found Mrs Purcell died from pneumonia, dehydration and skin ulcers, including a hip ulcer penetrating to the bone. The victim, who weighed just five-and-a-half-stone, also had undiagnosed cancer of the tongue, which would have made swallowing painful.  Mr Purcell claimed he didn’t realise his wife was “severely malnourished”, or her stained legs covered in sores, despite changing her clothes. He accepted her bedroom was “disgraceful”, but said he didn’t know it was that filthy until she died, because the bed was covered by a duvet. Lawyers acting for Catherine jnr – who chose not to give evidence – said she was devoted to her mum, but let her “demanding” dad take over. Catherine jnr\u0027s sister Kellie, who lived nearby but had not visited her mother in six months, was not charged. Repeated messages between the two sisters about needing to wash their mother and clean her bed were shown to the court.  Jurors on Monday found Catherine jnr and her father John not guilty of manslaughter, but guilty of wilful neglect, after a 15-day trial and nearly 20 hours of deliberation. Mr Purcell showed no emotion, while Catherine jnr burst into tears, following the 10-1 majority verdicts, after one juror was discharged. High Court judge Mr Justice Holgate, sitting at Liverpool Crown Court, said the pair would be sentenced on June 18 and remanded them on bail. Mrs Purcell suffered from Korsakoff’s Syndrome, an alcoholism-related vitamin deficiency disease, resulting in chronic memory problems.  Catherine jnr, whose son, then aged 11, also lived at the house, was her mum’s carer and received \u0026pound62 per week in carer\u0027s allowance. Prosecutors said the victim was estranged from her husband, of Quarry Green, Kirkby, but he still visited daily and often slept over. The couple had two other children, John junior and Kellie, the latter who lived nearby with her partner Darren Moore and three children. During the harrowing trial into the death of Mrs Purcell, Mr McLachlan read out messages retrieved from the defendants’ mobile phones. Kellie, who the court heard had not visited the house for six months, was not charged with any offences.

The former Labour Health Secretary was still finding his feet outside the Westminster bubble when Manchester’s worst peace-time atrocity claimed 22, mostly young, lives, and left an entire region shell-shocked. As the world’s media focused on Manchester’s grief and its people sought direction, the mayor went through the full range of emotions. Every hour, he said, seemed like a day. Initially, he felt an overwhelming sense of sadness, and not a little fear. Then, after a vigil he had organised saw Mancunian defiance come to the fore, pride and humility replaced the fear. As names and faces were put to corpses, and small coffins were carried at funerals, St Ann’s Square became a shrine and Don’t Look Back In Anger was adopted as the city’s anthem, Burnham struggled to articulate what it all meant.  Until, a few months later, at a homelessness event in Piccadilly Gardens, these lyrics, sung by an unknown band called Prose, knocked him sideways:  Manchester has lost its sound, the kids, the kids that can’t be found,   and there’ll never be a day that goes on where I say,   I won’t be carrying this weight in my heart,   remembering the place where I was when things changed,   and the world started falling apart.   Manchester has fell to its knees in the bedlam we forget to breathe   the city that’s never asleep loses its legs for a second and grieves,   and we get to our feet, build up our strength and we help the bereaved   and stand up together we’re stronger than ever,   our hearts and our heads are the weapons we need, we will not accept this is any defeat.  Burnham, 48, says: “It summed up everything I’d felt. Manchester had lost its sound. The day after the bomb, it was deadly quiet and jittery. It felt momentarily winded and unable to respond. But then it did and its response was magnificent.”  May 22, 2017, had been an ordinary Monday evening for Burnham. It was his dad’s birthday, so he dropped round a bottle of wine, then played five-a-side football, went home and switched on Newsnight. Then his phone rang. It was great friend and Liverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram asking what was happening at the Arena, where his daughters had gone to see Ariana Grande. The next call told Burnham it was a terror alert. He says: “I felt sick to the pit of my stomach. I decided not to go to the Arena while everything was unfolding, but to stay at home and gather my thoughts.” The next morning, he stood at the town hall telling the world that after the darkest of nights, Manchester had woken to the most difficult of dawns. He says: “It certainly felt like the darkest night I’d ever had. They were a hard few hours when I kept asking myself, ‘How will this place respond?’”  He and the Manchester City Council leader Richard Leese decided to hold a “vigil of peace” that evening in Albert Square. On social media, the far right accused them of lighting candles as terrorists planned a next attack. That angered Burnham. “We weren’t saying, ‘Light a candle and love each other’, we were saying, ‘Be proud, don’t let anything change you, don’t lose confidence’. “When Tony Walsh read his poem This Is The Place, the mood completely changed. Mancunians had found their voice. That vigil massively helped set the tone.” He was also in St Ann’s Square when the mass rendition of Oasis hit Don’t Look Back in Anger broke out. He says: “Hearing that build was just amazing. It showed that for all our challenges our biggest asset is our people.  “We saw it in the immediate aftermath, when Muslim taxi firms gave free rides. Something phenomenal came out of that terrible night. The sense of solidarity was summed up by the ‘worker bee’ symbol being adopted. It’s an emblem of Manchester and it says that no one is bigger than the whole.” There were 14,200, mostly teenage girls, trying to get out of the Manchester Arena when suicide bomber Salman Ramadan Abedi, 22, detonated an explosive device, killing 22 people and injuring more than 500. At the time Burnham described the attack as “an act of pure evil”. Does he still think that? “Yes. This individual grew up here. To commit that act in a place where he knew there was an \u0026shyaudience of teenage girls was pure, vindictive and unremitting evil.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tragic story behind 350000 electric","story":"NewsTragic story behind the £350,000 electric Jaguar which Prince Harry used to drive Meghan to their plush wedding receptionThe snazzy E-type, from 1968, was owned by a musician in Jamiroquai and was given a personalised registration plate\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByTom DavidsonOnline Reporter08:47, 22 MAY 2018Updated09:37, 22 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThere is a sad history behind the \u0026pound350,000 electric Jaguar which Prince Harry and Meghan Markle drove in to their raucous wedding reception at Frogmore House on Saturday.

His widow, Gabriella Crewe-Read, told the Daily Mail: The royal wedding car was bought from Toby. His brilliance is everywhere. She added that her late husband is \u0027still here\u0027.

The keyboard player was an alumnus of Marlborough College, the \u0026pound36,525-per-year boarding school where the Duchess of Cambridge was educated. The car was prepared for the much-anticipated wedding by giving it a new registration plate - the date on which Harry and Meghan tied the knot.  The car is a zero-emissions, battery-electric-powered version of the 1968 car with LED head lamps. Built between 1961 and 1975, the E-Type was described by Enzo Ferrari as ‘the most beautiful car in the world’. This model is said to be worth \u0026pound350,000.

The mesmerising video shows how deadly molten rock spurts from the Kilauea volcano that has caused a widespread disruption on the Pacific state’s Big Island. The stream of lava has now crept downhill onto the nearby coastline, causing a toxic acid cloud known as laze – a combination of lava and haze. The caustic plume, which formed by the combination of hot lava and sea water, could be fatal if inhaled, according to Hawaii\u0027s Civil Defence agency.  Two dozen lava cracks have appeared in the volcano and experts say the natural phenomenon is now entering a more dangerous stage. We\u0027ve seen Phase 1. We\u0027ve seen the clearing out of the system. We call that the \u0027throat-clearing\u0027 phase, Carolyn Pearcheta, operational geologist at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.  Lava has destroyed at least 44 homes and has forced thousands of residents to flee the disaster area since May 8. On Saturday, one man was seriously injured when a lava bomb projectile was fired from the volcano and struck him on the leg.  Janet Snyder, a spokesperson for the Office of the Mayor, County of Hawaii, said: A homeowner on Noni Farms Road who was sitting on a third-floor balcony got hit with lava spatter. It hit him on the shin and shattered everything there down on his leg, she said, adding that lava spatters can weigh as much as a refrigerator.” The ‘laze threat’ is a mix of hydrochloric acid fumes, steam and fine volcanic glass specks created when erupting lava - which can reach 1,093 degrees Celsius - reacts with sea water.

Gillian Andes, 23, from Phenix City Alabama, USA, proudly reveals the four-inch-scar that helped to bring five-month-old Piper, who is balanced on her knee, and three-year-old Lola into the world.  After being criticised for delivering her children through caesarean she decided to post empowering images online to show others they ‘no less of a woman’.  She was forced to give birth through C-section for a second time, after her incision started rupture during her 28-hour labour with Piper that could have killed them both. Since then, the stay-at-home parent has been determined to champion the cause and reduce the shame some mums feel for not giving birth vaginally.  “I feel like women who have had a C-section can feel like they are ‘less of a woman’ and like they took an ‘easy way out’, she said. “I was told that by multiple people online with my first baby, at first I was afraid to tell them because I knew about the stigma. “It’s seen that you’re less of a mum because you delivered through C-section and that your body failed you. “For my second child I went in with the mindset that it doesn’t matter how my baby comes out, as long as we are both alive that’s the end goal. “I laboured for 28 hours without medicine. There was a risk to vaginal-delivery because I previously had a C-section, I started showing signs of rupturing, which could have ended in death for me and my baby.  “Later, when I posted the picture, I had a feeling some of the comments would happen so was mentally prepared for it, but there wasn’t as much hate as I thought. “My husband took the pictures that show my daughter lying on my legs. Showing your C-section scar is such a taboo that I wanted to expose it. “Piper was four-weeks-old at the time and the scar had not totally healed, so there were still some openings. I wanted it to be raw, vulnerable and to show that C-sections are not easy. “I really don’t mind the scar, I can’t see anything in a bathing suit and even if I could, my body did what it had to, so that I could bring two beautiful humans into this world. “I wear that, my stretchmarks and everything that comes with being a mum with pride. “Your body changes with that, I try to wear it proudly and I have two healthy children from it so I’m happy with that.”  Gillian posted the first image in December last year, posing with her daughter strewn over her leg and revealing her scar – in images taken by her 25-year-old husband Shawn. Since then she has posted several more photographs that have received a mixture of responses, but she maintains the majority are positive and supportive of her message. She has started a blog to further point out her views about motherhood, birth and more. Gillian said: “I received a lot of support from people, there were some pretty hateful comments but 80% was positive. “Some people asked why I took a picture like that as when my daughter grows up she will think it’s nasty and other things like that. “Before posting I believed everybody would have a negative opinion but who can argue about loving yourself and anyone who does isn’t looking any deeper than the picture.

targets are at an advanced stage and deals could be struck over the weekend.Dunfermline pair Fraser Aird and Nicky Clark could be on the verge of joining up.While United have declined to confirm their interest in Clark, the 26-year-old’s proven scoring record at Championship level is something of which they are aware.And despite interest in him from the Premiership – St Mirren have also been linked – a determined effort to get him to Tannadice appears to be ongoing.Ex-Hamilton defender Ziggy Gordon is also on their radar and he could be fixed up soon.With other identified targets, the process could take longer.While the departures of 14 players means replacements are needed, and soon, as much time as is needed to ensure the right quality is obtained for next season will be taken.With the season just over, a number of players and agents are on their summer break and that will delay some business. In other cases, the calibre of those involved means United will battle with other clubs to get them.The fact they are remaining outside of the Premiership for a third season running makes that task harder – but it’s not being seen as an insurmountable one.And the number of players who’ve expressed an interest in hearing what the plans for the new-look squad are has been encouraging.There will be action at Tannadice tonight as Dave Bowman’s annual match to raise cash for skin cancer and dementia charities takes place.It will see a string of other past Tangerines greats turning out in the home ranks.“We’ve got the usual list of suspects and Sean Dillon and Jon Daly will be back in United strips as well,” said Bow.“We’ve even got your columnist in the Tele, big Lee Wilkie, playing.

Sometimes you just have to look after yourself, make sure you give your team the best chance to go and win a game by making saves when you need to.“All I did really in that Partick game was do my job.“I conceded a goal which is very annoying because I just want to keep clean sheets – that’s what goalkeepers are built on.“I wasn’t happy about that but, overall, it was a pleasing performance for myself.”And Ferrie did impress, making timely saves as well as commanding his area with Partick quickly putting the rookie keeper under pressure from the off.An early save that saw him claw an Adam Barton header out of the top corner set him on his way and, although he couldn’t stop Kris Doolan poking in the winner, he was happy with this performance.On that Barton header: “It had me worried when it was looping over me! I was thinking ‘oh, no, it’s looping, it’s looping, please get there!’“I managed to just get there and then, after that, there was a corner and with a young keeper they were going to put it on me. That’s what anyone does with a young keeper, and I got a good punch on it.“I felt that was important because it meant they maybe didn’t put it on me as much. I found in the second half they didn’t. The crosses were a bit further out, which was good.“Teams might look at that because I’m maybe not as big as other goalkeepers.

United, meanwhile, are continuing to hold talks with a long list of signing targets for next term.Dunfermline pair Nicky Clark and Fraser Aird could be fixed up this week.And Celtic youngster Sam Wardrop is also expected to join what will be a new-look squad.The 20-year-old played against United last season during a loan spell at Dumbarton that saw him make 27 appearances.United now know all the teams they will be facing in the Championship next season after Partick Thistle’s relegation was confirmed when they went down to Livingston in the Premiership play-off final.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b029991d13a2-692x564.jpg ","title":"simon murray proud of stints at both dundee and united but focus is now on hibs","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSought-after Simon Murray’s future will not be decided until July at the very earliest.And while the striker, who’s just finished a loan spell at Dundee, is extremely flattered by interest from the other side of Tannadice Street, his first choice is to remain at parent club Hibs.Murray is currently enjoying his summer break but is well aware of speculation linking him with a return to first full-time employers Dundee United.Beaten Scottish Cup finalists Motherwell are also known to be considering a summer move for him and, dating back to his time at United, several clubs in Europe have monitored his progress.As recently as Dundee’s victory over St Johnstone last month, one sent their chief scout to update their file on him.For the 26-year-old, however, the next piece of business he aims to be involved in is a battle to re-establish himself at Easter Road.“I am contracted to Hibs for another year and, although I spent the second half of the season on loan at Dundee, my aim has always been to go back there.“I still finished the season top scorer for them and, even when I went to Dundee in January, the plan was always to go back.“At the time I spoke to Neil Lennon and he stressed whether or not I went was entirely down to me.“I could have stayed and he would have considered me for selection but really the move came up because Anthony Stokes had left and they needed a No 10.“They wanted Scott Allan and the only way the deal was going to be done was if I went to Dundee, so the gaffer did say to me I would be back in the summer.“He’s told me I can stake a claim for a place in the team next season and I know, if he says that, he means it, because he’s very honest with me.”Should things not work out in his second season at Hibs, Murray will look at his situation.“Obviously, if they sign another striker or decide to go another way I’ll have to think about what happens next, so it is good to know other clubs are interested. If it doesn’t work out, the only person I will blame is myself but I feel the move to Dundee has been good for me because it’s got me a lot more Premiership experience.”He admits had the loan interest at the turn of the year been from someone other than Dundee, there’s a fair chance he would have opted to stay put.“A lot’s been said about me being a Dundee fan and that was a factor.“More important was it was a move that wasn’t going to involve me having to get used to a new city or league.“I stayed at my mum’s when I was back up and I already knew some of the boys, so it was easy to settle in. I’m not saying I wouldn’t have gone somewhere else but all that made it an easier choice to come.”And, as a proud Dundonian, Murray admits the fact he’s joined a select band of players to have worn dark blue and tangerine is pleasing.“I will look back at the end of my career and be proud I played for Dundee and United. While I’m a Dundee fan, even before I was at United I was never one who didn’t want them to do well.“I always went to see both teams and I still do. I’m a football fan and I want to see both sides from my city doing well.“Now I’ve got a United connection, they are a club I will always have a lot of time for.“They were the team that gave me my chance in the game full-time and I’m grateful for that.“I still know a lot of people there and they are very good people who I respect a lot.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the

artwork","story":"\u0026nbspAN alternative artwork to replace the controversial tilting pier concept proposed for the banks of the River Ness will be showcased at a public exhibition next week.Designs, to be displayed at Inverness Town House on May 24, have thrilled councillors who have had a peek at an international architect\u0027 new offering.The images are being kept under wraps for now. But the Courier understands the \u0026pound370,000 art installation, still branded by Highland Council as the Gathering Place, will be divided into two sections positioned on either side of the river. The installation is thought to be a mix of stone and wooden construction.There is great excitement among city councillors who have seen two-dimensional design work, and there is apparent consensus that it is aesthetically pleasing and will easily blend into the local, tranquil environment.The \"pier\" project, proposed for a spot by Eden Court, was aborted two years ago due to the scale of public objections to the design.The location for the new proposal is believed to be nearby, slightly further upriver, at the most shallow point on the edge of the Ness Islands.The council\u0027 Inverness city committee delegated powers of approval to the Inverness city arts working group. Its current chairwoman, councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, said she had closely scrutinised the fresh concept adding that it was \"within budget\".Giving little away, she added: \"I can see it appealing to the local community. It\u0027 innovative and there are a variety of ways to use it.\"The artwork is believed to be static and radically different from the previous offering.Fellow city councillor Duncan Macpherson said: \"The whole thing looks good. I think people who use this walkway regularly will be impressed. It\u0027 enhancing.\"People will be happy with it because they\u0026rsquove heeded public opinion.\"They\u0026rsquove taken the key aspects of the best features of the River Ness \u0026ndash its shape, the salmon fishing, the popularity of it. It enhances a current meeting place and it\u0027 a natural walkway.\"It\u0027 a good design, in the right place and way better. It\u0027 a natural \u0026lsquogathering place\u0026rsquo unlike the previous design which was very modern. That may go on to be a great success in another city but it wasn\u0026rsquot for Inverness or the location.\"A two-day public consultation was held last December at the city\u0027 railway station and in the Eastgate Shopping Centre to gather opinions about the overall riverside arts project to consider \"how the river should connect with the people and community of Inverness\".The arts initiative has been plagued by complaints about design and costs.The council has consistently stressed that the overall \u0026pound759,000 project, featuring a range of different art installations, is publicly funded but largely through ring-fenced grants.They were \u0026ndash Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,600), the Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound281,000), the council\u0027 \"cities gateway\" initiative (\u0026pound66,000), Highlands and Islands Enterprise (\u0026pound66,000) and a further \u0026pound40,000 from the council.
