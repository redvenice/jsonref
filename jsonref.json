And while there is evidence of broad disparities in the quality of education these pupils are receiving, the majority are unlikely to return to school before September. For certain age groups though, the school gates opened again earlier this month, meaning that students at pivotal points in their learning could have face-to-face access to their teachers for the first time since March.Before reopening the doors of Bonneville primary school to reception, year 1 and year 6 pupils on 3 June, headteacher Andrea Parker spent weeks preparing pupils, staff and the school building itself for a safe and productive end to the summer term.From installing hand sanitisers and distance markers to iding children into “bubbles” with their own classrooms, equipment and playtimes, Parker took pains to keep staff, pupils and teachers safe.Before her doors were opened to the children, she communicated the changes to everyone involved, including in weekly newsletters and a video hosted by teachers showing pupils what to expect on their return.“To see everyone sticking to the timetable – to see parents coming in and lining up on the 2-metre lines as you planned them to do, bubbles of children moving at the right times, and everything running smoothly, makes me exceedingly proud,” says Parker.“It’s been a community effort, and has taken a lot of hard work from education professionals who’ve spent hours perfecting what we need to do in order to get children back to school – we’ve been living and breathing it.“But the result was that there was no reluctance on the children’s part when they came back – they’re thrilled to see their friends and be able to play with each other. The parents have been very grateful too, and our teachers are really happy to be back.”The safety measures put in place at Bonneville have run as planned, with the addition of Friday afternoon “induction days” for any staff who are returning to school for the first time the following week.“Any teachers who were anxious before coming back were reassured as soon as they saw how everything worked,” Parker says. “So we introduced the induction days to give them the opportunity to walk through and see the school in action for themselves before returning.”“We were apprehensive, obviously, but I was desperate for my daughter to go back to Bonneville because she was getting a bit down at home,” says Miriam Paridjanian, whose 10-year-old daughter Rosa was one of those returning. Paridjanian, who is a qualified teacher, found home schooling “very challenging”, and jumped at the chance for her daughter to be able to work alongside her friends again.“Rosa is normally very bright and bubbly, but she just wasn’t feeling happy,” says Paridjanian. “I had a really hard time motivating her – she was getting a bit despondent and unmotivated, and she didn’t want to do the work.“The school seemed to have prepared for reopening very well – there was lots of communication, and I knew if I had any queries they’d be answered – so whenthe offer came to send her back, I took it.“Psychologically, I think children need that routine of getting ready and leaving the house in the morning, and since we sent Rosa back after half term she’s perked up so much – she’s like a different child. It’s made a difference to the whole family.”Despite some initial misgivings, Rosa is equally happy to be back at Bonneville.“I was excited when Mum told me I’d be going back to school but nervous too, in case it didn’t work and we’d have to go back to being home schooled,” she says. “Some parts aren’t great – we have to eat lunch in our classrooms, then go out to play, whereas we’d usually just all eat together in the dinner hall, which is better.“But I’ve made some new friends, because we all play together in our bubble in the playground now, and lessons are easier to do in school because we’ve got help from our teachers. I also like seeing my friends – everything’s more fun with friends.”With primary schools such as Bonneville reopening, the next stage of the UK government’s plans to bring children gradually back into formal education began on 15 June. Years 10 and 12 are encouraged to receive some “contact time” in advance of the summer break, and exams taking place in 2021.Hinchingbrooke school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, is one of the secondary schools that has reopened its doors to years 10 and 12.“I’m extremely proud of our teachers and the whole army of support staff who’ve worked really hard to make the school safe,” says Andrew Goulding, chief executive of a four-school academy trust that incorporates Hinchingbrooke school.“Teaching is a lot more than just imparting knowledge and giving pupils the opportunity to develop their skills. It’s about supporting iniduals and their complex emotions.“Although Hinchingbrooke and many others have done a great job with online learning, there’s no real substitute for being face-to-face with a teacher, because a good teacher motivates students in ways online learning can’t. Fundamentally, teaching is about human interaction.”To prepare for its new arrivals, the school has split its year 12 pupils into two groups, who attend one day a week on Monday and Tuesday. Similarly, the larger year 10 has been ided into three groups, each attending on Wednesday, Thursday or Friday.Between the year groups, some children will attend school every day of the week, and the system allows the school to manage a large number of students across each week during what are key educational years.“It’s really clear from the feedback we’ve had from parents that they’re desperate for their children to get back to school,” says Hinchingbrooke’s school principal, Mark Patterson. “They need that safety net and routine.“Quite a lot of the students, particularly the younger ones, are struggling with self-discipline. But while it’s important for everyone to be back at school, you have to prioritise those students who are nearer to their national exams, because they’re the first ones who’ll be tested externally next year. Giving them some time in person before the summer, so we can direct their learning, is crucial.”Like Parker, Patterson has prioritised communication to reassure students and ease them back into lessons, via weekly virtual assemblies and video call sessions for each tutor group.“We’re one community, and have had to rise to the challenge of keeping that sense of identity through the crisis,” he says. “But when students come back, it’s a dramatically changed picture from the one they left before lockdown. Familiarising them with school again shouldn’t be underestimated.”Returning children have received a set of safety guidelines, and both students and parents have been asked to sign a contract agreeing to abide by them.Safety measures put in place at the time include red circles marked on the ground 2 metres apart to help with queueing, reorganised classrooms with distanced desks and chairs, and one-way systems to ensure students don’t have to pass each other in close proximity. There’s also signage around the school reminding everyone of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand-washing and keeping their distance.Year 12 Hinchingbrooke student Rheeya Makwana, 17, had to learn how to adapt when she returned to school on 15 June – and so far, she’s pleased to be back.“I can study quite well independently anyway, but it’s better to be back at school,” she says. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom – and although it was obviously quite different being 2 metres away from the teacher, they still tried to teach as normal.“Seeing my friends again was so great, too. During lockdown, I FaceTimed them every day, but it’s different seeing them at school.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

But using his skills to work as a mortuary technician was an experience that had a profound impact“If it was my mum, grandma or son, I’d want someone looking after them”, says ex-Royal Marine commando, Sam Murray, who in April found himself volunteering as a mortuary technician, in response to the strain key workers suddenly faced. Having served in the marines from 1988 through to 1996, Murray had spotted a plea for help from fellow former marine Richard Sharp on social media. As CEO of charity Re:Act Disaster Response (formerly Team Rubicon UK), Sharp had requested military veterans urgently lend their skills to the crisis, which Murray says he was eager to do.“When Covid-19 was starting, I could see it all unfolding and wanted to help,” he says. “I thought: ‘I can’t just sit here, I need to do something.’ I saw they needed veteran volunteers, so I rang Richard up and said: ‘Right, get me involved.’” It meant Murray was given the daunting task of selecting, training and heading up a team of 12 veteran volunteers to work as mortuary technicians for five weeks. Stationing the teams across two hospital mortuaries in the north-west, Murray worked across both for three weeks. What he saw changed his life.Tasked with handling the deceased before taking measurements for their coffins,the volume of work the technicians faced was staggering, he says. “In a normal 24-hour period in hospital you’d have one or two deaths occurring – not including people arriving in ambulances. At the spike, they were receiving 20 a day, sometimes more. I can’t imagine how the technicians did it before we got there.”Any discomfort Murray initially felt was quickly put into perspective. “At first it was horrible and one guy had to leave because he didn’t like it, understandably. Then I thought: ‘Well someone’s got to do it.’” But having previously suffered from depression and PTSD, friends questioned whether the role was a good fit. “People were asking me if it would be good for my mental health and I thought: ‘Well, it is, because I’m doing something.’ If the bodies had suspected covid, we’d put them into sealed coffins, which meant families didn’t even get to see them. I kept thinking: ‘I’m the last person who’s going to see them’, which gave me a sense of purpose and duty, like I was doing something worthwhile. It felt like I was helping my country, really, just as I did in the marines. At least I could make sure they were looked after.”Murray is one of a growing number of veterans who have lent their support during the Covid-19 pandemic. As Johnny Mercer, minister for defence, people and veterans, says: “Those who’ve served in the armed forces have developed a vast array of skills during their career, meaning they can play a huge part now in our national effort to tackle coronavirus. We have seen many veterans making a fantastic contribution during the pandemic, through helping out the vulnerable in their local communities, to running mobile testing sites nationally. We cannot thank them enough for their efforts.”To date, Re:Act has deployed more than 200 volunteers and has helped to ensure 2,700 deceased patients have been cared for, 1,000 hospital beds have been installed and 5.4m PPE items distributed.Now Murray wants to share his experience so we can learn from it. “People need to know that Covid-19 kills people and if you don’t act sensibly, it’s going to happen again. I can see people out and about already forgetting and it can be frustrating when you’ve seen what I’ve seen,” he says.He is passionate about ensuring the work of the mortuary technicians – like the doctors, nurses and supermarket workers before them – is talked about. “Those technicians were on their own before we arrived. I dedicate everything I do to them, they were absolutely amazing, brave and cheerful. That’s the commando ethos – cheerfulness in the face of adversity. They’re incredibly brave, doing a job nobody wants to do.”But while many veterans are volunteering for the first time, Murray is no stranger to this work. After leaving the marines – where he specialised in Arctic warfare – he turned to security and close protection services, running his own surveillance business until last year. “It was a horrible world, but one of the last jobs I did was for an animal rights company,” he explains. “I remember thinking: ‘I’m doing something worthwhile – I’m helping animals and using my skills.’’’ It led Murray to change tack completely, leaving behind his successful business. “I thought: ‘I can’t go back to that world, I’m going to do good,’” he says.Having suffered from poor mental health after leaving the marines, Murray explains he attempted to take his own life five years ago. It meant he was put in touch with armed forces charity Rock2Recovery, which sparked a friendship with Dan Elliot. “I went to hospital and they helped me get back on my feet,” he says. “I formed a friendship with Dan, who is an amazing guy. You can’t put a finger on how many lives that man has saved. I’ve lost four close friends to suicide in the past four years and I’ve been in hospital in various states of PTSD or depression, whatever you want to call it,” he says.Murray’s involvement with the charity – and his friendship with Elliot – opened his eyes to the volume of military and blue light workers also suffering from poor mental health. Now in a stable, healthy place, Murray devotes his time to connecting withthese workers via social media, where he shares videos about his experiences. “There are thousands of people who want help,” he says. “I tell them about my problems and we speak for hours – they’ll call me at night to talk. Many of them have never opened up to anyone before.”They meet in person, too. Having discovered the Wim Hof method – which combines cold-water exposure, breathing techniques and meditation, and Murray credits with saving his life – he invites veterans and those still serving to visit his home in the Peak District, sharing the vital skills and techniques. “They drive hundreds of miles and I take them to the river and we do Wim Hof breathing and jump in the river,” he says. “I’ve had lads and girls saying: ‘You’ve saved my life.’ I think it shows young people that suicide is not the answer and that you can come through the other side. I’m starting to live my life now and I’ve never felt so alive. It saved me, so I teach it.”While his role in the mortuaries has come to an end, Murray is still volunteering with Re:Act, with his latest job safely housing homeless people in nearby St Helens. “I believe this is what I was supposed to do – helping people. It’s my calling”, he says, when asked why he’s doing it. “I think by doing good things and by volunteering, it helps them and it helps me. I also hope that by teaching – and showing people through doing – that they might volunteer more. I’m confident we’ll find positives during this terrible time.”Next, Murray plans to buy a camper van to travel throughout Britain, visiting members of the armed forces, blue light workers and now, mortuary technicians too, to further spread his message and teach the breathing techniques he practises daily. His hope for the country is simple: “During Covid-19, I noticed we’re a community and everyone was looking after the vulnerable and the elderly, which was great but we should be doing that anyway. My message? To keep that going and get people to be kinder, that’s all I’m trying to do.”In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

It has been won in the past by “true comic gems” including Marina Lewycka’s A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian and DBC Pierre’s Vernon God Little.Set in the fictional small seaside town of Dobbiston, Flake follows the life of ice-cream man Howard, who realises that the downturn in his business is a consequence of his half-brothers’s efforts to build his own ice-cream empire across the north-west.With his debut, Dooley, who also works in the House of Commons in its education department, beat shortlisted novels including Jenny Offill’s Weather and Oisin Fagan’s Nobber. Having won the ObserverCapeComica graphic short story prize in 2016 for a comic about a man who longs to win Lancashire’s Tallest Milkman competition, Dooley has been described by the Observer as a meld of Alan Bennett and graphic novelist Chris Ware.“We had none of us, I think, expected a graphic novel to win, but we were all captivated by Flake,” said judge and publisher David Campbell, while judge Sindhu Vee called the book “a rare joy: a laugh out loud story with characters you want to meet again and again”.Dooley, the 21st winner of the Wodehouse prize, said he was “surprised, overwhelmed and elated” to take this year’s award. His winnings include a jeroboam of Bollinger and a set of Wodehouse books.“Flake was published on 2 April, amidst a huge, bewildering global crisis. It’s been a very strange experience. Winning the Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse prize means it’s just got stranger in the best possible way,” Dooley said. “Now, how on earth do you chill a bottle of champagne that big…?”Usually, the winner of the Wodehouse is also presented at the Hay festival with a pig named after their winning title, but organisers said that “with the current situation not allowing for a physical pig”, Dooley has drawn his own interpretation of what might have been."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5a8cd20a35e5b95d246b75f8c0f25fe68b80648/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28d3c2961dc69bbc40baaf5aaad464a2","title":"small pleasures by clare chambers review a suburban mystery","story":"There is compassion and quiet humour to be found in this tale of a putative virgin birth in postwar BritainIn the mid 50s, scientists began to give serious consideration to the possibility of single-sex reproduction. Dr Helen Spurway, a biologist at the University of London, observed that guppies were apparently capable of parthenogenesis. It had also been demonstrated that it was possible to induce spontaneous conception in rabbits by freezing the fallopian tubes.In December 1955, the Sunday Pictorial (later renamed the Sunday Mirror) took a tabloid response to Spurway’s research by launching a Christmas appeal to find women who believed they had experienced a virgin birth. Most who came forward were ruled out for displaying some confusion about what virginity entailed. But there was one case over which several eminent doctors failed to reach a consensus – that of a woman named Emmimarie Jones, who apparently conceived a daughter while confined to bed in a German sanatorium.This curious case was considered by the geneticist Aarathi Prasad in her 2012 study, Like a Virgin: How Science Is Redesigning the Rules of Sex. Clare Chambers heard a radio discussion about the story and has made it the basis of her fictional account of immaculate conception in south-east London.The novel centres on Jean Swinney, a woman approaching 40 whose prospects of fulfilment have begun to fade. Jean cares for a neurotic, suffocatingly dependent mother, while dealing with the mundanities of her job at the local newspaper. There she is relied upon to pen housekeeping tips and dutiful celebrations of National Salad Week (“Try serving the humble lettuce with baked or fried forcemeat balls for a crisp new touch”).Chambers evokes a stolid, suburban sense of days “passing without great peaks and troughs of emotion”. Jean takes her solace where she can find it: “Small pleasures – the first cigarette of the day a glass of sherry before Sunday lunch a bar of chocolate parcelled out to last a week a newly published library book, still pristine and untouched by other hands …” The list continues in this vein for some time, going on to include spring hyacinths, fresh snow, the purchase of new stationery and the satisfaction of a neatly folded ironing pile.A more promising commission arises when Jean’s editor suggests that she interview “Our Lady of Sidcup”, a Swiss-German seamstress named Gretchen Tilbury who claims to have given birth to a daughter without the involvement of a man. Jean is instantly charmed by Gretchen’s congeniality, which is shared by that of the supposed miracle, her 10-year-old daughter, Margaret. She is less immediately taken with Gretchen’s dour and significantly older husband, Howard, whose insistence that he had no hand in Margaret’s conception appears to be borne out by the fact that the couple maintain separate beds.The narrative follows Jean as she attempts to substantiate Gretchen’s claim that, at the time of her daughter’s conception, she was suffering from severe rheumatoid arthritis and was confined to a women’s ward in a convent-run nursing home. Meanwhile, mother and daughter are treated like guinea pigs by a peremptory and often self-contradictory committee of experts at Charing Cross hospital in west London, who recommend serum samples, saliva analysis and skin grafts as a means of establishing the genetic match.Jean attempts conscientiously to trace Gretchen’s fellow patients and former staff from the nursing home, but her professional objectivity is compromised by her growing attachment to the Tilburys. She readily accepts Gretchen’s offer to make her a dress, and returns the favour by presenting Margaret with a pet rabbit. More surprisingly, she finds herself beginning to develop an intimacy with the unprepossessing Howard, whose lack of fulfilment in his marriage becomes increasingly apparent.The postwar suburban milieu of Chambers’ work has drawn comparisons to Barbara Pym, although perhaps a closer parallel could be made with Anita Brookner, with whom she shares an interest in intelligent, isolated women destabilised by the effects of an unexpected and unsustainable love affair. At its best, Chambers’ eye for drab, undemonstrative details achieves a Larkin-esque lucidity – when writing about the “porridge-coloured” doilies crocheted by Jean’s mother, for example: “They had dozens of these at home, little puddles of string under every vase, lamp and ornament.”Jean’s unfamiliarity with sensual adventure is hinted at in balefully comic terms: “Howard was astonished to find she had never eaten a cobnut, a deficiency he was determined to put right.” The problem is that once their passion has been declared, the prose fails correspondingly to ignite, relying on formulations such as “the monster of awakened longing” and “duty with its remorseless grasp”, which, even if used with self-conscious intent, feel uninspired.Chambers’ novel is set in a period before DNA testing could have provided conclusive proof and manages to keep the reader guessing to the end, although the chances of Gretchen being impregnated by an angel are admittedly remote. One can appreciate the novel for its quiet humour and compassionate consideration of the everyday, unfashionable and unloved. But in terms of revelation, it is probably too much to expect miracles.• Small Pleasures is published by W\u0026ampN (RRP £14.99). To order a copy go to bookshop.

A jury found the tweets did not reach the legal standard for defamation, and Musk was not found liable for damages.In 2018 the US Securities and Exchange (SEC) regulator fined both Musk and Tesla $20m over the chief executive’s tweets that he planned to take the company private at a substantial premium to the share price, causing the stock price to surge. As part of the settlement with the SEC Musk was forced to give up his position as Tesla’s chairman.The SEC ruled: “In truth, Musk knew that the potential transaction was uncertain and subject to numerous contingencies. Musk had not discussed specific deal terms, including price, with any potential financing partners, and his statements about the possible transaction lacked an adequate basis in fact.”Pirc said the episode had “prompted accusations of stock market abuse, with the SEC alleging that Musk had lied to investors. Mr Musk and Tesla settled these claims with the SEC, paying $40m, causing financial damage”.Pirc’s shareholder report also raised concerns about Musk’s tweets in opposition to Covid-19 lockdown measures. “Mr Musk has been a vocal opponent of the Covid-19 quarantine, and reportedly required workers to return to work during quarantine, without sufficient precautionsprotections and despite protests from workers,” Pirc said. “This concern is furthered as it has also been reported that multiple Tesla employees have tested positive for Covid-19 since returning to work.”Investors were also urged to vote against re-electing Robyn Denholm as Tesla’s chair. She succeeded Musk when he was forced to step down in November 2018. Pirc said she should step down because of her role overseeing Musk’s pay award as independent non-executive chair and as a member of the remuneration committee.Tesla’s annual general meeting was due to take place on 7 July, but the company on Sunday delayed the vote until September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df5efb151c20accce090198ccd42b6b714727741/0_287_4337_2604/master/4337.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5962f634e1bfcbc236386183618df4e5","title":"job losses uk house prices covid 19 ssp factories markets business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial newsHere’s our news story on the downturn in UK property prices:UK supermarket chain Sainsbury has reported a surge in sales during the pandemic....and a big jump in costs too.But clothing demand slumped by a quarter, with much of the population staying at home.And overall, the profit impact of Covid-19 is expected to be more than £500m, which will be “broadly offset” by business rates relief and stronger grocery sales.

However, new orders kept falling, highlighting the slump in global demand.Italy Manufacturing PMI rose to 47.5 in June, from 45.4 in May, showing a smaller contraction.

That’s close to stabilisation.Factory bosses reported that production and new orders continued to fall in June, but at much slower rates. Many were forced to impose reduced working hour, or cut staff, despite the easing of lockdown measures. But encouragingly, confidence about the future strengthened and returned to positive territory during June.Ryanair is threatening to add to the swathe of job cuts across the travel industry, unless staff agree a pay cut.Back in May, Ryanair announced it would cut 3,000 pilots and cabin crew positions. This morning, CEO Michael O’Leary declared that some of these cuts could be avoided, if staff agreed lower wages.He told the BBC that:“We’ve already announced about 3,500 job losses but we’re engaged in extensive negotiations with our pilots, our cabin crew and we’re asking them to all take pay cuts as an alternative to job losses.Despite these recent falls, UK houses are still pretty pricey when compared to wages:Britain’s estate agents are insisting that the property market isn’t about to collapse. Lucy Pendleton of estate agents James Pendleton, argues the market is showing resilience, given the scale of the pandemic.“Prices are down by a whisker annually but what is remarkable is how soft a landing the market has had given the scale of the disaster that has unfolded in the past few months. “June was the first full month of trading since the property market came back to life post-lockdown and these sellers will be those highly motivated to move through necessity. That pool of vendors will shrink rapidly and that could put a floor under prices.Jonathan Hopper, CEO of Garrington Property Finders, reckons the lockdown will have forced some people to move house -- perhaps to a property better suited to home-working:“So far this is a hard reset for the market rather than a collapse. The gains of the ‘Boris bounce’ seen at the start of the year have been swept away, and the market is transitioning to the ‘new normal’.“With estate agents across the UK at last able to conduct viewings, both buyers and sellers are feeling their way on price.“While the full financial impact of the pandemic has yet to feed through into the wider economy, in the property market the mood among buyers is best summed up by the two c’s – caution and curiosity.“Three months of being cooped up in the same four walls have led many people to consider a move, and to reflect on what they want from their home. “On the front line, we’ve seen a steady stream of pragmatic buyers who made life-changing decisions during lockdown and are now keen to capitalise on the current softening market.Here are the key charts from today’s Nationwide house price survey:Here’s our news story on the SSP job cuts:Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.The economic cost of Covid-19 is mounting, forcing struggling companies to slash jobs even as governments try to unlock their economies without fuelling the virus’s spread.In the last few minutes, British travel food group SSP has confirmed it is planning to cut up to 5,000 jobs. That would be over half its workforce, as it implements a reorganisation to address the crisis.The firm, which runs the Upper Crust and Caffè Ritazza outlets at airports and railway stations, has been hurt badly by the slump in travel since the pandemic started. It has concluded that sales will remain very subdued for months -- with demand for long-haul flights likely to remain very low for month.In a grim statement to the stock market, SSP says:If the pace of the recovery continues at the current level, this could lead to up to c. 5,000 roles becoming redundant from within the Head Office and UK Operations.That slump forced aerospace giant Airbus to announce 15,000 job cuts last night, including 1,700 in the UK.“Airbus is facing the gravest crisis this industry has ever experienced.” That crisis is also forcing EasyJet to axe thousands of jobs, but it also runs beyond the travel sector. Furniture chain Harveys and shirt maker TM Lewin both fell into administration on Tuesday, costing 800 jobs - with another 1,300 at risk.The Covid-19 slump has now hit the  UK property sector, with some people much more reluctant to risk taking on a new mortgage - or possibly even to risk visiting properties.More to follow..."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75ece4ef71384d452181519503c855232b42cfb1/249_407_2884_1730/master/2884.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=620602f79b558ed0c12097e32b95460e","title":"slob style covid 19 fashion statement lockdown dominic cummings","story":"Self-styled mavericks like Dominic Cummings will always dress like they don’t care. As for the rest of us, we’ll soon find out what worksI went on maternity leave last summer. Occasionally during that time I would think idly about what I would wear when I was back at work and my body looked less like a souffle. A few weeks ago, when the moment finally arrived, I found myself in the middle of a pandemic, still at home, wearing Birkenstock clogs and a tracksuit stained with yoghurt, braless, and staring into Zoom.Coronavirus has dismantled the scaffolding of our daily lives – and many of us working from home have reacted by dressing in clothing that is both comfortable and comforting. What we wear has been one of the few things we can control. So with restrictions easing far quicker than they were implemented, how exactly will we map this new freedom onto how we dress?There are theories: the great reopening will likely start on a high, like New Year’s Eve – crowds in their Sunday best and matching masks laying waste to beer gardens, that sort of thing. Expect reactionary colour, too, and the chance to wear heels for the first time in quite some time. Fashion insiders have told me they plan to make opera gloves happen that visors could “allow for a full face of make-up”. In reality, our elasticated waists will pivot at best to jeans. It’s one thing dressing for frivolity, but another thing entirely to be frivolous.Fashion is usually defined by cycles of capital, culture and commerce. The pandemic has interrupted that, leading to a shift in clothing that is driven by circumstance, not trend. This certainly applies to Lawrence Schlossman, one half of the fashion podcast Throwing Fits. He loves dressing up, yet Schlossman’s lockdown uniform, he told me, adheres to an exceptional but very specific casualness – Patagonia shorts, the Birkenstock Boston clogs – that has become “a way to keep one thing in my life consistent while everything else is crumbling around me”. If even dedicated followers of fashion are dressing down, then surely it must be a thing.Still, just as everything – pandemics included – is commodified under capitalism, so too are trends drummed up to justify, explain and lay claim to certain circumstances. To wit: GQ publishing an article attempting to codify “slob style” – my yoghurt-stained tracksuit – as not simply a trend, but a form of “power dressing”. We have, they say, become a nation of slobs. Unsurprisingly they cite Boris Johnson’s chief strategist, Dominic Cummings, as its figurehead.The word “slob” (however snobby its use often is) has long been applied to Cummings, perpetually photographed on his way into Downing Street in creased white shirts, dirty tracksuits and sports tees. But beyond the whims of the infamous lockdown dodger, a sentiment of dressing down fits the mood right now – which is no bad thing. Most of us are responding organically to the pressures and demands of life, not to mention the removal – for some – of the need to dress in a uniform, whether formal or not.This casual culture is part of a wider, privilege-adjacent moment, in which we seek new ways to look good yet comfortable, without betraying the great levelling that the pandemic has supposedly laid out. The truth is, though, that some of us are able to dress down and others are not, and this reality may reassert itself when lockdown lifts – it will be fully apparent when more people return to shared working environments.Unlike exhausted NHS workers on their day off or harassed parents now working from home, and long before Covid-19, Cummings has had the privilege of dressing the way he wants, cultivating along the way a reputation as a maverick. The skewed codes of fashion help him in this regard: we presume his Finisterre surfwear must be appropriate for Westminster, effectively becoming an expression of his status. When formality is hinted at (the white shirt, unkempt of course), that power becomes even more clear.Such dishevelment is allowed because of the role Cummings has carved out for himself in politics, and besides, he has merely deployed what Harvard researchers call the “red sneakers effect”: the idea that if someone is bold enough to wear red trainers in a room full of suits, we are inclined to listen to them because they must be important if they can get away with wearing them. This idea is potent in Silicon Valley – see Mark Zuckerberg’s traumatising array of casual wear – and has been previously popular among British government policy gurus, with the yellow V-neck T-shirts of Steve Hilton, David Cameron’s blue-sky thinker, a particular low point.Self-styled mavericks will always dress as if they don’t care in an attempt to build a myth. The question for the rest of us is whether the newfound comfort we might have found in lockdown is here to stay, or whether traditional clothing norms will be reasserted. This may seem like a small point in the grand scheme of things, but the vital question of whether coronavirus will lead to a different world applies to clothing just as it applies to anything else, no matter how much you may wish to distance yourself from fashion.Clothing has the power to define something, and shape it. Particularly for women, there could now be a reduced compulsion – one that is generally felt unconsciously – to dress a particular way, especially in the workplace. Or it’s possible that we have been so conditioned by our collective experience that nothing will actually change.The traditional suit, so analogous of authority, is on hiatus, however temporarily. It’s not simply a way of demarcating boundaries between work and leisure, it’s about plausibility. Perhaps now though, in our exhausted world, enveloped in shorts and clogs, we might finally be able to expand what’s plausible.• Morwenna Ferrier is the ’s deputy fashion editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a780a5b037051319f04fca6f1c1fe2c4e4398d53/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3cedc5d347fbc7fe86d2c27936ab917","title":"so we are getting ready to take on china thats brave but is it worth it","story":"Experts weigh in on Scott Morrison’s $270bn plan to upgrade Australia’s defence capabilities Strong national defence is the consequence of four interrelated factors: a vibrant economy an educated, inclusive and resilient society a smart defence force that exploits agility rather than bulk and an active and engaged diplomacy. Interestingly, an invested diplomacy is what ultimately brings together all the elements of national power and focuses them on realising the national interests.So, we are getting ready to take on China? That’s brave. But remember, VCs are often won posthumously.The attempted overreach in the package announced by prime minister Scott Morrison looks more like underreach, if China is the country we are seeking to deter. No matter how successful a flyweight is in bulking up to the welterweight ision, you don’t get into the ring with a heavyweight. You’ll get smashed.An agile ADF is important and a more versatile naval capability should distinguish Australia’s approach to national defence. That means submarines rather than frigates, but the government has yet to lay a keel. Missiles are great, but there’s never enough of them.Remember, a welterweight will never defeat a heavyweight, so you don’t get into the ring. Rather, you build coalitions.• Allan Behm is head of the international and security affairs program at the Australia InstitutePrime minister Scott Morrison’s speech at the Australian Defence Force Academy on Wednesday will have sent a chill down the spine of most Australians. But the bleak assessment he shared about the Indo-Pacific’s deteriorating strategic environment is frighteningly spot on – and justifies the department of defence’s major new investments into deterring and responding to coercion in our front yard.Three worrying trends lie behind the region’s slide into dangerous strategic competition: an eroding balance of power, a decline in the US’ capacity to deter aggression and maintain regional order, and an increase in China’s aggressive use of coercive statecraft – such as maritime assertiveness, economic leverage, covert influence operations and other grey zone activities – backed by its massive investments in high-end military capabilities designed to reduce our access and influence in the region.The 2020 Defence Strategic Update and Force Structure Plan – which provided the strategic substance for Morrison’s lecture – will begin to prepare Australia for these threatening new challenges.Prioritising the Indo-Pacific as the focus for our defence activities is the simplest but most important policy shift being ushered in. Since 2001, Australia has spent over $15bn on military operations in the Middle East compared to less than $4bn in our region – an unstrategic use of resources that was compounded by the way that counterinsurgency operations also warped our procurement priorities.This, presumably, will now end, freeing up additional funds and bandwidth to support our Pacific and Southeast Asian partners to better defend their – and our – strategic interests by pushing back against Chinese coercion, expansion and regional adventurism.How we do this, however, will pose thorny new questions about what kinds of military and geopolitical risks Canberra is willing to run in defence of our regional interests. This applies even more to the other big policy shift in today’s updates – Australia’s re-entry into the high-end deterrence game.Investing $13bn to $23bn in long-range strike capabilities, unmanned combat aircraft and offensivedefensive cyber assets will give the government serious options for threatening Chinese forces, interests and infrastructure in a crisis. But developing the operational concepts and political thresholds for making the preemptive military threats that deterrence requires will be a long and difficult process – and is where the really hard choices lurk.• Ashley Townshend is the director of foreign policy and defence at the United States Studies Centre, the University of SydneyOne of the most noteworthy admissions in the new defence strategy prime minister Scott Morrison laid out on Wednesday is that Australia – and the US – may no longer hold a technological military advantage in the Indo-Pacific.This assumption has been a cornerstone of Australia’s defence policy since the end of the cold war. It has largely allowed Australia to invest in high-end military equipment, often bought from the US, with the confidence that it was superior to anything a potential aggressor in the region could deploy.The Australian defence force may be small relatively to other large land-based armies in the region, but its equipment, technology and training could be counted on as being superior.But China’s rise has brought all sorts of implications for our defence policy, and its ascent as a scientific and technological power is perhaps the most consequential. Most estimates put Beijing’s national spending on R\u0026ampD to reach parity with the US, Canada, the UK , New Zealand and Australia combined in PPP terms by the mid to late 2020s.Much of this R\u0026ampD will also bolster the People Liberation Army’s military capability and explains – in part – why technology has become the central element of US-China strategic competition.Ensuring Australia has a competitive edge in military capability and technology is critical for a middle power in the Indo-Pacific. This new defence strategy leans into emerging technological capabilities like the autonomous UAV “Loyal Wingman” to team up with our crewed fighters, robotic capabilities for our land forces and boosts our space-based communications and underwater sensors.This is on top of an additional $3bn for defence innovation and science.But these new capabilities and investments – while needed – may miss the broader picture. With many new technologies originating in the private sector or through Australian universities having national security implications, investing and building our broader scientific and innovation capacity will be just as critical as new missiles and drones in withstanding the worsening strategic environment.• Brendan Thomas-Noone is a research fellow of foreign policy and defence at the United States Studies Centre, the University of Sydney"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3f1fc706ad459a4272306fa03f8dc8bedcbc75c/3_0_1107_664/master/1107.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=258e2ce3b1b060e63bdcfcb972bc87e6","title":"the switch to cloud how public services are becoming more agile and innovative","story":"The cloud offers the scope for a more responsive, flexible approach to delivering online services – enabling government departments to innovate in ways that were once beyond their reachYou may have noticed it’s a lot easier these days to get things “done” online with government departments. After years of relying on the public to post forms or queue in an office to pick up the right documents, government bodies are now using the cloud to launch services which in the private sector would probably make headlines for being years ahead of their time.Whether it’s filing and paying taxes online, renewing a passport, booking a driving test or registering to vote, online services are instantly and seamlessly connecting citizens with the information and services they need in their daily lives. When they are accessed, users are also finding data is being freed from silos so the latest information is made available and acted on.The Driver and Vehicle Safety Agency (DVSA) is a good example. Deloitte has developed an innovative app for the organisation that allows assessors to check and record all aspects of a vehicle’s safety digitally, reducing processing times and removing the risk of lost paperwork. It can scan licence plates for immediate access to a vehicle’s test history and take and upload photos of any faults. When a vehicle passes, it is certified instantly.This is a classic use-case for cloud technology. Opening up access from any mobile device or location ensures the safe and efficient transfer and processing of safety information, and means enforcement teams out on the roads have up-to-date data at their fingertips, so they can more easily identify unsafe and non-compliant vehicles. And, using only serverless technologies means it’s infinitely scalable and cost effective.Mobile services such as this would not be possible without the cloud. It enables a new way of developing solutions to support business challenges and it frees up an organisation from traditional functions such as hosting and servicing data centres and patching software, allowing services to run via a third-party platform and empowering employees to focus on more value-added functions.According to Kerry Appleton-Norman, partner for public sector cloud at Deloitte, the appeal of this approach comes down mainly to speed, flexibility and, sometimes, cost.Moving to the cloud not only saves time on purchasing and managing physical environments, it also opens up access to a suite of software on the internet as a service. It is far quicker to amend these to an organisation’s requirements, rather than have software written from scratch. “Traditional procurement and development processes could take several months, by which time an organisation’s needs may have moved on,” Appleton-Norman explains.By moving to the cloud, Appleton-Norman has found that Deloitte’s public sector clients are able to embrace the pioneering attitude found at exciting startups where new ideas can be tested at breakneck speed.“The cloud empowers companies to be part of the new wave of fail-fast, agile development,” she says. “With the cloud you can leverage the necessary storage capacity very quickly and there are usually software packages you can try out and adapt that already work on that platform. The real beauty for organisations is that the technology enables them to get pilot projects set up really quickly. If they work, it’s great, if they don’t, they can be shut down immediately with no extra expense incurred.”This flexibility applies to the server space required, too. One of the drawbacks of traditional software development has always been that a server would be commissioned and set up to permanently handle the peak flow of traffic it needs to deal with.“You would typically end with situations where a computer system was set up to be able to permanently work at maximum performance, but that’s just not necessary all year round,” says Appleton-Norman.“It works out way too expensive to have that capability available to you all the time when, say, a tax authority only needs to handle their maximum level of traffic around particular deadlines at known times of the year. Most organisations will have peaks that are far more efficiently handled by moving to the cloud where capacity can be dialled up or down as needed, it doesn’t have to be permanently available.”Experience of working with public sector bodies has shown there is more to digital transformation than the project at hand. One of the biggest impacts is a change in how the organisation serves the public and this often changes the roles of employees. For this reason, Appleton-Norman believes they need to be aware of the need for strategy and to consider the knock-on effects of what they are trying to achieve.“Most organisations start out considering the cloud as part of their digital transformation work, they generally want to work more efficiently and provide new frictionless online service to the public,” she says.“The thing they don’t always realise, without guidance, is that the programme will impact their entire organisation, it’s not just about servers and software. If you’re rolling out new interfaces that staff or the public use, you will also need to look at how to best structure your organisation to do this and how to equip your staff with the right skills to execute. A move to the cloud is part of a broader organisational transformation, and organisations need to understand how this will often require a change to the culture of the organisation. How can you support increased collaboration, how do you deal with more focus on the citizen, what are the new roles and responsibilities that are going to be created?”This extra strategic perspective empowers public sector bodies to test and launch innovative services that make citizens’ lives much more convenient while also getting the most out of IT budgets. Forward planning also makes sure that the organisation’s employees are prepared for their changed roles in serving the public in a new way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2e83125c2bd6d6627d36720e360fc14bdfb7d09/0_130_4422_2654/master/4422.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e9575049fb446d7859ca0009ad80083","title":"welsh schoolchildren to learn about arandora star sinking via radio","story":"Theatre company has chosen coronavirus-friendly medium instead of stage productionThe story of how 53 Welsh Italians lost their lives when the ship Arandora Star sank 80 years ago as it transported them to second world war internment camps is to be told via a back-to-basics, coronavirus-friendly medium.Entitled simply Arandora Star, the play will be streamed – in Welsh and English – into classrooms in the autumn. The move has been praised by arts industry leaders as an example of innovation in challenging times.The theatre company’s artistic director and co-writer of the play, Geinor Styles, said: “We are hugely disappointed that for the first time in three decades we will not be able to provide our usual production, but the safety of the children, our actors and creative teams is paramount.“We believe that producing a radio version of the play is a great solution in these uncertain times. It will ensure that the arts and theatre continue to thrive and the children of Wales are not losing out on the creative industries playing an important role in their schooling.”The company’s productions are seen every year by about 5,000 children between the ages of eight and 11. “I’m very happy that the tradition will continue and they will not lose out because of Covid-19,” said Styles.The Arandora Star, a converted cruise ship, was sunk en route to Canada in the Atlantic by a German torpedo on 2 July 1940, with the loss of more than 800 lives. Among those on board were Welsh Italians, many from the valleys of south Wales who had been declared “enemy aliens” by the British government.The play tells the story of a fictional character called Lina as she struggles to cope with the loss of her father, Guido, on the vessel and how she and her mother, Carmela, survive in a time of war and prejudice.“It’s a relevant story for now about how we deal with immigration,” said Styles. She also said teachers were pleased that as well as reminding the UK of a tragic, sometimes forgotten episode, the style of the piece may help bring back listening skills.The director, Dan Lloyd, said telling stories about episodes like the internment of Welsh Italians was vital. He said: “Although Arandora Star is a story set eight decades ago, there is much to be learned from history. Telling such stories ignites empathy, which is the key to helping things improve.”It is appropriate that one of the most famous examples of the radio play is a Welsh one – Dylan Thomas’ Under Milk Wood, which was revived during lockdown by a cast of household names and key workers.Fiona Allan, president of UK Theatre, praised the move by Theatr na nÓg. She said: “I’m encouraged to see companies finding innovative ways of getting culture into the classroom whilst theatres around the nation remain closed. It’s vitally important that our young future audience experience theatre and the arts at a young age.“We’re all acutely aware of the risk Covid-19 poses to our industry, with theatres and arts companies throughout the UK at risk of collapse, and desperately in need of more than the government’s roadmap. We need dates to work towards in order to plan properly towards reopening the sector.“In the meantime, Theatr na nÓg are demonstrating great resilience and forward thinking in bring this production to schools throughout Wales.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd738fbb29e66c1eecb81cef5279e12744bc226e/0_8_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f86e167b9385e08c6ee9ab74df32643","title":"likelihood of 40c temperatures in uk is rapidly accelerating","story":"Such deadly heat may become regular occurrence later this century, scientists findThe likelihood of the UK experiencing deadly 40C temperatures for the first time is “rapidly accelerating” due to the climate crisis, scientists have found.The research shows that such searing heat could become a regular occurrence by the end of the century unless carbon emissions are cut to zero. Global heating has already made UK heatwaves 30 times more likely and extreme temperatures led to 3,400 early deaths from 2016-19.The highest temperature recorded in the UK is 38.7C, set in Cambridge in July 2019, while the summer of 2018 was the joint hottest on record. The new analysis found an increasing risk of even higher temperatures.Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, forest destruction and other human activities are trapping heat and putting more energy into the climate system.\u0026nbspHotter air means heatwaves are much more likely. For example, scientists now say the unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 “could not have occurred without human-induced climate change”. In Australia, the scorching summer of 2016-17 in New South Wales was made at least 50 times more likely by global heating, linking it directly to climate change.Hotter air can also carry more water vapour, meaning more intense rain and more flooding.\u0026nbspAnother important factor in the northern hemisphere is the impact of changes in the Arctic. The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America.When these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California.\u0026nbspMost of the planet’s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. Record-breaking cyclones hit Mozambique\u0026nbsplast year. The deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was made three times more likely by climate change. Rising sea level also means storms cause more coastal damage.Today, a high of 40C is expected once every few centuries. But this would be every 15 years in a medium emissions scenario, in which carbon cuts are made but not enough to meet the 1.5C or 2C limits agreed by nations in the 2015 Paris climate deal. In a worst-case scenario, with emissions continuing the trend of recent decades unchecked, somewhere in the UK would reach 40C every 3.5 years.The new analysis follows research in 2019 that used the same medium emissions scenario to indicate that by 2050 London will have the same climate that Istanbul has today, Leeds will be like Melbourne, Cardiff like Montevideo in Uruguay, and Edinburgh like Paris. All these foreign cities have already broken 40C.“The probability of recording 40C, or above, in the UK is now rapidly accelerating,” said the scientists in the study, published in the journal Nature Communications. Its lead author, Nikolaos Christidis, at the Met Office Hadley Centre, said: “The rate of change is remarkable.”Prof Piers Forster, at the University of Leeds and not part of the Met Office study, said: “Heatwaves are a real risk to life in the UK, especially if we do not begin modifying our homes, workplaces and hospitals to manage their expected overheating.”The government’s official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, said on 25 June “the UK is poorly prepared for the very serious impacts of climate change, including … overheating”.“However, we should note that in terms of heatwaves, the UK will get off lightly compared with most other nations,” said Forster. “Heatwaves in the major crop-growing regions of the world could have more profound effects, both globally and for the UK.”The Met Office research combined temperature measurements at 1km scale across the UK with 16 large-scale climate models to calculate the likelihood of an extreme temperature being reached somewhere in the nation in a particular year.The significantly larger risk in the high-emissions scenario compared with the medium-emissions scenario shows cutting carbon emissions makes a big difference in reducing the frequency of extreme heat, from breaching 40C once every 3.5 years to once every 15 years.The scientists also examined the likelihood of exceeding 35C. This occurs in the UK about every five years at present, but would be an annual occurrence by the end of the century in either emissions scenario.The south-east and south regions of the UK are most affected by the rising heat, because other regions benefit more from the cooling influence of the Atlantic ocean. The study found that many areas in the north for which 30C is extremely rare may exceed that level at least once per decade by 2100."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72494dbd2c098c747b497c94abcf5a775bc04a5b/109_0_988_593/master/988.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ffc12b5129599580c2cbc159ea34ec4","title":"ms j alexander americas next top model judge","story":"The former America’s Next Top Model judge and catwalk coach talks big bows, the power of Pride and a surreal meeting with Imelda Marcos in ManilaThe bow, I kid you not, I made at 7.40am on the morning of the Oscars.

He returned to the northern shore of Hawaii, where he has remained since with his wife, the journalist and author Keely Shaye Smith, and their two sons, Dylan and Paris, 19. (Brosnan also has three children from his first marriage.)“We are a close family and this time of covid has nourished and nurtured a bond between us all that probably would not have existed without the lockdown,” he says.Brosnan is sitting at his kitchen table, in front of a bright Indigenous Australian painting, which he bought in Sydney during a “tour of duty” as James Bond. He is here to talk about his supporting role in the Netflix film Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga. The film, which was originally scheduled to coincide with this year’s contest, follows two would-be pop stars (Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams) in their quest to represent Iceland in a fictionalised version of the competition.There was hopeful expectation in some quarters that Brosnan might lend his singing voice, given his infamous performances in the Mamma Mia! films (his singing in the first film was so comical that it landed him the Razzie for worst supporting actor at the 2009 awards). Was he shocked not to be given the chance to sing on screen again? “I was surprised, I was disappointed, I was crestfallen,” he responds, good-naturedly.Brosnan plays Ferrell’s disparaging father (“Which I thought was a bit of a long shot”), who resents his son’s wild ambitions and wants him to aspire to a more conventional future. It is not a parenting style familiar to Brosnan. “My boys are academic and have a creative instinct and intuition towards the arts. So I don’t try to direct them.”His younger sons’ careers in film-making, acting (Dylan) and modelling (Paris) have seen them amass their own fame they have social media followings in the tens of thousands. They stole the show at this year’s Golden Globes in their roles as ambassadors, shepherding celebrities on and off stage in black tie. Does their social media fame worry him?“Yes, it does concern my wife, Keely, and I,” he says. “The footprint that they’re leaving will stay with them for many years to come. It’s treacherous waters. I went on Instagram to follow Paris, to make sure that he was acquitting himself well and not entering into any kind of liaisons with folk of ill repute. It’s a strange animal and you have to be careful with it. It can be narcissistic and you have to balance it out with human lightness.”Born in 1953, Brosnan was raised in Navan, 30 miles north-west of Dublin. An only child, he has described his childhood as a solitary, Roman Catholic upbringing. “My father took off for the hills and, for my mother, it was a very difficult time in the 50s to be a single parent. So, in many respects, I created my own self,” he says.After his father left, his mother moved to London when Brosnan was four. She wanted a better life for them. He waited for her in Ireland and lived in a succession of houses – with his maternal grandparents’, with his aunt and uncle, at a boarding house.“I’m very grateful that I didn’t have the shackles of parenting, so to speak, and really cleaved my own path in life. When, as a young teenager, I told my mother that I wanted to be an actor, she was extremely supportive of that. She wholeheartedly said: ‘Follow your dreams.’”Brosnan moved to Putney in west London when he was 12. At school, he was nicknamed Irish. “Being an Irish immigrant in London in ’64, they don’t let you forget that.” He later worked briefly as a commercial artist, but, having been raised on “cowboys and Indians, Old Mother Riley, Norman Wisdom”, he still dreamed of acting.Brosnan stumbled upon the Ovalhouse theatre in south London and found himself “in the company of poets and musicians and outcasts and mangled souls”. His breakthrough came when he landed a small part in a Tennessee Williams play, The Red Devil Battery Sign, as the understudy.“It didn’t work out for this other fellow,” says Brosnan. “I got the call: ‘Tennessee wants to see you now.’ I tore out of the flat and hopped on a bus. The bus was going too slow, so I got off and ran. My heart was pounding – Tennessee Williams wants to see me. I got to Tennessee’s apartment, and we read through two very emotional scenes and just let it fly. And I got the job.”They opened at the Roundhouse theatre in north London in 1977, with Brosnan’s performance receiving critical acclaim. Williams sent him a telegram stating only: “Thank God for you, my dear boy.”“It was an affirmation that I was on the right path, that I had the talent – a tiny bit of gold in my back pocket,” says Brosnan. “That made me hungry to be an actor. Once I found the world of acting, I clung to it with all my heart. It was liberating.”It was a hugely successful start to a stage career, but Brosnan’s ambitions lay elsewhere. “I always dreamed of the movies,” he says. “The stage, as exhilarating as it was, always terrified me. I wanted to be up on the silver screen.”In 1982, he landed the role of the charming TV detective Remington Steele. He moved to California with his first wife, the Australian actor Cassandra Harris, and their son, Sean, and her two children, Charlotte and Christopher, whom Brosnan later adopted. In 1987, Harris fell ill while filming in India and was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. She died four years later. Charlotte would die of the same disease in 2013.Brosnan turned to the therapeutic qualities of painting while Harris was ill and he has continued ever since. “I started painting in 1987 when my late wife had cancer. I had been painting out of pain, and now the pain sometimes comes through in colour,” he said at the charity auction of his painting of Bob Dylan in 2018. It sold for €1.2m (£1.1m).He found the fortitude to keep acting, too. In 1993, he made it on to the silver screen in Mrs Doubtfire. “At day’s end, you want to look around and hopefully you have a handful of films that you can be proud of participating in. That is definitely one of those movies for me.”He speaks just as fondly of the film’s late star, Robin Williams. “I went into the makeup trailer and there was Robin, sitting in the makeup chair. He had a Hawaiian shirt on and cargo pants, and his hairy arms and hairy legs hanging out. He had the head of Mrs Doubtfire and greeted me: ‘Oh, Pierce! Oh, you look so handsome, oh, give us a kiss.’” (Brosnan’s Mrs Doubtfire impression is impeccable.)At this point, Brosnan had already been offered the role of Bond, but had been obliged to refuse it due to his Remington Steele contract. When he made his Bond debut, in 1995’s Goldeneye, he made it count.His iteration of Bond – sensitive, suave, serious – proved to be a huge success, critically and commercially. Hindsight has bolstered Daniel Craig’s gritty, brutish incarnation of 007 as the best since Connery’s, but Brosnan played the role with a twinkle in the eye and the humour that such a cartoonish character deserves.After his final outing as Bond, Die Another Day in 2002, the producers felt the franchise needed a reboot to stay relevant in a post-911, post-Bourne world. Although Brosnan was keen to do a fifth film, the producers had settled on recasting the role and told him so over the phone in 2004 he would later say he felt he had been “kicked to the kerb”. “There’s no regret,” he says now. “I do not let regret come into my world … It just leads to more misery and more regrets.”“Bond is the gift that keeps giving and has allowed me to have a wonderful career. Once you’re branded as a Bond, it’s with you for ever, so you better make peace with it and you’d better understand that when you walk through those doors and pick up the mantle of playing James Bond.”Since relinquishing the role, Brosnan has generally been reticent about later instalments (“Not my monkey, not my circus,” he said in an interview with Esquire last year). He has, however, said enthusiastically that it is time for a woman to take over the role (“Get out of the way, guys, and put a woman up there!”). Why does he think there is so much resistance to recasting the role of Bond (and other iconic British figures, such as the Doctor in Doctor Who) as a woman or a person of colour?He pauses and slowly taps his kitchen table. “I’m gonna leave that right there,” he says, with a knowing smile and a single, slow shake of the head.Brosnan has had a successful career since leaving the franchise – his performances in The Matador, for which he earned a Golden Globe nomination, and Mamma Mia! stand out – and he was not hampered by the weight of the role he left behind.In 2010, Brosnan starred as a fictional British former prime minister accused of war crimes (yes, he based his performance on Tony Blair, he says) in Roman Polanski’s thriller The Ghost Writer. What does he make of the criticism of those who work with Polanski, given his rape conviction?Brosnan is silent for a full 10 seconds. “Well,” he says, steadily, “I took to the role and to the part in The Ghost Writer because of the work that Roman has done as an artist, as a director. I didn’t let the rest of his life influence my choice. I had to be honest with myself and know that justice had been done, half undone, and went forth as an actor.”Would he make the same decision again today?“I don’t know if, in this climate, I would have made the same decision, the same choice. These are dangerous times and it’s a very toxic world. I don’t know.”When he talks of the “climate”, it is clear he is referring to the world after #MeToo. “It was shocking,” he says of the scale of abuse powerful figures such as Harvey Weinstein got away with for so long. He punctuates every few words with a short pause. “It was absolutely appalling and really has changed the landscape and the workplace for women in Hollywood. It was a mighty fall from grace and one that was really ugly and sad for all parties concerned … that this man should have acquitted himself in such a fashion in the company of young women who were trying to make a career for themselves – it was upsetting to see that behaviour unfold on a daily, weekly basis.”Brosnan has been prolific in recent years. He has four films in production and a fifth awaiting release.“I have no desire to retire,” he says. “I am a man of 67 years now and the parts that will come to me will be the parts of the elder, the parts of the comedic turn. At this point in life, I don’t know what else to do but act and paint.”In the immediate future, there is a pandemic to navigate and a US presidential election on the horizon (Brosnan is a dual citizen of Ireland and the US). More than once in our conversation, Brosnan laments “the disease of racism” and urges people to vote. “I would like to think that the vaccine will come soon for the disease of corona. And I would like to think, also, a vaccine will come for the disease of racism and that we can really come together as communities to respect each other’s religions and beliefs and not to be so judgmental.”He continues: “With change comes struggle. But I have hope in our young people, I have hope in my sons’ generation that they will see the awful, shameful neglect that we’ve paid to each other’s religions, race, the nature of our lives, the environment that we live in. I have the strongest belief that the youth of today will make a big change, will have the courage to get out and vote for the rights of people – not racism and not ignorance and malignant narcissism.”If this sounds like wishful thinking, it is in keeping with Brosnan’s nature. “My eldest son said: ‘Dad is just a dreamer.’ But my dreaming has gotten me this far in life. So I shall continue dreaming and continue being the man I am and doing the best I can, with the tiny bit of gold talent that I’ve got.”Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga is out now on Netflix"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f82f18264b2c11f725677394890cd0af708fe37/127_1010_4482_2689/master/4482.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d2de5bdcc841926d7ba56ea3184ed99","title":"nigel slater recipe pasta peppers and broad beans","story":"Lovely green veg and herbs for a vibrant, healthy pasta supperBring a pan of deep, lightly salted water to the boil.

Does it matter which pasta goes with which sauce? Italian food experts dish out advice• Do you have a culinary dilemma? Email feast@theHow do I choose the right shape of pasta for my sauce? And does it really matter?Maya, LeedsAs Oretta Zanini de Vita writes in Shapes \u0026amp Sauces, “The truth is that almost any kind of pasta goes reasonably well with almost any kind of sauce, and people who get all serious and talk about the importance of correct sauce pairing are probably overthinking.” While I daren’t quibble with such an authority, it’s worth remembering that pasta is the vehicle for the sauce, so there is method behind those winning unions.“A lot of famous pairings came about because of the geometry of the pasta and regional habits, which over time have become entrenched,” says the ’s Rome-based food correspondent Rachel Roddy, who is currently penning The A-Z of Pasta (out next year). “I’ve found a lot more freedom than I expected, as well as hilarity, because choices are sometimes eccentric and subjective.”However, certain characteristics lead to more harmonious combos. Tubes, Roddy says, are “begging for a bean”, while wide noodles are for thick, rich, meaty sauces. Jacob Kenedy, chefpatron of Bocca di Lupo in London, matches chunky pastas with “things with big lumps in”, while finer shapes with more surface area require more delicate sauces. You could argue that carbonara, for example, goes with two very different shapes: Roddy pairs hers with rigatoni instead of the more traditional spaghetti, and this is where personal taste comes in. Then again, as Roddy points out, the “basic tenet of most Italian food is: let’s disagree”.The undisputed joy of Italian food is its sense of origin. “If you serve pesto Genovese with trofie,” Kenedy says, “adding potato and green beans as you cook the pasta, it speaks of a place. It’s nice to get that journey on a plate, especially seeing as we can’t travel at the moment.”Some sauces, however, welcome all. “A well-executed, tomato-based sauce can go with any shape,” says Phil King, head chef at Pophams, where pastries and pasta unite. He slow-cooks Sardinian antonella plum tomatoes with garlic and olive oil, while Roddy boosts hers with chilli and serves it with penne or, even better, garganelli. “The world is full of penne haters, but I’m a great lover of it,” she says. One such person is Kenedy, who prefers rigatoni, which he serves with punchy, meaty sauces of ’nduja, a soft, chilli-spiked sausage.If lockdown shopping has taught us anything, it’s that certain shapes have fallen out of favour (no, I don’t know why orzo and orecchiette were left on the shelves, either). It’s time to expand your horizons, and Kenedy suggests starting with paccheri: “It’s not used enough and is a very versatile shape.” These large tubes from Campania pair just as well with tomato sauce as with seafood such as squid or clams, he says. King recommends looking even farther south, and in particular to the eggless doughs of Sardinia and Sicily – orecchiette, capunti and malloreddus, which, pre-Coronavirus, Pophams served with baked olive tapenade and radicchio.As ever, the quality of the pasta plays a part: “The better the pasta, the more lovely, starchy stuff you get, which thickens and transforms the sauce,” Roddy explains. She rounds up the ends of said packets of pasta “like unruly children” to store in a jar ready to use in soups with beans or potatoes and sausage – just make sure the pasta cooking times are similar. All wayward carbs are welcome round Roddy’s: “There’s no shape I don’t like. I feel like a protective mother, because I love them all.”• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

Six hundred kilometres away, Real Madrid did. An own goal and three penalties, one of them retaken to bring the total to four, delivered a draw that suited no one except the team watching from home. Barcelona are a point behind Real having played a game more.It is a week now since Gerard Piqué said that winning the league would be “very, very difficult” – a second 2-2 draw in four days leaves it seeming impossible now, even if Barcelona win all of their last five games – and on this evidence, they won’t.This is a team in decline, unable to take their last chance to cling on to any lingering hope of winning a league title that in recent years has been theirs. Only a miracle would make it so now, and yet amid an institutional crisis as serious as theirs, perhaps the miracle is that they lasted this long.Quique Setién inherited a team who were top, but most knew that position was precarious. Now, it is gone. That team have gone too, their season virtually brought to a close on a strange night when they were again open at the back and unable to challenge their opponents up front, where a decent start again slipped away from them – something seen so many times before.The beginning suggested a game that would be fun, shifting from one side to the other. Luis Suárez fired off the first shot after 60 seconds and Yannick Carrasco almost scored direct from a free-kick that just evaded Diego Costa and José Marí­a Giménez four minutes later. Barcelona racked up two more even before they took an early lead.Lionel Messi had one shot blocked on the edge of the area and Ivan Rakitic saw another pushed away by Jan Oblak, then a corner bent towards the near post hit the inside of Diego Costa’s leg and found its way into the net. Just 11 minutes had passed and Barcelona, playing a midfield diamond, were moving the ball quickly.For all Barcelona’s recent failures, an empty stadium could not whistle them with that lead, even a full one might not have done, but it did not last long. Soon, Carrasco escaped Piqué on the left and pulled away, leaving the defender flailing on the floor. Carrasco, so rarely seen since his return but so exciting when he is, headed into the area and cut across Arturo Vidal. As he did so, the contact could be seen clearly. It could be heard clearly too, echoing around an empty arena.The referee, had no cause for hesitation. Marc André ter Stegen saved Costa’s penalty, but in the VAR room they had seen him off his line. Atlético got another chance, while Ter Stegen got a card – for an infraction of barely a couple of centimetres. Saúl Ñíguez took it this time, and scored.With that, the balance tilted, although Messi curled a shot that may even have grazed the far post and also saw a free-kick clip off the wall and get pushed away by the goalkeeper. Otherwise, while the passing continued, there was little sign of incision. Suárez was sluggish and Messi was watched. At the other end, Ãngel Correa almost got in, and Barcelona’s vulnerability was revealed again. This is a team – a club – on the edge of the abyss, and it knows it.A safety net was briefly placed below them early in the second half when Semedo dashed into the area on the right and tumbled under the challenge of Felipe. Replays suggested the contact was light, but that was enough. Messi ran fast towards the spot, as if preparing to smash the ball, a fierce rejection of recent frustrations, but instead dinked a gentle penalty floating past Oblak for the 700th goal of his career. He had been waiting three games for it to arrive, an eternity for the Argentinian and for the team that depend on him so completely.The problem is that even he is not enough now this is a team with an inability to hold a lead – underlined when another penalty followed fast. Semedo was again involved, this time at the other end. As he chased Carrasco into the Barcelona area, the Belgian tumbled. He did so having tripped over his own leg the question was whether there had been come contact before that.The referee decided there had been. Semedo didn’t complain, the pause to check was unusually short and Saúl’s penalty squeezed in near the post, via Ter Stegan’s hand. The German, conditioned by the card he had for the first infraction, would not keep it out.A draw was a defeat for Barcelona, and definitive too. Knowing that, they sought to avoid it, at the risk of leaving themselves even more exposed – and with Carrasco there, that was always a tightrope to be walked. Even when he was withdrawn, the risk remained with Thomas Lemar and Vitolo now in place to deliver the final blow. Lemar, suddenly racing away, almost did deep deep into stoppage time.The ball was Barcelona’s and so were the chances, but they were few and fewer still were clear. Suárez was absent, which is often when he appears, but not this time. Nor, indeed, could Messi find a way through the wall bricking off the box. Antoine Griezmann continued to sit it out, not introduced until the 90th minute, his presence virtually pointless. The ball circulated but rarely penetrated, Barcelona’s players held at the perimeter. Only Arturo Vidal found a way to break through, driven by a determination and directness that so few of his companions possess – and that was not enough.Piqué went down under a challenge from Giménez, appealing for yet another penalty, and twice Vidal went close, supplied by the one full-back after the other – first from a right-foot shot just past the post after Semedo’s ball from the right, then with a header from Alba’s cross delivered from the other side.Sergio Busquets then headed over Messi’s free-kick and Ansu Fati was sent on. It felt like a last roll of the dice, and there was no six. Still just 17, like the impressive Riqui Puig, Fati may well be Barcelona’s future. Too many of the men he joined are Barcelona’s past."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/710ed2985f1893d5ea274bcf2c8812ac49e9469e/0_1_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b95543bc313e8766bf69d6a23582402","title":"bruno fernandes manchester united champions league","story":"Bruno Fernandes insisted Manchester United can achieve Champions League football this season after his two goals at Brighton helped his side to stretch their unbeaten run to 15 games.United moved up to fifth place ahead of Wolves on goal difference, but Fernandes said their much-improved defensive performance was key to their current mood of confidence.“We didn’t concede any goal once again,” the man of the match said. “The defenders did an amazing job and the whole team deserved the result. We know if we keep this up we can make it into the Champions League placings.”Fernandes played alongside Paul Pogba in midfield though Nemanja Matic was arguably the most influential United player in that area of the pitch, helping to set up the third goal with an instinctive volleyed pass to set Mason Greenwood free on the left.Nevertheless the Fernandes-Pogba partnership dominated post-match conversations, to the extent that United’s January signing expressed a little annoyance.“Paul is an amazing player but I don’t want to talk too much about me and him,” Fernandes said. “We are a team, and this was a team performance. Talking about me and Paul isn’t fair on the rest of the lads, I would rather talk about everyone.”Ole Gunnar Solskjær was also impressed with the defending after the 10th clean sheet in 15 matches.“To come here and do that, to be able to leave a few players out and take other off after an hour, means it’s been a great night for us,” the United manager said. “The defence gives us a foundation to play from and David de Gea made two tremendous saves when he was called on.“Since the restart everyone has worked really hard, they have all been true to their word and the result is that we genuinely look fitter and stronger at the moment.“I’m not saying this is going to be a special season at Manchester United, we are a bit too far off the pace for that, but I think everyone can see the team is improving and we are still in with a shout in the FA Cup and Europa League as well as the battle for a Champions League place.”Graham Potter, the Brighton manager, accepted defeat philosophically, after his side suffered their first defeat in three games since the restart. “We played a really good side tonight, United are really hard to contain with their movement up front.

But very little of this oil is refined in the country because its four state-owned refineries are dysfunctional or have closed. Instead, international dealers export to Nigeria around 900,000 tonnes a year of low-grade, “dirty” fuel, made in Dutch, Belgian and other European refineries, and hundreds of small-scale artisanal refineries produce large quantities of illegal fuel from oil stolen from the network of oil pipelines that criss-cross the Niger delta.The net result, says international resource watchdog group Stakeholder Democracy Network (SDN) in a new report, is that Nigeria has some of the worst air pollution in the world, with dense clouds of choking soot hanging over gridlocked cities leading to a rise in serious health conditions as well as damaged vehicles.The extreme toxicity of the “official” fuel exported from Europe surprised researchers who took samples of diesel sold in government-licensed filling stations in Port Harcourt and Lagos. They found that on average the fuel exceeded EU pollution limits by as much as 204 times, and by 43 times the level for gasoline.Laboratory analysis also showed that the black market fuel was highly polluting but of a higher quality than the imported diesel and gasoline. The average “unofficial” diesel tested exceeded the level of EU sulphur standards 152 times, and 40 times the level for gasoline.“Our research suggests that Nigeria is having dirty fuel dumped on it that cannot be sold to other countries with higher and better implemented standards. The situation is so bad that the average diesels sampled are of an even lower quality that that produced by artisanal refining camps in the creeks of the Niger delta,” said Florence Kayemba, SDN programme manager.With more than 11m, mostly old, cars imported from Europe and Japan on the roads, and hundreds of thousands of inefficient generators used by households and businesses for electricity, Nigeria ranks fourth in the world for deaths caused by air pollution. It has been estimated that 114,000 people die prematurely from air pollution each year. The air quality in cities like Port Harcourt, Aba, Onitsha and Kaduna has reached crisis levels of pollution in recent years, and there is mounting evidence of rising asthma, lung, heart and respiratory diseases.More than half of developing countries, mainly in Africa and Latin America, still use high-sulphur fuels which have long been illegal to burn in western countries. In Nigeria the practice is encouraged by an opaque fuel subsidy system that keeps prices relatively low at the pumps, but is widely thought to fuel corruption. Refineries in Europe are allowed to make the fuel if countries agree to accept it.The SDN report, part-funded by the UK Foreign Office’s anti-corruption conflict, stability and security fund, calculates that around half the air pollution in Port Harcourt, a city of more than 3 million people, comes from the burning of official and unofficial fuel. The rest comes from nearby gas flaring, other industries, and the burning of rubbish.“The Niger delta already suffers environmental, health and livelihood impacts from decades of oil spill pollution, gas flaring and artisanal refining. This research indicates that it not only experiences the repercussions of producing crude oil, but also in the consumption of dirty official and unofficial fuels,” said the report.“This is even more concerning at a time when Nigeria is facing an outbreak of coronavirus. High levels of pollution and pre-existing respiratory and other health conditions may increase the risk that Covid-19 poses to the health of the population,” said Matthew Halstead of Noctis, which conducted the laboratory research.The SDN report substantiates allegations made in a 2016 Public Eye investigation and a Dutch government report in 2018, that European refineries and commodity brokers were blending crude oil with benzene and other carcinogenic chemicals to create fuels hundreds of times over European pollution limits for the weakly-regulated African market. This was said to be causing significant particulate pollution, damage to vehicles, and adverse health impacts for local populations. Nigeria, along with Togo, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Benin promised in 2017 to stop the imports of “Africa quality” oil products as part of a UN environment programme initiative. But while Ghana has acted, reducing sulphur from 3,000 to 50 parts per million, Nigeria has argued that it needs more time to adapt.However, the recent collapse in oil prices because of Covid-19 means that imported fuel no longer needs to be subsidised and should no longer be a barrier to Nigeria adopting higher standards.The bush refineries are highly dangerous and frequently explode, adding to air, water and soil pollution in the mangrove swamps. But they are an important source of income for communities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a9c44de1e637c82db9a950f0a0ae57ac9939e6f/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=413057466c4c410ac6e6cbfece64791b","title":"my day starts at 3am coronavirus fuels gruelling harare commutes in pictures","story":"Lockdown measures have meant getting to work is fraught with risk for those manning essential services in Zimbabwe’s capital. Three frontline staff reveal how they are coping with erratic buses, exhaustion and dangerIt’s a dark, nippy June morning before dawn and a queue is forming at Glen View 8 bus stop. A dozen or so people, mostly men, are there as 41-year-old Mairevei Mupombwi and her friend arrive at 4.43am carrying fleece blankets. The two women spread cloths on the ground to sit on and cover themselves with their blankets to keep warm. Mupombwi starts dozing.At 5.30am, the queue is now long and a man starts moving around with a permanent marker, writing numbers on people’s hands. Although it is still dark, Mupombwi is number 31 and by 5.44am, the last person in the queue is number 65. Muffled voices can be heard as people try to make conversation through their masks.Moments later, Mupombwi stands up, telling her friend she can feel ants getting into her clothes. She folds her cloth and puts it in her bag but keeps the blanket over her shoulders.As the first rays of the sun appear, there is no sign of the bus. Several buses pass but they’re all going in the direction opposite to central Harare, where she and the rest of the people in the queue want to go. As the sun warms up, she puts her blanket away. The conversation at the bus stop is now getting louder. You can clearly see men and women, young and old, wearing face coverings, others have them but have chosen not to wear them.At 7.10am, the first bus comes and parks a distance away. There is chaos, and the once orderly queue disintegrates as dozens of people run towards it. No one is allowed to board and no one knows exactly what is going on. The people start coming back to the queue saying that no one can get into town as all roads have been sealed off by the police and security forces. They start urging others to go back home.A few minutes later, another bus arrives, and Mupombwi and her friend manage to get on. There is a man at the door, squeezing sanitiser on to passengers’ hands as they board. Once on the bus, passengers observe social distancing.It is now 8.18am and the bus stops at Market Square. Mupombwi gets off and makes her way towards Avondale, where she works in a supermarket. She hails a private car at 8.43am and by 8.48am she arrives at work.Mupombwi says: “My typical day starts at 3.30am where I have to warm my water to bathe and by 4am I am leaving the house. I wait for my friend and we walk together to the bus stop and it takes us about 30 minutes. The bus sometimes comes at 6.45am, and if it is late, it comes after 7am. It’s the same coming home from work. We have to wait in long queues. I get very tired, and during my off-days, I just want to sleep.”Mupombwi’s story is not unique, and many frontline workers in key industries have been affected by the country’s lockdown. They are spending more time travelling to and from work, and being deprived of sleep and quality time with loved ones.Zimbabwe imposed a lockdown on 30 March to curb the spread of Covid-19. Under the current restrictions, only the government-owned and run transport operator Zimbabwe United Passengers Company (Zupco) is permitted to run. Private operators have been banned and directed to register under Zupco if they hope to continue operating.Many workers have been forced to start their day earlier than usual, walking in the dark, sometimes hitchhiking – a dangerous pursuit in Zimbabwe. While travelling, these workers are at risk of contracting the virus as commuter queues rarely observe social distancing.Sandra Chikore, 33, works at a tobacco auction floor and faces the same transport problems as Mupombwi. The tobacco industry is key to the country’s economy, and this is a busy time of year. She rises at 4.35am and by 5.45am she leaves the house, walking close to 2km to get to work on time.“I leave the house while it is still dark and walk along the main road, flagging private cars. My mother’s asked me if I am not afraid for my life. I am, but have no choice. When coming back from work, I have to wait for the bus and sometimes I get home around 8pm, and I am just tired and want to take a bath, eat and sleep. I do not have much time to spend with my son any more.”On the main road at 6.29am, an open truck stops and Chikore hops in with one other passenger, who sits in front. There are three other people in the back, all male. Along the way, the truck stops and two more men jump in. Eighteen minutes later, she arrives in town and walks to Market Square, where she boards a bus. Almost an hour later, at 7.25am, Chikore reaches her workplace.Archiford Zisengwe, 38, works at a petrol station, an essential service. He has been going to work since lockdown began. Zisengwe lives in Harare’s south-west suburb of Waterfalls and works in Groombridge, north of the capital.“There is no transport to take me directly to town so I leave the house at 4am every day and I go to Mbare. From there, I find transport into town and then from there, Groombridge. Some of the places we pass through are very dangerous.”The government recently relaxed social distancing rules and all buses now carry to capacity. However, the move has not alleviated the transport problem and for workers such as Mairevei, Chikore and Zisengwe, they continue to wake up early and spend much of their time waiting in queues.Besides sleep deprivation and losing time with loved ones, many key workers are at risk of infection on public transport due to difficulties with social distancing. They also face the threat of physical attack in a country where violence and crime are rife."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb10c0f998e7d48942fa1603ebcf0dc07ce008c1/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8aee839c9bf2ee7b47d77ef07359d5a2","title":"lockdown easing why the uk is better prepared for a second wave","story":"This Saturday, lockdown measures in England will ease further, with people able to get a pint in a pub, have a haircut and see another household indoors. ’s heath editor, Sarah Boseley, looks at whether another lifting of restrictions might result in a second wave, and if it does, why we are better prepared this time round From this Saturday, the government has said that in England, pubs, restaurants and hairdressers will be able to reopen, two households will be able to meet in any setting with physical distancing measures, and people can enjoy staycations with the reopening of accommodation sites. But with the loosening of restrictions comes fears of a second wave.

This will ensure members’ votes count.”In another sign of the transformation wrought in the party under Starmer’s leadership, it emerged that Seumas Milne, Corbyn’s most senior adviser and an executive director of the party, is leaving his Labour post. Friends believe he is planning to write a book.Asked about Milne’s departure, a Labour spokesman said, “we don’t comment on staffing matters”.Starmer and his allies believe the change to a proportional voting system, which had the support of the Electoral Reform Society, will dilute the power of “slates” of rivals from either wing of the party.But it was fiercely resisted by leftwingers on the NEC, amid simmering tensions in the wake of Starmer’s sacking of Rebecca Long-Bailey last week, over claims of antisemitism.One NEC member, Huda Elmi, from campaign group Momentum, said the NEC had “decided to wage war on member democracy”, calling the change a “stitch-up”.A group of NEC members, including Unite’s assistant general secretary Howard Beckett, are threatening to launch a legal challenge against the decision, which they say constitutes a “rule-change”, and should be put to a full Labour conference for approval.With this year’s gathering cancelled, that could potentially delay any change for more than 12 months.NEC members were also told by the party’s new general secretary, David Evans, that Labour’s membership is 580,000 – as high as the level reported during Corbyn’s leadership.During the meeting, which lasted more than six hours, Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner, were repeatedly challenged by left-wing NEC members over the switch to STV and other fraught issues such as his comments on Black Lives Matter.Starmer’s allies have insisted he was using the word “moment” in the sense of “epoch”, to emphasise the significance of BLM – but some party activists and staff complained that the remarks appeared to suggest it was a passing phase.Challenged about what he meant at the NEC meeting, the Labour leader spoke for four to five minutes, but declined to engage in an argument, NEC sources said. One person present described his response as “sucking the air out of the room”.Separately, 13 NEC members wrote to Starmer and Rayner in advance of the meeting, claiming that the party’s press office had dismissed concerns about potentially discriminatory behaviour by Labour staff revealed in a leaked report.The 860-page internal report, which emerged in April, described what it called an “abundant evidence of a hyper-factional atmosphere prevailing in party HQ in this period, which appears to have affected the expeditious and resolute handling of disciplinary complaints”.It included hundreds of private WhatsApp exchanges between named members of Labour staff, discussing Jeremy Corbyn and his close aides in insulting terms.The report’s contents, and the leak itself, are now being investigated by an independent review, chaired by Martin Forde QC.In a the strongly worded letter, seen by the , the 13 NEC members demanded an explanation of comments released to the website Open Democracy by the party’s press office.The comments appeared to dismiss as “po-faced” concerns about insulting WhatsApp messages revealed in the report, stressing they were private communications.In their letter to Starmer, the NEC members said: “The comment from the Labour party defends racist, sexist and abusive language in the WhatsApp groups, and denies that these messages between then senior party staff display a discriminatory culture within the Labour party.”Signatories included Howard Beckett, Mick Whelan, the secretary general of Aslef, and the NEC’s chair, Andi Fox.A Labour party spokesperson insisted the comments actually formed part of a statement from Labour’s lawyers, responding to claims made by Open Democracy about a specific member of staff, which should not have been sent via the press office.“For the avoidance of doubt, we are clear that the comments that have been quoted do not in any way represent the party’s position in relation to the contents of the leaked report overall and do not prejudge the outcome of those investigations,” the spokesperson said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80e58db433ba9957ebf29c2fa2f0cb160ce5fea9/0_28_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6ded9690663dc2443d486eb82fb7da8","title":"uk coronavirus live local lockdowns doctors pmqs covid 19 latest updates","story":"British Medical Association say swift action on regional spikes ‘is not happening right now’Leicestershire Police Federation Chairman Dave Stokes admitted to Sky News that the local force didn’t know how it was supposed to enforce the local lockdown in Leicester:“We don’t know. And that’s simply because we are waiting for the government strategy and the legislation, which will obviously support us locally about how we are going to police it. It’s a moving picture and I’m sure the information will be fed down but at the moment that clarity isn’t there.”Asked if he sees a role for the police in enforcing a ban on “non-essential travel” in Leicester, Stokes said that enforcement was always a last resort. “What has worked really well in Leicestershire is public engagement. In terms of enforcement, it’s been quite limited. And it has worked,” he said. “The challenge is more about fatigue, officers working long hours. And when I say fatigue, that is each and every officer, there has been a really difficult period working long hours.”A key scientist in the coronavirus response has said there is a window of just a few weeks to resolve “teething problems” in order to have systems up and running for the scheduled full return of schools in England.Imperial College London’s Professor Neil Ferguson, who used to advise the Government, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think we have not a huge amount of time, but a few weeks now to resolve those teething problems and get the data systems in place and get the modes of operation between local and national government working well, because we will desperately need them to work efficiently from September onwards.“I think we need to get the systems working, but I also agree that Public Health England and everybody involved is doing their best. It’s a very complex system to combine data from multiple sources from across the whole country. I don’t think we have any time to lose but I’m not going to sit here and start criticising people at the moment.”Ferguson said infection rates in Bradford and Doncaster were also a cause for concern: “Those are areas, where not as high as Leicester, but they have some of the highest numbers of cases per 100,000 of the population, which is the relevant measure, so they’re clearly of concern.”Leicestershire county council leader Nicholas Rushton has just been on Talk Radio talking about the “very difficult” local lockdown in place in Leicester. He said the government had promised special funding compensate the region for the “substantial” losses caused by the lockdown. But he said he didn’t know how much money that would be. He said:He said he hoped residents would abide by the new lockdown to stop the disease spreading, saying the region had not had particular problems with non-compliance in the past three months.“We haven’t had particularly bad outbreaks of people abusing the regulations in Leicester or Leicestershire to be honest,” he said, “but ultimately the police will have the powers to be able to stop people travelling around.”A scientist advising the Government on the coronavirus response warned that more local lockdowns should be expected, as per the ’s front page splash this morning.Oxford University’s Professor Peter Horby, who chairs the new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group (Nervtag), was asked on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme if the public should brace for more local outbreaks.“Unfortunately I think we should. We’ve seen the epidemic is focal, which is often the case, it’s not the same in all places,” he said.“And we saw that London unfortunately led the way in the UK and now Leicester is unfortunately leading the way and we can expect more of that, so I think there will have to be local responses to local outbreaks.”A group of 1,000 people whose relatives have died due to Covid 19 have strongly criticised Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock for failing to meet them or respond to their letter and formal petition for an immediate public inquiry, sent on 11 June.The group, Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice, advised by Pete Weatherby QC, who acted for 22 families at the 2014-16 inquests into the Hillsborough disaster, argued that the government is under a legal duty to hold a public inquiry, principally because most people’s deaths from the virus will not be fully investigated at inquests.On Monday, the group received a two-line acknowledgement from a Downing Street correspondence officer, which stated: “Your correspondence is receiving attention.”Jo Goodman, who co-founded the group after her father Stuart, 72, died from the virus on 2 April, said:“We are deeply disappointed that the government has not accepted our invitation to meet. It has not even had the courtesy to respond to our petition. Once again, grieving families feel forgotten, with the government refusing to accept any degree of responsibility for mistakes that have been made in its response to the pandemic. The government offers condolences to those who have been bereaved, but while it is unwilling to engage with us, it is very difficult to accept its sympathy.”In their petition, the families argued that there is “a compelling need” for an immediate public inquiry, to learn lessons from the government’s handling of the crisis, and to urgently consider the best measures to improve its response and save more people from dying. Stating that there has been “criticism of the government’s handling of the crisis from all quarters,” the group also argued that when a full public inquiry is held, it must consider key issues including:“The UK has recorded one of the highest Covid-19 death tolls in the world, and yet we have seen very little recognition of the fact that this is a country in mourning,” Goodman said. “As reports came in from Italy, the country was rightly horrified by what it saw, but as similar harrowing scenes have played out in our own country, those of us who have been bereaved feel that our loss has simply been swept under the carpet.”Ryanair’s chief executive Michael O’Leary has been talking on Sky News as it today expands its service to put 150 planes in the sky.He railed against the “stupid” quarantine which requires travellers returning to the UK to isolate for two weeks:It’s irritating, the government has been causing a huge amount of damage with its badly thought out quarantine measures that aren’t a quarantine filling in forms at airports which are then thrown in the bin and not followed up, but are deterring visitors to the UK in July and August. These badly thought-out, badly implemented policies have no effect on Covid are doing untold damage to British tourism, to British jobs and to the wider British economy. We need to get this stupid quarantine lifted.On Friday airlines including Ryanair are taking the UK government to court to challenge the legality of the quarantine and O’Leary said he was “reasonably confident” they would win. “The government has been unable to come up with scientific evidence for this form-filling exercise,” he said.Speaking on BBC Breakfast, the business secretary Alok Sharma twice dodged the question of whether he would extend the furlough scheme beyond October to help the airline sector survive. He said: “The furlough scheme will have been in place for a total of eight months and I think like any international standard, it has been groundbreaking. You talked about the airline sector specifically: of course, as you know, work is going on in terms air bridges and later in the week I hope we will be able to set out some of those low-risk countries so that when people return from these countries they will not be faced with quarantine.”Asked whether there would be localised extra support for businesses and workers in Leicester during the city’s local lockdown, Sharma seemed to suggest not, harking back instead to earlier business grants and the national furlough scheme:Anyone in Leicester will be incredibly disappointed and in fact worried about having to go back into lockdown and I know that businesses will be incredibly concerned as well. In terms of support to businesses in Leicester, we have provided over 5,900 businesses — small businesses — with grants to the value of £68m. We have also ensured that 40,000 jobs have been protected through the Job Retention Scheme and that is going to continue. Presenter Louise Minchin also extracted from Sharma that rarest of things in Westminster — an apology — after he gave out incorrect testing figures on the programme last week. He had said 240,000 people had been tested for Covid-19 on Monday 22 June. In fact, he accepted, it was the number of tests:I was wrong and I apologise for that. It was an inadvertent mistake. Up to 5,000 jobs are under threat at Upper Crust and Caffe Ritazza owner SSP amid a shake-up following plunging passengers numbers at railway stations and airports due to the coronavirus pandemic, my colleague Kalyeena Makortoff reports.The group warned it expects to open only around a fifth of its sites in the UK by the autumn as travel is set to remain at very low levels amid the Covid-19 crisis.It has launched a consultation on a restructure to “simplify and reshape” the business in the face of the pandemic, which it said could lead to more than half of its 9,000-strong peak season workforce being axed.The group said head office and UK staff would be affected by the cuts.Chief executive Simon Smith said: “In the UK the pace of the recovery continues to be slow. In response to this, we are now taking further action to protect the business and create the right base from which to rebuild our operations. Regrettably, we are starting a collective consultation which will affect our UK colleagues.“These are extremely difficult decisions, and our main priority will be to conduct the process carefully and fairly.”As pubs in England get set to reopen on Saturday (apart from in Leicester), the Royal College of Emergency Medicine has warned that medics are “bracing” themselves for the reopening of pubs during the coronavirus crisis.“We’re bracing ourselves, I think would be a fair way to say it. It actually is quite serious, we have emergency departments having to work in a very different way than they did before because we have to keep vulnerable patients safe so we can’t have crowded emergency departments.What we can’t do is have a department that gets overwhelmed by people who are injured because they have got themselves into a fight, they have fallen off something, they have drunk so much that they actually need the health service’s help.People have been standing at doorways clapping the NHS, well more important than clapping the NHS is using the resources responsibly and anybody who goes out and gets so drunk that they need an ambulance and they need to come to an emergency department is not supporting the NHS.”Good morning. I’m Helen Pidd and I will be keeping the live blog warm until Andrew Sparrow clocks in later this morning.It is day two of the UK’s first local lockdown in Leicester, with leading doctors urging the government to give councils accurate and up-to-date data to manage localised spikes, 101 days after the national lockdown.The British Medical Association (BMA) said local authorities need “timely, comprehensive and reliable” information to all those involved in the management of new cases at a local level.The mayor of Leicester has complained that he only received a full picture of local infection patterns last Thursday. Until then, the government had not shared detailed results of so-called “pillar 2” tests conducted at pop-up drive-through testing centres and completed via post.The BMA also called for clarity about how regional spikes will be managed in the future.Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the BMA Council, said: The prime minister has talked about a ‘whack a mole’ strategy to tackle local outbreaks, but this is no use if the people leading the response on the ground – be they public health teams or local leaders – are not given the most accurate up-to-date data possible.This is crucial to allow swift action and to protect lives and the health service, and something that is not happening right now. This is all the more important given that the ‘world-leading’ test and trace app is not in place, meaning local leaders and teams armed with up-to-date information will be vital in containing spread of outbreaks.Ahead of further lockdown restrictions being eased at the weekend, the BMA made a series of demands from the government.These include the use of set “metric trigger points” at which action will be taken to reintroduce local and national restrictions, which would take into consideration the regional reproductive rate – known as the R rate – as well as the level of infections in communities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce1c8e21d95fe9bef9eed866bbbcce4d3951071f/97_0_1480_889/master/1480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03ea3f318dcde7ebbbed903e6ca0319e","title":"ten years of the sun in one hour nasa releases mesmerising space film","story":"The space agency gathered 425 million high-resolution images of the sun, which have now been stitched together to form the videoNasa has released a mesmerising timelapse video of the sun that condenses an entire solar cycle into an hour of footage, using images of the star taken every hour continuously over a decade.Nasa’s Solar Dynamics Observatory has gathered 425 million high-resolution images of the sun, from its launch in February 2010 until June this year, which have now been stitched together to form the video.While the 20 million gigabytes of picture data captured over the decade have contributed to “countless new discoveries about the workings” of the sun, according to Nasa, the images have now been arranged into a 61-minute video showing events including transiting planets and eruptions.The film shows the major changes the sun undergoes during a solar cycle, an approximately 11-year period which sees the sun’s north and south poles flip, and the emergence of sunspots as a result of gas altering the star’s magnetic fields.Every second of the 61-minute video represents images taken over a single day, with the first frame showing the sun on 2 June 2010, and the last frame captured on 1 June 2020.With what Nasa describes as a “triad of instruments”, the SDO took a picture of the sun every 0.75 seconds on average, including the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly instrument that captured images “every 12 seconds at 10 different wavelengths of light”.However, not every image the SDO has taken has been used in the timelapse video. Only images taken at one wavelength, 17.1 nanometres, were used in the video, with the extreme ultraviolet wavelength of the images allowing for the sun’s golden yellow, outermost atmospheric layer – the corona – to be visible.Nasa commissioned German musician Lars Leonhard to compose Solar Observe to accompany the video.In a statement released with the video, Nasa explained why there were a few blank frames in the video and the infrequent changes of focus away from the sun.“While SDO has kept an unblinking eye pointed toward the sun, there have been a few moments it missed,” it said. “The dark frames in the video are caused by Earth or the moon eclipsing SDO as they pass between the spacecraft and the sun.”Nasa also explained that a “longer blackout” in the footage in 2016 was caused by a temporary AIA instrument issue that took a week to fix.“The images where the Sun is off-centre were observed when SDO was calibrating its instruments,” Nasa said.The SDO mission is expected to continue observing the sun until 2030."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b78963d519bd121e8beb9e5e6a7db6e46f19155/0_30_6428_3858/master/6428.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57d3037245fa6daaf30eb5b318385ed7","title":"nearly half of black uk households are living in poverty","story":"Campaigners found that 100,000 more people were living in poverty in 2018-19 compared with the previous yearBlack and minority ethnic (BAME) households in the UK are over twice as likely to live in poverty as their white counterparts, leaving them disproportionately exposed to job losses and pay cuts caused by the coronavirus pandemic, an independent study has revealed.The latest annual report by the Social Metrics Commission found that nearly half of Black African Caribbean households were in poverty, compared with just under one in five white families, while BAME families as a whole were between two and three times as likely to be in persistent poverty than white households.“With the economic and social impacts of the coronavirus likely to last long after the health crisis is over, these results show how far we have to go to improve the lives of the most disadvantaged in society,” said the commission’s chair, the Conservative peer Philippa Stroud.Stroud said more work was urgently needed to understand why BAME households were disproportionately likely to live in poverty, and what solutions would drive improvements, from skills and work opportunities to housing. “We should be looking to level up for the BAME community,” she said.The commission said BAME households were more likely to be in deep poverty than white families – around one in 10 adults from a Black British, Pakistani, Bangladeshi or mixed background were unemployed, compared with one in 25 white British people – and so were more likely to suffer heightened financial exposure to the pandemic.Zubaida Haque, interim director of race equality think tank the Runnymede Trust, said Covid-19 had disproportionately hit BAME families both in health terms and income. “I agree with Baroness Stroud that we should level up – and that means short-term increases to universal credit and child benefit to lift people out of poverty and in-work poverty, and long-term solutions around affordable housing and skills.”“These impacts on those already in poverty and just above the poverty line threaten to increase the number of people in poverty and deepen poverty for those already experiencing it,” the commission said.Helen Barnard, acting director of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and a member of the commission, said: “For a society that values compassion and justice, news that the proportion of people locked in deep poverty has increased over the last 20 years must act as wake-up call. That the pandemic has also hit those living in deep poverty hardest only sharpens the need for urgent action.”Sam Royston, director of policy and research at the Children’s Society, said: “These new figures – which show that nearly a third of people in poverty are living on less than half what they would need simply to get above the poverty line – should appal us all.”The Social Metrics Commission was set up in 2016 to develop a new way of measuring poverty. Its expert commissioners are drawn from across the political spectrum, academia and thinktanks, including the Institute for Fiscal Studies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c53fd1f5df828fb97a9fa5d408b48c0258653fd/0_301_3530_2119/master/3530.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba02057d761355131e656c9e6edb8a73","title":"psychiatrists urge new leader to rid profession of institutional racism","story":"Letter signed by over 100 UK psychiatrists says training and practice guides must changeMore than 100 UK psychiatrists have written to their representative body urging it to root out institutional racism and a colonial mentality in the profession.In an open letter to the new president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, Dr Adrian James, who starts in the role on Wednesday, the members say there is a “once-in-a-generation opportunity to put psychiatry at the forefront in tackling systemic racism”.They write: “We share a history with psychology and psychotherapy of not just ignoring the effects of discrimination, but painting other cultures as psychologically primitive and casting their approaches to understanding distress as backward superstitions.“For the Royal College of Psychiatrists to be able to advocate on behalf of those most marginalised in our society, it must first put its house in order and root out all examples of institutional racism and colonial mentality in its training curricula and various practice guidelines.”The letter refers to the collusion of psychiatry in eugenic mass murder in Nazi Germany and the labelling of civil rights protesters and political dissidents as psychotic. But there are also more modern examples, including what Dr Sami Timimi, a signatory and visiting professor at the University of Lincoln and fellow of the college, highlighted as “perceptions of black dangerousness”.The stereotype has been much discussed in relation to law enforcement, especially in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests, which began over the US police killing of George Floyd, but Timimi said it also existed in mental health services.“That is still very prevalent in our culture and therefore – not surprisingly – it’s very prevalent in the way we apply our psychiatric technologies,” he said. “So what we see is the label of schizophrenia, which is meant to be the worst type of psychosis that you can have, and is meant to be something with a very poor outlook, it’s disproportionately applied to black people, particularly black men.”He also cited the fact that black people in England were four times more likely than white people to be detained under the Mental Health Act.As another example, he said that when he started his first consultant job in an area of east London with a large Muslim population, a senior clinician told him the best they could do for the young Asian women they were seeing with mental health issues was “to save them from their culture”.Timimi said that while the police had been talking about institutional racism since the MacPherson report after the murder of Stephen Lawrence, the conversation had been lacking in the field of mental health. He said the training curriculum was not overtly racist, but defined what is normal “through the standards of the dominant culture”, which he said was also being exported overseas.James acknowledged ongoing institutional racism in the NHS and announced two presidential leads – Dr Lade Smith and Dr Raj Mohan – to develop a race equality action plan.Mohan said: “Systemic racism is something we can overcome with understanding and action. We want to see an end to people being detained or sectioned because they don’t get help until they’re in crisis. That means tackling social inequalities and stigma in society and providing culturally sensitive services, designed around the needs of local communities.”The signatories want James to go further and set up an independent commission containing service users and experts to examine all training curricula and practice guidelines that the college produces."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d6a746fe290b01dab8075661b95edb2b8b3b5ae/1_0_2416_1451/master/2416.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d5b606a13059f2c65b0543fafb74349","title":"life in the amber zone a view of project restart","story":" photographer  Tom Jenkins has documented the Premier League since its restart in June. Here, he looks back on the experience of shooting matches in empty grounds amid strict Covid-19 precautionsClick on each image for more informationThat bloody bird has been putting me off all game. High up in the stand above me at Carrow Road, a seagull is roosting and making a right old racket. It seems to be distracting the Norwich defence too, as Nathan Redmond strolls through and scores to put Southampton 3-0 up. There’s a brief cheer and a polite round of applause from a couple of Saints staff members in the stand before Redmond performs a Black Power salute. It’s all very surreal. Black Lives Matter meets Behind Closed Doors football. Welcome to the world of Project Restart, the Covid-19 version of the Premier League.For the last two weeks I have been lucky enough to be one of the chosen few to be let in to see the resumption of top-class football in England. When normally I could be one of between 20 to 50 photographers attending these matches, now it’s just a maximum of 10. Current rules state there must be no more than 300 people inside the ground at any one time.My first game back was the one that launched the resumption, at Aston Villa as they faced Sheffield United. All attendees at matches are required to have a temperature check before accreditation is given. In a building in the main car park I’m stood on a designated spot and look at a screen, like a high-tech speak-your-weight machine. This equipment deems me safe and my pass is handed over. Rumour has it that Manchester City have splashed out on an even flashier thermometerand a scanner operated by a real nurse. At the other grounds I’ve subsequently been to, the temperature check is performed with a little white plastic gun to the forehead. At Spurs, before their game v West Ham, it’s boiling hot. To make matters worse the man with the gun is waiting at the top of a flight of stairs and I’m carrying a ton of gear up there. My fingers are crossed as the gun points at my red, sweaty temple.Every ground is ided into three zones: green, amber and red. Roughly speaking, green is the immediate vicinity outside the stadium, amber inside the ground, red on the pitch and the tunnel area. Only players and club officials, those who are regularly tested, get into the red zone. I am amber. Before every game I’m sent a health declaration form to sign along with safety protocols to read. These vary enormously from club to club but the most substantial and well organised is definitely Liverpool’s, courtesy of their safety officer, Mr Stan Tickle.As I go into the first match at Villa, I look up at a big screen. “Face coverings must be worn at all times” it declares. I’m led to my allotted spot by a couple of kind, middle-aged stewards who are wearing their claret and blue masks as chin warmers. “You can’t move from there” they tell me “and you must wear your mask at all times”. “No problem,” I say as Jamie Redknapp brushes past me looking very dapper in a navy suit but mask-free. A member of ground-staff comes to disinfect the corner flag near me. As I pick up my camera, he is told by a colleague “put your mask on properly, you’re having your picture taken”.The atmosphere inside all the grounds is very strange and eerie. These are stadia I know so well yet it all seems unfamiliar. It’s a real sensory scramble, not only visually but also aurally. I was at Goodison Park for the Everton v Liverpool match, sat in the front row of the Gwladys Street End. Normally a febrile atmosphere emanates from the home fans in that stand, scorn pouring down on anything red. Around me this time are acres of tarpaulin sheets adorned with faces of the Everton faithful. A couple of metres away sits John Powell, Liverpool’s official photographer. “Lovely isn’t it?” he jokes.With 10 minutes left, and the game tied 0-0, Tom Davies hits the inside of the post and Everton are denied a famous winner. It is such a dramatic moment but all I can hear, apart from a couple of expletives from players, are the mellow tunes of a jazz saxophonist playing Baker Street by Gerry Rafferty from outside the ground. After a few matches I start to get used to the noise of these games. You can hear everything the players, coaches and referees say – it’s quite illuminating. There is so much shouting from the players I begin to wonder how they have the energy to run around. It takes me back to park football, refreshing to hear that multi-millionaires can still say such well-known football phrases as “Man on”, “Push Up”, “Keeper’s ball” or “Pull your finger out” although the last one did include a swear word as well.It’s fascinating to see how clubs have adapted to the rules laid down by the Premier League and government health advisers. Goodison Park’s notoriously tight tunnel means the away team change in a portable building in the car park, while at Tottenham the home team have shifted their changing room to the other side of the ground where the huge, expansive NFL rooms are situated. It’s also meant a lot more work for ground-staff, as they have disinfecting duties with balls, corner flags and goalposts.At Norwich they have an old-fashioned bucket of Dettol to drop balls into, while at Spurs they have armed their staff with Ghostbusters-style backpacks to spray down the posts. Even with all these safety requirements, things can go slightly awry. I was at Watford, positioned near the sideline where the substitutes were warming up. In the stand behind the dugouts the subs had carefully distanced seats to sit in, but as they started to stretch their limbs they gathered in a tight bunch, completely blocking my view of the game. One Watford player put his leg onto the board right by my camera, looked at me in my mask a couple of feet away, realised he was far too close to an amber zone non-tester, and moved away sharpish. After talking to his fellow subs, they all scarpered giving me a lovely clear view again.At Anfield last week, just after Liverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold arched that beautiful free-kick into the top of the Crystal Palace net, I could clearly hear a commentator eagerly describing the goal, even though he was high up in the Centenary Stand, probably a hundred yards away. It made me think what that stadium would have been like if the crowd had been there and I felt sad for them, deprived of seeing a moment like that in the flesh.I hope that before too long they will back and that the abnormality of behind-closed-doors football will soon be consigned to history."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff6e67acc03717a1b8fd3541222f99647b3facfa/145_128_2542_1525/master/2542.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d77c120b2d3a24265521acaa1cc37821","title":"swing low sweet chariot makes me feel uncomfortable englands maro itoje","story":"Maro Itoje has revealed the England rugby anthem Swing Low, Sweet Chariot makes him feel “uncomfortable” but he does not believe supporters should be banned from singing it at Twickenham.This month the  revealed the Rugby Football Union was conducting a review of the song – originally an American slave spiritual – conceding that many supporters were unaware of its roots.A ban on supporters singing the song would be practically impossible to enforce but the RFU is consulting with players and fans and intends to educate Twickenham goers as to its origins. The RFU’s chief executive, Bill Sweeney, has said he no longer sings the song but would not consider supporters who do to be racist. The union is also likely to rethink its marketing and branding campaign that uses the song’s lyrics, which are visible all over Twickenham.It is believed the song was first sung at Twickenham when Martin “Chariots” Offiah featured at the 1987 Middlesex Sevens tournament. In 1988 it became popular among England supporters when Chris Oti scored a hat-trick against Ireland. The song’s origins are rooted in US slavery, however, and it is believed to have been written by the American slave Wallace Willis around the 1860s.Itoje told the BBC’s Today programme: “The context in which it was originally sung was with African American iniduals to try and give them strength, give them hope. What makes me uncomfortable was its introduction with it being sung for Martin Offiah, it being sung for Chris Oti, who are obviously two black players that played the game at Twickenham. It is a great opportunity to educate people about the context of that song.“I am not too sure if banning works because you can’t regulate what comes out of people’s mouths but I think people should be educated about the background of the song and it will be down to any inidual if they want to sing it or not.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c85d7a0c35c0412a3b5e53778da347261ed07bbe/0_139_4748_2848/master/4748.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=beb59d68c2f939c893d1311f959e849a","title":"danny sapani we must teach the truth about british history","story":"The actor, who stars in the National Theatre’s stream of Les Blancs, says schools must acknowledge the damage done by colonialism – to strengthen the bonds of a multicultural societyIt is a historical play about colonial oppression and the struggle for African independence but is it also a political play for now?Yes it is. I think most of our history needs to be revised, and that’s just what Lorraine Hansberry did in this play. There are so many aspects of history she talks about in Les Blancs that have still not been acknowledged, that are not common knowledge and that have not been apologised for. As a result, aspects of colonial things in everyday life remain. Even the fact that we are talking about “black lives matter” is a hangover from imperialist thinking when black lives didn’t matter.We need to educate our children about British history it can’t just be about the Fire of London, the Tudors and the great things Britain has done. Let’s talk about the things that have not been great, too. This history explains why we have a multicultural Britain now it is a result of what happened in the past.I feel there has to be an absolute drive to educate ourselves and each other about the truth of our history and the stories that did not seem relevant to a world where George Floyd could be killed in cold blood, but are relevant in the new world we will build together.Have you been to any of the Black Lives Matter protests?I have been around the local protest with my children, wearing masks and social distancing.

But is Belfast’s sharp-tongued comedy circuit becoming less hostile to outsiders?Patrick Kielty’s first Belfast standup set won him a keg of beer. It was freshers’ week 1989 at Queen’s University and his housemates had nominated him for a talent competition. As well as the booze, he earned a termly gig on campus, but across Belfast comedy barely existed.Until, that is, BBC producer Jackie Hamilton approached him with an idea: The Empire Laughs Back, the city’s first dedicated comedy night. “There was no scene, so we decided to make it,” Kielty says.The venue, the Belfast Empire, was in a “beautiful sweet spot” on a neutral street between loyalist and nationalist parts of town. “When we set the comedy club up it was 1992, the ceasefire wasn’t until 1994, so there was an edge to it,” Kielty says. “The very first night, we weren’t sure how many people would turn up – 400 queued around the corner.”Hamilton brought acts from London – big names such as Jeremy Hardy and Lee Evans – but Kielty became the weekly compere. With barely 15 minutes of material, the news offered inspiration: “It led to my style being much more satirical and political.”In October 1992, the Shankill bombing and Greysteel massacre forced Belfast to shut down. But the Empire remained open. “The place was packed. The thirst to have somebody talk about what was going on was really great,” Kielty says.The Empire set the tone for Belfast standup, unleashing a desire for comedy that gave Northern Ireland a voice, with Kielty at the heart. When Colin Murphy, who began standup in 1993, took over as MC at the Empire, he remembers the struggle to win over the crowd: “They didn’t come to see the acts, they came to see Paddy. The applause would stop before you got to the microphone when they realised you weren’t Paddy.”Murphy was one of only a few Belfast standups at that time. “It wasn’t a culture that existed,” he says. “There was nowhere to do it.”The Empire Laughs Back is still going strong and is supplemented by open mics, monthly gigs led by inidual comedians, and regular shows at arts venues, including the Black Box, and bars such as the Sunflower and Pug Uglys.“The scene here has gotten quite good,” says Belfast comic Teresa Livingstone. “There’s certainly a lot more people doing it.”A former music teacher, Livingstone started comedy seven years ago and began writing songs in character as a woman at the end of a long night out. She was one of the few Belfast acts moving away from traditional standup.Some of them skipped open mics entirely. Colin Geddis’s wannabe ultimate fighter, Barry the Blender, and Paddy Raff’s posh caricature, Nigel, gained fans online. Both recently sold out shows at Belfast’s SSE Arena.Livingstone has also seen a shift away from talking about sectarianism: “People are like, ‘Right, that’s never going away, but what else is there?’ They’re able to talk more about themselves.”But Belfast audiences are still politically astute. “It’s the only place where you could do a joke about a local councillor and most of the room would get it,” says standup Sarah Firby.“Audiences here still like local stuff,” says Murphy, who now mostly tours theatres and is a stalwart of panel show The Blame Game. “It doesn’t necessarily mean it has to be about politics, just something about us, because we don’t see it anywhere else. Until Derry Girls, you didn’t hear our accents making jokes on TV.”That desire to see yourself reflected led Firby to set up Coven Comedy Club in 2019, a monthly gig passing the mic to women and LGBTQ comedians. Although Belfast has produced standups such as Nuala McKeever and Mary Flanagan, its scene is still male-dominated. “A lot of women and queer people didn’t feel there was much for them,” Firby says. “If you’ve got more Connors on the bill than women, you’re not hearing a huge amount of variety.”For a while, says Kielty, “if you didn’t have something to say about what was going on in Northern Ireland, people didn’t want to hear it. We focused life into this binary prism. The fact that that prism is disappearing means the full breadth of comedy can be developed.”Audience response to Coven has been “amazing”, Firby says. She’s now planning workshops to encourage more women and LGBTQ people to try standup. “Whenever you’re talking about inclusivity, people go, ‘There aren’t any women comedians.’ I thought I’d try to bring other people up and create an environment where they feel confident.”Across the growing variety of comedy, there are still common themes. “Slagging each other off is almost a way of communicating here,” says Livingstone. “It’s taken in good humour, but there’s a real sarcastic, ‘Aye, brilliant, well done.’”Murphy says: “There is a viciousness here that to the outsider can be frightening and a familiarity with people we don’t know. We, within minutes, will become overly familiar to the level that we think we can roast someone.”In the 90s, that came from audiences, too. “The Belfast audience wanted to join in,” Murphy says. “The Empire used to be infamous – in England, people were terrified of coming here.”There’s also been a willingness to embrace darkness. “Even Roy Walker,” says Murphy. “In his material there were undertones of doom.”When live comedy starts again, Kielty hopes we’ll hear more from Belfast comics. “I’d like to see more Belfast performers getting a crack at it across the UK,” he says. “There are comedic stories that the rest of the country needs to hear – bigger social issues that are currently Northern Irish stories. There is a youth and an energy in that city. The best days are still ahead.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de7f4311a67ef9aa773d1935f8f978ca06c4c3a8/155_37_2641_1585/master/2641.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8272305bef1f80af0342a5b04c5e02f","title":"hamilton review disney plus lin manuel miranda","story":"Disney+Lin-Manuel Miranda’s musical is smart, witty, funky and leaves us reflecting on America’s past and futureHamilton was hailed as revolutionary theatre in 2015, with its rapping 18th-century statesmen, its funky, feelgood hip-hop and a cast predominantly comprising actors of colour. It went on to conquer Broadway and West End audiences. How does that original Broadway staging fare on the flat screen, streamed by Disney+ in the midst of lockdown?It spoke to the moment then, and it speaks to us now, say director Thomas Kail and Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator and star, in their short, socially distanced preamble to this highly anticipated film of the show. “We are all thinking about what it means to be American,” they add. Even if these words are not in direct reference to the America of the past few weeks, with its upsurge of anti-racist protest, their story of the Caribbean-born immigrant hero and founding father of the US, Alexander Hamilton, speaks to us obliquely of all that remains neglected in America’s history while shifting the parameters at the same time.Its rousing opening scenes remind us of that great American ideal of equality and speaks of slavery and civil rights in the 18th century. “I never thought I’d live past 20. Where I come from, some get half as many,” sings Hamilton at the start, and his words echo the dangerous fate that awaits so many of America’s black or immigrant underclass now, as debate around Black Lives Matter protests has highlighted.Even more remarkably, it keeps all the power of a live performance while simultaneously adding a filmic pizzazz including some breathtaking aerial shots. There is extraordinary direction – again under Kail – so that the cameras capture the mise en scène of theatre without losing any of the closeup intimacy of film.Miranda’s lead performance brims with understated brilliance. Every actor alongside him performs with just as much conviction though some with more swagger: Phillipa Soo is a demure Eliza Hamilton until she breaks out, gloriously, into beat-boxing Daveed Diggs is a funny, scrappy Thomas Jefferson with his edgy raps and his attitude Renée Elise Goldsberry is a heartfelt Angelica Schuyler, with a sensational, and soulful, singing voice to boot.The film keeps all the energy of the stage, from the large-scale war scenes to the political power battles which are staged as rap battles. But it also takes us into tight shots of Angelica as she sings of her secret love for Hamilton, or of King George (Jonathan Groff), the camera so close we can see the spittle of his anger over the loss of his American colony.There are profanities and urban speak, but it never sounds brash or uncouth, and the period costume (breeches for men, Gone With the Wind style dresses for women) has an edge of modernity to it. All its radicalism comes wrapped in fantastically infectious songs, stirringly delivered, and the lack of book is no hindrance to the complications in its plot.“It takes on a different meaning when you see black and brown performers telling the origin story of our country,” says Miranda, and he is right in that these performers remind us of the contribution of immigrants like Hamilton to American history. But more than this, it is the intelligence in the lyrics, and the clever subversions of the “period drama” form that make this such a joyous musical to watch.It has political intrigue, personal tragedy, a sex scandal and lightning changes of mood that sweep us along at speed. Best of all is the wit that sits neatly alongside its politics: “Immigrants, we get the job done”, says one character archly, and the audience laughs knowingly.“What is a legacy?” says Hamilton, in the heart-stopping last moments, and the film leaves us reflecting on America’s.

Both well-established in the art market, the couple have transformed the castle grounds into a sculpture park featuring works by German and international artists, such as Tony Cragg, Maria Loboda, Dan Graham, Hans Arp, and Carsten Nicolai.It’s a bold, perhaps even radical, new attraction for this sleepy part of the Brandenburg region, around 25km north-west of Berlin, and an ideal post-lockdown cultural destination. Alongside the sculpture park, the couple have created a restaurant with a rustic, intimate interior, a large patio with an outdoor kitchen and a quaint wagon selling artisanal ice-cream. A farm shop sells handmade crockery, art books, cookbooks and local produce perfect for on-site picnics. An events programme includes open-air film screenings, outdoor yoga classes, concerts and lectures.“If someone had told me 18 months ago that I would be doing all this, and having this conversation with you right now, I would have said they were crazy,” says Loretta as she leads me through the restaurant and into the park. “We bought it from a friend, with no real intention of creating a sculpture park. But we wanted to maintain the house as the centre of a dynamic entity rather than a scenic backdrop. Since there’s no big agriculture here any more, and we are not farmers, art was the answer.”The baroque main building, which now serves as a private home for the couple and their four children, is said to have been designed by fabulously named Georg Wenceslas von Knobelsdorff, one of Frederick the Great’s favoured architects. It was constructed in the early 1740s for the von Redern family, generations of whom lived here until the 1880s. The vicissitudes of 20th-century Germany saw it used as a hospital and a DDR kindergarten.The garden is the estate’s pièce de résistance, though. Originally designed in the English style popular at the time, it now combines landscaped and wilded sections dotted with fruit trees (cherries, plums, apples), as well as pendulous willows, proud (and fragrant) linden trees – and more than 20 international artworks placed up trees, in ponds, and semi-hidden within thickets.It’s a fun way to enjoy art, and some pieces are additionally interactive, such as Dan Graham’s 2018 Play Pen for Play Pals, which combines stainless steel, glass and a two-way mirror to allow the viewer to merge, ghost-like, with the surroundings, and Carsten Nicolai’s cast-iron sound installation Echo, which mimics a meditation temple, encouraging visitors to thump their chests and listen for the reverberation from different places.A stainless steel corkscrew-style sculpture in a field turns out to be a 2012 work by Tony Cragg, whose own sculpture park near Wuppertal is perhaps the only similar project to this one in Germany. A small field of aluminium flowers that shimmy and chime with the wind and rain is by Berlin-based Japanese artist Toshihiko Mitsuya, who comes each week to clip the grass and plant new flowers. A much-darker note is struck by Polish artist Monika Sosnowska’s Stairs 2019, a crumpled black staircase that lies in the grass like a malevolent bug.But overall the park is a welcoming and graceful place, embellished with strategically placed Sissinghurst benches (with graceful arched backs), hammocks strung between trees, and a circular hedged area with a small pond and several day beds.“It’s about creating a space where art has no barrier,” says Loretta. “It’s not a white cube. It’s something where nature and art merges and families can come and enjoy.” Since opening, the site has drawn hundreds of visitors, including many families, a positive surprise for the owners, especially during these difficult times. On the way out, I spy another artwork rising from the lake – a neon sign by Martin Creed that reads Everything Is Going To Be Alright. Under normal circumstances it might seem a little trite, but as the world continues to grapple with a pandemic, it feels strangely comforting.• The Sculpture and Nature exhibition runs until 31 October.

Of Victoria’s cases, only three were from hotel quarantine, with community transmission becoming a growing concern in the state over the past fortnight. The source of 42 of Victoria’s newest cases remains under investigation.The Victorian premier Daniel Andrews told reporters on Wednesday that the work of public health officials door-knocking the most affected suburbs and offering people free testing was now a key part of the state’s strategy to bring the spread under control.“I can report to you that as of last night we had knocked on some 54,000 doors in those high-risk suburbs and postcodes offering advice, testing information and in some cases the self-administering test kits where people can take the test and it can be collected at a later point,” he said. “There will be further door-knocking, quite intensive door-knocking and there will be an update to this end each and every day.”Maidstone and Broadmeadows are the focus of this door-knocking on Wednesday, with and Albanvale and Brunswick West to be targeted on Thursday. Twelve new testing sites will be established across the 10 hotspot postcodes, which include 36 suburbs, facing lockdown.“In terms of those lockdown suburbs I again make the point I know and understand that this will be deeply inconvenient,” Andrews said. “It will be frustrating, it will be very challenging. We will be there to support each and every business that’s impacted, not just with within the zone but also the tourism businesses where there will be bookings that will have to be cancelled because of these lockdowns.”He said the prime minister, Scott Morrison, supported the measures, including the ersion of international flights to other states after breaches were identified in infection control in Victoria’s hotel quarantine program. Further announcements were expected on Wednesday afternoon about support for affected businesses, as well as how the lockdowns will be enforced.“Ultimately, if I didn’t shut down those postcodes I’d be shutting down all postcodes and I don’t think we want to get to that point,” Andrews said. “We all want to work hard, literally day and night to try and avoid that sort of an outcome.”It comes as the NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, announced any Victorian from one of the hotspot suburbs entering NSW faces fines of up to $11,000 or six months’ jail. Residents from his state face the same penalties if they go to one of the 36 suburbs.“Victorians living in virus hotspots have to take the Victorian and NSW health orders seriously and should be very aware that NSW will impose additional penalties if they seek to leave their suburbs to enter NSW,” he said.NSW has further eased its social distancing restrictions from Wednesday, with limits on attendance for funerals, weddings, places of worship and community sport relaxed as long as there is no more than one person for every 4 sq m of space.Outdoor gatherings are still restricted to 20 people but community sport with a Covid-19 safety plan can have up to 500 participants. Funerals, weddings and church services may have the maximum number of people allowed on the premises, with one person for every 4 square metres. All businesses can now open and operate under the same principle.The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, reiterated on Wednesday that the states borders were reopening from 10 July except to Victorians.Of the new cases identified in Victoria overnight, five additional staff members have been linked to the outbreak at Al Taqwa College in Truganina, taking the total to eight staff at the school. The cases are linked to previous outbreaks in Sunshine West and Truganina.Two new cases are part of the Stamford Plaza Hotel outbreak where returned travellers are being kept in quarantine, taking the total to 31. One is a security guard in quarantine and the other is a household contact of a confirmed case. On Tuesday Andrews said a number of Victoria’s cases through late May and early June had been linked through genomic testing to an infection control breach in the hotel quarantine program, prompting him to call for a judicial inquiry.Victoria’s chief health officer Professor Brett Sutton said: “This virus is not selective”.“It will impact anyone it encounters, and personal contact is the clear source of its transmission.” He said for people living in hotspots, “There is no excuse for not getting tested”. From midnight, for people living outside the restricted postcodes, there are only four reasons to go into those postcodes will be shopping for food and supplies, care and caregiving, exercise and study or work. People who live in these postcodes cannot have visitors to their home, or visit other homes, except for caregiving or compassionate reasons, or receiving services.Businesses and facilities in these postcodes that have reopened will again be restricted. Cafes and restaurants will only be able to open for take-away and delivery services."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0df0de4cb6ae57ed5a1817172a3d473182ede07/59_623_2287_1371/master/2287.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55188581f4297950c14dde9e3b03a51e","title":"madrids teatro real reopens with socially distanced opera","story":"Verdi’s La Traviata reimagined with cast and orchestra wearing face masksThe opening scenes of merriment have taken on a sombre tone, with the chorus clad in black and white and spaced exactly 2 metres apart. Minutes into the staging of La Traviata, the surgical masks come off, timed with the rising notes of an orchestra led by a conductor standing behind a plastic screen.Spain’s Teatro Real will reopen its doors to the public on Wednesday, becoming one of the world’s first opera houses to return to the stage with a production that includes a chorus, orchestra and soloists after months of lockdown. On offer is Verdi’s La Traviata, tweaked to reflect life in the time of Covid-19.“There are people who prefer to sit with their arms crossed and wait until we return to normal,” said Joan Matabosch, the artistic director of the Teatro Real. “And then there are theatres that prefer to try and conquer the normality that we find ourselves in.”It is an ambitious undertaking. In mid-March, Spain was plunged into lockdown as officials scrambled to control one of the world’s fastest-spreading outbreaks. The tens of thousands of excess deaths recorded since then hint at one of Europe’s highest per capita death tolls.The Teatro Real saw an opportunity, however, as the situation stabilised. It had originally scheduled a run of La Traviata for May and July and, given the relatively small orchestra needed for the performance, it saw it might be possible to salvage some of the season and still abide by physical distancing.The result is a production in which every aspect – both on and off stage – is coloured by the pandemic. “This isn’t an opera staged in normal conditions,” said Matabosch. “This is an effort by the Teatro Real to actively push for a progressive return to normality.” The decision was also made out of respect for the artists, many of whom “have gone five months without earning one euro”, he added.Every move onstage has been carefully calculated to keep soloists two metres apart. Members of the 56-piece orchestra wear masks when possible and sit 1.5 metres from each other, with plastic panels in front of the woodwind section. Artists have been asked to arrive much earlier than normal for the 27 performances, their entrances staggered to avoid any crowding and to allow them to have their temperature taken.More than €340,000 (£310,000) has been spent gearing up for a half-capacity audience of up to 869 people, who will each also have their temperature taken before being allowed in and be required to wear a mask at all times. No-touch features have been installed in the washrooms and the intermission extended to 40 minutes to avoid crowds or long queues.With scenes of ballroom dances, social gatherings and passionate embraces punctuating the original production, the task of redesigning the stage concept fell to the director Leo Castaldi.The tale of La Traviata, woven through with one character’s battle with tuberculosis, seemed like the perfect opera in which to explore this disconnect. “It’s not that La Traviata is the story of an epidemic, but it’s clear that one cannot watch this opera without thinking of what we’re living through,” Castaldi said.The production is peppered with nods to the current situation, such as the grid of red lines that ide the stage into 2-metre boxes, hinting at what Castaldi described as the psychological “imprisonment” of limited space.The wide swaths of empty space initially proved complicated for the artists, who strained to hear each other over the metres of distance that separated them. After 10 days of rehearsal – an accelerated timeline forced by the lockdown – they adjusted.“It’s a La Traviata that makes sense for today’s times,” said Castaldi. “And in doing it this way we discovered things. We discovered that, yes, there is distance but that music can fill this distance.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f615c544786f99e302712f852194a081062eaec8/0_100_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4dbf0596b9516953a2907855a7cc0620","title":"wednesday briefing experts expect more leicesters","story":"Rise in infections brings fear of more localised lockdowns … China says new Hong Kong laws will make extraditions easier … Pierce Brosnan on life, loss and 007Morning everyone. I’m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories this Wednesday morning.A rise in coronavirus infections has been detected in areas of England, Scotland and Wales, raising fears of renewed Leicester-style lockdowns as the countries prepare to ease restrictions. The Medway in Kent, the boroughs of Hammersmith and Fulham and Ealing in London, and Lanarkshire and Dumfries and Galloway in Scotland saw a rise in infections in the week to 25 June, according to official data. Other areas seeing higher rates included Bedford, Barnsley and Flintshire. The much-awaited reopening of pubs is set for Saturday throughout England, and from 15 July in Scotland. “I am expecting there to be a number of Leicesters,” said Prof Deenan Pillay, a virologist at UCL. Some clothing factories in Leicester remained open during the national lockdown and ordered workers to work even when they were sick, labour campaigners have claimed, amid concerns that the city’s garment industry has played a key role in the resurgence of cases. The government has been criticised for “sowing confusion” about the city’s new lockdown, while residents and businesses said they were baffled by the messaging.The Trump administration has bought up the world’s entire supply of remdesivir for the next three months, denying any other countries access to a drug which can help coronavirus victims recover more quickly. It sparked alarm that the US could use similar leverage to corner the market in any future Covid-19 vaccine. The US’s top infectious diseases expert says the virus curve was going in the “wrong direction” and that daily cases could reach 100,000. They rose by 47,000 yesterday, the biggest ever daily increase. Australia’s second-largest city, Melbourne, has placed 36 suburbs into lockdown after a spike in cases, while South Korea has seen a surge of “mask rage” as summer heats up.

An independent study found that nearly half of Black African Caribbean households were in poverty, compared with just under one in five white families. BAME families were between two and three times as likely to be in persistent poverty.China threat – China says Hong Kong’s new security laws will make it easier to extradite people for trial on the mainland. Chinese official Zhang Xiaoming, head of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs office, said the laws were a “sword of Damocles hanging over a tiny group of criminals who want to interfere in Hong Kong affairs”. Pro-democracy activists have nevertheless urged residents to defy a ban on protests and take to the streets to mark the territory’s handover to China 23 years ago.NHS inquiry – West Mercia police have launched an investigation into allegations of poor maternity care at Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Hospital Trust where dozens of babies may have died unnecessarily.

The prime minister called the proposals a “new deal” in an apparent reference to the US president Franklin D Roosevelt whose policies of the same name helped America out of the Great Depression. Labour leader Keir Starmer dismissed that idea, saying: “There’s not much that’s new and it’s not much of a deal.” Other critics said the plan risked raising emissions and eroding building standards.Weinstein settlement – New York’s attorney general has reached an agreement to settle two sexual misconduct lawsuits against imprisoned former film producer Harvey Weinstein for nearly $19m. The settlement would resolve a lawsuit filed against Weinstein, his production company and his brother in 2018 by the attorney general’s office on behalf of multiple women. But lawyers representing six of the women called the proposed deal a “sellout” that did not require Weinstein, 68, to accept responsibility or personally pay out any money.And the winners are – The new group of invitees to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences include Eva Longoria, Zendaya and Awkwafina as the Oscars voting body continues its push to ersify after criticism that it was “too white”.

If there is evidence of serious malpractice, exam boards will be expected to investigate.Headteachers had argued that the autumn series should be restricted to A-levels and GCSE English and maths because of concerns about the practical challenges already facing schools as they open up to all pupils from September.However, following a consultation, Ofqual ruled that exam boards must make exams available in all subjects at all levels in the additional autumn series beginning in October. Results will be based on exams alone, while pupils doing art and design will be set a task to complete under supervised conditions.Exam boards will be expected to have the usual arrangements for reviews of marking and appeals in place, and students will be able to request a replacement certificate.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said pupils and parents could be confident this summer’s grades would be every bit as valid as in any other year, without the need to enter for exams in the autumn.“We are concerned about how schools and colleges will be able to accommodate and manage a full suite of autumn exams alongside the huge challenge of bringing all their pupils back in September, identifying learning gaps, and putting catch-up support in place,” he said. “All of this will have to be done while managing the risks associated with coronavirus.”The University and College Union (UCU) warned that disadvantaged students who were unhappy with their results could still miss out. UCU’s general secretary, Jo Grady, said: “Research has shown that disadvantaged students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are more likely to be predicted lower grades than their more affluent counterparts.“The only option for students who are unhappy with their results is to spin the roulette wheel with high-stakes exams, which will not be the right fit for all and may disadvantage those with special educational needs.”Ofqual said anyone with concerns about “bias, discrimination or any other fact that suggests that a centre did not behave with care or integrity” when issuing calculated grades this summer should complain to their school in the first instance.“Where there is evidence, we require exam boards to investigate allegations as potential malpractice or maladministration,” Ofqual said. “We expect such allegations to be rare, but this is an important safeguard for students and their overall confidence in this year’s grading arrangements.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32d0906c1bcea2c9ab2abb7f15f07ea2c0c3cbea/0_219_3164_1898/master/3164.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6778e50da57654efb3f7134b53f3af07","title":"leicester how have you been affected by the local lockdown","story":"We want to hear from people living in Leicester about how restrictions are affecting themLeicester is the first city to experience a local lockdown with non-essential shops and schools closed from Tuesday.Restrictions are set to be in place for two weeks after infections rose, with Leicester accounting for around one in 10 of all coronavirus cases in the past week.We want to hear from local people, schools and business about their experiences.

In an interview in April, Sue, a civil servant, told of the emotional moment she and their children Hana, 16, and William, 14, all wearing personal protective equipment, were given 10 minutes to say their goodbyes.He is now expected to be discharged within days, but the physical toll of the virus could mean that he will lose some fingers, and he may require long-term dialysis.Doctors were “just completely astounded” at his determination and focus, she said. “Everybody in the hospital has been saying to him they did not expect him to survive. We were told he was slipping away, that he was as close to death as anybody they had seen that had then managed to survive.”She and the children had discussed his potential funeral. “To think we were at that stage, and it was almost so hopeless, and to now talk about him coming home, well we just can’t believe it. We’re just so incredibly grateful,” she said.Unable to see him in person, they initially saw him through FaceTime, but stopped because it was too depressing “to see him just lying there, lifeless, and obviously unresponsive”.When he eventually came out of his coma, “it was a one-way conversation”.“He was so weak, all he could do was blink, or perhaps raise an eyebrow, or nod. He couldn’t even move his arms, or hands, or legs, in the beginning. He had so much muscle wastage from being on a ventilator for so long.”After a while, with a voice setting fitted to his tracheotomy, he was able to respond. “The day we were able to hear his voice was just incredible,” she said.“Every time we see him now, it is more like him, he is just a very thinner, weaker version of himself. He’s just now realising how close he came, and what we went through as well, which is quite difficult I think for him to process.”Several fingers and his thumbs are “all shrivelled up” as result of medication given to keep him alive. “It’s a small price to pay if he requires some amputations of fingers and thumbs,” she said. He might always suffer from breathlessness, and could require dialysis long term. She has been told his hallucinations may last for years.“So we will continue to take each day as it comes. Him actually being here physically with us will make a massive difference. And we will just do whatever we need to do to get him to the best place we can get him to.“But we will all be very different. But hopefully there will be some positives to come from it and we will just continue to be as positive as possible and support him in the best way we can.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/976c297047730e9f5b371a5df58b8ab615541c42/131_0_3465_2080/master/3465.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5cbfdc58b420770bb03e1127f8863e3b","title":"netanyahu hints at delay to plans to annex the west bank","story":"Israeli PM’s suggestion that deadline may be missed follows Benny Gantz saying Covid-19 is more urgent than annexationThe Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is struggling to push through his West Bank annexation plans, slated to start as soon as Wednesday, facing opposition from Palestinians, the international community and even his own government.Netanyahu had pledged to begin the process of annexing Israeli settlements and the Jordan Valley from 1 July, as part of a peace plan devised by Donald Trump’s US administration. But he hinted at a delay on Tuesday, saying annexation talks would continue “in the coming days” with US officials.The remarks came a day after the alternate prime minister, Benny Gantz, said annexation must wait while the country tackles the coronavirus pandemic, pointing to deep isions arising from Washington’s initiative.Unveiled in January, the Trump administration’s plan supported annexation, but also foresaw the eventual creation of a Palestinian state – a red flag for many Israeli settlers, who believe their government should control the entire West Bank. A map published with the US plan shows a fragmented Palestinian state, pockmarked by Israeli settlements that are joined by Israeli access roads.Washington’s proposal was rejected by the Palestinian leadership immediately, as it offers them a rump state while rejecting their fundamental demands, such as a capital in East Jerusalem.Despite Palestinians’ firm rejection of the US plan, anti-annexation protests in the West Bank have failed to draw large crowds. The largest rally drew a few thousand people, including foreign diplomats, to Jericho in the Jordan Valley in June. Under Washington’s plan, the city would remain Palestinian while the surrounding area including the border with Jordan would be annexed by Israel.The Palestinian prime minister, Mohammad Shtayyeh, said a counter-proposal to Washington’s plan had been submitted to the UN, the US, the European Union and Russia, which make up the Quartet.While Shtayyeh did not detail the proposal, the Palestinian Authority said it was prepared to resume negotiations with Israel, according to a letter seen by AFP news agency.There has been no public response to the Palestinian proposal and the international community has pressed Israel to halt annexation, deemed illegal by the UN.“I am deeply concerned that even the most minimalist form of annexation would lead to increased violence and loss of life,” the UN’s top human rights official, Michelle Bachelet, said on Monday.Jordan, which along with Egypt is the only Arab country to have a peace accord with Israel, has threatened to downgrade or scrap the 1994 agreement.The EU is weighing up retaliatory measures, and Netanyahu’s government has lobbied the foreign ministers of Germany, Greece and Cyprus to tone down the bloc’s response during their recent visits to Israel.In the face of opposition from abroad and at home, Netanyahu may amend his plans and annex settlement blocks close to Jerusalem only.The US team, which includes the White House envoy Avi Berkowitz, is reportedly seeking an agreement between Netanyahu and Gantz before giving its backing to annexation in any form."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4292956.1593545288!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish holidaymakers left in a no man s land consumer advocate says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan  has said people should “restrict travel to when it is absolutely necessary” this summer and urged people to holiday at home in the weeks ahead.

He said Irish authorities and officials at an EU level “are doing very little and seem exclusively focused on getting business back in business and giving consumers nothing”.“The last Minister for Transport did very little to help consumers and we really do need to see a very different approach from the Eamon Ryan, the new minister to help citizens who have paid sometimes huge sums which is not at risk.”He said that if the “leading health expert is saying don’t go, then people need to listen to that and if that is the case then something has to give and it can be done either legislatively or simply by the Government telling the public not to travel and telling the travel companies to treat their customers fairly.”Meadbh Hayes is one holidaymaker who faces losing thousands of euro in the weeks ahead. “We booked our trip to Spain for July 28th to August 8th in February,” she said. “As yet, Ryanair have not cancelled our flights and having spent endless time on hold with them, they cannot update me on that flight status.”She said she was “very nervous about travelling with children and concerned about what would happen if we fell ill in Spain? We are stuck in the position where we are being advised by the government not to take non-essential travel and yet risk losing a serious chunk of money.”The situation is arguably more perilous for Keith Lawler.

If a school is behind on the curriculum, it will put students under added pressure,” Mr Laharte said.“Teachers have worked hard to keep education going, there have been inevitable constraints and completing the full curriculum may be too big an ask this year.“The common-sense approach is to give students’ more latitude in the exams on the understanding that everyone will have, for example, 80 per cent of the curriculum covered. That could mean giving students more options in the exam and not making every aspect of the exam compulsory.”Robust examsDeirdre McDonald, Association of Secondary Teachers’ Ireland (ASTI) president, said next year’s Leaving Cert exams should be tailored by taking into account students’ learning experiences, while ensuring the exams are as robust as ever.“This work needs to be completed well in advance of the commencement of the next school year. It must also be flexible and take into account the conditions, as yet unknown, under which the return to school happens,” she said.The Irish Second Level Students’ Union supported calls for exams to be adapted to ensure students do not have the added pressures of having to catch up on months of missed coursework.Union president Reuban Murray said mental health and career guidance would also be a key challenge for schools and called for funding for guidance counsellor posts to be fully restored.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"From planting to organising the kids\u0026rsquo room, there are lots of ways to keep plastic out of landfillOne Change: We may be at the beginning of a new era with changes starting to happenFriends of the Irish Environment challenges Government\u0026rsquos National Mitigation Plan"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climate"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Alan Betson The Government will strengthen its warnings about travelling abroad but is unlikely to tell airlines to cancel flights or ban foreign travel, despite warnings from senior public health officials about the dangers of holidaymakers coming here or returning from trips abroad. Senior health officials will brief Ministers on Thursday, and the Cabinet committee on Covid-19 is due to meet on Friday, ahead of a full Cabinet meeting next Monday that will decide whether to ease the 14-day quarantine.Despite officials’ concern about the effects of easing the travel restrictions, there is pressure from airlines and the tourist industry to relax the requirement for incoming travellers to quarantine for 14 days after their arrival in Ireland. Officials are also concerned that the quarantine requirement is not effectively enforced in many cases.It emerged last night that not every passenger arriving into the country is receiving a follow-up call to check that they are self-isolating for 14 days following their arrival into the State.The Department of Justice said that since early last week it has only been in a position to make 60 to 70 per cent of the follow-up calls to passengers arriving into the State to check up on their 14-day quarantine because of the increase in passenger numbers arriving. ‘Large cohort’The department said Covid-19 Passenger Locator Forms, which passengers are required to fill out, are randomly selected and a “large cohort” from every flight but not every passenger is called. Figures released last week show that of the follow-up calls made between May 28th and June 21st more than a third of calls to passengers contacted in follow-up calls went unanswered.The department said that as the passenger numbers increase significantly over the coming days, the task of making the follow-up calls will fall to the HSE as the department’s border management unit “will need to focus exclusively on their core function of immigrating passengers.”Some want the Government to cancel flights, so that people who have booked holidays abroad can be compensated. On Tuesday the Irish Travel Agents Association chief executive Pat Dawson said that giving permission to fly and yet saying not to fly was unfair.Government advice is currently not to travel abroad, but it is expected this will be relaxed after July 9th. Sources said that if people chose to go abroad, they should be aware that the quarantine requirements could change while they are on holidays if the rate of pandemic infections increases.‘Holiday at home’On Tuesday night the new Minister for Tourism Catherine Martin encouraged people to holiday in Ireland. She said that the advice of the chief medical officer “right now . . . is to continue with existing travel restrictions. In the meantime I would encourage people to take this time to holiday at home and enjoy the wonderful natural, cultural and outdoor recreational amenities that our own country has to offer.”Meanwhile, EU member states yesterday approved a list of 15 countries around the world that are deemed safe for travel, agreeing that member states should open their borders to them for all travel from Wednesday.Unusually among EU member states, Ireland is not part of the agreement because it is not in the Schengen area of free travel and has a Common Travel Area with the United Kingdom. Ireland was invited to take part in the joint agreement, but could only do so if Britain also agreed due to the open Border, and it opted not to do so, The  understands. Denmark is also opting out.The countries deemed safe are: Algeria, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay. China is also to be included, as long as Beijing agrees that EU citizens will also be allowed to travel there in turn.The United States was not included due to pervasive level of coronavirus infections there.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Authorities unlikely to tell airlines to cancel flights or ban foreign travelPublic sector pay increases to proceed as review warns of \u0026euro25bn hit to public purseClose analysis of cases could help with tracing in potential second wavePublicans will not face criminal sanction if in breach of Covid-19 rulesTeacher unions say greater flexibility and \u0026lsquocommon sense approach\u0026rsquo neededParty leaders yet to finalise list of ministers of State, but there will be disappointmentsThousands of tonnes of bog slipped down Shass mountain near Drumkeeran villageMove will allow 650 students to learn in large socially-distanced settingVideo links and social distancing to be part and parcel of new committeesThe distressed animal was coaxed out of four metres deep Atlantic waters on MondayConcern as people will not get flight refund even if travelling goes against health adviceDespite board refusal, FIE proceeded with case over \u0026euro116 billion Project Ireland planMinister says PPE costs could be as high as \u0026euro1bn while further funds needed for acute bedsT\u0026aacutenaiste sets out the economic challenges facing Ireland in the wake of Covid-19An Bord Plean\u0026aacutela has approved application for visitor centre in Dublin mountainsMotorist admitted she had driven over Wayne O\u0026rsquoNeill after being cautioned when garda\u0026iacute noticed dent in her vehicleThousands congregate for former IRA and Sinn F\u0026eacutein member\u0026rsquos funeral in BelfastStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"bobby storey the ira s planner and enforcer who stayed in the shadows","story":"Nearly 1,800 men and women, dressed in black trousers and slacks, white shirts and black ties, lined up along the black-flag draped Andersonstown and Falls roads in west Belfast on Tuesday for the funeral of Bobby Storey.Behind them stood thousands more as the hearse containing the Tricolour-covered coffin of Storey, a senior Sinn Féin and IRA figure for decades, passed by, applauding as it did. Even with the Covid-19 lockdown regulations in place, they were determined to pay tribute to a man they considered a hero.However, there are others who experienced the brutal side of the 64-year-old, who hold sharply different views about the man lauded in Anderstown and the Falls Road.Storey, who died on June 21st after an unsuccessful lung transplant in a National Health Service hospital in England, may be the “most famous Provo” that most people, with no connection to republicanism, have never heard about, or know little about him, if they had.However, “Big Bobby”, as his closest friend for decades, former Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams, generally called him, never wanted to be known by people at large, just by his own.Within the Sinn Féin and IRA family, he was viewed as a top commander – involved from his youth in the Troubles, with years behind bars, and a place at the top table right up to very recently when illness forced him from the scene.The two people he most admired, as he said himself, were Che Guevara and Gerry Adams. “He was grafted on to Adams,” was one well-put portrayal of their relationship.Studying his history, Storey, who was the IRA’s director of intelligence in the eyes of those who knew that world well, was “a planner, operator and an enforcer”.Illustrating that latter side to him, one former police officer, recalled a beating delivered by Storey to another republican who had dared to challenge the Adams-McGuinness leadership at one of key moments in the peace process.“The man was a repeat murderer, with a penchant for cutting people’s throats, but even he was scared of Bobby Storey,” the former officer recalled.Though he rarely took the microphone outside of speaking to usually-private, sometimes public Sinn Féin gatherings, Storey was able to come up with the memorable quote when he had to go to the front of the stage.One such moment came during a west Belfast press conference in August 2015 attended by Adams, the late Martin McGuinness, Mary Lou McDonald and some other leading republicans.Matters were then fraught. Kevin McGuigan had just been shot dead in Belfast in a revenge murder for the killing of senior IRA figure Gerard “Jock” Davison that May.Storey had been arrested for the McGuigan murder, but released without charge. The killing threatened the already shaky Northern Executive. Storey insisted that the IRA had had nothing to do with it.The then PSNI chief constable George Hamilton had said some IRA members carried out McGuigan’s murder, although they had acted without the authority of the leadership. Storey’s denials were treated with scepticism.“I think the chief constable and other perspectives out there see this in terms of the IRA being the caterpillar that is still there,” waxed Storey. “What I think is that it’s moved on, it’s become a butterfly, it’s flew away, it’s gone, it’s disappeared.”The butterfly metaphor, which prompted a smile from Adams, had the colloquial colour and rhythm of a remark from one who could talk softly because they carried a big stick.Storey was a “made man” in the IRA from his teens. In 1979, when in his early 20s, he was sent to London to try to free the late IRA leader Brian Keenan from Brixton prison using a helicopter.It failed and Storey and three others were arrested. He was acquitted but in 1981 was sentenced to 18 years in prison over a gun attack on British soldiers.That led to the Maze prison escape of 1983 and the beginning of Storey making his way into republican legend. Storey and North Belfast Assembly member Gerry Kelly were two of the masterminds in what was the biggest jailbreak in UK prison history, dubbed by republicans, The Great Escape, after the film. In all 38 IRA prisoners made it out of the prison gates in September 1983, half were recaptured but 19 got away.Storey, too, was caught and had another seven years added to his sentence. Prison officer James Ferris who was stabbed during the escape died, although a court later ruled that it was a heart attack that killed him.Storey in a 2008 interview with the republican paper An Phoblacht recalled the escape. “It was a great achievement for the IRA. It showed the degree to which comrades could work together, not just those who escaped but those who formed the back-up inside the jail, prisoners who weren’t going on the escape. Then there was the teamwork of people outside the jail: the drivers, the safe houses. Even getting captured didn’t dampen the event. We shafted Maggie Thatcher.”Storey probably is best known for the 2004 Northern Bank robbery. Adams and the IRA denied that the IRA did the job, and there are people who accept that denial, but not many.It was months in the planning, coming shortly after a failed attempt to resurrect the powersharing Executive and Assembly which had collapsed in 2002.Intelligence and security services put Storey at the heart of its planning. “The robbery was carried out by the Belfast brigade, and Storey was a key player in the brigade, so he would have been up to his neck in it,” said a former senior Police Service of Northern Ireland officer.It should be remembered that the IRA was on ceasefire at the time and supposed to have eschewed such criminality. The same source recalled how over the years the IRA engaged in numerous bank, post office and other robberies. When Border fuel laundering and other activity was taken into account it all amounted to a multimillion pound criminal empire.It prompted the late and former IRA member Dolours Price to comment at the time about slipping republican “standards” and to wonder: “The war is over, we are told . . . so what is all this money needed for?”It is a question that has never been properly answered.Storey had been involved in major robberies before. Stung by multiple truck hijackings in the early 2000s Gallaher’s cigarette manufacturers in Ballymena began to ship supplies bound for Dublin first to Liverpool by ferry, and then onwards to Dublin.The change soon drew the attention of the IRA to Gallaher’s use of Belfast port. In a raid in June 2001 that never drew the attention of the Northern Bank robbery, the IRA targeted a £4 million consignment of cigarettes bound for Rotterdam in the Netherlands.The planning was impeccable, even in the words today of security sources. The Belfast brigade of the IRA provided the people, the IRA in south Armagh handled the logistics, while Storey was at the centre of the web.“One night about 30 men appeared in Belfast dock. They took over the entire dock. They knew exactly what they were doing, they knew exactly what containers they were looking for, they knew exactly where those containers would be,” said one source.“The only mistake they made was that they were a little bit late and a couple of those containers were loaded by the time they got to the quayside. So they put a gunman in the cab of the crane with the crane driver and made him unload them again.“A fleet of lorries then appeared provided by the south Armagh brigade. The containers were dropped onto the lorries which headed off for the Border. The IRA held up the dock for another four hours, and then disappeared.“By the time the alarm was raised I reckon some of those cigarettes were almost in Cork. Bobby Storey would have been at the heart of that as well.”If the Gallaher’s raid made few headlines, the Northern Bank raid dominated bulletins across the world. Anxious to keep the IRA on board British prime minister Tony Blair’s “peace train” played down charges that the IRA was responsible for the cigarette job.“But it was absolutely obvious who did it. No organisation in Northern Ireland had the capability to do that job but the IRA,” said one security source involved in the investigation.Then there was the St Patrick’s night break-in in 2002 at the PSNI special branch offices at the Castlereagh police complex in east Belfast, supposedly one of the most impenetrable security centres in Europe. Three smartly-dressed men, one reputedly with an Oxbridge accent, almost casually got through the various checks, flashing what appeared to be genuine security passes.It was a Sunday, a quiet night, and the men walked along the corridors of the building, just as IRA men did in the Belfast docks raid, knowing exactly where they were to go.Within minutes, the three men were in the office where information about police agents, their police handlers and other highly-confidential documentation were kept.They got out with that hoard just as easily as they got in, a lone constable in the office being punched in the face and then hooded, bound and gagged as the three carefully and methodically assembled their haul.Millions of pounds were spent rehousing compromised detectives and others whose security was threatened by the break-in.Highly embarrassed, then chief constable Ronnie Flanagan referred to the Castlereagh raid as “an inside job”, giving rise to speculation that this was some sort of faction fight between the different elements of British intelligence. But it then emerged that Flanagan appeared to be referring to someone in Castlereagh assisting the three well-dressed robbers.The IRA denied involvement while senior Sinn Féiners complained of dirty deeds by “British securocrats”, to use a favourite and much-used phrase of Adams.Whitehall mandarin Sir John Chilcot, who later investigated the causes of the Iraq war, conducted an inquiry and found no evidence that any section of the British security agencies was involved.Once more Storey was blamed. Remembering the raid, a former senior police officer has no doubts but that he was central. However, that same source believes that Storey was criticised internally by at least one Sinn Féin leader who, whatever about the haul of information found at the break-in, was unhappy with its timing because it put pressure on the Northern Executive and Assembly.The then Ulster Unionist Party first minister David Trimble was under severe strain at the time for sharing power with Sinn Féin. Allegations that the on-ceasefire IRA had broken Castlereagh did nothing for his temperament, or his position.Storey was seen as a man who had “sleepers” in many sensitive positions who could be used at opportune times. Storey, this inidual believes, had “an asset” with knowledge of Castlereagh and that he decided to “use that asset, rather than lose it”. Not every element of the republican movement was kept in the loop by a man who kept secrets well.Storey was said to run a meticulous, almost obsessive intelligence gathering operation. Every IRA brigade in Northern Ireland, possibly apart from south Armagh which tended to do its own thing, supplied information to him.He carefully collated and stored it, much of it in a large bag, a “bit like a Gladstone bag”, according to the source. It was described in court as a “rucksack”.“Republicans were reporting back intelligence all the time, picking up information on prison officers, on police officers, taking down car registrations, getting family details, where children went to school, getting gossip about people’s finances, who was having affairs – all of it being fed back to Bobby,” he explained.It was around then, said the same source, that the PSNI devised a plan to bring him down. And here the story gets convoluted but it all leads up to Stormontgate in October of 2002.StormontgateThat month a long line of PSNI special branch and regular officers trooped into the offices of Sinn Féin at Parliament Buildings and seized material. Amid allegations of an IRA spy ring operating at Stormont – hence Stormontgate – Trimble could no longer hold his people together and the whole powersharing structure came crashing down, not to be rebuilt for close to another five years – an occasion in which Storey also featured.Sinn Féin’s head of administration at Stormont, Denis Donaldson was arrested, as were two other men, Donaldson’s son-in-law Ciarán Kearney, and William Mackessy. Storey’s “big bag” – stored in Donaldson’s home – was seized during a PSNI raid.They faced a range of charges but gradually some of them were withdrawn. In December 2005, the prosecution case ended, lawyers reporting it was no longer in the “public interest” to proceed with the case – a term that not infrequently is shorthand for protecting undercover sources or agents.The following day, Friday, December 9th, Donaldson posed with Adams and McGuinness on the steps of Parliament Buildings, the three looking rather self-satisfied.That did not last long. The following week a forlorn Donaldson gave a statement to the press admitting that for about 20 years he had acted as a British agent. At Stormont Donaldson came across as a quiet and decent inidual who kept to the background. On that day he appeared pitiful. He went to live a life of isolation in a cottage near Glenties in Co Donegal where he was brutally murdered the following April. One of his arms was almost blown off by a shotgun blast. The Real IRA said it had killed him, but there are still questions over whether that was a genuine admission.The outing of Donaldson allowed Adams and other Sinn Féiners to claim the whole Stormontgate affair was yet another example of a British “securocrat” conspiracy and that there was no republican spying at Stormont.Again some people believe that version of events. The other story, as expressed by a number of security, official and other sources, was that the police were trying to get Storey in possession of that bag of secret documents. Revenge was required for Castlereagh.In fact, said the former PSNI officer, the operation to nab Storey and other senior republicans had run for a long period. It was costly and involved many officers. But they just could not get the bag and Storey together. The PSNI for a long time knew Donaldson had the bag but were hoping for a “pass the parcel” moment when it would be handed over to the IRA director of intelligence.The source explained: “The bag had been left temporarily with Denis Donaldson. It was destined for Bobby and we were trying to catch Bobby with it, with all those intelligence records and CDs, but we couldn’t in the end. Eventually it got to the stage where we ran out of resources and had to move on it and take Denis instead.”One of the explanations for Donaldson’s arrest, even though he was an agent, was that he had not told his handlers about all the secret documentation. Another reason for the police moving in was fear that the material would be transported for safer keeping across the Border.The result was that Storey escaped the net while millions of pounds were spent trying to safeguard the estimated 2,000 or so people, many of them prison, police and British army officers, some of them politicians, named in the documents.The former officer also recalled how police did not get a chance to contact one particular man, an alleged drug dealer, on the list. “He was killed by the IRA, using one of its cover names, before he could be warned.”LoyaltySpeaking after his death, Adams was strong in his tribute to Storey, saying that he was “one of the bravest people I have ever had the honour to know”.“Whether inside or outside of prison, or through the years of harassment and beatings, arrests and torture from the RUC and British army, Big Bobby demonstrated time and time again his enormous personal commitment and courage,” he added.In turn Storey had a fierce loyalty to Adams. In 2014, when Adams was arrested and questioned at Antrim police station for a number of days about the 1972 abduction, murder and secret burial of mother-of-10 Jean McConville, Storey rallied to his cause.“That they would dare touch our party leader, the leader of Irish republicanism,” Storey thundered at a public gathering in west Belfast. At the same meeting Storey repeated a famous line from Adams about the IRA: “We have a message for the British government, for the Irish government, for the cabal that is out there: we ain’t gone away, you know.”During research for this article, several political, security and republican sources have emphasised how critical Storey was to the peace process and strategy pursued by Adams and McGuinness. They provided the strategy, he provided the muscle to ensure they got their way.Following the August 1994 IRA ceasefire, senior Sinn Féiners went to IRA units across Northern Ireland, and in the Republic, to argue for the peace strategy. Encouraged to speak up, a couple of IRA volunteers attending a meeting close to the Markets in central Belfast did so, and expressed their opposition to the ceasefire.“During all of this Bobby sat at the back of the room,” said one well-placed source. “As the crowd were filtering out Bobby took those speakers aside and explained to them in words of one syllable what the consequences would be if they ever challenged the Adams-McGuinness leadership again. Bobby could be vicious, and they knew that.”One very senior security figure was certain that Storey was important in ensuring that those within the IRA and Sinn Féin who opposed Adams and McGuinness never got the upper hand.“We always believed that Bobby Storey was director of intelligence in the late 1990s and early noughties for the IRA,” he said. “He was very much a key player, extremely close to the leadership. His support for them was pretty vital in containing any iniduals within the organisation who were threatening to throw over the traces, because they were all terrified of him.”“I have no doubt that he played a positive role in making sure that any dissent within the organisation was suppressed,” he added.“He would have been fairly free with his fists when he had to. There were many, many people in the organisation who were frightened of him. If he came around and supported the party leadership then there would be very few people who would cross him.”At the funeral Adams quipped that he did not know anyone who knew Storey “who didn’t like him – except for MI5, MI6, the old RUC, the British army, and prison governors”. Still, he was not universally loved, even within republicanism.In addition to those he threatened, there were other Republicans who had little time for Storey. One in particular was former IRA leader Ivor Bell who last year in court was cleared of soliciting McConville’s murder.That case centred on testimony Bell gave on the Boston tapes – the ill-fated oral history of the Troubles – where it was alleged that one night in 1972, Bell, the late Pat McClure and Adams gathered to settle the terrible end of the life of Jean McConville.Adams, who also gave evidence to the court, insisted no such meeting took place and that he had no part in the murder of the 38-year-old widow.But in the tapes, where former IRA man Anthony McIntyre interviewed Bell, mention also is made of Storey. The court heard that when the IRA and Sinn Féin decided to assist in locating the bodies of McConville and others of the Disappeared Adams sent Storey to speak to Bell. This would have been around 1998-1999.Storey’s task, it appeared from the tapes, was to elicit from Bell what he knew about the Disappeared. But it was clear that Bell felt that Adams was being disingenuous, which led to an infuriated Bell describing Storey as a “clown” and an “idiot” – terms that very few people would have used about him.A clearly annoyed Bell said that he told Storey, “What are you asking me about it for, sure my knowledge of it would be second-hand, why don’t you ask Gerry?”“Oh Gerry knows nothing about it,” Storey told Bell with an exasperated Bell saying to McIntyre, “the annoying thing is he actually believed Gerry.”Storey was loved within most of the republican community but as with Bell there were those who despised him.In July 2018, dissident republicans threw explosive devices at the homes of Adams and Storey in West Belfast. No one was injured. A rally there was quickly organised, with Storey telling dissidents they needed to “go back to where they come from”. “They were on a road to nowhere,” was a message he repeated on a number of occasions.YouthFrom teenage years Storey’s whole life was given over to the IRA and Sinn Féin. He joined the IRA when he was 16. Aged 17, he was one of the youngest to be interned in 1973. He served more than 20 years in prison, quite a lot of them on remand on various charges such as IRA shootings and bombings. Several sources said he was implicated in a number of killings but that because he was so long inside that he is rarely linked to some of the even more notorious multiple-death IRA gun and bomb attacks.“Then there was the massacre on Bloody Sunday when 13 people were gunned down . . . The fact that British paratroopers could gun down innocent protesters had a massive impact on me and from that point on I was attempting to join the republican movement.”Through the 2000s and as the IRA, to a relative degree considering the criminality, retreated into the shadows Sinn Féin leaders such as Adams saw the merit of bringing Storey more into the political fold. They tested the waters first by seeing how he would perform. On one occasion The  and other newspapers were invited to an off-the-record briefing where Storey, a little self-effacingly and with some reluctance, offered his thoughts on whatever was the political issue of that day. “I am not used to this,” he said, but then chatted away. There were no other such invitations for sit-down meetings with Storey.Tall, strongly-built, and with a commanding presence, Storey could be affable man, and with a good sense of humour. Equally, it was clear that he was not one to be crossed.His civility did not stretch to all journalists. The Belfast writer and journalist Malachi O’Doherty, who has been a regular critic of Sinn Féin and the IRA, remembers how in the mid-1990s he was tackled by Storey after he had delivered a piece on BBC Radio Ulster’s Talkback programme in which he referred to Storey’s “enforcer” status.Storey was 6ft 5in. O’Doherty is 5ft 2in, or little more. O’Doherty had been attending a lecture in the Felons’ Club in west Belfast when Storey approached him. O’Doherty recalled: “He put me up against a wall and told me I was a slug and not welcome in west Belfast.”“After that incident another journalist went to speak to him and said, ‘Look what’s the score with Malachi?’ And he said, ‘Well, Malachi shouldn’t feel that he is free to just walk into west Belfast given that he has been so critical of us’.”This was not a teasing, semi-jocular act by Storey, says O’Doherty: “Oh, no, it was clear intimidation of a journalist.”Some people have characterised Storey as little more than an IRA hardman who carried out the orders given to him and who could barely think for himself. McIntyre, who spent time in prison with him and who was no friend of the Adams-McGuinness leadership, and who himself took some serious gyp from Storey, strongly contradicts that view.He recalled occasions in prison when inmates were shown films. “I hated sitting beside him because no matter how complicated the plot of the film he’d work it out immediately and ruin it for you,” he said.“He was very competent and very well got. He was absolutely hated by the cops, they absolutely despised him.“He was exceptionally bright. I never found Bobby thuggish or a bully in a personal sense although a whole lot of others did. Whenever he was talking he always carried the authority of the IRA.”“In terms of practical intelligence and practical ability you would meet nobody brighter. People used to say to me, ‘He is stupid’, and I would say back to them, ‘You are stupid for thinking he is stupid’. You don’t put operations like that together if you are stupid.”Journalist Ivan Little while writing about Storey paramilitary past in the Belfast  also had a memory about his “softer” side. “At a talent contest I hosted in west Belfast some years ago he and his mother watched with pride as Storey’s brother Brian who had Down’s syndrome stole the show as an Elvis impersonator,” he recalled.But there are few such anecdotes.Across the Border he was also very well known to senior Garda and Army intelligence officers. “He was certainly on our radar he figured a lot in our intelligence reports down the years, he was an interesting character,” said one former Garda source.And while Storey is seldom mentioned as being on the IRA Army Council a former Army intelligence source said the view in the South was that “he was on the army council, or very close to it”.“Membership of the army council was fluid we think he was on it for a while. Storey was very influential. He mostly stayed behind the scenes but we had him at the very top of the tree,” he said.That 2008 An Phoblacht interview was another example of Storey’s switch from paramilitarism to politics although one security source said that even in his Sinn Féin days “he was somewhere between the two”.He held a senior position for Sinn Féin at Stormont and also served as party chairman for a period. He was a prominent backroom figure at times of political crises and during elections. He could energise the footsoldiers when the vote had to be got out. Perhaps jaundiced by the necessity to deal with journalists it seemed, however, that elected politics was not for him.In his graveside oration Adams spoke about how Storey was devoted to his partner, Teresa, their children, and grandchildren, brothers Seamus and Brian, and sister Geraldine.One of the repeated arguments from senior British security figures and some unionist politicians over the years is that a chief reason for the IRA finally ending its “war” was because it was so riddled with and damaged by informers and agents, some of them operating at very elevated levels such as Donaldson and Freddie Scappaticci, also known as Stakeknife, and some purported high-rankers yet to be exposed.Differing viewsThere are different views of Storey. Most unionists and many others will see him as just another ruthless terrorist who was part of an IRA murder machine that killed up to 1,800 people and badly injured thousands more in an unjustifiable and unnecessary conflict.That view was reflected in a piece in the Belfast  on the day before the funeral by historian Ruth Dudley Edwards which was headlined: “Bobby Storey: a violent thug who played role in the collapse of Stormont on three occasions”.The counter view was offered in that same day’s Irish News where senior republican Jim Gibney wrote: “If it is possible for one inidual to embody the spirit, the dynamic, the duration and durability, the depth and complexity of the republican struggle over the last 45 years then it was Bobby Storey.”But in the often dispassionate warts and all world of the British and Irish intelligence and security services that battled with Storey and his like there remains an objective regard for his nerve and skill.That same former Stormont official had one lasting memory of Storey that acknowledged his place in the republican hierarchy and in the “long war” tussle between the competing forces. It was May 2007, two months after Adams and Ian Paisley after much coaxing from the British and Irish governments, struck their truly historic deal to restore the Northern Executive and Assembly. This was after close to five years of direct rule from Westminster and now finally powersharing was being reinstated.While below in the chamber the politicians went about the business of formally reactivating the Executive and Assembly, in the visitors’ gallery above the likes of taoiseach Bertie Ahern, Blair and other VIPs observed proceedings, enjoying some of the reflected light of a job well done.Just a few seats from them sat three of the most senior IRA figures of the Troubles, the late Brian Keenan, Brian Gillen and Bobby Storey.“This is how central he was to PIRA and also to the peace process – while it would have infuriated unionists, their presence was a vindication of the Adams strategy and the peace process,” said the former official.He said that Blair and some of the other dignitaries “probably wouldn’t have recognised Storey anyway, which again says something about him”.And in a neat encapsulation of Storey’s significant but in many way reticent place in republican history and in the peace process he added: “He was very low profile, as befits an intelligence person – he was an observer.“But I do remember the respect my intelligence colleagues had for his operations. Quite apart from the Maze breakout to have planned the Northern Bank robbery and the Castlereagh break-in was extraordinary: respectively one of the largest bank robberies in history and the single biggest breach of UK national security ever. Quite a CV and he certainly didn’t lack ambition.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4292733.1593531749!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hundreds of inspectors to monitor pub restrictions","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA Garda spokesman said it has no role in enforcing the pub guidelines as they are not penal provisions under the emergency coronavirus legislation passed in April.Where there are breaches, pubs may be inspected by the Health and Safety Authority (HSA) or face difficulty in renewing their licence, the Vintners Federation of Ireland (VFI) has said. But there will be no criminal penalties.About 60 per cent of pubs in Dublin and 40 per cent in the rest of the country reopened on Monday, 15 weeks after being ordered to close their doors due to the coronavirus pandemic.In order to reopen, pubs must follow a strict rules including ensuring one-metre social distancing, limiting customers to a 105-minute stay and serving a hot meal worth at least €9 to all customers.There has been some confusion about how the regulations will be policed and what sanctions pubs could face for defying them.Some publicans have said they will defy the guidelines, including the owner of Oscars Bar in Dublin who said he would allow drinkers to stay for up to three hours as he believed this was safer.InspectorsThe measures are to be monitored by more than 500 inspectors. These will be mainly drawn from the HSA with some coming from the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Health Service Executive environmental health service.The inspections are being overseen by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. A department spokeswoman said the inspectors have been actively monitoring other businesses since phase one of reopening began. The department estimated that more than 5,000 inspections have been carried out to date. “This intensive inspection regime will continue during phase three,” the spokeswoman said.She said that analysis of inspections so far in relation to other businesses had indicated a high level of compliance and that “businesses are generally taking a responsible and proactive approach”.Phase three of reopenings will also see inspections by Fáilte Ireland staff “who will carry out a series of spot checks across various sectors on businesses that are successfully granted the Fáilte Ireland safety charter,” the department said.Tourist and hospitality businesses can sign up for the charter by agreeing to abide by strict infection-control measures.However, despite the inspection regime, pubs will not face immediate sanction for breaches. A Garda spokesman said it has no role in enforcing the pub guidelines as they are not penal provisions under the emergency coronavirus legislation passed in April.However, gardaí can still bring criminal charges against the owner of a premises if it contains more than 50 people.A spokesman for the VFI said that while there were no criminal sanctions for breaching most of the restrictions, there were other risks.“What we say to members is if you don’t comply you run the risk of a HSA inspection or a risk to your licence renewal in September.“Publicans and staff should comply with the rules because it’s for the greater good. That’s our position.”He said for the most part compliance would “effectively be self-policed”. “If people aren’t complying with the rules it will show up on social media and there will be a huge backlash, so it would be a very self-defeating stance to take.”Hugh Hourican, the owner of the Boar’s Head pub in Dublin, which opened on Monday, agreed. “It will be the public who do the monitoring.

She has worked in different government departments as an adviser, is close to Leo Varadkar and is a strong media performer. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireGroups of TDs gathered around Leinster House and the National Convention Centre for nervous conversations about their prospects, conscious that they are all each other’s rivals as much as colleagues.The subject of their speculations was Wednesday’s expected announcement of the list of ministers of State – junior ministers – and their chances of inclusion in the second tier of ministerial office.The aspirant junior ministers may have to wait a little longer after the three party leaders failed to conclude a final list at a meeting on Tuesday night. They are due to confer on Wednesday, and an incorporeal Cabinet meeting may be held later on Wednesday to make the appointments. The list may not now be made public until Thursday, Government sources said on Tuesday night.Politicians are obsessed with jobs for politicians it is part of what makes them tick. And even though the public don’t care that much one way or the other, the allocation and distribution of jobs is important for any government. The first few days of the new Government have been overshadowed by the controversy over Dara Calleary’s appointment, or non-appointment. This may be a vast overstatement of its true importance but it is real, nonetheless. So the three party leaders will be very careful about these appointments. That is good news for those whose gender and geography is an advantage.Tight squeezeIt’s a tight squeeze for Fine Gael, whose leader, Leo Varadkar, must contend with the expectations of some of the demoted Cabinet ministers. Of these, Josepha Madigan is considered a “cert” for promotion while former education minister Joe McHugh is also tipped. Like his fellow former Cabinet minister Michael Ring in Mayo, McHugh, a Donegal TD, has geography on his side.So do outgoing junior ministers John Paul Phelan (the southeast) and Patrick O’Donovan (midwest). Their colleagues Damien English and Brendan Griffin have been strong performers but things are filling up now, and there is only one woman so far – so new TD Jennifer Carroll MacNeill could be in line for a quick promotion. She has worked in different government departments as an adviser, is close to Varadkar and is a strong media performer. Other possible promotions are party chairman Martin Hayden. But they can’t all get in.Micheál Martin will use the appointments in a bid to ease some of the anger in his parliamentary party, but will be conscious of the first rule of ministerial appointments: you end up making more enemies than friends. Those who are appointed tend to believe they get there on merit those left out can nurse grudges for years.UnluckyMeath TD Thomas Byrne was unlucky not to make Cabinet and is in line for Helen McEntee’s old job as junior minister for Europe, sources say. Anne Rabbitte was widely tipped for Cabinet and left disappointed, so will feel truly victimised if she is omitted. Mary Butler (Waterford) has the advantages of both gender and geography. Jack Chambers is considered a short-odds bet, while Robert Troy and Charlie McConalogue have strong claims and are likely to be included. Michael Moynihan, Marc McSharry and James Lawless are also in the running but we are running out of slots here.And what of Jim O’Callaghan? The party’s justice spokesman was very publicly snubbed by his leader. Colleagues wonder if he would take a junior gig, though he has indicated to some he would be interested. Limerick deputy Niall Collins was slapped down after a Dáil voting controversy, but he is able and experienced. Whatever Martin does, he will only succeed in annoying more people.The Greens have three jobs and eight contenders. Brian Leddin, Malcolm Noonan and Marc Ó Cathasaigh are all in a strong position, but perhaps the biggest question will be whether Eamon Ryan appoints Neasa Hourigan – formerly the party’s finance spokeswoman but a strong opponent of the coalition deal – to a job in that coalition.Inside the tent, or outside? With 20 junior ministers, it’s a big tent. But there’s never room for everyone."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4293006.1593552694!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord empty theatre eeriness as cabinet takes their seats","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Leo Varadkar: Admits it is “very unusual” not to have a senior minister from the west. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsIn his first Dáil appearance as Heather Humphreys’s replacement, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar confirmed what many were thinking about the botched delivery of Cabinet jobs west of the Shannon – it was a case of cock-up rather than conspiracy.With Taoiseach Micheál Martin back at base busy working himself into his new brief, his predecessor remained in the spotlight on Tuesday, opening for the Government at the start of a day-long Dáil debate on spending. It wasn’t long before Leo let the cat out of the bag about Saturday night’s Cromwellian damnation of the entire west of Ireland by their new political overlords.It seems the parties in the tripartite government simply couldn’t get their act together, which bodes well for the future.Sinn Féin’s Claire Kerrane told the freshly minted Minister for Enterprise and Trade that the non-appointment of a senior representative from the region for the first time in the history of the State was a “huge mistake” and the electorate would not forget it. The TD for Roscommon-Galway doesn’t doubt they will try to “overcompensate” by appointing a clatter of westerners as Ministers of State, but “the damage is done”.The Tánaiste tried to explain what happened, while making sure to point out that such an omission never happened when he was in charge of appointing his own cabinet. “But I think when you have three parties doing it, and perhaps not co-ordinating it, you turn up with unusual results.”Such as fury from Falcarragh to Foynes and a miffed political martyr in Mayo.If a camel is a horse designed by committee, then the cabinet Micheál, Leo and Eamon built is the Merrion Street equivalent and it’s given a lot of people the hump.But they are anxious to make amends. Varadkar admitted “it is very unusual” not to have a senior minister in Connacht and promised they would do better in the next round of appointments.Ruffled feathersIt would be interesting to know when the penny dropped and the Big Three realised they made a complete dog’s dinner of their historic cabinet, the one which officially ended Civil War politics by pitting one half of the country against the other.As part of the Government’s rearguard action to smooth ruffled feathers in the west, the Tánaiste offered comforting words. After all “We DO have Hildegarde Naughten and Dara Calleary there” he cooed, referring to the two “super junior” ministers from Galway and Mayo.Contrary to popular belief, they are full members of cabinet. Oh yes. They are full members of cabinet even if they are not members of cabinet in the constitutional sense.It doesn’t matter that they have no vote either because the Cabinet hasn’t voted on anything for the guts of 40 years.“So their weight and voice will be equal to those of any other member of the Cabinet and I want people to know that.”And in the meantime, before it’s properly decent to have a reshuffle, here’s a rake of Ministers of State to be getting on with . . .If the Dáil had been sitting in Leinster House instead of the Convention Centre in Dublin’s docklands, there might have been angry scenes and heated exchanges about the 33rd government’s inaugural clanger, but the temporary venue is a political passion killer.Even if all 160 TDs were present – most of them high-tailed it back to the cosier confines of Leinster House when not required for speaking purposes – they would have been rattling around in a 2,000-seater auditorium. There is an empty-theatre eeriness about the proceedings.The Ceann Comhairle does his best to spot speakers from behind his drab desk in the middle of the stage. He couldn’t see Leo Varadkar when it was time to begin, scanning the empty rows stretching before him.“Is the Tánaiste here?”Ushers’ torchesA door opened halfway down and Leo beetled in with his new haircut. He was escorted to his place by two ushers, one of whom held a seating map. It might be a good idea to give the ushers torches, then they could shine them on the seats to help TDs find their socially distanced designated berths, then sell them popcorn.There were a few frontbench colleagues scattered around in Leo’s general vicinity. Heather Humphreys (social protection, community and rural developments and the islands) was in the same row as Norma Foley (education), although they were well apart.When Norma arrived, Heather had to move out for her to shuffle past. All that was missing was a chorus of “sorry, sorry, sorry, beg your pardon, sorry, sorry, oops, sorry . . .” as she felt her way along the row.It’s only a matter of time before TDs start opening bags of crisps and rustling sweet wrappers during Leaders’ Questions. The pop-up seats are fancier than the ones in the Dáil. They are described frighteningly as “premium Figueras ‘eight-hour’ chairs”.There won’t be any need for that.Fianna Fáil’s Niall Collins rose to speak on the revised budget questions but the Ceann Comhairle stopped him as soon as he started.“Sorry, am I sharing?” Collins asked, unaware that a party colleague was speaking in the same slot.“Deputy Troy is gesticulating furiously from the gallery” explained the chair, motioning towards the balcony where stood the TD for Longford Westmeath, like he was auditioning for Romeo and Juliet.Dress circleCollins couldn’t see him, as he was below in the stalls.“Where is he?” snapped Niall impatiently, looking around. But he couldn’t glimpse his colleague waving an order paper to gain attention and tipping dangerously towards the edge of the dress circle.“Don’t fall over there Deputy Troy. Please,” cried Seán Ó Fearghaíl with exquisite hamminess.Now Robert appeared to be trying out for Riverdance.“We spot you. Don’t worry,” boomed the Ceann Comhairle, just as we feared the deputy might plunge into the parterre with no musicians in the orchestra pit to do him justice.“So I have to share, I presume, yeah?” said Limerick County’s Collins to the vast swathe of empty seats around him while Troy, out of eyeshot, subsided into his premium Figueras, exhausted.Niall sounded disappointed, to add to his disappointment over not getting a senior job on Saturday. Probably a rap on the knuckles for his involvement in Fianna Fáil’s Votegate, War of the Buttons embarrassment. Still, at least he’s not in the Seanad, like his partner in crime, Timmy Dooley.“It’s quite hard to make yourself seen when you’re so far away” murmured Robert from the balcony when he finally got to speak. Richard Boyd Barrett, on the other hand. You can tell that the People Before Profit comes from a family of theatrical greats. He has no problem projecting in the Convention Centre auditorium.The same might have been said of Mary Lou McDonald, who is similarly vocally accomplished, but she was in Belfast at the funeral of ex-IRA chief Bobby Storey, marching along in the thick of a Covid-19 regulation-defying cortege.She’s had the virus, unlike her Sinn Féin colleagues who travelled from Dublin with her.It’s a pity they couldn’t find any masks all the same."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4290693.1593296152!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"who is in the new cabinet members in profile","story":"Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has been elected Taoiseach by 93 votes to 63, with three abstentions, in a historic Dáil vote which has taken place in Dublin’s Convention Centre. Video: Oireachtas TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party deputy leader Catherine Martin is now Minister   for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht.A new Taoiseach was elected on Saturday and a range of new Ministers were appointed. Here’s all you need to know about them:He became party leader in 2011 just weeks before the general election when Fianna Fáil lost 51 seats in the fall-out from the economic collapse. The five wilderness years were spent reorganising the party and its decimated cohort of TDs.In 2016, Fianna Fáil had a mini-revival, regaining 23 seats and in the 2019 local elections won the most seats of any party. The four years since were spent building up a still volatile parliamentary party but Fianna Fáil suffered further losses in the 2020 election and dropped six seats, partially blamed on the party’s confidence and supply agreement with Fine Gael.The 2020 election had become do or die for Martin, whose Cork South-Central constituency will now be home to three Cabinet members - himself as Taoiseach, his party colleague Michael McGrath and former tánaiste Simon Coveney.The first Cork Taoiseach for 41 years since Jack Lynch, he has been a TD since 1989, served on Fianna Fáil’s front bench since 1995 and held four senior government portfolios during the party’s time in office - foreign affairs, health, education and enterprise.Single-minded and driven with a huge work ethic, the pragmatic Martin can be sensitive to criticism. A good media performer he is however seen by some within the party as distant and colleagues are hoping that communications within the party will improve.Health conscious and very proud of introducing the smoking ban in Ireland, he has pushed the Public Health (Alcohol) Act despite the reluctance of rural TDs within the party.Leo Varadkar, Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and EmploymentAfter a terrible election result and what appeared initially to be a guaranteed trip across the Dáil to the opposition benches, Leo Varadkar’s fortunes have been transformed along with those of his party.His calm and assured leadership performance through the coronavirus pandemic combined with a lengthy stalemate over coalition formation talks have resulted in Fine Gael soaring from losers to clear victors in the opinion polls and with Varadkar moving from spent political force back to key player.Nobody has batted an eyelid at the fact that he will preside over the party’s abandonment of its Civil War stance after a century and move into a historic government coalition with Fianna Fáil and the Green Party.Even less remarked on has been his demotion to Tánaiste for over two years as Fine Gael participates in the previously vilified notion of rotating taoiseach. But he also leads his party into an unprecedented third term in office.A social agenda trailblazer, he is Ireland’s first openly gay minister, the State’s youngest taoiseach and is now Tánaiste. The son of an Irish mother and Indian father, his qualification as a doctor helped during the pandemic and assured him of good publicity when he decided to re-register as a medic and said he would do half a day a week on the helpline for people who suspected they had the Covid-19 virus.Never one to shy away from a photo opportunity, the 41-year-old was also the first taoiseach to assiduously use social media to push his message and his carefully cultivated image. And he got into the much discussed habit during lockdown of quoting a variety of books, films and other media in his speeches.He has also used his speeches to throw out provocative messages reflecting his economic views including his oft quoted controversial remark that Fine Gael should represent those who “get up early in the morning”.He previously served as minister for social protection, for transport and for health and now moves into the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. But it remains to be seen if he will innovate rather than merely manage as he was perceived to have done in his previous portfolios.Michael McGrath - Minister for Public Expenditure and ReformWhen political heavy hitter Michael McGrath (43) became Fianna Fáil’s finance spokesman, then minister for finance Michael Noonan pronounced that the accountant had a big future ahead of him in politics.That future has finally arrived for the Cork South-Central TD who has been finance spokesman since 2011, when Fine Gael was in coalition with Labour and again when Fine Gael relied on Independents and Fianna Fáil’s confidence and supply arrangement.First elected to the Dáil in 2007 he has retained his seat at each subsequent election. It has been a long road for the man who will finally take the helm at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.A constituency rival and colleague of his party leader he is seen as a potential successor, is well liked by his party colleagues and has a well-oiled constituency machine.Originally from Passage West but now living in Carrigaline with his wife Sarah O’Brien and seven children, he secured a first-class honours commerce degree in UCC and qualified as a chartered accountant with KPMG in Cork City.A central member of the party’s negotiating team in the government formation talks, he is a low-key, calm and effective spokesman.Stephen Donnelly - Minister for HealthThe appointment of Stephen Donnelly to Cabinet makes it two Ministers for Health in a row for his Wicklow constituency taking the baton from Simon Harris. It is a job often seen as a political crucifixion for the holder.Elected to the Dáil as an Independent on his first attempt in 2011, he went on to form the Social Democrats with Róisín Shortall and Catherine Murphy in 2015 and surged to a poll-topping performance in Wicklow in 2016.Shortly afterwards however, he left the party following disagreements with his co-leaders.In the Dáil he has since had a number of disagreements with the Social Democrats on the much lauded Sláintecare plan and all eyes will be keenly watching how he deals with the much debated health roadmap.After a short second  as an Independent he joined Fianna Fáil in 2017. While party leader Micheál Martin saw his recruitment as a major coup, his arrival left many noses out of joint in Fianna Fáil. Those tensions and the move, appeared to dent his 2020 election chances but he was elected on the 15th count.Darragh O’Brien, Minister for Housing, Local Government and HeritageAnother member of the Fianna Fáil negotiating team to get a seat at the big table Darragh O’Brien (45) becomes Minister for Housing in the new three-party Government.Party spokesman on housing, planning and local government in the last Dáil, he was first elected to the Dáil in 2007. He lost out in the 2011 decimation of the party in the economic recession. He became one of 51 party TDs to be defeated at the hands of angry voters. He successfully ran for the Seanad that year on the Labour panel and became Seanad leader, keeping a place in the Oireachtas.But his Dáil defeat had a salutary effect, resulting in him building up a strong constituency base with his brother as a local councillor. It may have contributed to local party tensions with Dublin Fingal colleague Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee.He went on to top the poll in Dublin Fingal in the 2016 general election.Before entering politics he worked in the financial services sector for 15 years as an area manager with Life Assurance Company.He was elected to Fingal County Council in 2004 before successfully contesting a Dáil seat in 2007.He is married with a young family.Barry Cowen, Minister for Agriculture and the MarineThe no-nonsense Fianna Fáil spokesman on public expenditure and reform Barry Cowen (52) has been appointed Minister for Agriculture. The man who sealed the fate of the water charges in the 2016 government formation negotiations, was again a key member of the negotiating team this time round.The 2016 talks led to the confidence and supply arrangement with Fine Gael but left Fianna Fáil out of government. The intense five-week\u0026nbspcampaign in 2020 led to government and the reward of a seat at the top table for the Clara, Co Offaly native.A brother of former taoiseach Brian Cowen he has been spokesman in a number of portfolios since his election to the Dáil in 2011. As well as spokesman on public expenditure and reform he also held the position of spokesman on environment and local government and on social protection.A married father of four, he was first elected to Offaly county council in 1999, where he served until his election to the Dáil to the seat vacated by his brother.A member of the Cowen family has represented Offaly in the Dáil continuously since 1977. His father Bernard Cowen was elected in 1969 but lost his seat in 1973. He regained it in 1977 and held it until his death in 1984.Norma Foley, Minister for EducationKerry TD Norma Foley, who nominated her party leader Micheál Martin to be Taoiseach has been appointed Minister for Education, five months after her election to the Dáil for the first time.Martin is said to prefer TDs to have done at least a term on the backbenches but the new TD who is a teacher by profession, has shown herself to be an impressive performer and has been effective at the Covid-19 committee in the questioning of witnesses. Calm, courteous and well prepared, she has a great grasp of detail and the bigger picture.The Tralee native took the fifth and final seat in the general election in Kerry, edging out her running mate and outgoing TD John Brassil.It is her second run at the Dáil, having been on the Fianna Fáil ticket in the 2007 election, when she was selected over Brassil.Since 2004, Foley has represented the people of Tralee Municipal District on Kerry County Council, topping the poll in last May’s local elections.She has also served on Tralee Town Council, and held the position of mayor of Tralee on three occasions, most recently in 20172018. In 20182019 she served as mayor of Kerry.She is the daughter of the late Denis Foley, who served as a TD for the constituency for 18 years, broken up by a three-year stint as a senator. He was named as the holder of an undisclosed offshore Ansbacher account.She is married to fellow teacher Denis Maguire.Simon Coveney, Minister for Foreign Affairs and DefenceHe may have lost his role as tánaiste but Simon Coveney (48) has retained the much coveted position of Minister for Foreign Affairs. Greatly admired by departmental staff as probably the hardest working minister in that portfolio, he has received much acclaim for his efforts in dealing with Brexit and is seen as the driving political force in Ireland securing its temporary seat on the United Nations Security Council.Loved by the party’s grassroots and accessible to TDs and Senators, he still retains ambitions to be party leader and is seen as likely to get there. A cautious and moderate politician, his tearaway teenage years when he was expelled from Clongowes school for drinking and partying, before being asked back – are at odds with his later serious image.From Cork’s so-called merchant class and a keen rugby and sailing fan, he has a degree in agriculture and land management and was catapulted into the world of politics following the death of his father Hugh, a TD and former minister, in 1998.He later successfully ran for the European Parliament in 2004 but returned to Ireland for the 2007 general election and he has successfully retained his seat since. He served as minister for agriculture for all five years of the Enda Kenny-led administration from 2011 later adding defence to his portfolio when Eamon Gilmore resigned as tánaiste.From 2016 he spent just a year as minister for housing, when his pledge to end all emergency hotel and B\u0026ampB\u0026nbspaccommodation backfired, before he moved to the hallowed halls of the Department of Foreign Affairs.Seen as open in his approach and meticulous in his work practices, he has risen solidly and steadily through the party’s ranks and his experience in Brexit talks paved the way for his central role in the government formation talks.Paschal Donohoe, Minister for FinanceAs soon as Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe confirmed he was putting his name forward as a unity candidate for the presidency of the Eurogroup, it was clear he was confident of returning to his office in Merrion Street.Ever cautious and highly political he would have been slow to put his reputation on the line without some assurance of keeping his own job while he applied for the top spot in the influential club of finance ministers from countries that use the euro.The deadline for that role came a day before the outcome of the vote on the programme for government.He is highly popular within the party although less so after his poison chalice position as director of elections for both the Dáil and Seanad elections.The electorate proved less than happy with the party’s budgetary and spending policies and Fine Gael lost 12 Dáil seats. It was also embarrassed by the failure to have any women elected to the Upper House.Nine years a TD for Dublin Central, the 45-year-old has held the finance portfolio since 2017. He previously served as a minister of state and then as minister for transport.A central member of the party’s leadership and key to the government formation talks he is viewed as culturally one of the more rounded Cabinet members with an interest in books, film and theatre.The former sales manager with a multinational firm will need all his skills as a party persuader and negotiator to navigate the traumatic economic conditions facing the State while keeping faith with his wary Fianna Fáil and suspicious Green Party colleagues.He will be happy to leave his one stated regret – not managing to control the costs of the new national children’s hospital – to Fianna Fáil’s Michael McGrath who takes up the re-ided Department of Public Expenditure and Reform portfolio.He is married with two children and lives in Phibsborough, Dublin.Heather Humphreys, Minister for Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the IslandsOne of the Ministers always seen as sure of keeping her seat at the cabinet table, Heather Humphreys fits the criteria for geography, gender and ability.A border-county TD, she was the first woman elected to the Cavan-Monaghan constituency in 2011, when she took over from fellow Presbyterian Fine Gael colleague Seymour Crawford.Now in her third Dáil term and one of three female TDs in the five-seat constituency, she is highly regarded within Fine Gael and viewed as capable and a safe pair of hands.A first-term backbench TD when she was appointed to cabinet in 2011 as minister for arts, heritage and the Gaeltacht she won plaudits for her stewardship of the successful 1916 Rising centenary commemorations.A loyal ally of former taoiseach Enda Kenny she was re-appointed to the portfolio by him in 2016 but was one of the first Ministers to declare her support for Leo Varadkar in the 2017 leadership contest.He promoted her to the Business, Enterprise and Innovation portfolio in 2017 following the resignation of tánaiste Frances Fitzgerald.A business background through her work with Ulster Bank and as manager of Cootehill Credit Union also helped secure her appointment. The coronavirus pandemic brought her biggest political challenge with the crisis facing thousands of businesses and leaving a 25 per cent unemployment rate. Grant and income support schemes, loans and other initiatives have helped cushion the initial blow.The Government will now have to deal with the fallout from a controversial High Court judgment striking out a sectoral employment order and ruling that she had acted outside her powers in making the order for the electrical industry.Her career in finance, experience as minister for business and farming background in Co Monaghan, where she is married with two adult daughters, make her a good candidate for the rural development portfolio.Elected for the first time in the 2011 general election, she lives in Aghabog, near Monaghan town, and her family is from the Cavan-Monaghan border area.Helen McEntee, Minister for JusticeA reserved but smart politician Helen McEntee (33) from Castletown, Co Meath, has been a TD since 2013 when she won the byelection following the death of her father Shane McEntee.Minister of State for European Affairs since 2017, the Meath East TD proved her mettle in the ever present and fraught Brexit crisis, leading the Government’s response on a number of related issues.She has been described as Leo Varadkar’s “secret weapon” and is considered level-headed and a very good negotiator. Former president of the European Council Donald Tusk called her “diligent” and an “exceptional diplomat”. She is one of 10 vice-presidents of the European People’s Party, Fine Gael’s centre-right representative grouping in the EU.Graduating from DCU in 2007 having studied law, politics and economics, she worked briefly in a Citibank subsidiary. She later completed a masters in journalism and communications and worked with her father in Leinster House, first in opposition and then when he was appointed minister of state.A supporter of Varadkar’s from the start she has been by his side throughout the Brexit crisis and has a keen understanding of its intricacies and complexities.Simon Harris, Minister for Higher Education, Innovation and ScienceDespite his increased stature during the coronavirus pandemic as minister for health Simon Harris (33) became a focus of increasing speculation in recent days that he would be demoted from Cabinet.In the fateful 2017 Fine Gael leadership campaign he took sides early on in favour of Simon Coveney as opposed to Varadkar but held onto the health portfolio Kenny appointed him to in 2016.Described as the “teenage” minister when first appointed to the hugely significant but poison chalice department, he has visibly aged in the past three months through the stresses of the Covid-19 crisis.He remained a popular choice in his Wicklow constituency in the election despite concerns about a shortage of hospital beds, the spiralling cost of the new national children’s hospital and the recruitment and retention difficulties around healthcare staff.Those issues disappeared during the pandemic with the unprecedented takeover of all private hospitals and the return home of emigrant doctors and nurses to assist with the crisis.These problems have re-emerged but are no longer an issue for Harris as he moves on from the department described as a war zone.A social media expert, he is one of the party’s top media performers, assured and persuasive in his delivery, accessible and generally guaranteed to avoid political gaffes.He first became engaged in politics while campaigning for his younger brother and other children with autism. He topped the poll in the local elections and secured the highest vote in the country through his social media campaign.While a councillor, he approached then Seanad leader Frances Fitzgerald, became her parliamentary assistant and moved into Leinster House politics from there.Viewed as having an uneasy relationship with his party leader he is far from the inner circle. He is married with one child and lives in Greystones, Co Wicklow.Eamon Ryan - Minister for Climate Action, Communications Networks and TransportIt has been a torrid few months for Green Party leader Eamon Ryan (56) as he enters Government with a deeply scarred and ided party.In all the controversy the spectacular success in winning 12 seats in the general election has been all but forgotten.Now appointed to his long sought role in climate action and transport he will have little time to relish the challenge as he bids to heal the schism within the party.It is a reflection of the party’s isions that when he was mired in controversy after repeating a racial slur in the Dáil that it took a minister from another party, Charlie Flanagan of Fine Gael to publicly defend the Dublin Bay South TD by saying he did not have a racist bone in his body.But through all the accusations, insults and recriminations he has been calm, conciliatory and with party deputy leader Catherine Martin has persuaded the party’s membership to decisively back an unprecedented government with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.He now faces a leadership contest against his deputy leader but has remained sanguine about the prospect.An impassioned speaker prone to gaffes, including a call during the election campaign for the re-introduction of wolves, he nonetheless led a team to rebuild the party after its disastrous first foray into coalition government after which it lost all six Dáil seats.A councillor before his 2007 election to the Dáil he previously ran a bicycle shop and cycling holiday business.He is married to journalist Victoria White and they have four sons.Catherine Martin - Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the GaeltachtDublin Rathdown TD and deputy Green party leader Catherine Martin (47) emerged as a surprising contender for the top job in the party.Her stance on coalition has strained the previously close working relationship with Eamon Ryan but his move to appoint her as lead negotiator in the coalition talks was seen as an inspired move.Cautious by nature, she is said to seek advice widely and does not say things lightly. Some in her party are said to find it hard to gauge where she stands and those on the other side of the negotiating table have described her as an enigma.As an influential voice in the party she will have a significant role in attempting to heal the party’s schism.From her first days in the Dáil she forged good relations across all parties and founded the Irish Women’s Parliamentary Caucus in the Oireachtas, pressed for anti-bullying protocols in the Leinster House campus.From Carrickmacross, Co Monaghan she trained as a classical singer and after graduating from NUI Maynooth, she taught music and English at St Tiernan’s Community School in Ballinteer.Her initial foray into politics was when she was co-opted to her brother Vincent P Martin’s council seat in Monaghan in the 1990s. She returned to politics in Dublin, was elected as a councillor in 2014 and came from nowhere to win a Dáil seat in 2016.Her husband Francis Noel Duffy became a TD in 2020 and took an opposing view in rejecting the coalition deal. The couple has three children.Roderic O’Gorman - Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and IntegrationLong predicted to make the high table Roderic O’Gorman (38) is one of the Green party’s most experienced politicians. His victory in the 2020 general election marked his 10th foray in 15 years including four general elections, two byelections and four local elections. The party’s justice and equality spokesman he was on the negotiating team and insisted in the talks that the coalition must make a commitment to end direct provision.A former chairman of the party he served from 2011 to 2019.From Tyrellstown he lives with his partner Ray Healy in Blanchardstown. A lecturer at the Brexit Institute and School of Law and Government in DCU he is a graduate of Trinity College and the London School of Economics.Close to both party leader Ryan and deputy leader Martin he is courteous, considered and reflective in his deliberations and well regarded across the party. He is a fan of TV shows West Wing, Game of Thrones and Arrested Development.Hildegarde Naughton - Minister of State at the Department of Climate Action, she will be attending CabinetOne of the survivors of the electoral cull of Fine Gael TDs, Hildegarde Naughton (43) has consistently grown in experience and stature since she first arrived on the political stage in 2009.That was the year the former schoolteacher was first elected to Galway City Council, becoming mayor two years later. Mentored and promoted by then taoiseach Enda Kenny, the Galway West TD was appointed to the Seanad in 2013.In 2016 she seized the chance to get on the Fine Gael ticket in the general election after Barry Walsh stepped aside from politics on health grounds.Chair of the Oireachtas Committee for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment in the last Dáil she fought the green fight in an uphill and forthright battle to persuade many reluctant party colleagues to the cause and has been Fine Gael’s leading environmentalist.That role, that experience and her capability has brought her to the Cabinet table - along with the need to have some gender balance at cabinet and take account of geographical considerations.Outside politics she is a talented singer who has performed and won awards for her roles in musical theatre. While a senator she established a group called Bel Canto with two other sopranos, who sang at charity events. She has described her musical interest as “my golf”.Pippa Hackett, “Super Junior” Minister of StateGreen Party Senator Pippa Hackett’s appointment as a “Super Junior” Minister of State is the first appointment of a Senator to Cabinet since the early 1980s.She takes on the role of Minister of State for Agriculture with responsibility for land use and bioersity.Her appointment has taken some by surprise amid speculation that someone among the party’s TDs might be selected.A farmer from Offaly and the party’s agriculture spokeswoman, she was elected to the Seanad in a byelection in November when a vacancy arose following the election of then Senator Grace O’Sullivan to the European parliament.But the move is as much a surprise because it is virtually unprecedented.The last time a Senator took on a ministerial role was in 1981 when then taoiseach Garrett FitzGerald nominated Senator James Dooge as minister for foreign affairs, a portfolio he held for a year.A vocal supporter of the programme for government, Hackett was elected unopposed to the agricultural panel in the Seanad when the other parties opted not to contest the seat.Formerly an Offaly county councillor she lost out in the general election for the Laois-Offaly constituency when she was eliminated in the final round.Originally from Ballandine, Co Mayo she is married with four children and lives in Edenderry, Co Offaly.Dara Calleary - Chief whipNew Government chief whip Dara Calleary has Fianna Fáil in his DNA. The Mayo TD who has been in the Dáil since 2007 and is the son of late TD and former minister of state Sean Calleary who served in the Dáil from 1973 to 1992. His grandfather Phelim was TD for Mayo from 1952 to 1969.Affable and steady, popular with party colleagues he is deputy leader and viewed as a safe pair of hands.He has had a previous taste of government when he served as minister of state for labour affairs and public service transformation from 2009 to 2011 in the Fianna Fáil, Green Party coalition.A graduate of Trinity College with a degree in business and politics he has served as the party’s spokesman on justice, equality and defence, as well as spokesman on jobs, enterprise and innovation.Paul Gallagher SC, Attorney GeneralThis will be Paul Gallagher’s second time in the job, having previously served from 2007 to 2011. During his first term, he was called to offer legal advice on some of the biggest issues ever to face an Irish government, including the bank guarantee scheme, the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency and the International Monetary Fund Troika programme.He is regarded as one of Ireland’s top barristers, with a fearsome work ethic."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Testing blitz as recent jump in infections in Australia stokes fears of second wavePolice tweet picture of man arrested for carrying a Hong Kong independence flagHistoric move will allow authorities to crack down on subversive and secessionist activityRisks of viruses crossing species barrier into humans in densely populated regions highlightedWashington plans to target Chinese officials undermining Asian financial hub autonomyJustin Trudeau called on Beijing to cease the \u0026lsquoarbitrary detention\u0026rsquo of two CanadiansMany were struck as they were planting seeds across Bihar state in east of countryThe decades-long project sees a constellation of 35 satellites circling the Earth to rival the US-owned Global Positioning System (GPS)Regime rows back on threat to deploy troops near border amid rising tensionsOfficials prepare \u0026lsquoretaliatory punishment\u0026rsquo after anti-North balloons arrived from SouthBan on cruise ships extended beyond June 30th cases increase as more citizens return homeCovid-19 outbreak in staff at Tyson foods in Arkansas sparks Beijing U-turn on policyChina says draft law is aimed at separatist activity, subversion, terrorism and collusion abroadSamira Imin\u0026rsquos father was incarcerated for three years in XinjiangChina may have shut down its controversial re-education camps, but minorities are still persecutedDelhi says Chinese dammed a river and lay in wait for clash in which 20 Indians diedCases widely seen as Chinese \u0026lsquohostage diplomacy\u0026rsquo following arrest of Huawei\u0026rsquos chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou in VancouverInvestigators say they have found gun and are talking to two \u0026lsquopeople of interest\u0026rsquoTensions remain high despite two governments agreeing to de-escalate confrontationAustralia says it will not name country responsibleStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4293419.1593592330!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus dozens of melbourne suburbs locked down again after rise in cases","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t A nurse carries out a swab test for Covid-19 in Melbourne, Australia, on Wednesday. Photograph: James RossEPAAuthorities will lock down more than 300,000 people in suburbs north of Melbourne for a month from late on Wednesday to contain the risk of infection after two weeks of double-digit rises in new coronavirus cases in Australia’s second most populous state.Australia has fared better than many countries in the pandemic, with about 7,920 cases, 104 deaths and fewer than 400 active cases, but the recent jump has stoked fears of a second wave of Covid-19, echoing concerns expressed in other countries.From midnight, more than 30 suburbs in Australia’s second-biggest city will return to stage three restrictions, the third-strictest level in curbs to control the pandemic. That means residents will be confined to home except for grocery shopping, health appointments, work or caregiving, and exercise.The restrictions will be accompanied by a testing blitz that authorities hope will extend to half the population of the area affected, and for which borders will be patrolled, authorities said. The measures come as curbs ease across the rest of the state of Victoria, with restaurants, gyms and cinemas reopening in recent weeks.Victoria recorded 73 fresh cases on Tuesday from 20,682 tests, following an increase of 75 cases on Monday. State premier Daniel Andrews warned on Wednesday that the return of broader restrictions across Melbourne remained a possibility.“If we all stick together these next four weeks, we can regain control of that community transmission . . . across metropolitan Melbourne,” Andrews said at a briefing. “Ultimately if I didn’t shut down those postcodes I’d be shutting down all postcodes. We want to avoid that.”Victoria’s spike in cases has been linked to staff members at hotels housing returned travellers for which quarantine protocols were not strictly followed. Victorian state authorities have announced an investigation into the matter.“We’ve had an increase in cases but they’re almost all in a very defined geographic area,” said acting chief medical officer Paul Kelly. Some other Australian states and territories are preparing to open borders, but applying limits and quarantine measures to citizens of Victoria as the school holiday season gets under way.South Australia, the country’s fifth most populous state, has had just three new cases in the past month. But citing the spike in coronavirus infections, on Tuesday it cancelled its scheduled reopening to other parts of the nation.New South Wales (NSW), Australia’s most populous state, has stopped short of closing its borders to all Victorians, but those holidaying from hotspot areas – not permitted under NSW rules – can be handed a fine of A$11,000 (€6,770) or jailed if they are detected, state authorities said. State cases rose by 14 overnight, all returned travellers in quarantine.The delays reopening internal borders cast doubts over a federal plan to set up “travel bubble” with neighbouring New Zealand that would allow movement between the two countries. – ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4292677.1593537762!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland left out as eu opens borders to 15 states including australia canada and japan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA passenger iat El Part de Llobregat airport in Barcelona. Photograph: Ale Jandro GarciaEPAEuropean Union member states approved a list of 15 countries around the world that are deemed safe for travel, agreeing that member states should open their border to them for all travel from Wednesday.Unusually among EU member states, Ireland is not part of the agreement because it is not in the Schengen area of free travel and has a Common Travel Area with the United Kingdom. Ireland was invited to take part in the joint agreement, but could only do so if Britain also agreed due to the open border, and it opted not to do so, The  understands. Denmark is also opting out.The countries deemed safe are: Algeria, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia, and Uruguay. China is also to be included, as long as Beijing agrees that EU citizens will also be allowed to travel there in turn.To qualify countries needed to have coronavirus infections that were close to or below the EU average, and to open their borders to EU citizens in turn, but political considerations also came into play.\u0026nbspAgreement on the list of countries was repeatedly delayed as countries struggled to forge consensus, with isions between countries with large tourism industries which pushed for greater opening and those which were more cautious.The United States was not included due to pervasive level of coronavirus infections there.The list is expected to be reviewed every two weeks, and countries could be removed from the safe list if their epidemiological situation changes.To take part, Ireland would need to close off travel to all states but those on the “safe” list. The agreement notes that it “also includes Ireland and the United Kingdom if they decide to align”.While the Schengen countries opted to jointly close their borders to travel from outside the EU on March 17th, Ireland went its own way, maintaining open borders while requiring arrivals to quarantine for two weeks.Due to the quarantine, which also applies to arrivals in Ireland from EU member states, several countries in the EU including Germany, France, the Netherlands and Denmark advise their citizens against non-essential travel to Ireland.“Ireland meets the criteria for low infection rates in the new travel guide model, but we still advise against any unnecessary travel to Ireland because there is a 14 day home quarantine for people traveling to Ireland from abroad,” the advice to citizens on Denmark’s foreign affairs ministry reads.Asked whether it was a concern that some EU countries could have greater ease of travel with the 15 global countries than with Ireland, the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said the situation would be subject to review.“In accordance with government policy, which is based on official public health advice, the Department of Foreign Affairs continues to advise against all non-essential travel overseas. This includes Great Britain but does not apply to Northern Ireland,” a foreign affairs spokesman said.“This advice is subject to review and as per recent statements the Government is giving consideration to a possible roadmap for the resumption of international travel.”.Under the agreement, people travelling for essential reasons are allowed to travel regardless of which country they are arriving from. Essential workers include healthcare workers, seasonal agriculture workers, transport personnel, diplomats, people travelling for urgent family reasons, refugees, incoming international students, and highly skilled workers. Countries taking part in the agreement are free to impose additional precautions on these travellers, such as requiring them to quarantine.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4292699.1593546508!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"why are france and germany advising against travel to ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Aer Lingus planes lined up at Dublin Airport. Photograph: Alan Betson Germany, France, the Netherlands, and Denmark are among the European Union member states that advise their citizens against non-essential travel to Ireland.It’s rare for such countries to advise against travel to a fellow EU member state, since an agreement in Brussels that most countries in the bloc would open their borders to one another on June 15th.Why is Ireland left out? It’s due to its unusual position in the EU rather than our rate of coronavirus infections.Ireland is not in the Schengen area of free travel, unlike most EU member states. Instead, we have a Common Travel Area with Britain that is decades older.Now that the United Kingdom is no longer an EU member state and is choosing not to collaborate even on many things it is still invited to take part in, this puts Ireland in an awkward position.Because of the open border with the North, it has little choice but to follow the lead of the UK.When the Schengen states agreed to close their borders to travel from outside the EU on March 17th, Ireland and the UK went their own way. They kept their borders open, and ultimately introduced a requirement for incoming travellers to quarantine at home for two weeks after arriving.It’s this quarantine requirement that many EU states cite as the reason for advising their citizens against travel to Ireland. Nevertheless, their borders are open to travellers coming in the other direction, arriving from Ireland.“This is an advice from our side against travelling which is due to the fact that Ireland, and also Britain, have quarantine requirements that are in place for German citizens when they enter the country,” a German government spokesman said.“It doesn’t affect at all the status of Irish citizens or people travelling from Ireland.”This has led to the unusual situation that it may be easier to travel between countries like Germany and some of the non-EU states on the list – such as Rwanda, Tunisia and Uruguay – than with Ireland.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Plan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4293023.1593558854!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fda issues guidance for coronavirus vaccine approval","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAnthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, says a vaccine is still some time away. Photograph: Al DragoBloombergThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Tuesday released guidance for approving a coronavirus vaccine, saying the vaccine has to prevent or decrease disease severity in at least 50 per cent of people who are inoculated.More than 100 vaccines are being tested worldwide against the virus, which has claimed more 126,100 lives in the United States.In May, the Trump administration announced a program called “Operation Warp Speed” to speed up the development of Covid-19 therapeutics and vaccines, as the country has none approved for treating the virus.Several companies such as Moderna, Pfizer and AstraZeneca are in the race to develop a vaccine.“While the FDA is committed to expediting this work, we will not cut corners in our decisions,” the FDA said.Experts have said it could take 12 to 18 months for a vaccine to be developed.Vaccine developers have also been asked for data to support use during pregnancy and to show safety and effectiveness in children, the health regulator said.“The guidelines are pretty standard, they look pretty much like influenza vaccine guidelines,” said Gregory Poland, director of Mayo vaccine research group. “I don’t think that’s a high bar. I think that’s a low to maybe an appropriate bar for a first-generation Covid-19 vaccine.”Flu vaccines are 30 -70 per cent effective in any given year, according to Jefferies analyst Michael Yee. The guidelines could be seen as a relatively high bar given the urgency to accelerate availability of a vaccine, Yee added.Dr Anthony Fauci, the United States government’s top infectious diseases expert, cautioned that there is no guarantee of a safe and effective vaccine. – ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"around third no coronavirus symptoms may have developed immunity","story":"Until now, efforts to measure levels of protection against coronavirus have focused on antibodies, which have proved an unreliable measure. Sampling in the UK suggests that around seven per cent of people in England have developed antibodies, rising to 17 per cent in London. The new research suggests that levels of T-cell immunity may be significantly higher.Antibody testing has been dogged by problems, as tests have proved unreliable and it is not clear how much immunity antibodies confer. The results have yet to be peer-reviewed. At the end of May, tests found that just 7.3 percent of Stockholm\u0027s inhabitants had developed Covid-19 antibodies by the end of April. This was far short of the 25 percent Sweden\u0027s state epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, had estimated, but Prof Ljunggren said that, with more recent Stockholm studies showing that about 17 percent of people had tested positive for antibodies, the predictions did not look so far out. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"government urged rethink air bridges eu scheme open borders","story":"The Government was under pressure to rethink its air bridges plan after the EU unveiled a list of countries whose tourists could undermine the scheme.EU ambassadors agreed a list of 15 non-EU countries for which border controls could be lifted from July 1, enabling travellers from “low risk” countries including Algeria, Japan, China, Rwanda, Thailand, Morocco and Tunisia to fly freely into Europe.Holiday experts and officials admitted it opened potential loopholes that could allow tourists from the 15 nations to use the Government’s planned air bridges in Europe to enter the UK, sidestepping the requirement to quarantine for 14 days.The UK’s locator form which all arrivals are expected to complete only requires their port of arrival, the country from which they took the airline, train or ferry to arrive in the UK and passport details, not the country of origin.Henry Smith, the Conservative chair of the cross party Future of Aviation Group, said: “It starts to beg the question as to whether we should have a broader opening up rather than bilateral corridors.”On Friday, BA, EasyJet and Ryanair will bring their case in the High Court seeking to overturn the Government’s entire quarantine policy which they claim is “irrational and disproportionate.”Tomorrow (thur) the Government is expected to unveil its list of more than 50 countries which it proposes should have “air bridges” that will exempt holidaymakers from self-isolating for 14 days in the UK. Most Western European nations and the British territories are expected to be on it.Paul Charles, a spokesman for the Quash Quarantine campaign group of 500 travel and hospitality businesses, said: “The policy of travel corridors is going to have holes in it as you cannot create a watertight system unless you stop all travel.“Europe is in effect dictating to us. Unless the UK closes itself off from the rest of Europe, it is going to be impossible to keep these visitors out. We are connected to Europe and if Europe opens up, we open up too because of the nature of the transport links including ferry and rail.”Other countries on the EU list of 15 include Australia, Canada, Georgia, Montenegro, New Zealand, Serbia, South Korea, Uruguay, San Marino, Andorra and Monaco. Chinese tourists would be allowed only if Chinese authorities also allowed in EU visitors. The United States, Russia and Brazil are excluded because of their high Coronavirus rates.Italy last night said it was opting out of opening its borders to the non-EU countries although it is still keen for an air bridge with the UK.However, Andrew Flintham, managing director of TUI, Britain’s biggest holiday firm, warned that some other countries might follow Greece in banning British travellers because of concerns over the UK’s higher Coronavirus rate.“There’s still going to be a few bumps in the road,” he said. “I think there will still be some countries that won’t be opening up which means we will be cancelling a few more holidays.”British Airways, Easyjet and Ryanair were among airlines that yesterday announced the cancellation of planes to Greece until July 15 when the Greeks will review their decision to suspend UK flights.A Government source said the aim of public health measures was to target the country from which people originated and Border Force could legitimately ask them to quarantine.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"happened use r rate","story":"Throughout much of the pandemic it has seemed as if ministers and their scientific advisers could barely get through a sentence without mentioning the “R”.A hitherto obscure epidemiological concept which describes whether a disease is spreading or in retreat, the term was referenced incessantly at the daily Downing Street briefings.An R value of less than 1, denoting a decrease in the rate of transmission, was even made an explicit condition of the official strategy to exit lockdown.As with much of The Government’s core messaging, the idea successfully cut through.Ordinary people began to speak of the R as if they were discussing the weather, or the score of a football match.It is striking, therefore, that amid the clamour of public statements made in response to the surge of cases in Leicester, and the subsequent local lockdown, the R value has scarcely been mentioned.Addressing the House of Commons on Monday, Matt Hanock instead spoke of the seven-day infection rate and of cases per 100,000 (Leicester has 135 - three times\u0027 the next highest city).The Health Secretary also talked of daily hospital admissions for Covid-19 in the area (between six and 10 in Leicester, against one at other trusts).Rather than a volte-face, however, Mr Hancock’s choice of jargon reflects a discomfort with the R among policy makers that has been growing for some time.As far back as the second week of June a senior government scientist, speaking to journalists in an off-the-record briefing, issued a “word of caution” about the term, particularly when applied regionally.He explained that as the number of cases comes down, the R painted a less and less nuanced picture.For example, while the R for the UK as a whole on that day (June 19) was 0.7 to 0.9, the growth rate was between -4 and -2 per cent.“R estimates do not tell us how quickly an epidemic is changing and different diseases with the same R can result in epidemics that grow at very different speeds,” a spokesman explained.“For instance, a disease with R2 with infection lasting years will grow much more slowly than a disease with R2 with infection lasting days.“Growth rates provide us with different information to R estimates, by informing us of the size and speed of change, whereas R value only gives us information on the direction of change.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"leicesters lockdown cricket ban mad rules defy science","story":"Pity poor Leicester! Just as the sweet smell of freedom was in the air, the suffocating pall of a new lockdown has once again spread across the city. While the rest of the country is preparing for pubs and restaurants to (partially) reopen, its residents must batten down the hatches. And for how long? No one knows, because the strategic rationale is impossible to discern.As we emerge from three months of “hibernation”, as Boris Johnson termed it, is this the shape of things to come? Every time there is a spike in a town or city, is it to be put back in quarantine? How big does the increase have to be before the threshold is reached for new isolation? Does anyone have a clue?Sir Peter Soulsby, the Leicester mayor, pointed out that the Department of Health knew of an outbreak in the city two weeks ago, so perhaps action should have been taken earlier. Since then, he had been “struggling to get information from them about what data they had that led them to believe there was a particular problem here and struggling to get them to keep a level of testing in Leicester”. Eventually, on Monday, he was given the bad news. Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, is using public health powers to shut the city down once more.So what, you may ask. All this does is to replicate what has happened elsewhere in the world whenever there has been a fresh outbreak. China closed down parts of the country, as did Italy, with police roadblocks to stop people going in or out. In Germany, there have been localised lockdowns. So why not here? If one particular town is harbouring more of the virus than the rest of the country, does it not make sense to put it into quarantine?Moreover, this is hardly a new approach when pestilence is on the wing. In 1665, the Derbyshire village of Eyam was closed off to the rest of the world to stop the bubonic plague spreading. Indeed, the residents volunteered to isolate, and about half of them died.But Covid is not the plague. Nowhere near it. As we keep being told, for the vast majority it is a mild illness. An increase in infection, therefore, is only a serious problem if the virus is transmitted to the most vulnerable, for whom it is potentially fatal. So protect them, do not reimpose controls on everyone.If we are going to close down cities or regions every time there is a rise in the number of people testing positive, we will never come out of this nightmare. In any case, we don’t really know what has been going on in Leicester because the data is all over the place. It is not even clear whether Leicester’s new spike is a function of more testing – though scientists have evidently decided not.Part of the new measures include closing schools, although since so few pupils are being educated at the moment this may not be a great sacrifice.Yet, as Mr Hancock told MPs on Monday: “The good news is that this virus hardly impacts on children, they are very, very low risk, that’s one of the saving graces of this virus.” So why close them then? This does not bode well for the Government’s promise to open schools “fully” in September.All this is happening while thousands of hospital beds lie empty, which must be a first during a pandemic, and with the latest ONS figures showing that the current number of weekly deaths is below average.Even as the lockdown eases, many of the rules are hard to understand. Why should a father not walk his daughter down the aisle for a wedding? What scientific evidence is there for limiting the number of wedding guests to 30? Why are outdoor swimming pools not opening, but pubs are? Why can tennis be played but not club cricket, when they both use a ball that other players handle? There is no record of a cricket ball ever acting as a vector for disease.These rules are all so arbitrary – an extension of that peculiar national officiousness that had already taken a grip in this country long before Covid reached our shores. In deciding who can do what and when, a committee of Whitehall busybodies must be having a field day.But what would YOU do, comes the cry. Well, here is an idea put forward by scientists every bit as eminent \u2028as those on the Government’s advisory group, Sage. It was proposed in the Royal Society Open Science journal by Professor Julian Peto, of \u2028the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.The plan involves taking a medium-sized city and lifting the lockdown entirely to discover if weekly testing of all residents can control the spread of the virus.Testing would be by way of quick and simple saliva tests, known as RT-Lamp tests, which are cheaper than those most commonly used to detect coronavirus.Those who test positive would be placed under quarantine with all members of their household. As it takes around six-and-a-half days on average for a person to pass on the virus, researchers say this could stop transmission of the deadly virus at a population level.The experiment has the potential to eliminate coronavirus in weeks and offers a way out of repeat lockdowns. “It seems pretty obvious,” Prof Peto said. “If we test regularly, we could completely stop transmission.”It may be pretty obvious to Prof Peto, but he has been touting this idea around since early April and only now is it being taken up in Southampton on a trial basis. Testing the whole population would be infinitely cheaper than the colossal amounts already spent and the cost of an economic depression. If the Government wants to get us out of the pandemic mire, this is how it has to be done.Random lockdowns every time there are a few more Covid cases will be a disaster, undermining the revival of confidence that is the key to recovery, far more so than Mr Johnson’s planned building splurge. Prof Peto recently said the reason why his proposal had not attracted earlier attention from the Government was “a deep mystery”. It is by no means the only one.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"melbourne launches ambitious plan lock 10 suburbs","story":"More than 300,000 people in Melbourne will be placed back under lockdown as new Covid-19 cases continue to climb.Daniel Andrews, the premier of Victoria, of which Melbourne is capital, also announced he had asked Scott Morrison, the prime minister, to ert international flights away from Melbourne for the next two weeks.Victoria recorded its 14th consecutive day of double-digit growth on Tuesday, with 64 new cases, after 75 on Monday. The steady increases prompted Mr Andrews to announce stay-at-home orders for ten Melbourne post code zones, coming into effect on Wednesday.The residents of the coronavirus hot spots will only be permitted to leave their homes for essential activities: to exercise, go to school or work, undertake care responsibilities, and buy food and other essentials.Mr Andrews told a news conference that police patrols would be conducted in the areas to ensure people were complying with the new rules.In a statement, Mr Andrews thanked health workers and volunteers but said “it’s just not been enough”.“Too many people are still going out when they’re sick. Too many people are ignoring rules about physical distancing and pretending restrictions don’t matter. Yet still, somehow, more than a thousand people, when asked, refused to be tested. It shows us that still, somehow, too many people are not taking this seriously. That means… a return to tougher restrictions.”Tony Blakely, an epidemiologist and public health medicine specialist at the University of Melbourne, told SBS that he imagined the restrictions would “essentially be a return to the lockdown we had in place in March and April”, adding that for maximum effect the definition of an essential worker would be “reasonably tighter” than during the previous lockdown.Professor Blakely said schools would likely need to close.Schools can be open when you\u0027re doing a suppression strategy - when you accept there\u0027s going to be a low level of the virus... we\u0027re trying to stop all transmission, so schools would need to close in my view.”He said a locked-down suburb should have “movement of essential workers and essential shopping but not much beyond that”, adding that applying lockdown rules to inidual suburbs would “require some enforcement”, and mentioned the possibility of “military patrols”.The total number of known cases in Victoria is now 2,158, out of a population of about 6.6 million.The premier said in his statement that the state’s chief health officer had advised the government a number of cases from late May and early June were linked to an “infection control breach in the hotel quarantine programme”.“Clearly there has been a failure in that programme… And to say I am disappointed about what’s happened would be an understatement.”He announced the establishment of an inquiry, led by a former judge, into the operation of the hotel quarantine programme.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/19/12/city-bank-england.jpg","title":"coronavirus recovery v shape recession uk gdp bank england andy haldane","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Bank of England chief economist says rebound ‘sooner and faster’ than expectedThe UK economy is on course for a “V-shaped” recovery after a faster-than-expected rebound from the lockdown slump, according to the Bank of England.Andy Haldane, the Bank’s chief economist, said early evidence suggested Britain was benefitting from a surge in consumer spending after coronavirus restrictions were eased.He said that if the rebound continued on the same path then the loss in annual GDP might be far lower than first feared, at 8 per cent compared to the 17 per cent forecast last month.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, he warned that “considerable” risks remain, including mass unemployment once the government’s furlough scheme ends in October.In a webinar speech on Tuesday, Mr Haldane said: ”Although these risks are in my view slightly more evenly balanced than in May, they remain skewed to the downside.“Of these risks, the most important to avoid is a repeat of the high and long-duration unemployment rates of the 1980s, especially among young people.”Created with Sketch.

Cast and crew can sit wherever and whenever they need and frequently do.”Novak’s words corroborate Jackman’s confusion when Hathaway made the claim – the actor previously worked with Nolan on The Prestige in 2006.Jackman also said that Nolan is one of many directors to enforce a rule forbidding the use of mobile phones on-set.Hathaway worked with the director on The Dark Knight Rises (2012) and Interstellar (2014).Nolan’s new film Tenet, a sci-fi blockbuster starring John David Washington, Elizabeth Debicki and Robert Pattinson, is set to be released in cinemas on 12 August.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A volunteer workforce of expert scientists, technicians and students were drafted in to help get the Lighthouse Laboratories up and running at the beginning of the UK lockdown. As the first tranche of staff arrived on site in Milton Keynes, the challenge became clear.“The simple fact is the Milton Keynes site wasn’t a lab at all,” said one insider. “Most of the equipment we were using was donated and it all had to be set up quickly. All the tests failed in the beginning.”Another added: “They spent the whole first week getting the process up and running and validating the tests with a hospital checking the work. It would have undoubtedly been a faster response mobilising existing labs.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOne said: “It was 200 unpaid people who knocked out the first 300,000 tests and essentially winging it in a very controlled and sensible way but when you talk about preparedness, that doesn’t strike me as being very prepared.”This article was funded by our supporters. If you would like to see more of this important work, please make a contributionSpeaking to The Independent as part of our investigation into the UK’s private coronavirus labs, funded by our Supporter Programme, staff questioned the initial set-up of the three labs, which were opened as part of a centralised push to increase coronavirus testing. Accountancy giant Deloitte managed the operations. The first lab, in Milton Keynes, was opened on 9 April, followed by Alderley Park in Cheshire on 20 April and a third lab in Glasgow a few days later.At the Alderley Park base, nestled on a business park in Cheshire, the feeling was the same: “It was just an office space to begin with, which had to be completely refitted. They started from nothing really.”Local health officials say they’ve been left in the dark on Covid-19How German coronavirus testing stormed ahead of the UK’s modelThe labs received test samples with barcodes, but no other information, then were required to send the test results for each barcode to NHS Digital. The Independent was told the labs did not follow the same standardised processes, meaning there were disagreements on issues such as when to discard damaged or poorly labelled samples, leading to big variations in the void rates between Milton Keynes and Alderley Park.One source said the rates reached as high as 40 per cent and were still at around 20 per cent earlier this month. The Lighthouse Labs and Department of Health said these numbers were not accurate but declined to give an alternative figure.One insider said: “We did have a number of samples that we couldn’t test because the swab had been taken and then it hadn’t been put in the transport tube, which means you can’t test it. Or the sample tube leaked. These are all things that happen when you’re relying on long distance transportation to a testing lab.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“In the early days, we were getting all sorts of combinations of swabs and samples, it was ironed out but that did delay things. You wouldn’t have had to iron out those things if you were using experienced lab staff.”Another described tube errors as the “biggest issue”, adding: “In the early days when we were trying to ramp up to 20,000 it became impossible because the tubes weren’t processable at all. Deloitte have really got on the case with that now.“Everyone has been given the impression these labs were networked and working to a single protocol but that wasn’t the case at all. They were each left to figure it out for themselves.”When the issue of large variations in the void rate between Milton Keynes and Alderley Park emerged, a meeting was held between the labs in May. A source within the labs said: “It was a big issue, with Alderley Park very unhappy. They felt Milton Keynes was trying to make them look bad.”During April, as the virus reached its peak in the country, staff in the labs described setting up the test process and having to overcome problems and errors that many felt were caused because they were starting from scratch.Staff described being moved to tears when they saw the scale of viral infection in care homes.There were several occasions where it all went really badly wrongOne technician said: “One night we thought there was something wrong with the machines. The signals were so strong from the samples from a care home. It was a shocker you could see how strong the virus was. I admit it made some of us quite upset.”When health secretary Matt Hancock triumphantly announced the UK was now carrying out 100,000 tests staff in the labs said they were “hurt and upset” at the obvious use of postal home-test kits to increase the numbers.One scientist said: “People were upset when they announced the target had been met. I felt quite hurt at that, we had achieved so much so just to lie about it sort of devalued it a lot. A lot of us were p***ed off. We had done brilliantly to get to 65-70,000 tests at that stage.”As many staff begin to return to their normal lives, some told The Independent they had been unaware private companies were behind the labs and felt “exploited” as the labs now looked to recruit paid staff and expand further.“I didn’t really realise there was profit to be made, perhaps I was naive,” said one volunteer who has since returned to their university: “The way things are changing at the labs now, it does make a lot of sense that they’re private companies.They added: “I think they’ve really underappreciated how fragile the processes are. It’s all very well getting these guys in without the experience. And it’s fine when it’s running smoothly but it’s when it goes wrong. There were several occasions where it all went really badly wrong, and we stood the risk of losing thousands of tests.”The Milton Keynes Lighthouse Lab was based at UK Biocentre, a not-for-profit company set up to do academic biomedical research. It employed only 27 staff before the crisis and had no experience of providing infectious disease testing, with one source saying: “It was a very odd choice to create a lab there from nothing.”The company was established in 2011 as a subsidiary of the UK Biobank charity and is funded by the taxpayers via the National Institute for Health Research and the Department of Health, which has gave the company a grant of £653,000 in 2017 after it made a loss. Its latest accounts for the year to September 2018 show it made a loss of more than £11,000 and reported it expected to continue making losses until it could expand services at the site.The Cheshire Lighthouse Lab is run by Medicines Discovery Catapult, described as a technology and medical innovation incubator funded by Innovate UK, an agency of the UK government. It also had little experience in running large-scale infectious disease testing.Along with the third site in Glasgow, these labs have been operating without formal accreditation to confirm they meet the same standards followed by most UK laboratories.Allan Wilson, president of the Institute of Biomedical Science, said: “When you set Lighthouse Labs up, running only with volunteers without registered staff, which are largely unaccredited, then I think that runs significant risks and that’s not a risk many other countries are prepared to take.“The testing strategy for this country has been constantly shifting with more political targets than clinical. Before May there was no clear testing strategy. We should be using testing in a targeted way to try and reduce the transmission of disease.”Medicines Discovery Catapult said the integrity of samples and packaging received by the labs varied and any samples deemed unsafe or which could not be identified were classed as void and not tested. It said efforts were ongoing to improve the packaging across testing sites.MDC said the labs had been working under an open book not-for-profit contract with the Department of Health, and all volunteers have been offered salaries with many taking on the roles.It said the success of the labs meant there was now a need to maintain them, which is why they were now recruiting for longer term staff.A Department of Health spokesperson said: “The Lighthouse Labs form part of the biggest network of diagnostic laboratories in British history and has been set up in a matter of months.“The UK has one of the largest testing programmes in the world and it draws on the expertise and resources of a number of public and private sector partners which has undoubtedly curbed the spread of the virus and saved lives.”Read the rest of our Failing the Test investigation:Slow start and flawed decisions in Britain’s coronavirus testing have cost lives, warn health leadersHow German coronavirus testing stormed ahead of the UK’s modelLocal health officials say they have been left in the dark on spread of coronavirusThis article was funded by our supporters.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.As the UK barely managed 5,000 coronavirus tests a day in early March, Germany was already nearing 100,000 tests per week – significantly ramping up testing with the virus raging in nearby Italy.While Britain had stopped most testing of the virus and entered into lockdown, Berlin took a different path, mobilising its network of laboratories and involving dozens of private labs and companies in what was seen as a national effort.In our investigation into Britain’s efforts to rapidly expand testing, funded by The Independent\u0027s Supporter Programme, multiple sources referenced the German approach as an example of what the UK could have done had decisions been taken earlier. Though the German diagnostics industry is better established than the UK’s, they also pointed to a fundamentally different approach for expansion and conveying results.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis article was funded by our supporters.

They are controlled price-wise, by the government and their competition is really their turnaround time, and their portfolio of organisms.Inside the coronavirus mega-labsLocal health officials say they’ve been left in the dark on Covid-19“They instantly geared up when they saw this coming and so they had a much better infrastructure to be able to address the problem.”When the first cases emerged in Germany in February many of the existing private labs in the country recognised the threat and began to work on increasing testing.Daniel Hefel, from Medicover Diagnostic Services and a member of Germany’s Association of Certified Labs, or ALM, told The Independent: “We started very early to bring together all the competition, usually the laboratories were never talking to each other, but we decided very early in the Covid-19 crisis that we needed to share information.“The most important thing was speed and to scale up very, very quickly so that we can deliver results the same day or one day later.”He said that by the first week of March the country was delivering just under 100,000 tests a week but this rapidly increased and is now in the region of 350,000 tests a week after 10 weeks with the capacity to do much more if needed.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In these two hours we informed the health authority, the health authority went to the media, but in parallel they contacted the patient and started immediate isolation. This was in the beginning of March.The biggest challenge is when you have a huge centralised lab, and you want to funnel everything into the central lab, and that was also what the US did in the beginning where they had a couple of monster labs set up, but it was not covering the whole state so they opened up to many other labs in the US and then scaling is much easier.”Asked about the UK approach he said: “Building up something from scratch is certainly very difficult. I would have it done differently.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The Lighthouse Labs form part of the biggest network of diagnostic laboratories in British history and has been set up in a matter of months.“The UK has one of the largest testing programmes in the world and it draws on the expertise and resources of a number of public and private sector partners which has undoubtedly curbed the spread of the virus and saved lives.”Read the rest of our Failing the Test investigation:Slow start and flawed decisions in Britain’s coronavirus testing have cost lives, warn health leadersLocal health officials say they have been left in the dark on spread of coronavirusInside the coronavirus mega-labsThis article was funded by our supporters.

It comes after ministers faced criticism for the handling of the surge in cases in Leicester, which was put into the UK\u0027s first local lockdown on Tuesday. Australian authorities will lock down about 300,000 people in suburbs north of Melbourne for one month from today after two weeks of double-digit rises in new Covid-19 cases.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLeading doctors say local authorities must be given better Covid-19 dataAustralia locks down 300,000 in Melbourne to contain outbreakAustralia locks down 300,000 for one month to contain outbreakAuthorities will lock down about 300,000 people in suburbs north of Melbourne for a month to contain the risk of infection after two weeks of double-digit rises in new coronavirus cases in Australia\u0027s second most populous state.Australia has fared better than many countries in the pandemic, with about\u0026nbsp7,830 cases and 104 deaths, but the recent surge has stoked fears of a second wave of Covid-19.From midnight, more than 30 suburbs in Australia\u0027s second-biggest city will return to stage three restrictions, the third-strictest level in curbs to control the pandemic. That means residents will be confined to home except for grocery shopping, health appointments, work or care-giving, and exercise.The restrictions will be accompanied by a testing blitz that authorities hope will extend to half the population of the area affected, and for which borders will be patrolled.The measures come as curbs ease across the rest of the state of Victoria, with restaurants, gyms and cinemas reopening in recent weeks.Victoria recorded 73 fresh cases on Tuesday from 20,682 tests, following an increase of 75 cases on Monday. State premier Daniel Andrews warned that the return of broader restrictions across city remained a possibility.ReutersGive local authorities better data about spikes, urge leading doctorsLeading doctors are calling for local authorities to be given accurate and up-to-date data on spikes in coronavirus cases.The British Medical Association (BMA) implored the government to ensure local leaders were given timely information about cases in their area to help contain the spread of the virus.It comes after ministers faced criticism for the handling of the surge of cases in Leicester.The BMA urged the government to share timely, comprehensive and reliable information to all those involved in the management of new cases at a local level.It also called for clarity about how regional spikes will be managed in the future.Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the BMA Council, said: The prime minister has talked about a \u0027whack a mole\u0027 strategy to tackle local outbreaks, but this is no use if the people leading the response on the ground - be they public health teams or local leaders - are not given the most accurate up-to-date data possible.This is crucial to allow swift action and to protect lives and the health service, and something that is not happening right now.This is all the more important given that the \u0027world leading\u0027 test and trace app is not in place, meaning local leaders and teams armed with up-to-date information will be vital in containing spread of outbreaks.PAGood morning and welcome to today\u0027s live blog.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.George Neal, the owner of four hair salons across Leicester, believed his business could survive the coronavirus pandemic – if he was able to reopen in early July. But now a second lockdown has begun, his hopes of survival are fading.“I’ve been saying that the beginning of July is it,” he tells The Independent. “Any longer than that and I don’t know if we can survive.”His business is one of many that, after preparing for the reopening of trade on 4 July, is now facing fresh uncertainty and financial hardship as authorities attempt to grapple with a localised outbreak that has seen 944 cases recorded within the city over the past two weeks. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAs the rest of the country moves to take a welcome but tentative step out of lockdown, there is to be no such relief for the 330,000 or so residents of Leicester.Here, the pandemic is still making its presence firmly felt. Indeed, the city has recorded 10 per cent of all positive cases in the country over the past week, while hospital admissions for coronavirus have crept up to between six and 10 a day – compared to around one a day at other hospital trusts.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyIn Neal’s case, his salons were all set to go. From protective screens to social distancing measures, the necessary health protocols were in place. Ten weeks’ worth of appointments had been booked in, with his staff – split into two teams “so that if one were one to contract coronavirus, you don’t lose all employees” – to keep the business open 12 hours a day, seven days a week. Now, any hope of returning to normality has vanished. “It’s going to be a big blow, absolutely,” he says. “Although we’ve got a lot of our staff on furlough, we’ve got to make up for the 20 per cent of what the government scheme doesn’t cover. It’s left us very near to the bone.”It had initially been assumed that current restrictions already in place across the country would simply be extended to contain Leicester’s outbreak, meaning only those businesses within the hospitality and personal services sector would have been affected, leaving the local population free to continue visiting local shops, friends and family.However, the government has reversed many of the freedoms rolled out in recent weeks. Non-essential shops, such as department stores and electronic retailers, have closed from Tuesday, schools will shut to most pupils on Thursday and residents have been advised to stay at home as much as they can while the local lockdown continues. “They’ve gone further than we anticipated they might,” Sir Peter Soulsby, mayor of Leicester, said on Monday. Health secretary Matt Hancock later insisted that the “broader action” was needed. “Targeted action wasn’t working,” he said, explaining that the introduction of additional testing units and visits to local factories and workplaces “unfortunately” had failed to limit the rate of transmission.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe town itself was eerily quiet on Tuesday morning. After a slight increase in footfall and activity over the past two weeks, the surreal silence that marked the peak of the pandemic has since returned. Among those affected by the new rules, which Hancock has said would be enforced by police in some cases, there was nothing but a sense of deflation.Withers Sports, which has been serving customers just off the high street for more than 75 years, pulled down its shutters again this morning after barely two weeks worth of trade after non-essential shops reopened on 15 June.“It’s heartbreaking,” owner Steve Brett said. “You’ve got businesses that are 80-years-plus old. Three months ago you go through all the emotions, the anxiety, the stresses, the concerns. You think, are you going to come through this? And now we’re back to this.“It’s horrendous. We’re online as well so it’s not been too bad. But I feel for the restaurants, cafes, pubs.”Like other businesses in the area, Brett is concerned as to whether the government will continue to provide support if Leicester finds itself being repeatedly placed into lockdown over the coming months. “I hope there’s going to be some compensation for this. We’re going to need more help if this keeps on happening.“I understand why, we have to be sensible and safe. I just hope people take heed of this and understand that there are consequences for actions. If people aren’t listening to lockdown rules, then businesses are going to suffer. We just can’t continue like this.”A few streets away, the Rutland \u0026amp Derby Arms stands as quiet as it has been for the past three months. After being informed last Wednesday he could reopen on 4 July, Sam Hagger had been tirelessly working to prepare his pub, along with the three others he owns in Leicester, and “getting the doors open” again.“It’s going to delay the much-needed return of cashflow to our business, because we’ve had no income since March,” he says.“Only two of our four pubs are eligible under the government business grants release scheme. We’ve got pubs that have literally had no income and we’ve paid all our bills, our trade creditors and teams, but it’s left us a little bit light.”Leicester mayor says officials struggled to keep testers in cityBeyond the further loss of revenue from now absent punters, Hagger has also spent money preparing to reopen – all now wasted.“We’ve let the supply chain know we’re going to reopen,” he explains. “Although we won’t open at the same strength we were before lockdown, we’ve obviously let people know that we’re going to start buying a certain amount of food we’ve previously bought, and now all of a sudden we’ve come to a grinding halt.”As residents scramble to see how the lockdown will affect them – a map has been drawn to highlight where the restrictions extend to, while a postcode checker is also being developed – there remains a number of unanswered questions hanging over the city: what has driven this outbreak? Why didn’t the government’s preemptive measures work? And how will the lockdown be realistically enforced? The Leicestershire Police Federation on Tuesday demanded urgent clarity from the government over its expected role in enforcing the lockdown.There is also the question of why action has only been taken now, when the government knew 11 days ago that cases were spiking in Leicester, and why local authorities were kept in the dark. He added he has been trying “for weeks” to access data on the level of testing in the city and was only given access last Thursday.Then there is the concern regarding the disproportionate impact of the virus on local black and Asian communities. Health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said on Monday that, as a “proudly erse city”, Leicester was “particularly at risk”. Data from the Office for National Statistics has shown that black people in the UK are 1.9 times more likely to die of Covid-19 than white people, while British Indians are around 1.5 times more likely. A separate report by Public Health England (PHE), published earlier this month, said such disparities may be explained by social and economic inequalities, differing risks at work and the prevalence of conditions such as obesity and diabetes among minority groups.North West Leicestershire MP Andrew Bridgen suggested that the city was a “perfect storm”, with younger people who are less likely to comply with lockdown restrictions, a large ethnic minority population, multigenerational households and large food processing and garment industries.Although coronavirus outbreaks have already been recorded in a number of slaughterhouses across Europe, including a chicken plant in Wales and meat-packing plant in West Yorkshire, authorities in Leicester have yet to confirm the role played by these densely populated workplaces in contributing to the city’s high infection rate.Experts have also warned that there is no evidence for rhetoric, espoused by several city residents, that minority groups – whom they alleged had not followed guidance – were to blame. “Let’s be clear – the restrictions being re-introduced are not the fault of the local population. There is no evidence that their behaviour has been being ‘at odds’ with other parts of England.”What the data does suggest, however, is an “unusually high” incidence of coronavirus in children. Hancock said that while work was still being done to understand Leicester’s outbreak, extra testing revealed that a large percentage of under-18s had tested positive for Covid-19, therefore justifying the decision to close local schools.Analysis of 800 local hospital admissions has also revealed that late-middle-aged men have been “heavily affected”, along with elderly people, Soulsby said on Tuesday. He added that “Bame communities in general have had somewhat higher rates of admission to hospital than the white community” but were “not outlying with figures from elsewhere”. For now, though, the city remains in the dark over what has passed and what is to come. The only certainty, it seems, is that while Leicester may be the first to find itself subjected to a localised lockdown, it won’t be the last.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

While its win was a coup for DreamWorks – the film was the studio\u0027s third victor in a row– it was far from a deserving recipient, especially considering Ron Howard won Best Director over Robert Altman and David Lynch for Gosford Park and Mulholland Drive, respectively.219 Chariots of Fire (1981)While Chariots of Fire is precisely the type of film the Academy usually takes under its wing, the fact it won was a big surprise, considering everybody present had expected Reds to win the top prize. The Warren Beatty film would have been a far worthier winner, too.Cold Mountain lucked out by being nominated in what was a particularly weak year for Best Supporting Actress. Renée Zellweger recovered from failing to win for Chicago the previous year and, in doing so, earnt the unremarkable drama its Oscar-winning tag.Viewers of the Oscars have grown used to unexpected victories, but none was more ill-judged than when Paul Haggis\u0027 drama Crash beat Brokeback Mountain to Best Picture.519 Dances with Wolves (1990)It\u0027s quite soul-destroying to think that Dances with Wolves scooped a total of seven Oscars in the same year that Goodfellas was nominated.Alicia Vikander\u0027s performance in The Danish Girl is by no means weak, but it was nothing on Rooney Mara\u0027s affecting turn in Todd Haynes\u0027 film Carol. Had Tom Hooper not won five years before for The King\u0027s Speech, it seems unlikely that the drama would have picked up any nominations.Put simply, The English Patient isn\u0027t a very good film. Of the nine (nine!) Oscars it won, Juliette Binoche\u0027s trophy for Best Supporting Actress was perhaps the most surprising. The French star herself could barely contain her shock. This will most likely be this list\u0027s most controversial placement, but let\u0027s be honest: Gladiator is not the fantastic film it\u0027s regularly hailed as. Ridley Scott\u0027s overlong historical drama boasts plenty of swords-and-sandal bravado, but not much else.The musical Going My Way may have been the biggest cinematic hit of its year, but it certainly wasn\u0027t better that classic noir Double Indemnity, which it beat to win Best Picture. In fact, it\u0027s nowhere near director Leo McCarey\u0027s greatest film (he won six years previous for the Awful Truth and would be nominated again for The Bells of St Mary\u0027s two years later).There\u0027s a reason why Grand Hotel is the only film to ever win Best Picture without receiving a nomination in any other category. An entertaining film, sure, but nothing more.1119 The Greatest Show on Earth (1952)It\u0027s ironic that a film with the word greatest in its title has gone down as one of the worst winners in Oscars history. A prime example of when the Academy voted for spectacle over quality.To those who don\u0027t care about awards ceremonies, Green Book is a crowdpleaser that boasts decent performances from Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. To everyone else, it\u0027s the damp squib that somehow came out of nowhere to snatch Best Picture from under Roma\u0027s nose. The Imitation Game won Best Adapted Screenplay, which begs the question: what the hell was this distinctly average film doing having any nominations at all?Meryl Streep has won enough Oscars for the world to know she\u0027s evidently one of the finest actors who\u0027ll ever live. Her win for The Iron Lady, though, was one Oscar too many.The year of 1999 marked one of the most remarkable Oscar ceremonies in history for the sole reason that the majority of its winners were terrible choices. Right up there was Roberto Benigni, who beat Tom Hanks (Saving Private Ryan) and Edward Norton (American History X) to win Best Actor for, of all things, Life is Beautiful.It might finally be accepted that disgraced film director Roman Polanski shouldn\u0027t be handed accolades, but back in 2003, this was still what the Oscars were doing. He won Best Director for The Pianist, an award the French-Polish filmmaker could have done without.1719 A Place in the SunA Place in the Sun is a fine little film, but fine little films shouldn\u0027t be winning Oscars –\u0026nbspespecially when they see off competition from more deserving opposition. In this case, director George Stevens beat John Huston (The African Queen), William Wyler (Detective Story) and Elia Kazan (A Streetcar Named Desire) to the Director prize.1819 Shakespeare in LoveYou have to hand it to Shakespeare in Love, it played the Oscars campaign trail perfectly, overtaking war favourites Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line to win the evening\u0027s biggest prize. This doesn\u0027t mean its success has gone down as anything more than evidence of poor judgement from the Academy.It\u0027s often good to hold your hands up and admit that a film is nowhere near as good as you recall. Sadly, Slumdog Millionaire is one of those. While its win no doubt put smiles on the faces of commuters reading the morning papers the next day, the shine has worn off its success in recent years. The rightful winner –\u0026nbspThe Dark Knight – wasn\u0027t even nominated for Best Picture.A Beautiful Mind is one of the mustier Best Pictures winners of the century so far.

The Imitation Game won Best Adapted Screenplay, which begs the question: what the hell was this distinctly average film doing having any nominations at all?Meryl Streep has won enough Oscars for the world to know she\u0027s evidently one of the finest actors who\u0027ll ever live. Her win for The Iron Lady, though, was one Oscar too many.The year of 1999 marked one of the most remarkable Oscar ceremonies in history for the sole reason that the majority of its winners were terrible choices. Right up there was Roberto Benigni, who beat Tom Hanks (Saving Private Ryan) and Edward Norton (American History X) to win Best Actor for, of all things, Life is Beautiful.It might finally be accepted that disgraced film director Roman Polanski shouldn\u0027t be handed accolades, but back in 2003, this was still what the Oscars were doing. He won Best Director for The Pianist, an award the French-Polish filmmaker could have done without.1719 A Place in the SunA Place in the Sun is a fine little film, but fine little films shouldn\u0027t be winning Oscars –\u0026nbspespecially when they see off competition from more deserving opposition. In this case, director George Stevens beat John Huston (The African Queen), William Wyler (Detective Story) and Elia Kazan (A Streetcar Named Desire) to the Director prize.1819 Shakespeare in LoveYou have to hand it to Shakespeare in Love, it played the Oscars campaign trail perfectly, overtaking war favourites Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line to win the evening\u0027s biggest prize. This doesn\u0027t mean its success has gone down as anything more than evidence of poor judgement from the Academy.It\u0027s often good to hold your hands up and admit that a film is nowhere near as good as you recall. Sadly, Slumdog Millionaire is one of those. While its win no doubt put smiles on the faces of commuters reading the morning papers the next day, the shine has worn off its success in recent years. The rightful winner –\u0026nbspThe Dark Knight – wasn\u0027t even nominated for Best Picture.Francesca Archibugi – “A Question of the Heart,” “Tomorrow”Icíar Bolláin – “Even the Rain,” “Take My Eyes”Terence Davies – “The House of Mirth,” “The Long Day Closes”Sophie Deraspe – “Antigone,” “A Gay Girl in Damascus: The Amina Profile”Maggie Greenwald – “Sophie and the Rising Sun,” “The Ballad of Little Jo”Kathleen Hepburn – “The Body Remembers When the World Broke Open,” “Never Steady, Never Still”John H.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.From fashion stylist to farm hand: meet the people helping to harvestThe bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms. Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo? You’ll find plenty of of delicious ideas from the likes of Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Amanda Grant at vegpower.org.uk. You can get involved too: share your recipes using #SeasonalVeg on social mediaTry different types of fishSimilarly, the UK\u0027s fishing industry has suffered during the current coronavirus pandemic.While higher-end produce is currently not being purchased by restaurants, much of the catch from UK waters that would usually be exported hasn’t been, so boats across the country have struggled to sell their fish and seafood. That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.British hunters have killed at least 60 lions – and probably more – since the shooting of Cecil in 2015, as a promised government ban on trophy imports has been delayed again.Official figures reveal dozens of bodies, skins and other parts of the endangered animal have been brought into the UK from Africa in the past five years.The data also show the European Union imports more lion trophies than any country, allowing the species to be driven dangerously towards extinction, experts say.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAfter the killing – exactly five years ago – of Cecil in Zimbabwe by a US dentist prompted an international outcry, ministers promised to ban imports of lion trophies by 2017. The promise was also included in last year’s Tory election manifesto, and in February, Boris Johnson told Parliament he would deliver a ban.Numbers of wild lions have tumbled from about 450,000 in the 1950s to 20,000 in 2015 to an estimated 15,000 now. It’s feared there could be as few as 13,000.

Conservationists have described the decline as “heartbreaking”.Ministers last year announced a public consultation on a ban, which ended in February, but officials say the outcome has been delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic.The consultation included the option of stricter requirements or a ban on parts of only certain species.But analysis of numbers from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), which regulates trade, reveals lion bodies, as well as skins, skulls, claws and feet, have been legally brought into the UK. A conservative reading of the database suggests that represents between 53 and 77 dead lions.But if the body parts were listed not as trophies but for personal, educational or commercial trade, the number of imports to the UK is 154.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Then it changed its mind. As a result, British hunters shot another 50 or more ‘Cecils’.“Now it’s saying again that it wants to ban hunting trophies. We cannot have any more dithering or delay. Nine out of 10 voters want this stopped.Lions cubs found at squalid breeding centre too sick to walk“Wildlife is on the brink. There is now a real prospect of lions becoming extinct in the wild.”Other Cites data reveal the EU is the world’s largest importer of lion trophies compared with non-EU countries. The EU imported 406 lion trophies in 2017 and 2018, including 18 trophies of wild lions in Zimbabwe like Cecil.Within the EU, Spain imported the most lion trophies – 84 – in the two years.Claire Bass, Humane Society InternationalUK’s executive director, said: “Cecil’s senseless killing exposed trophy hunting as immensely cruel, completely unnecessary and morally bankrupt. And yet, five years on from his tragic death, Britain and the European Union are still providing a market for this horrific hobby.”Killing of Cecil the lion encourages UK hunters to kill more big catsThe public were outraged when Walter Palmer shot Cecil, a protected lion and one of Zimbabwe’s most loved animals, on 1 July 2015. It led to calls for his extradition to Zimbabwe, and he became the target of threats and protests. A professional hunter was cleared over the death.In answer to MPs who have questioned the delay, minister Victoria Prentis said the government was continuing to work on the issue and would publish its response as soon as it was practical. “The outcome of the consultation, and the accompanying call for evidence, will inform our next steps,” she added.A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “There is a clear manifesto commitment to ban the import of hunting trophies from endangered animals and we continue to work to end this shocking trade.”The Independent has also asked the European Commission to comment.Cecil the lion\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Social enterprise Bread n Butter – one of the charities supplied by our Help The Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project – closed its doors at the end of March.However, its founders saw a growing need among the city’s most vulnerable for regular home-cooked, nutritious meals, so they joined with community centres Stonegrove Community Trust and the Hive Trust.Since then, Bread n Butter’s team, aided by volunteers, have been cooking and delivering more than 1,000 meals a day to Londoners in need in Barnet, Enfield and Brent. Here, we speak to four people who keep this project going.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRichard Simon, a furloughed IT worker, joined the Stonegrove Community Trust’s OneStonegrove project in Edgware at his wife’s suggestion. The 52-year-old said: “Working in the kitchens was like being on Ready Steady Cook. You don’t know what ingredients you’re going to be working with, so you have to think on your feet.” The father of two, who dedicates 20 hours a week, added that the biggest thing he had learnt was the power of “working together”.“For a group of people who don’t know each other, we just get on with it, working flat out.

I have also learned how to cook, whereas before I lived out of tins.”Mariana Bassi Da Silva, a software developer, wanted to volunteer as she was not working due to the pandemic. A keen cook, the 34-year-old volunteered for OneStonegrove and said the project had helped develop her love of cooking. The Brazilian-Italian, who moved to London seven years ago, said the greatest impact the project has had on her was the sense of “belonging”.“It is hard to settle in when you move,” she said. “Here, I have a community.

Despite the vast differences between the two situations, Fawcett’s extensive military experiences and qualifications have helped him and his team develop a robust response to the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I was the only doctor there for about 300 people, which was quite an eye-opening experience,” says Fawcett of his first stint in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of the Army Reserves. Working at the Role 2E Field Hospital in Camp Bastion and at the Forward Operating Base, Fawcett provided key treatment on the Afghanistan frontline.On his second stint in 2007, he spent three months in Camp Bastion as a Trauma Team Leader, and on his third tour in 2011, he was the clinical lead for the Medical Emergency Response Team, a four-person medical team operating from a Chinook flying over Afghanistan, picking up wounded soldiers on the battlefield.What’s more, Fawcett – who also counts a role with the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity as a helicopter doctor amongst his impressive repertoire – has completed an MSc in Disaster Healthcare. Playing an instrumental part of Stoke hospital’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic is just one more string to his bow.“I was able to take a lot of stuff I learnt and apply it from the very start,” Fawcett says of putting his Masters in Disaster Healthcare into practise. “Before the patients even get to the emergency department, we make sure there’s clear boundaries, and patients are directed to the right areas to avoid any cross-contamination.”His army tours also contributed: “Looking at the designs of how they set up field hospitals and stuff helps,” he adds. “And working with international colleagues – it’s good to get a non-UK perspective on how other countries deal with certain circumstances.”This involved an overhaul of the whole emergency area and its processes. “We now run two emergency medicine departments out of one department,” he explains. “We’ve had to basically split the whole department in half.”Now, Stoke hospital features red zones and green zones: the former is for those displaying potential Covid symptoms and the latter is for those who aren’t. As such, the pathways and patient-flow of the hospital have had to be changed to avoid any instances of contact between these areas.“We have separate ambulance entrances for red and green patients. We have two resuscitation departments, two areas for major patients, two areas for walk-in patients, two minor injuries areas, two paediatrics departments, as well as designing alternative pathways to try and stream those patients that don’t have to come through the emergency department to other places.” he explains, noting how such isions have had to be executed throughout the whole hospital to prevent crowding and maintain social distancing.How schools in England are helping pupils return to the classroomThe task may have been monumental, but Fawcett takes pride in the hospital’s response: “This is what we’ve always trained for and it’s been good to see how us as an emergency department have responded to it. We’ve ensured patient safety and staff safety has always been at the forefront.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.With a swathe of lockdown restrictions due to be lifted on ‘super Saturday’ this weekend, new statistics showed that there are still 36 parts of England where coronavirus cases have been increasing.Release from lockdown was put on hold in Leicester as authorities moved to damp down an upsurge in infections which saw the Midlands city record 10 per cent of all positive cases in England in the past week.Its infection rate of 135 cases per 100,000 over the seven-day period was three times higher than the next worst-affected city in the country.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut figures from Public Health England (PHE) showed that other areas had also experienced increases in positive cases between the weeks of 13-19 June and 20-26 June.Doncaster recorded a rise from 11 to 32 in the number of positive cases over the period, while Derbyshire’s figure increased from 23 to 25, Medway from 10 to 17 and Sandwell from 8 to 10.Created with Sketch.Rankin unveils portraits of NHS workers on the coronavirus frontline Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Midwife, University Hospital Coventry and WarwickshireSuperintendent Pharmacist, Bedminster Pharmacy in BristolMidwife, University Hospital Coventry and WarwickshireSuperintendent Pharmacist, Bedminster Pharmacy in BristolSome of the sharpest increases were in London boroughs, where the weekly figure rose from 7 to 18 in Hammersmith \u0026amp Fulham, from 9 to 15 in Hounslow, 5 to 14 in Ealing, 6 to 14 in Westminster, 7 to 13 in Brent and 8 to 12 in Kensington and Chelsea.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyMany other council areas which had seen no cases in the first week recorded one or two in the second, while other experienced small numerical increases of one or two cases from a very low base.The increasing rates of infection in dozens of areas across the country has led to fears from some experts more local lockdowns could be on the way.“I am expecting there to be a number of Leicesters,” Prof Deenan Pillay, a virologist at UCL and member of the influential Independent Sage group told .“The base level of infections going on in the UK is still much higher than it was in other countries in Europe when they started to release their lockdowns.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But the test does not state that infections must be falling across the country.PHE said it would be wrong to use the figures to predict possible coronavirus hotspots which might need lockdown restrictions reimposed in future.A spokesperson said that the figures broken down by local authority area were used “as one of a number of indicators to help us and partner organisations to identify trends in local areas and to take action accordingly”.“To use these data in isolation to predict which areas will see significant increases in cases is not appropriate as they do not provide a complete picture of what is happening locally.”Dr Rupert Suckling, director of public health at Doncaster Council said that the rise in positive tests in the town “coincided with widespread testing in our care homes where we identified a number of asymptomatic positive cases”.He added: “We have also seen cases in health and care workers, with sporadic cases in schools. However, the weekly testing from the week 8-14 June shows a significant reduction.“We are not complacent and encourage everyone with symptoms to self-isolate and arrange to be tested. We are working closely with the local Public Health England centre which has not raised any concerns with us.”Nick Fletcher, the MP for Don Valley, told The Yorkshire Post : “The increase in numbers was due to the increase in testing, we’re still testing at these high levels now and there’s been a significant reduction in cases but we can’t be complacent, the last thing we want to see is a rise.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We have been on it.”The emergency crackdown in Leicester follows the revelation that one in 10 new infections nationwide are happening in the cityNon-essential shops will shut and remain closed for the foreseeable future, most schools will be closed from Thursday and plans to relax shielding measures for the most vulnerable have been shelved.With the city’s pubs, bars and restaurants no longer permitted to reopen this weekend, there are fears of people flocking to nearby Derby and Nottingham, for example.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut EU employers are anticipating the end of those right, which will make it harder for Britons to do some jobs that involve cross-border travel.“We are seeing people refused interviews for jobs because those jobs require the freedom to travel across the EU,” Kalba Meadows, a steering group member of British in Europe who lives in France, told the EU Future Relationship Select Committee.UK policies risk ‘retaliatory deportations’ for Brits living in EUWhat happens to UK citizens living in the EU under a no-deal Brexit?“We’re not even at the end of transition yet and there are already real live instances of people’s lives and livelihoods being affected – and that will only increase. So many jobs rely on free movement because of the single market.”Ms Meadows added: “We have a very large number of people whose livelihood is based on working in different countries – people with small businesses, people who are employed, and an awful lot of them face losing our livelihoods. It’s not just about losing your rights on paper, it’s something that affects real lives.”While the Brexit withdrawal agreement protects some of the rights of British citizens abroad and EU citizens in the UK, there are holes in it, notably with regard to jobs not based in a single member state. The integrated nature of EU economies means that occasional travel to other countries is common, particularly in professional-level occupations.There are also gaps in the extent to which Britons’ qualifications will be mutually recognised in the EU after Brexit.Michael Harris, a steering group member of British in Europe who lives in Spain, told MPs: “There’s a stereotype of a Briton who lives in Spain – there are a lot of retired people in Spain who won’t be affected by the need to go and work or provide cross-border services, but around 60 per cent of Britons in Spain are working-age or below. Young Britons in the EU are the people who are going to be most affected by this – to go and study and work.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There are no rights in the withdrawal agreement on cross-border working,” she said.Britain and the EU are currently negotiating a future relationship, which both sides have always said will cover immigration issues. But political pressure in the UK has led to the government ruling out a continuation of free movement.Neither side’s draft agreement includes provisions for free movement rights and the UK’s draft immigration bill contains no provisions for such policies.Ms Golding told the committee: “We haven’t had any indication from either side that this is a topic that’s being discussed in any detail in the future negotiations.”British in Europe\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Prior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.As the US faces a new surge in coronavirus cases, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has said he will hold back on traditional presidential rallies until large gatherings no longer pose a risk.When one reporter asked if he planned to hold any rallies between now and November, the candidate made it clear that epidemiological concerns came first.“This is the most unusual campaign, I think, in modern history,” said Mr Biden “Well, I start off with a premise, Mike, that I’m gonna follow the doc’s orders. Not just for me but for the country. And that means that I am not going to be holding rallies.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I am not going to be – for example, you all are here, but thankfully the school has put those circles around so we keep to social distancing, everybody has masks on, as soon as I finish this I’ll put my mask on. So it’s almost all been virtual, although I have gone into Houston, I have gone into Pennsylvania – I’ve had travel, but when I do, I get in, make my case, then leave.”Mr Biden was taking questions from reporters gathered at a press conference in a school gym, with circles drawn on the floor to ensure the masked-up press pack kept safely apart from each other.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safely“But you know me,” he continued, “I’d much rather be out there with people because that’s where I get the greatest feel. I can get a sense by the look in their eyes, by the plane of voices, what they’re concerned about.“But notwithstanding that, I’ve been surprised – the irony is that we’ve probably reached more people directly.”Mr Biden’s announcement comes as Donald Trump prepares for a 4 July firework display at Mount Rushmore in South Dakota, which is expected to draw a crowd of as many as 7,500 people. Governor Kristi Noem told Fox News this week that attendees will not be required to practice social distancing or wear masks.When questioned about his seemingly solid lead over Mr Trump in many polls – including in numerous swing states – Mr Biden was careful not to get carried away.“I don’t wanna jinx myself. I know the polling data is really good, but I think it’s really early, it’s much too early to make any judgement. I think we’ve got a whole lot of work to do. I plan on laying out in detail my economic plan as to how we recover from this, my plan on dealing with foreign policy – working out in detail what I’m gonna do if I am elected president so that people know what’s coming.”And asked if he has started preparing for debates with Mr Trump, Mr Biden simply said with a grin: “I can hardly wait.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The virus poses a greater threat to my elderly mum than it does to me.Men from working-class backgrounds are more likely to die, as are people from ethnic-minority communities.Coronavirus doesn’t just discriminate when it comes to health. It discriminates according to wealth, too.As we live through the worst economic crisis of our time, some parts of the country will be hit a lot harder than others.The impact the virus has had on our economy is breathtaking. The Bank of England says \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"we are heading for the biggest recession in  years.The fall in output in March and April alone wiped out  years of growth. Claims for Universal Credit have already risen by .million.Behind these statistics are the jobs and livelihoods of hard-working people.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Whether this has affected you personally depends on your line of work.Advertising executives, accountants and lawyers are able to work from home.Those with jobs in manufacturing, construction and retail are not.The more labour-intensive an industry is, the harder it is likely to have been hit by lockdown.The types of jobs that are most cushioned from the economic crisis are concentrated in London and the South East.Manufacturing jobs are mostly found in Yorkshire and the North. The West Midlands — where I’m an MP — will take a harder hit than London because much of our local economy relies on car manufacturing.Of course, \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"inequalities between these areas already existed.Before the virus, wages were  per cent lower in the North East than they were in London and le expectancy was nearly three years shorter.Fixing that was a driving force behind our General Election victory six months ago. My concern is that the crisis could make an unfair situation even worse.It’s not just a question of fairness, either. Across the country, towns and cities continue to underperform due to a lack of investment.Putting an end to this tragic waste of potential is a crucial part of boosting the nation’s productivity.The Prime Minister gets all this. That’s why \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"he is gearing up to kick-start growth with a massive package of investment. As he looks to rebuild, he will rightly see this as an opportunity not only to revive our economy, but to set it on a firmer, fairer foundation than before.I’ve been working with the Centre for Policy Studies since we went into lockdown, coming up with ideas to help my colleagues in government secure the strongest possible recovery as we come out of it.I want to make sure that left-behind regions not only share in our economic comeback, but that our plan is specically designed to spread prosperity to every corner of the country, leaving no one behind.Thankfully, we’re not short on options.One of the first things we can do is bring forward plans for a revolution in regional infrastructure.Investing in roads, railways and broadband will increase economic activity and boost communities by creating new jobs and helping businesses grow.Alongside investment in training and skills, this will transform the regions.The Government should also take advantage of record-low rates to massively step up the amount of cash it is willing to invest in overlooked areas.Where this cash goes shouldn’t be led by bureaucrats in Whitehall, but local people who really understand the problems in their area.City and Town Deals have proved a huge success, as have visionaryMayors such as Ben Houchen in Tees Valley and Andy Street in the West Midlands.We shouldn’t be afraid to devolve wider and deeper across England, increasing the powers of local authorities and setting up models that have proved successful.Finally, we need to find new ways of putting money back in people’s pockets, and change the tax system where it is grossly unfair. For towns and cities across the North, we can do both by changing the way council tax works.Bizarrely, your council tax is calculated using property values that are  years out of date.If you move into a new-build, the valuation office tells you what band you’re in based on a guess of what it might have been worth in .Because the value of their homes has soared since then, this system effectively hands rich homeowners a massive discount.That isn’t fair. We should consider a full council tax revaluation to make sure that hardworking people in less well-off areas are not subsidising the rest of the country.This pandemic will change many things about our country. One thing that won’t change is the need to address profound regional inequalities, and spread opportunity and prosperity to every part of the UK.The case for levelling-up is stronger than it has ever been before.With better regional infrastructure, more local decision-making and fairer taxes, we still can — and must — make it happen.  To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Non-essential shops and schools will also be told to close, effectively placing Leicester back to where the rest of the UK was in May. And Mr Hancock today announced that in some cases police would enforce the lockdown.He said: We will bring forward a legal change very shortly, in the next couple of days.Because some of the measures that weve had to take in Leicester will require a legal underpinning.It comes as:He revealed the government had been monitoring the situation in the East Midlands city, with targeted measures brought into factories and workplaces where there had been outbreaks.But the Health Secretary explained the moves hadnt been working in Leicester, meaning that the broader measure now had to be taken.Leicester mayor Sir Peter Soulsby revealed he had spoken to Prime Minister Boris Johnson on the phone today, having previously criticised the governments lockdown measures.He told The Sun Online: The Prime Minister called me and the first thing he said was that he ‘wishes us all well’ which I thanked him for.‘I told the Prime Minister it would be enormously helpfulwe could have data  showing the ethnicity of people tested and their evidence work which may give us a clue to how the spread has taken place.He said he understood that need and would be getting that data to us. We need a good understanding whenever positive and negative tests come through.Mr Johnson thanked the people of Leicester for their “forbearance” in dealing with the new coronavirus restrictions - saying we cannot be prisoners of this crisis.The drastic move will see non-essential shops closing while schools will also have to shut.Leicester streets were today deserted after the news was announced.The decision to close schools comes after a unusually high number of children under  tested positive for the bug.And Mr Hancock said that while non-essential travel was not being made illegal, it wouldit had to.He continued: “We are recommending against all but essential travel to and from and within Leicester.“We will take further action including putting in place lawsthat’s necessary but I very much hope it won’t be.“If further action is needed then of course we are willing to take it.”Concerns have been raised that people in Leicester could try to flee the city to nearby Nottingham this weekend, where pubs and shops will re-open. Nottinghamshire Police has said it will work with the British Transport Police to stamp out any unnecessary travel, with fines issued as a last resort.Chief constable of Nottinghamshire Police, Craig Guildford, told Nottinghamshire Live: If we get any intelligence from Leicester such as a minibus or coach travelling to Nottingham then we will act accordingly.British Transport Police will be doing the same. You are still allowed to travel to get to work, but they will be looking for a breach of the guidance such as going shopping or going on a night out.Mr Guildford added, however, that the force is not anticipating a rise of people from Leicester this weekend. Jeremy Hunt warned today that local lockdowns would become the new normal until a vaccine is found.Rates of infection in the city are now three times that of the town with the next highest rate.Ten per cent of tests are now coming back positive - five times the national rate.Officials have now asked for more time to get the disease under control as they scramble to understand why Leicester has been so badly affected.There have been outbreaks in food production sites, clothing factories and in large multi-generational households.About  per cent of Leicester’s population is of Indian heritage, and a further  per cent are from black or Asian backgrounds.Language barriers, high levels of diabetes and poverty may have played a part in the new surge.Mr Hancock told the BBC that he was familiar with potential reasons, adding: People will find them intuitive.Todays announcement also saw the Health Secretary forced to defend the Governments whack-a-mole strategy for tackling outbreaks.He said: The strategy is to allow for the opening up of the rest of the country, giving people their freedoms back where it is safe to do so.But we also need alongside that to take local action where there is a specic flare-up.The Health Secretary also confirmed that a football match between Leicester City and Crystal Palace would go ahead this weekend.Health minister Nadine Dorries tweeted: Leicester boundary decision will be taken by local council leaders working withand others on the ground who know Leicester street by street - using infection rate information provided by the centre.   This is the essence of how local outbreak management plans will work.Adverts in multiple languages on TV, radio and street signs will encourage people to stay at home.Officials will review the situation in two weeks and decide to ease, maintain or tighten the controls. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Corbynista zealots were appalled, moderates celebrated.Furthermore, the dismissal of Long Bailey was just part of a systematic removal of hard Left influence in the party.Much to the fury of left-wing agitators, Starmer yesterday dismissed calls for the police to be “defunded” in the wake of anti-racism protests. Emphasising his past work with the police as Director of Public Prosecutions, he labelled such demands as “nonsense”. Out are Corbyn allies like Jennie Formby, the former General Secretary. And in comes the new chief David Evans, described by admirers as “a stanch opponent” of the hardliners.According to the latest polls, the British public is warming to the new Labour leader. In one survey last week,  per cent expressed a preference for him as Prime Minister, two points ahead of Boris Johnson.Interviewed by the BBC on Sunday, former leader Ed Miliband joined in the cheer-leading, saying: “I never had his approval ratings. I think he has made a great start.”Yet it would be wrong for Labour supporters to be carried away. Sir Keir might be a better leader than Corbyn and Miliband, but those two set the bar very low. The truth is that Labour still has a mountain to climbStarmer is to become Prime Minister. His party is still a deluded rabble, dominated by the worst kind of toxic identity politics, contempt for Britain and student union dogma. Labour is ready for neither victory at the ballot box, nor for the governance of our country.Parallels are sometimes drawn with the situation now and that of , when John Major’s Government was engulfed by the financial crisis of Black Wednesday five months after winning the General Election against Neil Kinnock’s Labour. But the huge dference is that Labour was on the advance, having won a further  seats at the election. Power was almost within the party’s grasp, given that Major only had a tiny majority. But today, Labour is still reeling from the humiliation it suffered last December, when it lost  seats, the biggest loss for any opposition in a century. Moreover, the party is in the wilderness in Scotland. Once Labour’s Caledonian fortress, the party has just one MP there.In total, the Conservatives have no fewer than  more MPs than Labour.That means the job that now faces Starmer is daunting. To be the biggest party, Labour would have to make  net gains from the Tories on a swing of  per cent. Even in the phenomenal landslide of , the swing to Tony Blair was only . per cent.And there is not the slightest sign of that happening at the moment, in spite of all the Government’s recent problems. It is a remarkable fact that the latest two opinion polls both show that the Conservatives, after ten years in office with a very mixed record, are still seven points ahead of Labour.Indeed, there is even a danger that Labour could slip back further. A recent internal review by the party into the disastrous  defeat warned that a further  seats in Labour’s heartlands could be vulnerable on a very small swing to the Tories.The central problem for Starmer is that his party, fixated by fashionable theories of social justice, has alienated its traditional voters. It will take more than the sacking of Rebecca Long Bailey or reassuring words about the police to bring them back. As the sensible former MP Natascha Engel wrote this month, Labour must recognise how far it “has shted from it core. If it wants to sht back again, the party will have to find the right road and prepare itself for a very long walk.” But the journey has barely begun. A party that is willing twice to elect Jeremy Corbyn as its leader is not going to change overnight.In reality, Labour remains gripped by far Left ideology, as shown by its eager embrace of the cultural revolution. Decent, patriotic working-class voters, once the bedrock of the Labour movement, are bound to be repelled by the endless posturing against Britain or the police or family le or even common sense. Despite the change of leadership, the insanity remains. At the weekend, Labour front-bencher Lloyd Russell-Moyle was forced to apologise after disgracefully attacking JK Rowling for using her own experience of domestic sexual assault as “a justication for discriminating” against transgender campaigners.In the same vein, senior Labour MP Dawn Butler recently declared on Good Morning Britain that “a child is born without sex”, a piece of biological nonsense that is about as sane as saying the Earth is flat. The atmosphere of a cult still hangs over the party. The lunatic Left has certainly not gone away, as reflected in MP Richard Burgon’s celebration that teaching unions thwarted “Tory attempts to force schools to re-open. When the row about statues was at its most hysterical, Lisa Nandycalled for imperialist murals to be removed from the magnicent interior of the Foreign Office. Similarly, the Nottingham MP Nadia Whitthome, sounding asshe lived in an occupied country, expressed her thrill at the movement to topple monuments of the past: “I celebrate these acts of resistance.”Sir Keir is not the figure likely to win back the traditional working-class, particularly not in the Red Wall seats of the Midlands and the North. This is, after all, a figure who used to edit a radical magazine called Socialist Futures, who built his reputation as a metropolitan-based human rights lawyer, who presided over the Crown Prosecution Service when it gained notoriety for its failure to take a tough stance on crime, and who battled ferociously for a second referendum on Brexit. For all the ordinariness of his upbringing as the son of a toolmaker and a nurse, he is now the personication of the North London liberal elite. Moreover, he lacks both authority and charisma. With his strangulated vowels and permanently anxious expression, he frequently sounds like a teacher who is surprised at this promotion to be head of department.The political landscape could have changed dramatically by , when the next election is due. Britain may have enjoyed a strong economic recovery. The culture war may have petered out. Public services may have been reformed. Mrs Thatcher was in desperate trouble in , battered by riots and rising unemployment. Two years later she won a landslide. It is perfectly possible that Boris Johnson could enjoy the same fate – especiallyLabour fails to change.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They are likely to employ extremely vulnerable people who will be scared to come forward for testing.”Leicester mayor Sir Peter Soulsby admitted there is an issue with “illegal manufacturers” in the East Midlands city but said he had not seen any data linking them to viral “hotspots”.Residents are being advised to stay at home as much as possible and to avoid all but essential travel.Police revealed they will issue fines as a last resort for those who breach the lockdown measures and travel from Leicester to Nottingham to shop or visit pubs this weekend.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It wasn’t that long ago we were heading to Costa clutching our reusable coffee cups with pride and packing our groceries into our “bags for le”.We were horried when David Attenborough showed us footage of a turtle tangled up in plastic that had found its way into the ocean.We dutully sorted our trash into recycling bins and shunned plastic straws.Now it is like a boil has burst. People have been repressed for so long during lockdown that, now they are free to go out again, they have forgotten how to behave.They see others leave their rubbish and think it is OK to do it too. It is classic copycat behaviour. If a place looks like a dump, people start treating it like that.When daytrippers are drinking or getting high on “laughing gas”, they are likely to lose their inhibitions. They become irresponsible and unashamed of urinating in the street.If you can’t find a bin or they are all overflowing, take your rubbish home with you. It’s not dficult.In fact, take two carrier bags out with you — one for your litter and oneyou really can’t find a toilet.Butit comes to that, please hide yourself away. It is so undignied to think of people defecating in public places such as the grounds of the Queen’s Balmoral estate, as The Sun reported on Monday. For goodness’ sake! A lot of public loos aren’t open — and that is something councils need to really look at. No one wants to see our countryside turned into a toilet.It is great we can now meet up with others for a few drinks in the outdoors and take the family to the beach. But we really must look at ourselves.The police have better things to do than tell grown men and women to bin their McDonald’s boxes. Now is the time to take some personal responsibility.It is interesting that people in Wales and Scotland are still restricted to travelling just five miles from their homes. If people in England can’t respect our outdoors, perhaps we should apply that across the whole UK.Then the only people allowed on our glorious beaches would be locals who care for the area. Another idea might be to place refuse trucks nearby, with bins for general waste and recycling containers. That way there would be no excuse not to dispose of your rubbish properly.In Spain’s Benidorm, sun worshippers have to use an online booking system to secure their spot on the sand. That keeps the numbers at an acceptable level.We have the Keep It, Bin It campaign — a joint message from the Government and Keep Britain Tidy. But at the moment it seems to be falling on deaf ears. We need to be tough.Clearly, putting up signs saying “Beauty dies where litter lies” is not doing the job. We need bigger fines to act as a real deterrent.Alternatively, we could follow the example of Calornia, in the US, where they impose community service on louts who leave their rubbish behind.When I was in Los Angeles I saw people in unorm cleaning the beaches.In that city, a third littering offence results in  hours of collecting rubbish.Such community service could be a humbling experience that would help people realise how unpleasant it is to tidy up someone ’s mess.Sadly, it seems we need to be reminded about wildle and seale getting choked by plastic.Perhaps we need to see some stark images on Instagram, TikTok and all the other social media young people use. Not that young people are solely at fault. Unfortunately, many of those to blame are old enough to know better.It seems our morals have gone out of the window along with social distancing. The messaging from the Government has been all over the place.Better enforcement of social distancing — as we saw in the early days of lockdown — would mean fewer people congregating in public areas and less litter.People in England have been told it is OK to go to the beach, meet other people and enjoy themselves . . . and they have gone mad. In Wales and Scotland, the messaging has been very clear.One piece of good news is that the weather is going to be rubbish this weekend, when the pubs and restaurants reopen.Perhaps that will limit the numbers heading to our beaches and parks, giving us all some extra time to think about how we behave.We have come through lockdown but we need to emerge in positive fashion, thinking about each other — and our country.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He said: We’re waiting asbetween the flash of lightning and the thunderclap with our hearts in our mouths for the full economic reverberations to appear.The PM declined to estimate how many jobs could be lost but warned that the post-pandemic crisis would be worse than the  financial crash. Mr Haldanes comments come after the Bank recently said it now expects gross domestic product to tumble by  per cent in the first half of the year.This is a record, but not quite as extreme as the  per cent it predicted in May.But Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England, warned at the time against getting carried away by signs the recession may not have been quite as steep as it expected, with the Bank launching another £ billion of quantitative easingto help boost the economy.Mr Haldane was the only one on the nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee to vote against increasing QE in the June meeting.In his speech, he saidthe economy continues recovering on a similar path as lockdown measures ease further, then the loss in annual GDP could be far lower than first feared, at  per cent against  per cent forecast in May.But he cautioned some of this may be down to pent-up demand, as well as the massive Government support for households and businesses through the scheme to furlough workers on  per cent pay.With nine million workers currently on furlough, he said there was a risk of soaring unemployment when the Government support measures end, which could impact the path of recovery.Mr Haldane said he remained open-minded about more action to boost the economy.His prediction of a V-shaped rebound was supported by separate data compiled by Barclays.

just weeks after they reopened to seated diners.The state government also requested all flights be erted to other states to prevent the risk of imported cases.If we dont take these steps now we will finish up in a situationthan locking down  postcodes, we will be locking down every postcode, said Andrews, referring to postal codes which cover the  suburbs.People are desperate for this to be over, no one more than me, but it isnt and pretending wont get us to the other side.Those living in the ten postcodes will not be allowed to go on holiday and the government will announce a support package for affected tourism businesses tomorrow.  Theto lockdown is a devastating setback for the home state of nearly a quarter of Australias  million people.Worryingly it has been widely seen to have taken one of the toughest enforcement approaches when the country first went into lockdown in March.But while most other Australian states have reported zero or low single-digit daily increases in COVID- infections for weeks, Victoria has experienced double-digit increases for each of the previous  days.In the  hours to Tuesday, Victoria reported  new cases, down from the previous days  new cases.By comparison, the most populous state, neighbouring New South Wales, and the third-most populous, Queensland, both reported no new cases.The vast country has had  deaths from about , infections -

as  per cent said they’ve had days where they’ve had no contact with anyone at all.Currently,  per cent of adults feel lonely, with one in  finding this the most challenging aspect of the lockdown.Video calls have proved beneficial in reducing feelings of loneliness among  per cent but one in  admitted they feel even more distant afterwards.But despite being burdened with feelings of isolation, more than half of those polled haven’t shared any of their struggles during the lockdown with another soul.A third of those who haven’t discussed their dficulties opted not to because they didn’t want to worry anyone and a fth find openness too hard.Instead,  per cent of those suffering with loneliness have taken to comfort eating, while a quarter now regularly exceed the recommended alcohol consumption limit.But the most common effect of loneliness is missing friends and family - and older people have perhaps felt this most.Nearly three quarters of people over  said they have struggled with loneliness during the lockdown, and two thirds admitted theyve not spoken to anyone about how they have been finding it dficult to cope.  And this may have affected their overall wellbeing as four in  adults with older or vulnerable relatives said they’ve noticed a deterioration in their mental or physical health over recent months.The Santander study, carried out through OnePoll, also found loneliness has proved to be signicantly challenging for those who don’t live with anyone.Currently a fth of the population live alone and  per cent currently feel lonely –  per cent more than those who reside with someone .Further to this, those living alone had gone an average of  days without talking to anyone at all since the lockdown came into effect on  March.To help alleviate loneliness, Santander UK employees are signing up to volunteer with Alzheimer’s Society and Age UK.They will place regular social phone calls to isolated people and those living with dementia, distribute support leaflets, deliver groceries, help older people get online and develop their digital skills, and become ‘Dementia Friends’.The Santander Foundation is donating £, to Age UK and Alzheimer’s Society for every Santander UK employee who takes part in volunteering initiatives -

If I was to be more blunt, I would say that we’ll all be six foot under before it’s even half built at this glacial rate of progress. Boris was at pains to tell us he’s no communist. I think we knew that. What we discovered is that he’s no Franklin D Roosevelt either. President Roosevelt is famous for unlocking mega-bucks to lt America out of the Great Depression in the s. Our Prime Minister’s wallet, by contrast, is a bit thinner. While Roosevelt built the Hoover Dam, Johnson promised some bridge repairs in Sandwell. To be fair, there was some good news for Greater Manchester in the speech. We were give £m to clean up brownfield sites and build more homes on them. This will allow us to make some further inroads into tackling the housing crisis, although much more is needed. I was also pleased to hear the £ billion commitment to upgrade school buildings - though it didn’t escape my notice that it came almost  years to the day since Michael Gove scrapped Labour’s £ billion Building Schools for the Future programme. What the North of England needs more than anything is investment in our Victorian rail infrastructure which is responsible for the timetable chaos of recent years.  So we welcome the Prime Minister’s recognition of the “rail bottleneck” in Manchester City centre in his speech. But we’re not sure about his solution. We already have a plan in place to build two new s at Manchester Piccadilly to solve it. Instead of giving that the green light, the PM chose to allocate £m to develop an alternative plan. How does that fit with his much-vaunted Project Speed  Overall, and not for the first time with this Government, the hype before the speech overshadowed the real thing. There are only a certain number of times that you can promise to dual the A before people begin to switch off. As I said on Monday, “levelling up” needs to be about skin and bone as well as concrete and steel. People are crying out for help now and it would helpthe PM acknowledged this before promising any more shiny projects in the dim and distant future. One of the statistics which haunts me from this crisis was the Unison survey of care workers in the North West. It found % said they feared they wouldn’t be paidthey needed to self-isolate. Just think about that. We have a care service in England which has such poor employment conditions that it forces people to stay in work evenare ill. If the PM had started his speech by promising that, from now on, the heroes who work in our care homes looking after our relatives will get paid at least the same as a nurse, then I think the whole country would have risen to applaud him.

But they then also had to wait up to five weeks for their pension to be paid. After the situation was raised by cross-party MPs, campaigners say claimants started being given a one-off payment to bridge the gap.  That transition payment is now being put on a legal footing. From November , all Universal Credit claims will be automatically extended for the full monthly assessment period in which people hit pension age. The move is expected to benefit , people who reach pension age in the next five years. They will gain an average of £ each, the government said. Legislation was announced this week almost four months after ministers first promised to act. The reform is a victory for Alyn and Deeside MP Mark Tami who raised the problem. A campaign was also backed by  MPs from Labour, Lib Dem, SNP, Plaid Cymru, the Greens and DUP after a gap in the law was spotted by a local Citizens Advice office in Flintshire. The Citizens Advice staff said pensioners were risking being left without money for a long period, due to the way Universal Credit and the New State Pension are each paid.Mr Tami said: I am proud to have been able to lead this campaign on a very obscure and technical bit of the benefit system, but which pushed too many older people into poverty.

And it has been reported huge amounts of testing data - is not being made public by the government.According to the Financial Times, published data for Leicester recorded just  new positive tests between June  and June .But Matt Hancock revealed the complete figure for that period was in fact . The official statistics ‘dashboard’ - set up by the government last week when the daily coronavirus briefing was cancelled - only publishes data from ’pillar  testing’ at a local level. That means it only includes swab tests performed in hospitals for people with ‘clinical need’ and staff. Test results from centres outside of hospitals - like mobile and drive-through test centres, and at-home testing - are known as ‘pillar ’ testing. Pillar  testing makes up around % of test results - and aren’t included on the dashboard. Neither are they routinely shared with mayors and local councils. They are available to local health officials - but critics say that’s not good enough to help local authorities keep tabs on local outbreaks. Labour MP Yvette Cooper tweeted that health authorities in her constituency in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, had been trying to get hold of local Pillar  testing data but had not been able to. She tweeted: Our local public health teams, council, NHS doctors  managers in Wakefield have had to fight for months to try to get this data. “In public health crisis, most important thing is knowing where infection is. Appalling  incomprehensible that basic info hasnapost been provided. The idea this could have been Ministerial choice rather than failure of competence is even more shocking. “What on earth is going on  Transparency  trust are basic currencies for dealing with public health crises. Pls, pls Govt, don’t keep screwing this up. Leicester mayor Sir Peter Soulsby criticised the Government and Public Health Englandfor delays in sharing case and testing data which showed how the disease was spreading. He said he had been trying for weeks to access data on the level of testing in the city and was only given access last Thursday.

Working from home became the norm, socialising was forced online and missing loved ones became an everyday occurance. As the virusapos hold begins to ease, some places are beginning to see the strict restrictions lted, but weaposre still a long way from le as we knew it. Non-essential businesses - including pubs - will reopen their doors in England this weekend, and people will finally be able to reunite with family for longer periods of time. But whataposs next  Back in May, Prime Minister Boris Johnson revealed his -page road map plan for getting the UK out of lockdown, both socially and economically. The next big change is due to happen this weekend, with a large number of restrictions being relaxed in England. Pubs, hairdressers, hotels, campsites, restaurants, cinemas, museums and galleries can reopen their doors on Saturday  July and two households will also be able to meet indoors and even stay overnight - as long as they maintain social distancing. And the two-metre social distancing rule will be cut down to a one metre plus rule, with people able to be closer - but only  they sit side-by-side or wear a mask. However aposlocal lockdownsapos will be introduced for areas experiencing a surge in cases. Leicester was the first city to be forced back indoors in a bid to control the virus, going back to step one of lockdown. There are another  other cities or towns which are deemed at risk and could follow in Leicesteraposs footsteps. And then what  While many things are starting to get back to normal, many businesses and industries are still waiting for the green light to reopen. Nightclubs, bowling alleys, indoor playareas, swimming pools, tattoo studios, water parks and conference centres are just some of the places weaposre still waiting for an update for.  The beauty industry is still at a standstill, with everything except hairdressers - including beauty salons and nail bars - remaining closed. However there may be a light at the end of the tunnel for the fitness industry, including gyms. Despite Government sources says gyms remain shut because there is a “far greater risk of infection” due to people breathing harder and touching surfaces, they could be open in a fortnight. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has: Subject to public health, our aspiration is to reopen gyms  leisure facilities in mid-July. The government wants all children to go back to school in September, and parents will face finesthey donapost sent their kids in. A plan is due to be outlined this week on how exactly that will happen. Unions have warned it is impossible to reopen schools while maintaining social distancing - there simply isnapost enough space. Currently, children have to be kept in separate bubbles of  pupils or fewer. So ministers are considering massively expanding these bubbles to cover  pupils - which is basically the whole class - or even an entire year group.

Michael Alcorn, , of Accrington, Lancashire, made the comment after he was sentenced on Tuesday at Preston Crown Court for a string of burglaries over two days in April. Alcorn was on licence at the time from a nine-year jail sentence for burglary in  when he posed as a builder to con his way into the home of an -year-old severe dementia sufferer and stole cash.Before his outburst on videolink from prison the court heard Alcorn had contracted coronavirus while on remand and that had more of a salutary affect on him than any of the numerous jail terms he had received for a total of  previous convictions for  offences.His barrister Andrea Lock said: He was very poorly and tells me he thought it might be his fate that he would die in custody. He said that had given him more pause for a rethink than anything before. Alcorn pleaded guilty to five burglaries on April  and  at homes in Whitworth, Rossendale, Helmshore and Haslingden, and stole cash from two of the addresses. He also admitted breaching an anti-social behaviour imposed in  which bans him from approaching homes to offer services. The daughter of one of his latest victims, an -year-old man with limited mobility, branded Alcorn a lowle by targeting a vulnerable, old man who has never hurt anyone in his le. The son of another victim, a -year-old woman who lives alone and requires regular care visits, said of Alcorn: The man is a scumbag. Sentencing, Judge Brown, the Honorary Recorder of Preston, told the defendant: You are a person who is prepared to prey on those least able to resist. At a time when the Covid- crisis was close to its highest peak these were elderly and extremely vulnerable people who no doubt had been instructed by the Government that they fell into the special category of people who needed to self-isolate for their own protection.

Increasing new cases have been found in  areas in England as pubs, restaurants and hairdressers prepare to reopen on Saturday. And infections in Wales also remain worryingly high. Infectious diseases expert Dr Gail Carson of Oxford University said: “Local lockdowns...are probably to be expected more.” Spikes have been recorded in Doncaster in South Yorks, Derbyshire, Medway in Kent and the Hammersmith and Fulham borough in West London, among others. The Prime Minister said yesterday: “Many are nervous, rightly, about more outbreaks whether national or local, like the flare-up in Leicester.” In the week to last Friday, Leicester had  new cases confirmed by Public Health England labs – up from  the week before, and accounting % of all that week’s nationwide positive tests. It was the second highest number of new cases in the country after Kent, which had over  new infections each week this month, though cases there are declining. However, in the Medway area it has risen from  to  week-on-week.  Doncaster had a worrying spike in new cases from  to . Derbyshire had  new cases last week, up from  the week before. Previous infection rates published by Sage suggested outbreaks may also be growing in the North West. Data from King’s College London’s Covid Symptom Study App suggests Wales has the highest new symptomatic cases, followed by the Midlands. Four of the five areas with the most confirmed cases per capita over the entire outbreak are in Wales. Merthyr Tydfil is top, followed by Denbighshire, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Dundee in Scotland and then Cardf. Nationally the number of new cases has flatlined after falling since April. Public health expert Prof Linda Bauld of Edinburgh University said: “Has the national release of lock down in England been too rapid given the number of cases in the community   “Learning lessons now could avoid other areas experiencing the same consequences with further damage to children who have recently ed to school, and to local businesses who have reopened and now need to close again.” Former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the Leicester lockdown is a “necessary puncturing of the elation that had been building up throughout the country” as restrictions are lted. The Health Select Committee chairman added: “It’s not going to be smooth and there are going to be times when we have to go into reverse gear.” Data had suggested a rise in Leicester for weeks, and intensive testing resulted in % coming back positive, five times the national rate. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the city was locked down after “targeted action” including extra testing and school closures did not work. He said there was an “unusually high” incidence of coronavirus in children in the city.  Non-essential shops there closed yesterday, and tomorrow schools willto teaching only the children of key workers. Leicester City said yesterday it would still host Crystal Palace at the King Power Stadium on Saturday after consulting with local authorities, its Safety Advisory Group and the Premier League. It said the Foxes Fanstore at King Power Stadium has closed and only essential staff will remain on site. North West Leicestershire MP Andrew Bridgen said he had reported local “sweatshops” to the Home Office yesterday after the Mirror revealed clothing factories that remained open during lockdown may have been a source of the increased cases.  He said: “There is a very large garment industry which should’ve locked down, which my sources are telling me have worked for internet retailers who’ve been very busy during lockdown and they’ve carried on working as well.” He added: “The human resources and health and safety are not necessarily what you’d want them to be. I would regard them as sweatshops.” The number of reported Covid- cases in the city are much higher than figures published by the Government suggest. The most recent data, out on Monday, said there have been , cases in Leicester since the outbreak began. But Leicester City Council said the latest figures it has received show there have been ,.

The girl, who does not wish to be named, had got the watermelon and coconut fruit cooler as a treat from her mum Anna at a Costa Coffee drive-thru in Cornwall last Friday. Anna Wright has now spoken of her terror as her daughter screamed and made a choking noise before spitting what looked like pieces of glass into her hand. The girl was rushed to AE where a doctor also thought the cup was full of tiny shards of glass. But an aposinitial investigationapos by Costa revealed the drink actually contained hundreds of pieces of plastic. Costa has now launched a full investigation and apologised for ‘any distress causedapos.  Anna told Cornwall Live : “She suddenly screamed and made a choking noise. She started spitting tiny pieces of what looked like glass into her hand.“She said ‘oh, mum it’s in my throat’. The pieces were stuck between her teeth and in her mouth. “I kept her calm and encouraged her to take the pieces out of her mouth. I pressed them with my nail to seeit was plastic or glass and it felt like incredibly thin glass. “I couldn’t believe it when I looked at the bottom of the cup – there were thousands of tiny, sharp pieces.” Anna drove straight back to the Costa drive-thru to complain and told them she thought her daughter had swallowed glass from one of their drinks. The manager told her there wasn’t any glass in the café and wonderedthe blender had been contaminated, though there wasn’t anything in it on inspection.  Anna added: “I said ‘why don’t you stop serving these people, my daughter’s just drunk glass’ but they didn’t.” The manager took photos of the cup and its contents and took a couple of samples of the tiny, hard objects. Anna then drove her daughter to hospital where a doctor also thought they were pieces of glass. She was told an X-ray wouldn’t pick up the small shards so she was told to observe her daughter in case she started bringing up blood over the next few days. She was also advised to contact the police in case it was a malicious crime.  The police then told Anna to report the incident to the Food Standards Agency and Cornwall Council’s food safety department, which she has done. Anna told Cornwall Live: “We obviously thought it was glass as it was so hard, but even though it’s plastic it is still unacceptable. There were hundreds,not thousands, of tiny sharp pieces in her drink.  “You do everything you can to protect your children as a parent. I’m a single mum too and very protective, so this was really distressing.I’m concerned because my daughter is already anxious about drinking something now.” A Costa Coffee spokesperson said: “The health and safety of our customers is our number one priority. We were concerned to hear of the incident which took place at our drive thru, in Penzance. “Our on-site and customer services teams were alerted to the incident and have been in continuous dialogue with the customer. “A full investigation has been launched and as an immediate action we have taken all necessary steps with our local Environmental Health Officerto ensure our store is able to operate safely.

Spider webs and thick layers of dust and grime cover surfaces and possessions, a womanaposs dressing gown hangs on the back of a door and childrenaposs toys and teddy bears sit in an upstairs room. A Harrogate-based urban explorer who snapped these pictures said the house is stuck in a time warp - and it has a tragic back story. Have you been affected by this story  Email webnews@mirror. It is said the property belonged to a -year-old woman who died alone inside the house in .Her possessions were never cleared out after the property was inherited by her son who is believed to live overseas, said the young explorer, who runs a Facebook page called Lost Places  Forgotten Faces. He said the time capsule is filled with old artacts, family photos, wedding albums, calendars and newspapers that were purchased or delivered shortly before the owneraposs death, and others from the s.In the bathroom,  teeth, toothbrushes, razors and a toy boat rest above a sink, clothes are piled in a hamper, and medication and lotions are still in a cabinet. The toilet and bathtub are covered in grime. Black and white photos, postcards and other belongings are scattered on a bed in a bedroom, where the floor is also covered with possessions and there is graffiti on a wall. Another bedroom photo shows an old record player, a poster of singer Kate Bush and piles of decades-old magazines. Tins of food and bottles of condiments still sit on shelves, there are empty bottles of cognac, an old TV rests on a desk and a three wheel rollator that the woman used to get around is in the kitchen. An old rotary phone hangs on a living room wall and eyeglasses lay on a desk with books, letters that arrived in the post and more photos and postcards.A North Yorkshire Police Athletics Association diary from  has been placed on top of a newspaper from March . A souvenir edition of a newspaper insert, dated February , , commemorates the death of Winston Churchill a week after his death.

Documents within the house indicate she died alone in the house in . The house is a time capsule of old artacts, ornaments, photographs, wedding albums, calendars, newspapers. Her clothes are still hanging up in her wardrobe, her dressing gown is still on the back of the door, and her  teeth remain resting above the decaying sink.  There are childrenaposs toys and teddies upstairs, which tells me that maybe her grandchildren would once come and visit her. There are also a number of empty vintage cognac bottles found throughout, so itaposs fair to say she enjoyed a tipple once in a while. The explorer added: The house had been set up with assisted living handles to help her get around. The stairs leading to the upper floor were worryingly steep, even for me, so I could only imagine the struggle she would have getting up there.  She evidently ended her le by living only downstairs as a bed had been assembled to the rear of the dining room. She died in bed alone next to her walker. Seeing everything left behind, a letime of possessions now rendered meaningless, made me feel so sad. Apparently, her only son lives abroad and after attending her funeral in , he inherited the house but never bothered to clear out her belongings and they have since remained in a time warp.  His inheritance has subsequently become a battered relic of a once family home. The explorer, who is in his s, has been photographing abandoned places since November last year. He visited this home with his partner earlier in June. He said: What hit me straight away, literally, was a blanket of old cobwebs that have collected over years of abandonment.

Cleon Papadimitriou, , got on his bike after getting fed up of waiting for travel restrictions to be lted. He left his student flat in Aberdeen on May  and took a ferry to Holland before cycling through Germany, Austria and Italy carrying a load of  kilograms. From there he took another ferry to Patras in Greece, arriving in Athens seven weeks after setting off. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE. Cleon said: I like adventures so when I couldnapost fly home I decided to go by bike. I had a lot of punctures and had to put up with snow, hail and intense heat along the way. Sometimes the bicycle tire burst two or three times a day, and that not only cost me a lot of time but it wasn’t good for my morale either.  It was a lesson I had to learn to manage. Iaposm a bit saddle sore but it was worth it, he added. Cleon camped along his marathon journey and survived on bread, peanut butter and tins of sardines. His parents greeted him when he arrived in Melissia, north of the Greek capital, with a laurel crown and a large banner saying: Welcome Home Cleon: One more challenge accomplished!

The good news is the government has given permission for hotels with en suite showering facilities, or one designated shower facility per guest room, to reopen. But it has issued strict guidelines for owners to follow in order to keep staff and visitors safe and stop the spread of Covid-. The seven key new rules are designed to help employers, employees and the self-employed in England only understand how to work as safely as possible and protect their customers while keeping to the recommended social distancing guidance applicable at the time. Below are the seven vital changes you will notice next time you stay at a hotel in England...plus we speak to a hotel in Glasgow to see how they have been adapting during the crisis. . Screens in reception  Hotels have been told to take measures to make reception areas safer, with increased cleaning, keeping the activity time as short as possible and where possible the addition of screens between guests and staff. . Lt limits Bosses have been told to consider minimising lt usage from reception, and urged to provide clear signage for new lt rules. . New room service delivery plans Where offering room service, the guidelines state measures such as dropping butler’s trays outside door should be introduced. Hotels are also encouraged to add tips to the bill. . Cleaning checklist for housekeeping  Housekeeping staff must follow government handwashing guidelines, and now make a checklist of all hand contact services to be cleaned when each guests vacates. . Swimming pools and sauna rules Hotels have been told to check the latest government guidance on opening of additional guest facilities . . Face masks for guests  Guests are to be encouraged to wear masks on communal corridors to help minimise the spread of Covid-. . Social distancing at bars Owners must ensure that any bar or dining area is only opened in a way compliant with UK government guidance on the hospitality sector. Hotel supports hospital heroes with meals  When the coronavirus pandemic hit, Laura McKenzie had a flood of cancelled bookings at her Glasgow hotel, Cathedral House. The McKenzie family had spent  months building up business at the boutique hotel, which offers a luxurious “home from home” atmosphere, so they were shattered. But within days Laura, who runs the hotel with husband Shane and two of their children Callum,  and -year-old Anna, was inspired to help out staff at nearby Glasgow Royal Infirmary. First, they block booked rooms for hospital staff at a reduced rate then with the help of a donation from Celtic FC Foundation, set to work making meals for them. “I made a few phone calls and straightaway we had the team we needed to start producing the meals. It was probably ten days from thinking: ‘This is horric, this is the end’ to thinking ‘We can do something good and support the local hospital here.’” Laura knows the pressure that NHS staff are under because her daughter, Emily, , is a junior doctor in Dundee, so she was desperate to help. With the hotel’s staff all on furlough, Laura assembled a team of volunteer chefs from the city. The Red Onion’s patron chef John Quigley was one of the first to volunteer and Laura worked with the head nurse at the Infirmary to set up the menu.  “We decided we were going to do  meals a day,” she says. “We did  veggie options and  meat options and bought little takeaway tubs and labelled them all up with little stickers that said: ‘With love from Cathedral House’. And every night at quarter to seven the driver from the hospital would come and take the big boxes of food away. He said there was always such a buzz. People were like: ‘Oh, the food’s coming! What have we got today ’” The hotel has now delivered more than , dishes such as jambalaya, bangers and mash and Thai curry. “It was a simple menu, all cooked fresh with lots of veggies and the sort of dishes you’d cook for yourself when you get home from work,” says Laura. Doctors staying at the hotel were delighted because Laura would text them to seethey wanted a dinner putting aside – and they could pop down to the kitchen to collect it. Laura’s home-from-home hospitality was a real comfort to her guests."},{"url":null,"title":"how 100 days coronavirus lockdown","story":"NewsHow  days of coronavirus lockdown have changed Britain - maybe forever“Normal” le now means accepting that a trip to the shops means standing, face hidden under a mask, in a socially-distanced queue, or working from home, while home-schooling the kids, or keeping in touch with colleagues and loved-ones on Zoom callsShareCommentsByEmily RetterSenior Feature WriterPoppy Danby:,  JUN Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video woman-wears-full-ppe-go-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news how--days-coronavirus-lockdown-\"\", url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Things we took for granted – the night out at the pub, trip to the cinema, mini-break in a European capital – belong in the past. Even our vocabulary has changed, words like shielding, self-isolation, the R number and lockdown itself now common.The Oxford English Dictionary added  coronavirus words, including “elbow bump”, in April.Here are some other ways the lockdown has changed Britain in the past  days.Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog hereFinance With shops closed and long queues at supermarkets, more Brits than ever started doing their shopping online, or buying their groceries local. One in five British households bought groceries online in the past month, pumping up sales for home delivery by %, while small independent stores rang up % more sales in the three months to  June, according to analysts Kantar. Nearly half of debit card transactions are now made online, while older generations in particular have seen their internet spending rise, to % of transactions from just % a year ago. And with cash seen as a potential vector for spreading the virus, and the contactless limit raised to £, the decline of cash has accelerated too. Withdrawals from ATM fell as much as % year on year during the lockdown, according to data from cash machine network, Link. But while nearly two million UK households are set to emerge from restrictions better off after saving money, those with incomes less than £, are more likely to have borrowed money and face a dficult future. Economy  And figures have now shown the UK economy shrank .% between January and March, the joint largest fall since . The International Monetary Fundwarns the world is set to take a £. trillion Covid- hit, and Britain’s economy will plunge by .% in . Some experts say we should expect levels of unemployment of three million or more, while the Centre for Retail Research predicts as many as , shops could close this year. Debenhams, Laura Ashley and Cath Kidston are just some of those hit hard already. Workers furloughed fear redundancy once employers need to start paying some of their wages in August. Meanwhile, the way we work may have changed forever. Many have seen the benefits to work-le balance of working from home and video calls, with , working parents surveyed by Bright Horizons showing only around one in eight want toto pre-pandemic ‘normal’. One in  business premises in London have already permanently closed. Communication  We’ve all had to find new ways to communicate. Unknown to most before lockdown, millions are now familiar with video conferencing app Zoom, which by the end of April had over million daily meeting participants. And older people have also become tech-savvy, with % of elderly residents in of parts of the UK regularly using Zoom, WhatsApp and FaceTime to connect with loved ones.Lockdown has also given us the chance to meet our neighbours – whether it’s saying “hello” over the garden fence, going into the street to clap for carers, or getting together in community Whatsapp groups and Facebook pages.However, social media has had its downsides, with a study finding that those who believed in conspiracy theories were more likely to get Covid- information from Facebook or YouTube. Of those, % believed coronavirus was created in a lab and % claimed it didn’t exist at all. Sport  When the Premier League restarted on June  there were cheers from football fans across the country. And no more so than when Liverpool won their first Premier League title in  years. But things were far from normal as matches took place behind closed doors and fans could pay to have a cardboard cut-out of themselves in the stadium seats of their favourite team. And imagine telling a football fan back in January that they’d be able to use the red button to turn fake crowd noises on and off during a match Meanwhile, while some big events such Royal Ascot and the darts PDC tour were given the green light to go ahead, others, such as Wimbledon and the Olympics were forced to reschedule.Relationships  More than % of people say that lockdown has had a positive effect on their lives. And, of these respondents, more than half said they were able to spend more quality time with the loved ones they lived with. Meanwhile, absence has made the heart grow fonder and helped us appreciate family members more than ever. And % of new couples say the pandemic has made their relationship stronger. But there’s been some hurdles to overcome. Parents have been homeschooling their kids for  days. Yet only % of working class parents feel confident in doing so. And sadly, there’s been a % increase in orce inquiries. The Environment  This was our lockdown silver lining. Studies found daily global carbon dioxide emissions fell by % compared with  levels thanks to the shut down of industry and traffic at the start. As le stilled, wildle began reclaiming the empty spaces. Goats took to the streets of Llandudno, buzzards ed to Hampstead Heath and after the National Trust closed their properties, rangers reported rare animal sightings. While CO levels still rose, reaching . parts per million in May - .ppm higher than the peak of .ppm in  - scientists say that without Covid-, the rise might have reached .ppm. NHS and key workers  The nation’s clap – or pan rattle – for carers, thanking our NHS, social care and key workers, became strict Thursday night routine. Rainbows in our windows thanked them. As many of us worked from home, we appreciated others were taking a risk to support us and save lives. After the Prime Minister himself thanked the NHS for saving his own, our health service can surely never be undervalued again. But too many workers paid with their lives. Most – some analysis suggests % - from BAME groups. Schools universities  Parents tried their best to homeschool, but four in ten pupils across England have not been in regular contact with their teachers since schools shut. Another report estimates around one in five UK pupils have done no schoolwork or managed less than an hour a day. While seven out of  state school pupils have had just one online lesson or less per day, almost a third of private schools have been providing four or more, exposing a widening gap between the rich and poor. Meanwhile, older students, forced to take virtual exams and accept predicted marks, fear downgrades. Many are planning to defer university, too, as online learning and student ‘bubbles’ are considered. Cambridge University has already announced all learning will be online until summer . Politics  The daily press briefing has meant we have seen more of the government than ever. Record numbers of million of us were glued initially – although that later shrunk to million.Meanwhile, confidence in Boris Johnson and the Tories has shrunk, too.At the start of lockdown, three in four Brits agreed with government handling of the pandemic. A recent YouGov poll shows the British government has the lowest domestic approval rating in the world  for its handling of Covid-.The PM’s approval ratings sit at just %, not helped by the revelation his top aide Dominic Cummings flouted lockdown rules. An Opinium poll showed % of voters think Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer would be better at leading the country, compared to % for Boris.Hobbies at home As we’re unable to go out, we’ve had to find new ways to amuse ourselves. Flour production had to increase  fold to keep up with the surge in home baking. And, by April, there were over .million photos tagged “sourdough” on Instagram.Lockdown has also given us the time to start those tedious household jobs and the three-hour long queue outside Ikea and BQ showed just how much DIY we had to do. We’ve also been making the most of home comforts, with slipper sales doubling in some stores, such as John Lewis and a % increase in TV viewing. Meanwhile, for those who wanted a bit of fun there have been countless Zoom quizzes, and the sale of alcohol at supermarkets soared. For animal lovers, working from home has also provided the perfect opportunity to get a pet – with online searches for getting a puppy surging %. Exercise  Gyms closing saw theof the home workout. Many elite gyms, such as Barry’s Bootcamp and Rebel started streaming their classes on social media for free.Before lockdown, few people had heard of Joe Wicks, who has given millions of children the taste of a daily exercise routine, while celebrities such as Tyson Fury, Naomi Campbell and Gregg Wallace, also started sharing their workout regimes with fans.Perhaps the most unlikely motivator was Boris Johnson, who announced lockdown urging people to exercise once a day. A Bupa study found that % of Brits have upped their usual exercise and bike sales have increased by %. On the down side, .million eager exercisers have injured themselves during lockdown, with men twice as likely as women to get hurt. Royals  Despite not being able to attend public engagements, the Royals have made sure to maintain their duties by switching to video calls during lockdown. William, Kate, Charles, Camilla and other members of the royal family kept busy with their charity work online - even turning into bingo callers for a care home in Cardf. And members of the royal family have also been volunteering, particularly the Countess of Wessex, who has been organising PPE shipments and working in a charity shop.

New figures show  cities or counties across England are seeing a fresh rise in lab-confirmed cases, meaning infections are rising in almost one in four cities and counties. Doncaster, second behind Leicester, is among the places that have seen a worrying spike. Derbyshire is one of the counties where cases are higher than other regions. Leicesteraposs flare-up means it will not emerge from parts of lockdown as swtly as the rest of England on July , when pubs, restaurants, hairdresses and other non-essential businesses will reopen. Residents have been told to stay at home, with schools and shops to shut this week with the city being one of the countryaposs Covid- epicentres. Public health officials are keeping an eye on Doncaster and other areas that have seen a signicant increase in cases in recent weeks as England gradually emerged from its Covid- lockdown with the reopening of schools and easing of other restrictions. In Leicester there was an unusually high incidence of coronavirus in children, the Health Secretary has said. Matt Hancock told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday that while work was still being done to understand why Leicester had been so badly affected by the outbreak, extra testing had found under-s testing positive for the virus.Lab-confirmed cases in Leicester have been rising week-on-week, from  between June - to  in the week of June -. Mr Hancock said the cityaposs seven-day infection rate was  cases per ,. Leicester City Council said it had seen  confirmed cases of Covid- in the past two weeks. The Health Secretary said that of course the Government was looking at similar places but said the outbreak in Leicester was very signicantly worse than the next worst-hit place. These  areas ranked behind Leicester, which had the highest number of new lab-confirmed cases, according to the latest available data from Public Health England. Many are urban, densely populated and ethnically erse areas. Five are in London and two are in Kent.

He said that even though children are less likely to get ill from the disease, the decision to shut the cityaposs schools was made to try to halt further transmissions.  Mr Hancock added: We have sent in a lot of extra testing into Leicester over the last  days or so and one of the things we have found is that there are under-s who have tested positive and therefore, because children can transmit the disease - even though they are highly unlikely to get ill from the disease - we think the safest thing to do is close the schools. The reason I said what I did last night about Leicester is that it is an unusually high incidence in children in Leicester. Mr Hancock also said that the lockdown had been introduced in Leicester after targeted action at factories and workplaces had failed. He added: We have been monitoring it incredibly closely, we have put in extra testing units, some of the schools in Leicester were closed already. We also went into some of the factories and workplaces where there was an outbreak and we put in place measures. These sort of much more targeted measures have worked in other outbreaks. So weaposve been taking this highly localised approach, but unfortunately that targeted action wasnapost working in Leicester and thataposs why we have taken this much broader measure. When asked about possible causes such as poverty, higher ethnic ersity, language dficulties and higher-density housing, Mr Hancock said they were familiar to him.He added: We are still doing the work to understand exactly why the outbreak has been so bad in Leicester. But lots of the reasons that you mentioned just then are familiar to me and people will find them intuitive. North West Leicestershire MP Andrew Bridgen said that Leicester was a perfect storm of a city with younger people who are less likely to comply with lockdown restrictions, a large ethnic minority population, multi-generational households and large food processing and garment industries. The Conservative MP told BBC Radio  Live that the garment industry should have been in lockdown, but workers had carried on.Mr Bridgen added: What we have seen in Leicester is a perfect storm really, you have got a city which has generally got younger people living in it. We know younger people have been less likely to comply with lockdown rules. We have got the biggest ethnic minority population of any city, so you have multi-generational households where the young people have probably been out socialising in breach of the lockdown. On top of that there is quite a substantial food processing industry. And on top of that you have got a very large garment industry which should have locked down which my sources are telling me have worked for internet retailers who have been very busy during the lockdown and they have carried on working as well.

Darcy Shaw was left with scars on her neck and chest after surgery for skin cancer and was surprised with a video call from Princess Eugenie and her sister, Beatrice. The young royals held a video call last week with a group of young people supported by the Teenage Cancer Trust - and Eugenie had an inspirational message for Darcy. The Queenaposs granddaughter has never tried her hide her own scar, which is about the size of a piece of string and runs all the way down her spine. She was diagnosed with scoliosis - curvature of the spine - when she was  and underwent eight hours of major surgery. Surgeons placed eight-inch titanium rods into Eugenieaposs spine and screws at the top of her neck and she spent three days in intensive care and a further week in hospital. She was in a wheelchair for a time afterwards but was quickly back walking again thanks to the incredible medical team at Londonaposs Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, who she regularly praises. Eugenie even chose her wedding dress to show off her scar as a mark of respect and thanks for the medical staff who had treated her. Seeing the images of the princess on her big day, with her scar proudly on show, was a turning point for Darcy as she struggled to come to terms with the marks on her own body. She explained: Iaposve always struggled with my body image, way before I got diagnosed with cancer, and anxiety and mental health issues. I was quite recently diagnosed - in February - and now have a scar on my neck and chest from surgery. And I thought to myself aposwell, everything is going to plummetapos. But, actually, the complete opposite has happened, and I put that entirely down to all the support Iaposve had through the lockdown. Iaposve attended body image workshops with Teenage Cancer Trust, and itaposs boosted my confidence, I canapost believe it. I saw pictures of you in your wedding dress and the scar, and it inspired me that you were so open about it and wanted to have it on show. Eugenie, who donned a pair of flower-shaped sunglasses she had brought in case any of the patients wanted to play bingo, during the call was delighted to hear she had helped. She said: Woo - I love hearing that, Darcy. I have a big old scar down my back and Iaposm proud to show it off. Eugenie proudly shared a picture of her scar earlier this week to mark International Scoliosis Awareness Day. The caption read: Today is International Scoliosis Awareness Day. I just wanted to share my scar and encourage anyone out there whoaposs gone through something similar to share theirs with me. Letaposs be proud of our scars! Iaposd love to repost any of your images on my stories so please tag me and I will share.  Darcy is now planning to start a new job as a teacher later this year. Eugenie and Beatrice are honorary patrons of the Teenage Cancer Trust and they chatted to six young people from across the North West, who are helped by the charityaposs specialist nurses and youth support co-ordinators based at the Christie NHS Foundation Trust in Manchester. The group told the royal sisters about some of the issues they have faced during the pandemic such as shielding, appointment delays and loved ones not being able to visit them in hospital, and the help they have received from the charity.

New regulations enabling trials of rental e-scooters will come into force on Saturday and the first schemes are expected to be launched next week, Transport Minister Rachel Maclean said. The trials are being held for  months to assess whether the devices reduce motor traffic and what impact they have on the safety of users and those around them. Riders who participate in the pilots will need a full or provisional car, motorcycle or moped licence, must be aged at least  and will be urged to wear a helmet. Only rental e-scooters will be allowed on roads, and they will be limited to .mph. Ms Maclean said: As we emerge from lockdown, we have a unique opportunity in transport to build back in a greener, more sustainable way, which could lead to cleaner air and healthier communities across Great Britain. E-scooters may offer the potential for convenient, clean and cost-effective travel that may also help ease the burden on the transport network, provide another green alternative to get around and allow for social distancing. The trials will allow us to test whether they do these things. E-scooters are currently banned in the UK on public roads and pavements, but this does not stop many people using them.  The politan Police caught nearly  riders in London in a single week last summer. YouTube star and TV presenter Emily Hartridge became the first person in the UK to be killed while riding an e-scooter when she was struck by a lorry in Battersea, south London, in July last year. Alan Clarke, director of UK policy and government affairs at US scooter rental firm Lime, said: Todayaposs announcement that the UK is embracing micromobility, with trials of e-scooters now able to begin, presents a real opportunity for change.

Scotland and Northern Ireland are likely to remain cloudy with some persistent rain through the day.  Mr Deakin continued: For most of England and Wales itaposs a case of watching some quite heavy showers break out during the afternoon. But equally, thereaposll be some breaks developing in the cloud so some places will cheer up.

Whereas where it stays cloudier with cooler air coming in across Scotland weaposre only looking at temperatures stumbling into the teens.

This should involve a referendum designed in Scotland where a last invitation is offered to the UK to participate to put the case to remain in the union.#A request to the EU to sanction this referendum should be made and every attempt to involve them in the designing of that referendum should be pursued.#mdash Pete WishartJune , Mr Wishart#s preference is to secure an #irrefutable mandate# by winning a majority at next year#s Holyrood election with a #clear and unambiguous commitment to hold a referendum#, and then #move quickly# with the participation of the UK.However, he believessuch a mandate is rejected, Scotland should seek approval from the EU to design a process for rejoining as a #substate# # despite there being no current provision for this within the body#s existing rules.The influential MP also wants Scotland to look at #withdrawing from the apparatus of the UK state# and informally acquire responsibilities currently exercised by the UK Government, which could include withdrawing from institutions at Westminster.#What we have to demonstrate is that we have tried absolutely everything possible to secure the UK as a participant in resolving the question of our democratic right to consider our nation’s future,# Mr Wishart said.#We have to conclusively convince the EU and the international community that no stone has been left unturned in trying to engage them as a partner in resolving this democratically and constitutionally.#Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union hit out at Mr Wishart for spending time on the #route map# and called for him to instead to focus efforts on tackling the coronavirus crisis.She said: #It tells you everything about the SNP that Pete Wishart#s priority is a route map to separation, rather than a route map to economic recovery for the people of Scotland.#Even before the coronavirus crisis, the SNP#s blueprint for leaving the UK acknowledged there would be economic hardship # now it would be manestly worse.#The majority of people want their elected representatives to focus on bringing people together as we face the harsh reality of a deep recession with many job losses.#It#s also vital to remember that at election time people vote for parties on a wide range of issues. Pete#s proposal is therefore a non-starter and he should instead focus his efforts on representing all his constituents at this dficult time.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

It was almost near completion before lockdown – I was out on a site visit and was very impressed with what I saw then.“The anticipation is that it will be about  weeks, so around four months to complete the works.“There are hurdles to be reached and overcome, in terms of approval processes and handing over the keys to Scotrail to operate the station, but it’s hoped that by that time Kintore will be operating as a station.“There were plans to get schoolkids or a steam train involved in an opening event, but all that is secondary to getting the project complete.”The new station at Kintore is part of the Aberdeen-Inverness Improvement Project, which is sponsored by Scottish Government agency Transport Scotland and delivered by Network Rail.A Network Rail spokesperson said: “The project team are now back on-site at Kintore and work to complete the new station will gradually restart in the coming days.“While the main construction work on s and lts has been finished, there is still a considerable amount of work to do to complete the car parking and passenger facilities at the new station.”The recommencement of the construction project was announced by Network Rail alongside several others around the country, including the £m reconstruction of Glasgow Queen Street station and the £m redevelopment of Dunbar station.Michael Matheson, Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity, said: “Efforts across Scotland’s Railway, from frontline staff running day to day services to those in planning and maintenance roles behind the scenes, have played a fundamental part in ensuring key workers are able to get to where they are needed during this pandemic.“While many non-essential projects were rightfully paused, our continued investment in maintaining vital rail infrastructure has given reassurance at a dficult time.#As we now make the transition through the Routemap to Recovery, it is important we step up work where we can.“This will enable us safely to resume key projects such as the new Kintore station and Queen Street station improvements, bringing investment at a time when the supply chain and its workers need it most.“I look forward to seeing these signicant projects make progress because their completion will bring benefits to passengers, workers and the economy alike.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

I do love the current shop layout but it is not workable with the present challenges.“It#s good to a local business taking the initiative and adapting quickly.

His debut solo album Strand was released in  to critical acclaim.James said: #Gaither reflects the changing role Forvie has played over the course of history in supporting its inhabitants and visitors.#The piece features a bed of audio which I recorded at the Forvie shoreline a few years ago whilst visiting my family in Inverurie. The melody and orchestration aim to reflect the shting sands, the movement of the sea and the constant change of visitors to the area.#The writing and production process took place during the Covid- lockdown with each contributor recording engineering from home.”The music composed by each of the musicians will be released later in the year with accompanying films.A preview of James Lindsay’s piece, Gaither is available now. For more information on James, see www.jameslindsaymusic.The  winning entries were composed by musicians ranging from established artists like Marie Fielding, a lecturer at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, and James Lindsay, a musician with renowned folk band, Breabach, to emerging young artists such as Malin Lewis, Neil Sutclfe and Roo Geddes.Entrants aged  and over were invited to compose a piece of music inspired by one of  national nature reserves across Scotland. Winners receive a £ cash prize. Each winner will also have the opportunity to collaborate with a professional film maker to make a film on the nature reserve that inspired their music.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

positive steps to get football up and running continue","story":"Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes hopes Scottish football can continue to take positive steps towards ato competitive action.The Dons ed to full contact training at Cormack Park on Monday after the initial two weeks of pre-season were socially distanced.The SPFL and SFA recently confirmed Scottish Government ministers had formally approved full contact training for Premiership clubs could begin on Monday.It is another major step towards the emergence of Scottish football from the Covid- shutdown.McInnes is working his squad towards the SPFL’s targeted August  restart for the Scottish Premiership and a Europa League entry on August .After months of uncertainty during the outbreak Aberdeen now have a clear route marked out for ato action.McInnes is delighted at the recent progress made but accepts there must also be caution.He said: “In the last four weeks we have come quite a long way bit by bit.“Hopefully we can continue to keep making these small steps.“Four weeks ago everything was still a little up in the air.“Although we are not back to normality yet and not out of the woods we have taken big strides to get to where we are now.“A lot of things are now starting to take shape.“We have Europa League dates, the Premiership fixtures coming out soon and the draw date for the Europa Leagueis settled.“Now we have some dates to look forward to in the calendar.#If we take ourselves back four weeks ago, we would have taken that.“We didn’t think it was going to move as quickly as it has done and there is a lot of encouragement for the season to be started as planned.“However, clearly we still have to be mindful of the climate we are living in at the minute.“We know that things can change quite quickly.”Scottish football was shut down at all levels on March  due to the coronavirus pandemic.When Scottish Minister for Sport Joe Fitzpatrick met the SPL and SFA Joint Response Group on May  the football authorities initially proposed July  for the resumption of contact training.However earlier this month the Scottish Government were askedthat time-frame could be accelerated.After careful consideration the green light was given for the resumption of contact training on Monday supported by appropriate public \u2028health measures including regular Covid- testing.Aberdeen players had previously trained on their own for three months due to lockdown restrictions and social distancing.Eventually they ed to socially distanced training a fortnight ago at the £million Cormack Park training facility.Last week Aberdeen made the first signing of the pre-season by securing Jonny Hayes on a two-year contract.Due to the financial hit of the Covid- crisis the Dons have projected losses of £m.Hayes, who was a free agent having left Celtic, agreed to defer his wages for a year to push through ato Aberdeen.Now that contact training has resumed Hayes and his new Dons team-mates are stepping up training intensity as they work towards that August  Premiership restart.McInnes said: “We have to be mindful of the fact that it will almost be five months from the Hibs gameto the first the first game of the season.“The players have had a longer break than they have ever had.“What we did was use the first two weeks to build them up to get players really ready to what they would normally come back for a pre-season.“Then we would use that last month to get them tuned into game related practices.”Another major development in recent week is the growing hope supporters canto stadiums in limited numbers earlier than initially anticipated.Aberdeen are not expecting to have full crowds back at Pittodrie until January next year.However McInnes is optimistic that further changes to social distancing guidelines could yet allow some fans to attend games when next season kicks off.He said: “It is ongoing and it is ever-changing.#We are planning for not having full crowds back in until January  but that may well change.#A fraction of supporters being allowed in I think is a real possibility but it is all dependent on what is happening in society.“If we go down to a  metre rule that might allow stadiums and clubs to be allowed to cope with a certain amount of supporters in.“I think that would be fantastic.“Although there is pay per view and Sky have allowed clubs’ season tickets holders to watch games, supporters are desperate to get back in and watch their team.“If we can get that moving as well that would be another bonus compared to where we were three or four weeks ago when we thought that just wasn’t going to be possible.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Action is needed and the bullies must be confronted. That they were allowed to behave in this way for so long is the real shocker.Their own managers have questions to answer. Why was this not nipped in the bud  Is there an ongoing lack of management training and support Whatever the reasons, it has to stop now.Minard folk were surprised to find themselves in the papers, on television and on the radio this week.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited. The charity has created a free pack full of tips, ideas and videos to help people host their own virtual picnic.You can hold your picnic in your garden, on your balcony or on the living room floor. Just find some space, make some tasty treats and connect with friends and family online.Although we are all still respecting social distancing and cannot meet in groups, we can still share experiences together and create happy memories.  And when lockdown finally ends we can do it all again, but this time in person.To find out more and to get your free pack, visit the Family Action website.David Holmes CBE, Family Action Chief Executive Officer, London"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll golf clubs tee off as lockdown eases","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf clubs across the region are planning to re-open on a limited basis on Friday May , following the latest Scottish Government guidance.Lochgilphead Golf Club#s course will be open to members only in the first instance and members must pre-book tee times in line with Scottish Golf guidelines.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

Lothian Council to introduce a number of temporary measures to our streets as further easing of lockdown restrictions are applied.ldquoMany local shops are re-opening for business and these temporary changes are focused on protecting public health by providing necessary space for continued observance of physical distancing whilst supporting businesses and their customers.ldquoWhilst planning these new temporary changes, we have taken into account the erse needs of local communities to ensure as much as possible that those with mobility or sight concerns will be as supported as able-bodied iniduals.ldquoThese measures will create space for everyone, whether on foot, bike, wheelchair or using prams and buggies, and will support the initial stages of local economic recovery.The council said detailed plans of the changes to be introduced were still being discussed and no maps or additional information were currently available.However, it said a staged approach would be taken, with measures to be introduced including temporary widening of some footways, mph speed limits, some segregated space for cycling and opportunities for businesses to use pavement space for customer queuing.Some parking spaces within town centres may be temporarily removed."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource

He knew how to whet my appetite.\"Yet the characters arent the only element getting a makeover: billed as the originals \"spiritual descendant\", the brand-new -part series will transport viewers from Ripper-era London to the Golden Age of Hollywood in  Los Angeles.A time and place deeply infused with social and political tension, the sequel - which opens with a grisly murder - sees detectives Tiago Vegaand Lewis Michenerbattling the citys rich history. From the building of the first freeways and its traditions of Mexican-American folklore, to the dangerous espionage actions of the Third Reich and the rise of radio evangelism.In amongst the uprising, Kinnear plays Dr Peter Craft, a father of two who flits between caring paediatrician and his turn as head of the German-American Bund, an organisation he hopes will keep the United States isolated from the growing threat of war in Europe.\"Peter has a lot in common with a lot of characters in the show in that theyre all complex, conflicted, and struggling to do the right thing whilst coming up against temptation,\" says the star, whos also worked with screenwriter Logan on Bond films Skyfall and Spectre.\"He has a troubled home le, in that his we is an alcoholic and has seemingly cut herself off from looking after their children,\" he continues. \"And his profession is all about looking after kids, so were expecting that [viewers] sympathise with him.\"But obviously in meeting Elsa, the path thats in front of him changes, and as a result the audience may have their sympathies change as well.\"Elsa is just one of a number of guises adopted by Natalie Dormers character, Magda.Dubbed a supernatural demon who can assume the form of anyone she chooses, the Game Of Thrones actress - whose character believes humankind is evil - has her work cut out, as she shts between blonde German housewe Elsa, government assistant Alex, and androgynous freedom fighter Rio.Her goal: to prove her point by nudging the city towards a race war.It was a major endeavour, says the -year-old, \"in so far as its a physical and mental exercise because its four characterisations for the price of one\".\"We realised quite quickly that I had to play them as separate entities becauseyou dont play Elsa and Rio and Alex as fully fleshed out, three-dimensional characters, not only are you doing a disservice to your co-stars, the truth of the entire thing gets completely lost.\"And that actually, speaking in a pure sense as an actor, in terms of craft, its a joy because it means you have a lot of fun playing with the physicality, with voices, accents, and the costume and hair department...\" she notes.\"I was very pleased to be a stage-trained, classically trained British actor because I really did go right back to my training, in order to do this sort of exercise. It was a nice challenge.\"Similarly, Kinnear states: \"I like playing characters with lots of dferent shades [and] Peter comes upon a fairly invincible force in the shape of Elsa and Magda.\"But we dont know how much strength he has in him to withstand that temptation,\" he teases. \"You see over the course of the  episodes that he does try, and hes also trying to stand up to the more radical, Nazi wing of the German-American Bund as well, to try and make the claim for peace.\"Peter is almost the inverse of the Creature, really he is trying desperately to push down his true identity and create someone completely anew. Whereas the Creature was in constant search of his origin and identity.\"\"Magda has this theory that all mankind needs to become the monster he truly is, is to be told that he can, Dormer follows.\"For me, theres a bit of a premise that good people do bad things, whether its to do with threatening their family, their country or their vulnerability. Its that philosophical question of what it takes to bring out the uglier side in all of us.\"As for the shows key political themes - take othering, racism, and isions in society, for example - it seems theyre as relevant today as they ever were.\"What this shows is that all the tensions and dficulties of any large city, which has had a history of oppressing minority groups, have not gone away, and that they will continue to resurfacetheyre not fully addressed or addressed honestly,\" recognises Kinnear.Can he pinpoint a link between the first iteration and this \"I think its that focus on how the supernatural plays out in real peoples lives and the strength of feeling that it can still provoke not only in the s, but today as well,\" he muses.\"The first Penny Dreadful was all about the monsters that lie within us and it was using largely pre-existing literary characters,\" reasons the father of two.\"This one focuses on that same thing, but also the sense of no matter how much you study and learn, there are things that exist beyond us, beyond our comprehension, which we try to give names to.\"That can lead to fears, whether irrational or not, but it can also give succour and strength as well.\"Is there room for another series \"John is always several steps ahead,\" Kinnear finishes. \"Not only is he so extraordinarily prolic in terms of all the output that he has, across so many dferent disciplines, he really enjoys it - and Penny Dreadful was his first time doing long-form TV!\"There are lots of surprises thrown up in that, but you do have to plan your first three series because thats always the hope!\"Watch all episodes of Penny Dreadful: City Of Angels on Sky Atlantic and streaming service NOW TV from Wednesday, July ."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-dont-forget-chinas-brutality","story":"THERE have been many media revelations over Black Lives Matterand slavery, some of it very close to home. and it gives one pause for thought.During this crisis, apparently starting in China by fair means or fowl, I, like many have taken to reading.

This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus.

To be clear, I am not a member of any political party.Those better qualied than me will comment on educational standards, but as far as reopening schools is concerned it is far too early to pass judgment. We are still several weeks away in a fast-changing situation which could still go either way fully open, blended learning or local lockdown. I expect that local authorities will continue to develop solutions for each scenario over the coming weeks.Some weeks ago the London School of Economics busted the myth that care home deaths pro rata have been higher in Scotland. Fundamental responsibility for barrier nursing and supplying PPE rested with the care home owners but we should be pleased the Scottish Government helped with supplying PPE and there have been ious other positive interventions by the NHS and Care Inspectorate. The actions that the Health Secretary has taken with the NHS boards responsible for the Queen Elizabeth University and Sick Children hospitals should be welcomed rather than condemned much has still to emerge about the delivery of the respective contracts and adherence to specication. We should also commend the setting up of a central unit that will give guidance on design and procurement as well as oversee construction of hospitals across the country in future.Similarly, while the contract for the provision of rail services has not met targets, the contract is being terminated at the next break point. Surely this, combined with the plan to allow a public sector bid, is a sound action and not a failing Mr Loneskiersquos mention of ldquobranding in Gaelic is nothing to do with the SNP or the current Scottish Government. Each public body in Scotland is required to have a Gaelic Plan under the Gaelic LanguageAct , which was introduced at the time of the Labour Liberal Democrat Scottish Executive.The NHS is not the only service that is potentially unsustainable in Scotland under the current allocation of funding in the UK and we could certainly do better. We need to start to realise that Scotland is a wealthy country and when trade, production, land, sea and air assets are allocated properly, Scotland is better resourced pro rata than rUK. We are the wealthy part of the UK and are capable of funding ourselves adequately, becoming similar to countries like Denmark, Finland and Slovakia, which exist quite happily with populations around the same as ours.These small countries donrsquot need big neighbours to let them play their full part in the world either for example only last week Norway and Ireland gained seats on the UN Security Council.John C Hutchison, Fort William.WELL, there we have it, after the Tory UK Government cry of \"get Brexit done\" the mantra now appears to be \"get Covid done\" and move on. This was confirmed by our cavalier PM that England was ending its \"long national hibernation\", with lockdown rapidly easing.This is against the advice of independent health professionals, at home and around the world, who warn of the \"real risk\" of a second wave of coronavirus. However, for the sake of all the peoples of the UK I fervently hope this will not happen.As a new kind of normality arises, the meaningless intransigence of Westminster should accept that a union, freely entered into by two sovereign nations, commands mutual respect with either member able to withdrawa majority of its people decide. With separate legal systems and with very dferent views on Europe and the world, it is now up to the people of Scotland, alone, to decide their destiny. This democratic right is growing in Scotland as polls to date have risen to more than  per cent for independence and with several strong mandates already in place for indyref, an independent Scotland is inevitable with or without the permission of London.Grant Frazer, Newtonmore.FOR some time Scotland plc has been run by the marketing department, putting a kilt on everything including a Nightingale Hospital, culminating in the ridiculous plaid face mask sported by the CEO last week.In the meantime the operations departments of education, healthcare, tourism, social care and industry, have under-performed miserably when measured against the competition, yet curiously underspending every year.In the tough times ahead the shareholders of Scotland plc will demand a change of CEO and finance director and impose severe cuts to the banal marketing spend and replacement of all the department heads with people who know which way is up, because, for the first time in recorded history, you are not better off with the devil you know.John Dunlop, Ayr.I FOUND Sir Tom Hunters articleinspiring.

I look back at Damian Green, the effective ldquoDeputy Prime Minister of the entire UK, and the serious accusations which faced him. He is no longer a minister, but still a respected MP and a pundit the media often turn to for informed comment, a situation which could not be replicated in Scotland, where only the starkest black and white exist.GR Weir, Ochiltree.I AM surprised that David Rocheshould apparently sell his soul to the devil in order to gain independence for Scotland. I consider his suggestion that Labour voters should betray their cause and vote SNP in order to bring about a single-party independent state is as illogical as it is ill-timed.I believe thathe displays patience until the next UK General Election he will without any doubt see Sir Keir Starmer lead Labour to a majority by a landslide and go on to drain the swamp of Westminster.Many will agree with me that in a misguided and somewhat naiumlve effort to lead his party by consensus, Jeremy Corbyn effectively managed to design an unelectable Labour Party in the last General Election.Sir Keir now has a breathing space to reconstruct a focused, transparent and dependable UK-wide party.During the same period I anticipate Boris Johnson will continue his downward spiral of an incremental collapse in party confidence with growing public unease, suspicion and mistrust.Bill Brown, Milngavie.Read more: Sturgeon tells shoppers not to squander Covid- progress"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-asylum-seekers-just-like-us","story":"People from both sides of conflicts flee for their lives.

The tourism industry will reopen in full on July .However, the Arran Ferry Action Group says some tourism businesses on the island are deciding whether to ldquohunker down and remain in mothballs until next year.Sam Bourne, a spokesman for the group, said: ldquoI know some businesses have decided not to reopen, hotels, guest houses, and self-catering accommodation providers.

However, because of the two-metre social distancing rule, the vessel will still only run at about  per cent of its usual , capacity.While as many as , passengers are normally ferried between Arran and the mainland per day in July, numbers are currently limited to .Mr Bourne said that eventhe service s to its usual summer frequency after the tourism industry reopens on July , the reduced capacity means it may not be viable for businesses on Arran to reopen.In addition to the limitations on capacity, Mr Bourne said the new timetable exacerbates the situation facing Arran locals because CalMac will no longer reserve spaces for people who need to travel to the mainland for vital medical appointments.He noted that by the time people receive notice of medical appointments, which is often less than one week in advance, the  places for the key morning sailing off the island andcrossing will already have been taken.Mr Bourne said this contrasts with the position for residents on the Western Isles, who he said have been given a commitment that places will always be made available for people travelling for medical appointments.Mr Bourne said: ldquoThere is no guarantee [for people on Arran]. Is there a special deal for the Western Isles  This is critical. The backlog for medical appointments is huge.Meanwhile, the Arran Ferry Action Group has welcomed confirmation from CalMac that it will permit passengers to stay in their vehicles on the crossing between Lochranza on Arran and Claonaig on the Kintyre peninsula when it resumes on July , after securing an exemption from the Marine and Coastguard Agency . The route is served by the MV Catriona.Mr Bourne said: ldquoWe are slowly making progress, [but] even the north ferry is  passengers maximum and one sailing a day. It is marginal.The intervention from the group comes after it warned earlier this month that ferry capacity constraints due to coronavirus were making le on the island ldquounsustainable.A spokesman for Transport Scotland said the organisation has worked with CalMac to try and move from the essential leline timetable introduced during lockdown to a ldquoshoulderrsquo timetable by July . ldquoHowever, capacity challenges will remain as a result of physical distancing requirements on vessels that are required to protect public health and to ensure compliance with MCA regulations also, he added.The spokesman said CalMac will retain % capacity for ldquoturn up and go travel after consulting islanders who raised concerns over securing space for ldquofamily visits and other allowable trips."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-e-attendances-highest-level-since-start-lockdown","story":"Official figures showed there were , attendances at AE in the week ending June , an increase of , on the previous week.The attendance figure was the nighest since the week ending March , when there were , visits to AE.The following week, as the lockdown began, there were , attendances, as people avoided the NHS out of fear of contracting coronavirus and burdening hospitals.Numbers hit their lowest at the end of March, when there were just , attendances, leading to fears people were delaying vital treatment.Of the patients attending AE last week, . per cent were seen and admitted, transferred or discharged within the Scottish Governmentrsquos target time of four hours.This was the seconded week in a row the % target was met.The percentage of patients seen within the target time is also far higher than at the same point in , when % had to wait four hours or less.Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said: \"The latest weekly AE waiting-times figures show that for the week ending June , .% of patients were seen and treated within four hours.

He also played an important role in the early career of Steve Martin, co-writing and directing several of the comedianrsquos most successful films, including The Man With Two Brains.Reiner made many other films too, but the Dick Van Dyke television shows were probably his greatest achievement. Not only did the show make big stars of Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore, it took sitcom to a new level of sophistication.There was plenty of slapstick in therebut there was slickness, too, in the fast-paced witty script. The word we would use now for the concept would be ldquometa: Reiner was writing a comedy show about a man writing a comedy show.Reiner had tried to sell the idea for the show as a pilot with himself as the star, but the bosses didnrsquot bite. So he tried again with Van Dyke in the leading role of Rob Petrie and it was a hit, running for more than  episodes from  to . Many of the characters were based on real people Reiner had encountered while head writer on Your Show of Shows, a s iety show hosted by Sid Caesar.Reiner had actually started out not as writer but as an actor. Born in the Bronx to Jewish immigrant parents , he served for a time in the Air Force during the Second World War before pursuing a career as an actor and performer, initially in Broadway musicals.He was then cast in Your Show of Shows, often acting in skits alongside Mel Brooks. The two men formed a strong bond and created a routine in which Brooks played a ,-year-old man being interviewed by Reiner, which became a number of best-selling comedy albums.Reinerrsquos work on Your Show of Shows, as a performer and writer, was hectic. ldquoI only was an actor two or three days a week, but three and a half days a week, we were in the writersrsquo room getting it together, he said. ldquoThen wersquod rehearse it on a Thursday, put it on its feet on a Friday, show it to the cameras on Saturday, and Monday start all over again.ldquoI was a writer without a portfolio, but I was in the writersrsquo room. Thatrsquos why I wrote The Dick Van Dyke show and made Rob a writer because I felt like I was a writer most of the week.Making The Dick Van Dyke Show was just as hectic. Reiner was the producer but also head writer, writing  of the first  shows by himself. He also produced  shows a year for five years but he knew from the start he had something special. He later revived the show in a dferent format in  as The New Dick Van Dyke Show, with Van Dyke this time playing the host of a TV talk show.Away from television, Reinerrsquos career writing films began with the  Doris Day comedy The Thrill of It All, and he made four films with Steve Martin in the s and early s: The Jerk, Dead Men Donrsquot Wear Plaid, The Man with Two Brains, and All of Me.He also acted in films, including The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming, a comedy about a Soviet submarine that runs aground in America during the Cold War, and the  comedy caper Itrsquos a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.He also appeared in all the Oceanrsquos Eleven movies, as conman Saul Bloom, starting with Oceanrsquos Eleven, in . As a director, he made a black comedy about senility called Wherersquos Poppa , and Oh God!, which featured George Burns as the Almighty. One of his last films as a director was rsquos Fatal Instinct, a spoof of Basic Instinct.Reiner said he learned his skill for engaging and fast-paced comedy from his father. ldquoIt comes from not wanting to bore, he said. ldquoIf you donrsquot want to bore, you learn how to cut judiciously, and Irsquom pretty good at that.

The project has grown out of recent patterns whereby once remote destinations in the Arctic and northern European countries have become more accessible to tourists.The growth of the expedition cruise industry, cheaper accommodation and an increase in flights have all contributed to this trend. Visitors to these regions are often curious, drawn to less-visited parts of the world to experience and learn about somewhere that is off the beaten track.Now places like the isle of Arran and Assynt in Wester Ross could become international destinations alongside Iceland and Lapland with tourists keen to learn about science of a local area.Project manager Ari Laakso from the University of Lapland said ldquoTravellers want to understand and learn about what they see and experience. Often, tourists will visit a museum, a science centre or a culturally interesting venue to learn more about natural phenomena, but why not take this a step further  This new tourism concept would focus on utilising and communicating science in a fun and hands-on fashion, exploring a certain topic or place.ldquoScientists have always travelled to remote places for study and research.

As more and more companies continue to get back to work, we look at how the financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here is an example of how one company has been helped, and what support is available. vw, px\"  When the Covid- pandemic arrived the chief executive officer of East Lothian firm Sunamp, knew the company could respond. Andrew Bissellsaid: “A week into lockdown I woke up in the middle of the night and just thought ‘we have to do something that makes the business relevant in this crisis’.” Mr Bissell turned to Sunamp’s innovative technology, developed in partnership with the University of Edinburgh.The applications of the technology span several industries, but the company’s focus has so far been on offering a product that replaces the hot water tank in heating systems with something smaller and more efficient. vw, px\"  Recognising the potential of the technology in the context of Covid-, Sunamp was one of more than , companies to apply for grant funding from Innovate UK, the UK Government’s innovation agency.In April, Innovate UK launched the Fast Start initiative, with £m of funding available to companies responding to the pandemic with some form of innovation. In the end, Sunamp was one of  companies to secure a grant.The £, award is being used to develop mobile handwash units that can be installed in locations where people lack access to hygiene facilities that can help prevent the spread of Covid-. vw, px\"  Mr Bissell said: “You don’t need hot water to wash your hands, but it is much more comfortable.“Right now, we’re dealing with the virus in the summer time, but as we head into winter,you have to wash your hands outside a railway station or supermarket or vaccination centre, it will be much more pleasant to have warm water.”The idea has gained traction with Sunamp’s clients, with inquiries coming in rapidly even though the finished product is still in development. Mr Bissell said: “Covid- is a global problem so there’s widespread interest.“Sunamp has partnerships and licensing arrangements with businesses all around the world through which it sells its heat batteries, so the ambition for the mobile units is international.”For Mr Bissell, the appeal of the project is that in addition to its obvious commercial potential, there’s a real societal benefit.“There is no minimising the negatives of Covid-,” he said.“But there are many people stepping and doing amazing things.”Working with everything from gas boilers to solar and heat pumps, Sunamp says its Heat Batteries deliver hot water with efficiency and proven savings of up to  per cent on utility bills in residential, commercial or industrial settings.Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. , jobs in Scotand have been furloughed through the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme up to May ., claims amounting to £ million through the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme up to May .%of those eligible for SEISS made a claim.

It reflects the additional constraints faced by farm businesses in these communities and provides much needed financial stability.“In the midst of a pandemic, with the UK’s impending departure from the EU, there is no lack of challenges facing the farming sector at the moment. At a time of such uncertainty, retaining the benefits that LFASS delivers would seem both sensible and desirable.“The group established by the minister to develop proposals for future farm support post-Brexit is due to report shortly. It is right that consideration is given to the way funding is allocated across the board.“However, as Fergus Ewing rightly acknowledged, LFASS has shown itself to be particularly good at targeting support where it is most needed.  Moreover, in helping sustain farming and crofting in some of our most fragile areas, it also plays a pivotal role in building community cohesion.“These are ‘public goods’ we should value and protect and I am pleased that the minister seems up for the fight in ensuring this happens.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This comes as the prevalence of the condition in the county was predicted to double between  and .Anna Buchanan, of the Le Changes Trust – a charity that invests in and supports three groups, including people living with dementia and their unpaid carers # described the strategy document as an “exemplar for where” and has told members they would be contributing up to £, to support an independent the evaluation of the impact of the strategy.The meeting of the Integration Joint Board , last Wednesday, saw board members agree that the strategy document was a “formidable piece of work” and vital at a time when almost all families in Orkney will be touched by dementia in some respect.Presenting the strategy, Gillian Coghill, NHS Orkney Alzheimer Scotland Clinical Nurse Specialist, outlined the work undertaken and their aspirations for the future. She said: “The purpose of the Orkney Dementia Strategy - is to set out a renewed vision for dementia care and support in Orkney. It draws on a wide range of evidence and inter-related policies, including Scotland’s Third National Dementia Strategy. Most importantly of all, it draws on the experiences and views of people living in Orkney whose lives are affected by dementia. Some of these people are living with dementia and others are unpaid carers, often family, supporting people living with dementia.“There is often a lack of awareness and understanding of dementia, resulting in stigmatisation, inequality and barriers to diagnosis and care. The impact of dementia on carers, family and wider society can be physical, psychological, social and economic. We need to adopt a social model of dementia as a disability, recognising the challenges people with dementia face and affording the same priority to reduce impact, as we do for physical disabilities. Dementia is one of the foremost public health challenges worldwide. There is currently no cure for dementia. However, there are treatments, therapies and supports which are effective in maintaining skills and independence and contributing positively to the experiences of people with dementia and unpaid carers.”With an ageing population within Orkney, a projected increase in numbers of people with dementia presents a range of challenges, not only for the people who develop dementia, and their families and carers, but also for the statutory and voluntary services that provide care and support, Gillian Coghill explained.She said: “If the estimated prevalence rates remain similar, the number of people living with dementia in Orkney is set to almost double between  and , increasing from  to  people. We need to develop innovative ways to build capacity, resilience within financial constraints.”The five-year strategy provides a framework for improvement in support and services for people with a diagnosis of dementia and those who provide unpaid support for them throughout communities in Orkney, Ms Coghill added.“This strategy aspires to highlight the importance of risk reduction, early diagnosis and access to high quality post diagnostic support which is dynamic to needs, strengths and identied personal outcomes for people with dementia.“It recognises the positive contribution and need to support carers, volunteers and staff and has been developed from a grass roots perspective. It supports Community Led Support and the need for integrated systems, which promote enablement and uphold rights for people with dementia, the building of dementia friendly communities and increasing community capacity to enable people with dementia to live well, without stigma as a valued part of their community and in their own homes when possible.“This strategy evidences the importance of planning and developing services and supports for and with people living with dementia. It addresses the challenges involved in meeting the needs of the growing number of people who will be diagnosed with dementia, recognising the unique challenges and strengths of the Orkney community. It supports the right care, in the right place at the right time by the right people.“There is recognition of the need to do things dferently, both in relation to people’s experiences and to ensure a sustainable model of support. We need to work together with all relevant people and groups to design and deliver the best care and support we can. This provides us with an opportunity to make changes which support the appropriate level of priority and investment needed for dementia in Orkney. We need to ensure that dementia is prioritised and kept firmly on the agenda in all relevant policies, procedures and plans.”Members of the IJB approved the strategy and consultation will now take place with key stakeholders, results of which will be presented to the board at a future meeting, no later than September .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We do have movie nights in winter when we watch DVD’s and now Netflix through a data projector onto a large pull-down screen.It is almost a cinematic experience with the sound coming through my old-fashioned stereo and its big speakers on the wall.Very occasionally though I get to hear about a television drama that sparks an interest.Mostly they are forgotten asthey are any good, they are released on DVD or online as a mini-series, like Sherlock, produced by Skye’s own Douglas Mackinnon, and I can enjoy them at my leisure, glass and popcorn in hand while lying on a sofa.Last week however, I heard about the BBC drama The Salisbury Poisonings, an adaptation of the real events following the attempted murder of a former Russian spy in , and the ensuing public health danger.The series was timely.There was talk of tracking and tracing, areas were locked down, and there was a possible spread of an invisible deadly nerve agent.Containment was the key.Viewers now have an understanding and comprehension about much of the unfolding events, that they perhaps wouldn’t have had, were it screened four months earlier.Contamination through contact from surfaces such as light switches and work surfaces and Salisbury business owners complaining at a public meeting of a  per cent drop in trade due to the cordons in their streets.Much of what happened would strike a chord with many, as would the uncertainty of it all.I managed to watch the three episodes, albeit a few days after they were broadcast, and was struck how the story was a human one.It was about ordinary people doing the best they could in an unprecedented situation.It was seemingly very true to le. The screenplay was written after many interviews with the real players, who we meet briefly in a moving vignette at the end.The main protagonist was director of public health for the local authority Tracy Daszkiewicz.She found herself transported from doing the school run on the way to her perhaps ordinary council job, to making decisions in overflowing conference rooms with senior police officers, Porton Down chemical warfare experts and Whitehall representatives, the outcome of which could either prevent or mitigate the deaths of thousands of people.At times Daszkiewicz sits in her car with her head on the steering wheel, fighting back the tears and trying not to be overcome by the gravity of it all.Her agenda, quite simply was to protect the health of the people.As lockdown begins to be eased in Scotland, we know well enough that there is a balance between lives and livelihoods, health and the economy, mental and physical well-being, and consequence for the future.Decisions are being made daily as to how to ease the country back into a new normality in the most appropriate manner.These decisions are beginning to be politicised, and the old adversarial ways are beginning to rear their ugly heads in the chambers of our government.It is correct that decisions are scrutinised, and justication is asked for in public, but knee jerk criticism for political posturing is untimely, and often disingenuous.We are still very much in a public health crisis.The future is unknowable, and whatever path is taken, there will be negative consequences.It is not at all cut and dried or in any way unambiguous.Mark Twain popularised the quote “lies, damned lies and statistics”, but numbers are persuasive.If we are to believe the figures gleaned from the internet, England with  times the population has approximately  times the average daily new cases and hospital admissions, and  times the deaths.In England, the Westminster government is handling the crisis dferently, perhaps with a dferent agenda and a dferent emphasis on the balance between the health of the economy and the health of the population.Perhaps they have dferent priorities, but I have medic friends who are glad they live in Scotland, and worry how things might pan out south of the border.Lockdown couldn’t, and cannot last forever.The new normal must include commerce which must include tourism, but when I hear tourism representatives arguing for a reduction in the distance of social distances in order to protect jobs and businesses, I wonder, how many extra deaths should we allow in order to allow a pub to open.There are always dferent viewpoints and it takes real wisdom to be able to consider all perspectives.When the lobbyists and business sector leaders want relaxations to protect their interests, I hope they realise the bigger picture, and no decision which may preclude their ruin, would be taken lightly or flippantly.The collateral damage of closed down businesses I am sure will weigh heavily on the consciousness of our political leaders.I am reminded of a cartoon I have seen used in conflict resolution courses. Two people are looking at a number drawn on the floor from opposite angles, with the phrase “just because you are right doesn’t mean to say I am wrong”The number is of course a , or is it a  It is clear that the sliding and phasing of the opening of tourism and recreational facilities is to keep a slowly-slowly approach to prevent a flood of movement of people and the virus.They could have said folk with brown eyes are allowed out on Tuesdays and Thursdays, anything to stem a possible tide.An aspect of leadership is to be able to make dficult decisions, taking all criteria on board often in the face of criticism, trying to see the big picture in the face of uncertainty.A change of decision, a backtrack or U turn seems to be regarded as weakness by an opposition, although I have never understood why.Surely it shows strength of character to realise that a chosen path might not be the best, and that a dferent option might be better.There has been some discussion about female leaders acting dferently and perhaps more appropriately in the face of the current pandemic.I wonderSalisbury was lucky having a female director of health,the poisoning drama is to be believed. Tracy Daszkiewicz acted with incredible professionalism and complete integrity, with compassion and humanity.Political allegiances aside I believe that the same could be said of our own leader in Holyrood, a person doing an extraordinary job in an unprecedented situation.I wonderNicola Sturgeon sometimes stops her car puts her head on the steering wheel and weeps at the gravity of it all.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hope-and-faith-scaled.jpg","title":"skye youngsters clock up more than 10000 miles for zambian school","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe Portree High students were challenged to clock up the miles and between them run or walk the distance between Skye and Lusaka, Zambia – home of the Hope and Faith Community School.Over the last two months pupils and teachers have completed , miles, easily surpassing their original ,-mile target.Now the youngsters have been challenged to add a further , miles before the term ends, and to add to the £ that has been brought in for the project.A donation of £ will pay for school meals for all pupils at the school, which has long established links to Skye.The school began in  with two pupils, but has since grown to help provide education – and a daily meal – for over  children on the outskirts of the Zambian capital..There have been exchange visits between the schools, and Portree teachers Neil Burrows and Tony Breen had been due to head to Africa at Easter, with two Zambian teachers ing to Skye in May.It is now hoped the exchange can go ahead in .Mr Breen, Portree’s deputy head, said the challenge had been a positive one – both for the charity and for the health and well-being of the pupils during lockdown.He added: “We are very pleased with the balance of work and wellbeing for the majority of our pupils.“Looking at our provision of online learning in comparison with the rest of Scotland, most parents have been happy with the dferent ways in which pupils have been learning # from watching teachers pre-made videos, google meets and chats, online quizzes, and even DIY science practicals.”.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Skye-golf-club-sconser.jpg","title":"green for go competitions off and running again at the isle of skye golf","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineSomewhat belatedly the competitions have commenced and it was to the ladies section that the honour of opening the season belonged.On a recent blustery Sunday a quartet of quines graced the fairways at Sconser and Sandi Beatson emerged from the pack to steal the headlines on day one.Playing off her #mark# of  two steady halves of  and  saw her record an opening day handicap-reducing gross score of  and an immediate #cut# from  to  so very well played and what a great start to her golfing season.Proxime accessit was Donalda Johnston with a gross score of  in this the first of five rounds to be played for the Ladies Championship.Incidentally in this same competition last year Sandi also recorded a victorious, handicap-reducing score of three under the Competitions Scratch Score* for the day. This time round she doubled that.A few days later and this time a quintet of girls flew in formation round the course again this time competing for the Lochalsh Ladies Stableford prize.Sandi Beatson, fresh from victory in the first competition of the season, registered her second straight win but on this occasion only by the very narrowest of margins # the dreaded #better inward half# which is a count-back method used to declare a result when scores are tied after  holes.The player with the better score for holes - is then declared to be the winner.Apparently, the weather conditions were favourable so it#s dficult to see why the recorded #numbers# were so comparatively poor against the par of the course.New club member Shona Jackson very nearly started off her campaign with victory but I#m sure that even after one bf she#ll be able to settle in and join our girls in chat, combat and competitions.By my calculations Sandi#s two loops were +pts whereas Shona#s were +pts and that my friends was how the result was decided.With the threat of the coronavirus still hanging over us the committee decided at short notice to add a Skye Community Response fundraising competition to the club fixture list to be played over a period of two days with all the entry fees being donated to that worthy local cause.Players both male and female could submit as many rounds as they liked in the two day period and despite the rather fy weather several took the opportunity to sharpen their respective games and submit more than one ##.Playing on day one Robbie Macaskill and Chris Hanley # the latter proudly brandishing a new set of sticks # ed the day#s best scores of pts in the Stableford format with the former easing the latter courtesy of the better inward half.Despite a rocky , prelude to his round Robert settled well toloop scores of  and .Chris was on fire on the first nine with a fine  but the old fella must have been eating too many chocolate bars during lockdown and faded to  #coming home#.Donnie Macphee took third place one point in arrears.Some of the boys ed next day for another bf and another contribution to the charitable cause of choice but it was Hamish Philp, who had apparently been #shooting the lights out# in the winter league, who ed the best score of the occasion # a blistering pts.Had the competition been an official #counter# for handicap purposes Hamish would have graciously received a reduction of a couple of shots from his current mark but the omens for his season look promising.A distant speck in the rear view mirror was Ryan Macaskill on pts with John Maclean weighing into bronze position courtesy of pts for his honest endeavour on the day.However, pause for drum roll.The award for #the moment# must go to Club Captain Kenny Macleod who bodaciously eagled the par  th hole # all yds of it # and into the prevailing wind too!One wonders how many stones or sprinkler heads the old boy#s ba# must have bounced off to propel him to the distant target in three miserly shots.This is not aggrandisement # it was a truly remarkable effort by the bodach!The most prestigious competition in the gents fixture list # the Club Championship # is coming soon and there should be better than average competition this time round in pursuit of the title won by Ryan Macaskill in .One can#t help noticing that the assimilation of the three young lads into the fold last year caused some of the higher single-figure handicappers to emerge from their possible casual slumber of complacency and do something to improve both their game and their handicaps to ward off the challenge from these youngsters.It worked and not just to the benefit of the players themselves but to the general enhancement of the playing calibre of the gents section of the golf club.Two qualying rounds will be played to determine the four successful candidates eligible to compete in knockout matchplay semi-finals in their quest to be crowned Club Champion and subsequently have their name added to the Roll of Honour in the clubhouse #it#s doors ever swing open again Emerging from this prolonged and enforced period of omphaloskepsis and procrastibaking one can confidently predict a healthy turnout of golfing gladiators irrespective of the weather!CSS or Competition Scratch Score is a reflection of the playing dficulty of the course based on the scores ed with the handicaps represented on any particular day.Stableford format awards points as follows. Eagle, two under parpts: birdie, one under parpts, parpts and bogey, one over parpt.This form of play is very popular as a very high score on one or two holes doesn#t ruin the player#s chances of winning as would be the case in medal or strokeplay competition.Generally speaking the better players prefer the former while the rest of us favour the latter!Par is the score expected to be recorded on the hole by a #scratch# player and is determined by the number of shots the player should take to reach the green then add on two for putts.A par can be three # one shot plus two putts four # two shots plus two putts or five # three shots plus two putts. .

While NIE Networks staff will still not be entering customers’ homes to obtain a meter read at this time, they will call at customers’ doors and ask them to read their meter while they wait. Meter readers will be able to take readings from meters located in outside positions as normal.NIE Networks is urging customers to protect its meter readers and themselves by continuing to observe social distancing protocols. Ben Cupples, Meter Reading Manager at NIE Networks, explained the importance of recording a precise meter reading for the customer.“Providing a precise meter reading will ensure that your electricity bills accurately reflect your consumption,” he said. “Our meter readers will call to your home and will record the reading you provide while we wait.“If you are unable to read your meter for any reason oryou are not at home when we call, we will leave a card with information on how to submit your meter reading online via the NIE Networks website, via email or over the phone.”Mr Cupples explained that while meter reading activity would resume it would only be carried out with the health and safety of the public and meter readers in mind.“The safety of our employees and customers is our utmost priority. “If you see our meter readers out and about, we would ask that you please help them by standing at least two metres away. Likewise, we will stand at least two metres from customers’ doors at all times.“We are continually reviewing how we undertake our meter reading activities in light of COVID- and we are looking forward to being able to resume our normal way of working with customers at some stage, but we will only make that decision when it’s safe to do so.” NIE Networks is reminding customers that you only need to submit your reading to either NIE Networks or your supplier – there is no need to do it twice. Customers unable to submit a meter reading will receive an estimated bill from their supplier based on their usage history.If a member of the NIE Networks team arrives at the door, they will always show identication.

It would make much more sense not to go ahead, said Dr Holohan.The development comes as the Government prepares to unveil its first stage of #air bridges# - a number of short-haul European destinations which will not require UK holidaymakers to quarantine.The move has been hailed as giving the travel industry - which has suffered greatly due to the pandemic - a vital boost.However, Dr Scally told the Belfastyesterday the public should give foreign travel a miss this year - a plea which has been described by travel operators here as soul-destroying as demand in holiday bookings s.My personal view is that we should take a holiday from having foreign holidays, he said.There shouldn#t be any holiday trips outside the island of Ireland this year.The basic principle is that we shouldn#t be flying off to the sun for a couple of reasons. I don#t think it is safe to go holiday tourist hotspots becausethere are going to be flare-ups of the virus abroad, the likelihood is that those holiday hotspots will be prime candidates and people may get the virus and bring it back with them.Dr Scally continued: The risks coming back are importing cases into Ireland where - north and south - the number of cases are extremely small.And the best way of keeping them extremely low - in fact getting rid of them entirely, I believe - is that there should be a zero-Covid island.The risk of people importing new cases is that they can spread quite rapidly through the community and travelling through airports and public transport.Dr Scally said that the Executive should follow the footsteps of the Republic and issue the same no foreign holiday plea.I think the Executive should consider the matter and come out with a very clear statement and work very closely with the new government in the Republic, and take an agreed position on the matter, he said.It should be something we have in common, that just for this year, it#s a stay at home year, and enjoy your own country.In response, Health Minister Robin Swann has urged the public to take precautionsthey do make the decision to go on a foreign holiday.Clearly there is a risk in travelling to countries where the virus is still very much circulating, he said. I would urge the public to take all necessary precautions to reduce their chance of becoming infected, including following governmental advice for travellers as well as adhering to good hand and respiratory hygiene, keep to the social distance guidelines and follow the guidance in relation to the use of face coverings.Dr Scally also said that people staying at home would give the economy a boost on both sides of the border.It would be betterthe pounds and the euros on the island of Ireland were spent on tourism in the island of Ireland, he said. And that would help local businesses to recover and keep people employed and restore the economy.Heather Fielding, managing director of Gallagher Travel, said customers# #wanderlust# is now ing.The demand for travel is here, even though restrictions may be in place, she said.We#ve noticed a real increase in demand for the remainder of this summer, and we#ve had key workers working non-stop and they#re ready for a holiday away. People now want to getaway. Some people are postponing trips, but we#re definitely seeing that demand coming back.Ms Fielding said that a message urging people not to go abroad now would be coming at the wrong time for the industry, although she stressed public health remains the priority.It#s soul destroying. We#re in a kind of no man#s land and we#re taking a day at the time as an industry, she added. The managing director also stressed there are definitely deals to be had for customers.Meanwhile, Naomi Waite, director of marketing at Tourism NI said there is plenty of choice for those who are opting to have a staycation at home.Whether it#s revisiting childhood holiday destinations with your own family or awakening your sense of adventure, there will be a giant welcome for visitors this summer, she said.

The Very Rev David Monteith, from Enniskillen, said he wanted to offer a message of support to those now facing added weeks of uncertainty.He also called on the government not to forget the most vulnerable, with many of those testing positive for the virus in Leicester coming from low income and BAMEbackgrounds. The first localised lockdown in the UK was announced after Health Secretary Matt Hancock said around % of all positive cases in England were detected there over the last week.Non-essential shops have closed and schools will follow for at least two weeks for the city centre and some suburbs, with citizens advised not to make unnecessary journeys.Rev Monteith said he is now uncertain about when he canto Enniskillen to visit his parents, or when Leicester Cathedral can reopen.It#s quite sombre here, people are quite stunned, he told the Belfast .The city is quieter today but clearly not everyone has got the message so it#s not quite back to how it was in March or April.He noted how coronavirus death figures in Leicester during the worst parts of the pandemic were lower than expected, adding: Hospitals were pretty much managing to keep on top of things so this suddenly coming into the public arena has really surprised people.Places of worship in England were allowed to open for private prayer earlier this month, with full worship supposed to follow on July . In a very multicultural city like Leicester, that includes mosques, temples, churches and synagogues, he said. Private prayer has worked for some traditions, but in mosques you#re supposed to pray in public.This weekend many faith communities, including the Christian community, would have been able to have a much more normal sense of worship.The cathedral is now closed until further notice, and funerals will again have to be held outside with limited numbers.It sits at the burial site of Richard III, and just this week a large group of tourists had been welcomed inside. This was the first timethat any of us have been in a room with  or more people and there was a real delight and joy about it evenyou couldn#t shake hands or hug, Rev Monteith said.Initially lockdown was a big shock for us. We#ve been doing online weekly services and sometimes we get very signicant numbers of people, far more than would ever come to church. But there#s something about physical presence which is still important even though online offers new possibilities.Somehow we#re going to have to work with both of these realities moving forward.Offering hope to those dreading the latest restrictions, he said: I think I#ve noticed that this whole process has affected people very dferently. Some have found the space and the clear air to have been a delight, while other people have struggled incredibly.But the human spirit is incredibly resilient and hope has not died at all. If anything in Leicester we#ve learned over the years that hope is a gt that comes from community.That#s been my experience over the years,I find myself locked away in a dark place, often the way to get out of it is to break out and reach out.As Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced plans to spend billions on infrastructure projects, Rev Monteith said those in need must be included.A lot of the people who are being tested positive in Leicester come from BAME backgrounds, and people living in poverty and working in very low paid jobs.We#ve seen a way in which we as a society have revalued care workers who are also not paid very much. I suppose moving forward, in thinking about the type of society we want to try and create, I think church and faith leaders are up for playing their part in creating a much more equitable society.On Tuesday Matt Hancock told BBC Breakfast there was an unusually high incidence of coronavirus in children in Leicester.The Health Secretary said that while work was still being done to understand why Leicester had been so badly affected, extra testing had found under-s testing positive for the virus. He added that the decision to shut the city#s schools was made to try to halt further transmissions.

If they are all table service, that should alleviate any problems. It#s really important that government gives us a date. Regrettably, I do think this virus, and therefore social distancing, will be here for a very long time. We need government to help those businesses which just physically cannot reopen.Speaking on the Ulster Business Podcast, Janice Gault, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation, said while everyone is looking forward to coming back, there is a little bit of nervousness around it.We have discovered that people miss the type of product we provide, she said.But many spots, even those which are technically able to open their doors to serve food, will not open this weekend.The days of the shoulder-to-shoulder pub and back-to-back restaurant will not be with us for a while, Mr Neill says.There will be a responsibility on customers, businesses and staff to do everything to stop the spread of this virus.Mr Rana, whose company owns hotels such as The Crowne Plaza and Ibis in Belfast, said while the core of hotels won#t have changed, customers will start noticing dferences.Hotels are about hospitality ... the fundamentals won#t change. There will be more distance between yourself and fellow diners, but the real work is behind the scenes, he said. In our four star hotels, breakfast will be largely served. The buffet is a touch point we are trying to avoid.In the mid-market and budget hotels there will be a range of #to go# options, just presented in a dferent manner.Ms Gault says while businesses are now keen to bring staff back to work, getting through to March next year is going to be a challenge.Listen to the full podcast at www.ulsterbusinessBelfast Most ReadBobby Storey funeral a #kick in the teeth# for those who respected Covid- restrictions, claims DUP#I wish I had seen Noah when he left his bike outside my front door#Parades body #has no powers# to stop Twelfth marchesTop  speeding hotspots in Northern Ireland revealed as detections rise by % in yearPSNI investigating whether Bobby Storey funeral breached Covid- regulations,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I realised it had to be his.Ms Crooks, who attended the north Belfast vigils for Noah on Sunday, immediately called the police at pm. A neighbour#s CCTV would later show Noah walking around the back of the Northwood Road, where there is access to a storm drain, which may or may not have been locked.They realised this must have been where Noah was last seen alive, she said.I#d obviously started a chain of events because then they were then able to find his clothes and helmet.Then the search and rescue teams appeared. They were here most of the night searching the area around my house, trying to work out where he went next.As a child who grew up here, I was asking myself #where would I have gone  What would I have done#  I just couldn#t work it out.She also revealed that she became very emotional when police officers called to collect Noah#s bicycle.When they took the bike away on Tuesday afternoon, I burst into tears, she said.I#ve had to take comfort from the fact that me coming across that bike brought the rescue team here to start the search. If I hadn#t brought them here, to this storm drain and this river, maybe they would never have found him.Ms Crooks, a classroom assistant, said she didn#t need to watch any of the news reports because she watched the search unfold in my front garden, my street and in my community.She also told how she met Noah#s aunt Niamh in her back garden and she said they would always be welcome at her home, should they wish to visit.Niamh and others came down to help in the search at one point and had made their own sandwiches, she said. Pastor Brian Madden, who was comforting the family, said #put those sandwiches away, we have got hot food for you, and tea and coffee#. As Brian later said, they didn#t want to encroach on anyone#s generosity.Ms Crooks said that, as a mother of two young boys, she could only imagine how Noah#s mother must be feeling at the loss of her son.You just believe your children are always going to be there with you, she said.Unfortunately that#s now not the case for Fiona. How she#s going to get over this, I just don#t know. I#m heartbroken for her and her family.It is still not known why Noah entered the drain, but police have said they do not believe there was any foul play.The funeral will take place at St Patrick#s Church in north Belfast at am on Wednesday.On Monday the Lord Mayor of Belfast, Frank McCoubrey, opened an online book of condolence in memory of Noah.He said: People from across the city have been deeply affected by the loss of young Noah, and their thoughts and prayers are with Noah#s mother and wider family circle at this devastating time.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cba-ba-a-d-abea_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cba-ba-a-d-abea_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cba-ba-a-d-abea_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cba-ba-a-d-abea_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cba-ba-a-d-abea_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"VideoNorthern IrelandPrivate funeral to be held for schoolboy Noah Donohoe A private funeral will be held for tragic schoolboy Noah Donohoe on Wednesday, his family has announced.

The move was backed by the DUP, Sinn Fein and the SDLP, while the UUP, Alliance, Greens and People Before Profit gave their support to an amendment from TUV leader Jim Allister.The North Antrim MLA proposed that an independent body be given the role of setting future allowances, subject to Assembly Commission guidance.However, Mr Allister#s proposal was rejected by a vote of  to , with one abstention.He said he feared that those behind the proposal had failed to learn from previous abuses of the expenses system.Those who tabled the motion must have short memories. I do not think that the public have, added the TUV leader. The public well remember that when the system that is proposed in the motion was in operation - namely, that MLAs controlled, through the commission, their own expenses - it was abused and the product was scandal.Alan McQuillan was part of the  in an independent review which previously determined the salaries, expenses and pensions paid to MLAs.He said: This decision takes them back  years. They will be the only legislative body in the UK or Ireland doing this.My fear is that, give it two or three years and we will find ourselves in the original situation, causing serious damage to the reputation of the Assembly.DUP MLA Keith Buchanan, who put forward the allowances proposal, said the current rules failed to recognise economic realities facing MLAs.The motion will enable the Assembly Commission to ensure that members can legitimately purchase basic items to help them to deliver services to our constituents, that an MLA#s contact details can be promoted on the constituency office, and, most notably, to ensure that the terms and conditions of employment of the staff who work in our offices are fair and reasonable, he added.Sinn Fein#s John O#Dowd argued that the TUV amendment would cause further delays to expenses reforms.Mr O#Dowd said: Go back to your staff in your constituency offices, or some of your staff may be sitting in offices in this building. Sit down in front of them, look them in the eye and say, #I had the opportunity to correct a wrong, but I backed an amendment in the full knowledge that it would fail#.Belfast Most ReadBobby Storey funeral a #kick in the teeth# for those who respected Covid- restrictions, claims DUP#I wish I had seen Noah when he left his bike outside my front door#Parades body #has no powers# to stop Twelfth marchesTop  speeding hotspots in Northern Ireland revealed as detections rise by % in yearPSNI investigating whether Bobby Storey funeral breached Covid- regulations,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, the CCNI stressed that charities could continue to operate as previously without any disruption to their operations.The watchdog added: Furthermore, the commission will be contacting as many charity funders and support bodies as possible in order to clary the situation and request that this issue be taken into consideration when assessing applications from charities.A solution is being sought from the Department for Communitiesin order to permanently resolve the issue regarding decisions. Further information and guidance will be provided on the commission#s website.The DfC assured the charities affected that they remain charities in law and need do nothing dferently in the interim.It added that Caral Ni Chuilin, who is acting as Communities Minister in the absence of Deirdre Hargey, would shortly outline how the department intends to respond to the issues raised by the court judgment.The department is assured that the Charity Commission has introduced interim procedures to ensure decisions can be taken in compliance with the judgment, a spokesman said.Belfast Most ReadBobby Storey funeral a #kick in the teeth# for those who respected Covid- restrictions, claims DUP#I wish I had seen Noah when he left his bike outside my front door#Parades body #has no powers# to stop Twelfth marchesTop  speeding hotspots in Northern Ireland revealed as detections rise by % in yearPSNI investigating whether Bobby Storey funeral breached Covid- regulations,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I#m thankful for having had Bishop Donal as a trusted companion in what became for us a joint quest. Donal and I do what we do because of a sense of calling. Jesus told his disciples to love one another and that is a command we have sought to live up to and share as best we can, whatever the cost. In this, we have been privileged to follow in the footsteps of inspirational predecessors. Bishop McKeown said the awards would serve as an encouragement to the Church and wider civic society. He explained: It is a privilege to receive this award along with Bishop Ken. He laboured long and faithfully in this corner of the Lord#s vineyard.

His coffin was draped in the Tricolour.Thousands of mourners congregated on each side of the Andersonstown Road as the cortege left the family home at Owenragh Park at around .am for the short journey to the church.Men and women dressed in black trousers, white shirts and black ties formed a guard of honour, while black flags hung from the windows of houses along the street, and two kilted pipers played airs that included The Minstrel Boy, Sean South of Garryowen, A Nation Once Again and On Raglan Road.In accordance with coronavirus regulations, about  people were permitted to walk behind the hearse, including Mr Storey#s partner Teresa, children, grandchildren and other family members. Also among them were Sinn Fein presidents past and present Gerry Adams and Mary Lou McDonald, the party#s northern leader and deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill and members of her late predecessor Martin McGuinness#s family.Thousands more lined the footpaths as far as the eye could see.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming ba .ece AUTOCROP w BT_KA.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph

on a cold, grey morning, with rain falling only as the funeral procession made its way to Milltown Cemetery, where Mr Adams delivered a eulogy.I don#t know anyone who knew him who didn#t like him. Except for MI, MI, the old RUC, the British Army, and prison governors, said Mr Adams.How could you not like him  He was smart, well read, funny, caring, always ready to listen - always willing to help - always prepared to give freely of his time and his great positive energy.Earlier, a security check of the area surrounding the church had been conducted.The service was led by Fr Gary Donegan at the request of the Storey family.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseFr Gary Donegan FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappFr Gary DoneganFr Donegan, director of the Passionist Peace and Reconciliation Office in north Belfast, knew Mr Storey for two decades from his time as rector of Holy Cross Church in Ardoyne.Mourners were told that Mr Storey was a -hour-a day-activist and leader who led from the front all his le.In his homily, Fr Donegan quoted from a tweet written by Sinn Fein veteran Gerry Kelly shortly after Mr Storey died, in which the MLA wrote: Bobby ran the marathon of le at a sprint, in conflict and in peace... his legacy will drive us all forward.Fr Donegan - who earlier this week hit out at keyboard warriors criticising him for taking on the former IRA leader#s funeral - said: Over these days, many comments and eulogies have and will be written about Bobby. This is dferent.He told the congregation that Mr Storey was raised during a time when communities were under threat and the Army were constantly patrolling the streets... ultimately the family were intimidated from their home and spent several days sheltering in Girdwood Army Barracks.Mr Storey would later rise in the republican ranks, becoming the IRA#s director of intelligence and the northern chairman of Sinn Fein. He spent many years in jail for ious offences, played a key role in the mass IRA breakout from the Maze Prison in  and was widely regarded as one of the most feared and formidable members of the republican organisation.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThe late Bobby StoreyKevin Scott   Belfast  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe late Bobby StoreyHe is also credited with having played a prominent role in the peace process.Fr Donegan said that, having worked as a confessor for the past  years, he thanks God for not being confined to the limitations of human compassion and mercy.Often the biggest task of a confessor is to convince people to follow God#s example and to forgive themselves, he told the congregation.Reflecting on Mr Storey#s le, Fr Donegan described him as a devoted partner to Teresa with a gt of humour extended to all he met.The priest recalled how Mr Storey#s -year relationship with Teresa began to develop from the time of Bobby#s first parole in  and how his partner spoke of Bobby the family man and the great love he had for sister Geraldine and brothers Seamus and Brian.She told us of the great mutual love shared between Bobby and her sons Emmett, Fergal and Sean, he continued.The priest added that Bobby Storey will be fondly remembered by those who knew him.Ironically, his funeral may be remembered more by those who did not.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappSpeeding is a major cause of accidents resulting in deaths.By Adrian RutherfordJune   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe number of speeding offences in Northern Ireland has surged by % year-on-year.Almost , incidents were recorded on the region#s roads in  - equivalent to  every day on average.In one case a driver was caught at mph, nearly double the road#s mph limit.The worst hotspot was the Frosses Crankill Road in Co Antrim, where , offences were recorded.A senior PSNI officer said speeding was still the single biggest killer on our roads.Inspector Rosie Leech said: Far too many people continue to take unacceptable risks on our roads whether speeding, not paying attention, driving after drinking, taking drugs or not wearing seatbelts.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappNew figures released by the Northern Ireland Road Safety Partnershipshow that:, speeding detections were made in . This was a % increase on the  figure .The fixed speed camera site on the Upper Newtownards Road in Belfast accounted for more than one-thirdof the , speeding detections by fixed cameras in .Over halfof all speed related detections were on mph roads.The highest speed recorded in  was mph. This was detected on the A Dunman dual carriageway near Cookstown, a mph road.Other bad examples included a driver caught at mph in a mph zone and another doing mph in a mph zone.RSP vans were deployed , times in , an increase of % on deployments in , partly explaining the rise in detections.The data is contained in the NI RSP#s latest annual bulletin. There are four fixed speed cameras, six fixed red light running cameras and one average speed enforcement camera system here. Eight speed camera vehicles also operate at ious locations throughout the region.The number of speed detections in  was more than four times the total recorded in  .The main reason was the reduction in the speed threshold at which a driver can be detected speeding. Additional sites for enforcement were also added in  and .Detections at fixed camera sites totalled , - down by % when compared with .The fixed site on the Upper Newtownards Road, Belfast, accounted for % of detections by fixed cameras, followed by Springfield Road, Belfast , Antrim Road, Belfastand Saintfield Road, Belfast . The Saintfield Road cameras had signicant downtime throughout .The number of detections at mobile camera sitesincreased by % between  and .This followed an increase in deployments of safety camera vans, resulting in more detections.The , other cases were detected by #average speed# cameras.Inspector Leech said everyone had a responsibility to make our roads safer.She added: Removing excess speed from the road safety equation should be the easiest thing that every road user can do. If we all stop speeding, more people live. If we all stop speeding, fewer people have to contend with le-changing injuries.All right-thinking and law-abiding motorists will realise that speed restrictions are not there to inconvenience them but to make our roads safer for everyone. Our aim is to prevent people from being seriously injured or killed. As speeding is considered one of the major causes in road traffic collisions, we make no apology for adopting a tough approach to enforcement.All motorists have a duty to drive in a responsible manner, butthey do not then we have a duty to detect and prosecute them.Infrasturcture Minister Nichola Mallon said: Unfortunately, for many families excessive speeding is persistently one of the main causes of death and serious injury on our roads and this is unacceptable.Speeding isn#t just about doing  or  miles per hour. It is about going too fast for the conditions.As a driver, it is your responsibility to adapt your driving - according to the weather, the type of road, your own ability and enough to expect the unexpected.So far  people have lost their lives on Northern Ireland#s roads this year.

There were definitely lots of botched jobs done during lockdown, she joked.We are high-fiving the women who didn#t do the botched colouring.Mrs Grufferty said the last number of weeks had been hectic as she prepared for reopening, with a range of new safety measures implemented, including screens and personal protective equipment. It#s been very expensive, she continued. It#s crippling for a business when they#ve not been making money but for the safety of my staff and also the customers that come in here, it was a no-brainer, we had to take that hit and just put that in.Realistically you can#t run your business and make sure everyone is protected and make sure your staff are protected without stuff like this so it was really dficult, but it has to be done.She said customers would notice many changes, including an appointment-only system.We also can#t give them a hug now, she added.Mrs Grufferty#s sister-in-law Kathleen was one of the first back into one of the salon#s chairs yesterday morning.I#m very excited to be back and feel normal again, she said.I was in at am this morning, it was great - one of the first.Bryant Jordan was also there early.

Lavey Parish pooled their energies to raise almost pound, to contribute to the recent work on St Mary’s Church of Our Lady of Mercy. Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much. At the end of the lockdown period I think we were all, kind of, looking for a lt of some kind and it certainly gave us all a great lt. “I want to say a sincere thanks to everybody who was involved - everybody who was at the organising end of it, and particularly to the groups that took part.” The fundraiser received huge community support, with local sports clubs in the area all taking on a specic challenge to help with the chapel’s restoration. Erin’s Own GAA’s underage footballers and hurlers ran km each, while their senior counterparts ran a collective km. googletag.cmd.push Termoneeny Hill Walking Club had originally pledged to walk a collective km, but upped their target to ,km during the course of their challenge. Termoneeny Cycling Club members each cycled km, while the Erin’s Own camogie players each clocked up at least km. -year-old Harry Boyle’s remarkable contribution saw him cycling around all the townlands in the parish, while Fr Graham and his parochial team got involved by running in their Lavey gear. The challenge was not just limited to Lavey, though, and their diaspora throughout the world got involved via social media, sharing photos of them completing their contribution. The club have raised almost pound, to date and donations can still be made via the Lavey Parish Just Giving page.

The five-bedroom property called The Qube will be built on land beside the Everglades Hotel. It has been advertised as one of Northern Irelands only passive houses, which means it will use very little energy and leave a small ecological footprint. The three-story dwelling will also be a smart home and the lights, heating and blinds can all be operated from a tablet or smartphone. googletag.cmd.push  The , sq ft building will be locatedon a triangular piece of landat the junction of Prehen Road andHazelwood Avenue.

However, the journey to obtaining this was not a smooth one. In Northeern Ireland, local councils are responsible for most planning decisions. Each council has planning officers who make recommendations about planning applications. However, the Planning Committee, which is made up of councillors, has the option to reject these recommendations. googletag.cmd.push The planning application for The Qube first came before Derry City and Strabane District Councils Planning Committee last September. Council planners provided councillors with a detailed report which recommended that planning permission be refused for the building.  The meeting was also told that  letters of objection had been sent by local residents. Among their concerns werethe destructionof ancient woodland and mature trees and the suggestion that the buildingis out of character and proportion with theexisting neighbouring properties. The report said thatthe building went ahead it would have adversely affected thecharacterandenvironmental quality of theof thesurrounding area through the loss of an important and well establishedurban woodland greenspace. Councillors agreed to defer the decision for a site visit, which took place on September  last year and which was attended by seven councillors. On September , the Planning Committee voted not toaccept the recommendation to refuse the planning application and agreed to reconsider itfurther information on the Tree Protection Order was provided. The council sent out additional notications to all neighbours, objectors and supporters ofthe scheme in January this year and  more letters were received, with six in objection to the application and  in support. The letters in support said the site was an eyesore and the owner of the proposed building would have a vested interest in maintaining it. On March  this year, the Planning Committee met again and was told council planners had not changed their position that planning permission should be refused. The Principal Planning Officer told elected members an Arboriculture Impact Assessment had been carried out which broadly agreed with the initial recommendation that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate the proposed scheme would not have a detrimental impact on the Tree Preservation Ordersite. DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock, who attended the site visit, told the meeting she did not believe the protected trees would be affected by the proposed building. She proposed to overturn the decision of the planning officer and for approval to be granted subject to conditions provided by planners. The proposal was seconded by SDLP councillor Angela Dobbins and was passed after seven votes for, three against and three abstentions. On Friday, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council confirmed that that an application for the Prehen building came before the Planning Committee in September  with a recommendation to refuse as it would result in the loss of a valuable urban woodland green space and the applicant had failed to demonstrate that this dwelling would not have an adverse impact on existing trees. The recommendation was not accepted by elected members and the application came back before the committee on March of this year as a reconsidered application, following a visit to the site by elected members and the submission of further information, said the spokesperson. Whilst the officers presented an unaltered opinion to refuse, elected members voted to approved the application.” The sale of The Qube, which was designed by architect Gerard McPeake, is being handled by McGuinness Fleck Estate Agents   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They have two beautul children, Conan and Carina.” The congregation heard how Ciaraacuten, a plumber by trade, lived for a Sunday, which he designated as a day to be spent with his young family. googletag.cmd.push “Another important thing for Ciaraacuten was a Sunday,” said Fr Kearney. “Sunday was his family day and he played with the children. They watched movies and had great fun together. He adored them and they adored him. “He had built his own house and was working to establish a good family home for his ‘wee unit’. He was a real family man and he is going to miss so many firsts. “One was coming up very soon, when Conan starts school just across the road in September. In his short le, Ciaraacuten McShane brought so much love, joy and goodness to people. “He most certainly will be rewarded for all of that.” Local Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Councillor, Sean Bateson, described Ciaraacuten as a ‘proper gentleman, one of the good guys in le’. Pearse’s GAC, Kilrea, where Ciaraacuten played football in his younger days, said they were ‘deeply saddened’ by his passing. “Ciaran played underage with the club and then came back to kit out for the reserves on many occasions. “One thing that everyone will tell you about Ciaran was that he always had a big smile on his face and his sense of humour was infectious.” Ciaraacuten will be sadly missed by his we Shauna, their children Conan and Carina, his parents Bertie and Patricia and siblings Siobhaacuten, Damian and Odraacuten and all his wider family and friends. Fr Kearney summed things up by telling mourners to look back on all Ciaraacuten achieved. “Sometimes bad things happen accidentally, and we know that’s part of le, but it’s devastating when it happens. “We should look back at his years among you and see what he achieved, and it was much.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Cha’s - victory over Manchester City on Thursday confirmed the Merseysiders could no longer be mathematically caught and sparked wild celebrations. For local fanatic Gerard Harraghy, the overwhelming emotion was relief, rather than ecstasy. “The main emotion is a little bit of relief that it’s finally confirmed, to be honest,” he told the County Derry Post. “We knew it was going to happen for a while, but there was that bit of doubt over the last three months that it might not actually get finished is now over. googletag.cmd.push “In a cup final, you have that one moment when you win it, but because it is the league, you don’t really get that. “While we may have clinched it last night, there were actually three or four moments throughout the season that were bigger in inidual terms.” Supporters Barry Craig, Kieran Patterson and David McLaughlin celebrate in a marquee off the new Dungiven bypass. The Magherafelt native, known affectionately to some of his old school friends as ‘Gerry Scouse’, admits the success was dampened a little with supporters not being able to witness it. “I definitely never envisaged being stuck over here and not being able to go to the match,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “A few friends did send me pictures and videos from last night in Liverpool and everyone seemed to be having a good time anyway. “I’ve been supporting Liverpool since I was about six or seven, I would say. I started going regularly before I started uni and for the past ten years it’s been pretty much every home game. “I’ve been on the waiting list for a season ticket for about  years, maybe more. I’m still only about ,th on the list!” While Liverpool’s stretch without a league title lasted three decades, they were not without success in the interim, winning the Champions’ League twice. The emotion of Istanbul in , when Liverpool came from three goals down at half-time to win the Champions’ League on penalties, will always be the pinnacle for Gerard. “I still don’t think anything will ever come close to Istanbul, for me,” he recalled. “It was right in the middle of my A-Levels and I had an exam the next morning, but I did not care one bit! “I would say the league is probably bigger than last year’s Champions’ League, just because it’s the first time we’ve done it in my memory.” As well as ending a -year drought, Liverpool’s th title brings them within one of fierce rivals Manchester United after the latter surged ahead with a period of dominance in the s and s. Gerard watched the game that clinched the  title at home with a few friends. One of them was a Manchester United fan, and the Magherafelt man took great pleasure in his discomfort. “A couple of mates came round and we watched it in the house,” he said. “One of them was actually a Man United fan. He tried to sneak out with about five minutes to go, but we had to lock him in! “I’m pretty sure I’m going to have him deleting his Facebook account by the end of the week with the amount of stuff I’ll be posting. It’s nice to get a bit of revenge after all these years.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In an anonymous poll conducted by the County Derry Post, with  responses,  of John McEvoys squad indicated they would play for Team Ulster, yet only eight of the squad would see it as a benefit to hurling in the county. As part of the survey comments were sought. One said it was a good idea but it wouldnt be easily organised. All the rest spoke out against it, citing a range of reasons. googletag.cmd.push The combined Ulster team wouldnt compete with Top  teams for the McCarthy Cup, hence it would be a waste of time and resources should be used to get the Ulster championship resurrected. Another respondent pointed to Derrys ability to compete in the Joe McDonagh Cupall the best players in Derry were playing. With more publicity, the current tiered structure was the better solution. Team Ulster would paper over the cracks was another comment, with the already considerable training load also offered as a reason to oppose the concept. On the topic of bringing back the Ulster senior hurling championship,  players indicated it should be ed after its three-year absence. googletag.cmd.push One respondent, who commented at , felt Team Ulster was nice to chat about but would only serve players who felt they needed to be playing in the Liam McCarthy Cup. Full commitment to the Derry jersey, from all the best players, full backing from the county board and supporters, was the way forward, something he felt was happening. Of the squad,  felt it should be played after the league and before the tiered hurling championships, such as the Christy Ring and Joe McDonagh Cups. The remainder opted for a window in pre-season, before the leagues. One respondent felt that Antrim would be so far away from the rest of the pack, but a combined rest of Ulster team playing the Saffrons would diminish the competition.

In an anonymous poll conducted by the County Derry Post, with  responses,  of John McEvoys squad indicated they would play for Team Ulster, yet only eight of the squad would see it as a benefit to hurling in the county. As part of the survey comments were sought. One said it was a good idea but it wouldnt be easily organised. All the rest spoke out against it, citing a range of reasons. googletag.cmd.push The combined Ulster team wouldnt compete with Top  teams for the McCarthy Cup, hence it would be a waste of time and resources should be used to get the Ulster championship resurrected. Another respondent pointed to Derrys ability to compete in the Joe McDonagh Cupall the best players in Derry were playing. With more publicity, the current tiered structure was the better solution. Team Ulster would paper over the cracks was another comment, with the already considerable training load also offered as a reason to oppose the concept. On the topic of bringing back the Ulster senior hurling championship,  players indicated it should be ed after its three-year absence. googletag.cmd.push One respondent, who commented at , felt Team Ulster was nice to chat about but would only serve players who felt they needed to be playing in the Liam McCarthy Cup. Full commitment to the Derry jersey, from all the best players, full backing from the county board and supporters, was the way forward, something he felt was happening. Of the squad,  felt it should be played after the league and before the tiered hurling championships, such as the Christy Ring and Joe McDonagh Cups. The remainder opted for a window in pre-season, before the leagues. One respondent felt that Antrim would be so far away from the rest of the pack, but a combined rest of Ulster team playing the Saffrons would diminish the competition.

Those behind the ambitious project are confident that the ious stories will appeal to both locals and visitors alike.Other interpretative  will tell of the emigration of families from Saintfield to the United States over the last  years, using the example of the three Maffett brothers who left Leggygowan for America, the first in , followed by a further two brothers in .It is one of their descendants, David Moffett, who has made this precious community asset possible.Saintfield Development Association officials, who played a lead role in securing the new community centre, approached the owners of the Windmill Road field and began protracted negotiations to secure the site, with the all-important funding to acquire the land obtained through Mr Moffettrsquos generous donation.A successful business executive with a well-known company in America, his family had links with the area dating back to the early th century, with Mr Moffettrsquos ancestral, family including James and Isabella Maffett and their children, buried in the graveyard at Saintfield Parish Church.Explaining the background to the heritage park proposal, a spokesman for the Development Association explained that a successful funding bid was submitted to the Heritage Lottery Fund for money to carry out necessary feasibility studies on the field.ldquoThese studies have since been completed to the satisfaction of the funder and have shown that there are no impediments for the field to be developed as a community heritage park, he explained.ldquoThese studies will also provide evidence for the necessary planning application for the change of use of the field from agricultural to community use.The spokesman also confirmed that consultants who carried out the feasibility studies of the field also compiled a list of proposals for the development which include measures to obviate as much as possible any disruption or annoyance to neighbouring residents through noise or anti-social behaviour.Public consultation on the proposals will be undertaken once the current pandemic restrictions are sufficiently eased and, following this process, the Development Association intends to raise the funds needed to implement the agreed proposals by applying for suitable grants.There will also be community fundraising.In addition, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has been asked to approve a new link being created between the community centre and proposed heritage park. The issue was under discussion prior to the coronavirus pandemic.Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess has praised all those involved in the project and hopes that the remaining pieces in the development jigsaw fall into place.ldquoThis is a terric development that not only local people can enjoy, but one which visitors to the town can also enjoy and learn so much about Saintfield and its people, he said.ldquoWe are fortunate to have the new community centre up and running and developing a new heritage park would represent further success for the town. Great credit must go Saintfield Heritage Society and townrsquos hardworking Development Association.Cllr Burgess added Saintfield was ldquovery fortunate to have extremely committed community iniduals who have the town and its people very much at heart.Full details of the proposes heritage park proposal are available at discoversaintfield..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Butler look after royalty and presidents  ","story":"FRANCIS McBriar has been a butler to four generations of the Royal Family, served US and Irish presidents and Northern Ireland Secretaries of State.However, he has only one mantra in his mind every time he dons his smart unorm mdash and that is he treats everyone the same.The farmerrsquos son who lives just outside Saintfield with his we Heather has butlered for  years. For those in the know, hersquos the man to reach out foryou have a special occasion or dinner event coming up.Regularly employed by the Earl of Erne at his Fermanagh residence, Crom Castle, Francis was recently featured doing what he does best in the RTE food series, Lords and Ladles.The  year-old was introduced to Hillsborough Castle, the Royal Familyrsquos official residence when they are in Northern Ireland, by the castlersquos late and highly regarded former house manager, David Anderson.ldquoI wouldnrsquot be where I am today without David Anderson, itrsquos as simple as that, said Francis.ldquoWe met through First Saintfield Church which David joined when he moved into the area. We were part of a group looking after senior people of the congregation and we would have worked together hosting dinners and bus outings and so on.ldquoOne day David turned to me and said, lsquoFrancis you are a very adaptable person, you could be a great help to meyou would like to bersquo.ldquoI was invited up to Hillsborough Castle to work with him and things just took off from there. I enjoy working with people and always went out with the intention of helping others and to make sure that they enjoyed their day, or their dinner. I also always found it easy to chat away to people.At that time, Francis was working as a distribution manager for a group of fashion shops and was the father of three young children with no thoughts of a future career in butlering.Today, he works mostly at Crom Castle and, closer to home, at Montalto House in Ballynahinch, but also looks after an American family when they travel to the British Isles.They take Francis wherever they go, sometimes to the Scottish Highlands and hopefully inSeptember to their Dorset property.ldquoIrsquom hoping that it still happens, admits Francis, whose work, like many others, has been affected by the Covid- pandemic.ldquoI really enjoy it and I love to travel. It doesnrsquot bother me being away from home for maybe several weeks at a time. My family are grown up with families of their own and I think my we is quite content to see me going out and about as she gets her head showered.He and Heather have three children, Robert, Anita and James, and a grandchild, George, who will be one year old soon. A second grandchild is due any day now.Having, in his words, ldquolooked after the late Queen Mother, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, their children and Prince Charlesrsquo children, the likes of President Bush, Irish presidents Mary McAleese and Michael D Higgins, Francis admits his disappointment at missing out on meeting Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge.He said: ldquoItrsquos been lovely to look after the Royal Family and a few years ago I was invited up to look after Prince William. I was so looking forward to looking after the couple but unfortunately that was the day the Duchess announced she was pregnant with Prince Louis and couldnrsquot fly over. So I missed that opportunity and would have loved to have met Kate.He believes that having served royalty, he can serve anyone and his nerve has never let him down so far.ldquoI think perhaps once you have attended to the people at Hillsborough Castle, it takes any nerves away, said Francis. ldquoYou think wellI can serve the Queen, then I can serve anyone. No-one is better than anyone  in my eyes. I just go in and do my best for whoever Irsquom looking after.For most people, the role of butler is quite rare today but in the days of stately and larger homes a bulter was the head male servant in a large household and his job was to manage the work of all the other servants.Francis agrees that his role is similar to that of the most famous butler in recent times, Carson, from the hit TV series and movie, Downton Abbey.ldquoThe whole point of being a butler is be unobtrusive but close at hand in the backgroundyou are needed. You need to judge when not to overstay your welcome when you are at the table.ldquoWhat happens there, stays there. I suppose I have developed a reputation for being discreet and I try to be. I would never tell others the conversations I hear around the table. As far as Irsquom concerned, everything is private.ldquoI treat everyone the same, no matter what their position in le, These people are paying my wages. I believe that nobody is better than anyone . If they are there at the table, then Irsquom there to look after them.Unlike Carson, who had to extract Lady Mary out of a number of compromising situations, Francis has never come across anyone who was the worst for wear for drink or found in an embarrassing situation.ldquoI must admit that in the circles I would be in, Irsquove never come across anyone over-indulging. My job is really to be able to turn my hand to anything and to look after people. The butler is really in charge of the household. When I go to work at Crom Castle, the Earl tells me lsquoFrancis, yoursquore in charge, itrsquos over to yoursquo.Working with some of the best chefs around, Francis admits that hersquos been treated to some delicious dining experiences through his work.ldquoI honestly donrsquot see what I do as work. Itrsquos not workyou love what you do, he said..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Developers asked to show interest in Irish Street site  ","story":"DEVELOPERS will shortly be asked to submit expressions of interest in transforming a major site in the heart of Downpatrick to help bolster the townrsquos economic recovery.The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are driving ambitious plans to redevelop a near two acre site encompassing the former Irish Street police station, a number of adjacent empty buildings and the local authority-owned car park.While it was feared that the coronavirus pandemic could delay plans to redevelop of the huge site, work has continued on the project with a new brochure produced to provide would-be developers and other interested parties with an overview of the sitersquos potential and secure expressions of interest.The development site stretches as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue and is also adjacent to the Irish Street car park, with council officials looking to make the brochure available to the public virtually.Described as a ldquostrategic and prominent location in the heart of Downpatrick, senior council officials, politicians and members of the business community are excited at the Irish Street sitersquos development potential and are working towards drawing up a development brief.While the former police base enjoys protected status, it is hoped that potential developers will be able to come up with an imaginative plan for the historic building and that a preferred bidder will be appointed as early as October and as late as the end of the year.The council and the Department for Communities are keen to revitalise Irish Street and hope its redevelopment will act as a catalyst for the wider economic and social regeneration of the town.Council officials say that the Irish Street project is vital to the recovery of the local economy, improving the wellbeing of the community and a welcome confidence boost for the construction sector.In addition, they insist that theyrsquore committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the site and want to hear their feedback on the way forward.The steering group set up to oversee the Downpatrick scheme held a recent progress meeting and council chairwoman Laura Devlin said she was delighted with the projectrsquos momentum.She confirmed that councillors and local authority officials have been working with the Department for Communities and local stakeholders to develop an lsquoonline engagement processrsquo.She explained this is designed to inform the preferred end uses for the Irish Street site and allow key stakeholders to have input into the development brief which is critical to the success of the project.ldquoWhile the Downpatrick regeneration scheme is in the early developmental stages, it will also stimulate signicant investment for the local economy, she added.John Armstrong, from the Construction Employers Federation, said the scheme and a number of others the council is planning for the Newry area, will provide a boost for the local construction sector.South Down MP Chris Hazzard and Downpatrick councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the progress being made on redeveloping he site.Mr Hazzard described the regeneration project as a ldquounique and exciting opportunity, one which has the potential to unlock much-needed economic and social opportunity for the town centre and wider community.ldquoThis regeneration project must act as a catalyst for the long overdue expansion of the townrsquos evening and weekend economy its new heartbeat in some respects, he continued.ldquoGiven the sitersquos close proximity to nearby homes, the project must also be viewed as more than a commercial development. It must seek to bind together the town centre with the outlying housing developments and consequently look to improve the economic and social wellbeing of the local community.Cllr Curran agreed that the Irish Street site offered a ldquounique opportunity for the development of business, employment and tourism.He thanked council committees and Department for Infrastructure for supporting the project.He said: ldquoThe Irish Street project represents the single biggest change to the town centre in a generation. It has the potential to transform Downpatrick and itrsquos vital everyone works together to make the regeneration proposal a major success.ldquoThe planned redevelopment is one of the most important projects ever proposed for Downpatrick and it is vital to make the most of the opportunities it presents. The proposal has the potential to add a new vibrancy with local people helping shape how this key site will be transformed.Cllr Hanlon said she was pleased that the next stage of the sitersquos redevelopment is ready for launch, allowing potential developers and interested parties an opportunity to view the site online, with feedback from the local community welcomed.ldquoPeople will be able to give their views on the potential for the site and the likely constraints within any proposed project, she explained. ldquoAny feedback would be used to assist both the council and Department for Communities to prepare a development brief for the site.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoThe project to redevelop the former police base and surrounding area provides an opportunity to reinvigorate the Downpatrick town centre.

However,we use DNA technology to catch dog owners who allow their pets to foul public areas, their identity will be made publicthey end up in court, he continued.ldquoDog fouling problem is a highly contentious issue and, without doubt, one of the single most complained about problems across our district. It is something that we have not yet to got to grips with, but perhaps the new initiative under consideration will change that.Cllr Walker said it was important to remember that the overwhelming majority of dog owners across the district cleaned up after their pets, but there was a hardcore who did not.He added: ldquoWe have talked about this issue for years and the problem has not diminished in any way. People are looking to politicians and the council for leadership and it is vital that we do everything we can to address this problem.Another Rowallane councillor, Kathryn Owen, has welcomed agreement to pursue the DNA issue, explaining that while this particular suggestion had been been brought to the council many times in the past, it was always rejected.She said that going down the route of DNA testing would remove the need for CCTV cameras to be erected to capture video evidence or the need for witness statements to nab offenders.Cllr Owen said that despite the refusal to examine DNA testing in the past, there is now a ldquochange in tone and acceptance to explore this particular option.She added: ldquoI was delighted to support this course of action proposed by Cllr Patrick Brown as something drastic needs to be done.ldquoIt is a terrible shame that it has come to this. Council officers are now going to compile a report for the Neighbourhood Services Committee to decide on the viability of using DNA technology to catch offenders..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Education Minister visits Saintfield school presentation  ","story":"EDUCATION Minister Peter Weir made a special visit to St Maryrsquos Primary School in Saintfield on Monday morning.Mr Weir was the guest of honour at the annual P awards presentation which was held with social distancing and health and safety measures in place to protect the children and their parents.Mr Weir presented some of the awards and was also on the receiving end of a gt when Ryan Walsh Williams presented him with a rainbow chameleon which he has specially painted for the occasion.The children were delighted to receive the awards as an acknowledgement of their success during seven years at St Maryrsquos.The Very Rev Father Anthony McHugh gave the children and parents a blessing for their future.The school has remained open throughout the Covid- pandemic and plans to re-open for all children as soon as the Department of Education gives its permission.A spokesperson for the school said: ldquoSt Maryrsquos is delighted to announce that it will be able to re-open with social distancing measures in place for all children as soon as a restart date is approved in mid to late August.ldquoClassrooms have already set out the two-metre social distancing rule and all staff are keen to welcome all children back in a safe and effective manner.ldquoTeachers are aware of the need to promote the health and well-being and of pupils and the school has a new nurture room, ready and waiting for use.ldquoTeachers said their first aim is to address the wellbeing of our children using a nurturing approach.ldquoWe believe that the best place to do that is in our school environment.

We’ll not be doing congregational singing or communion as we had done previously. “We need to communicate to our flock exactly what they’ll be coming to, so that we can manage expectations. We are trying to provide something to feed the soul and not entirely alienate a church-going population who are used to their own way of doing things. “We will rely on people’s goodwill a lot. People are hungry to go back to church. They realise that it can’t be the same, just as they realise that going to Sainsbury’s isn’t the same as it used to be.”He added: “Churches would have a fair number of older, faithful congregational members. We know that they will come as soon as the doors are opened. Whether they should is an entirely dferent question. So we need to make sure we are doing things as safely as we can for the folks that are going to come.”During lockdown the church harnessed modern technologies to hold Bible study groups, prayer meetings and record an online Sunday service.Rev McConnell said: “I would say a fair percentage of those things will continue even after lockdown really eases. We’ve found it has opened up new channels of communications for us, people have tuned in who haven’t been to church for years.”Presbyterian churches are also putting safety first with the majority targeting a resumption of worship from mid-July to early August.Cregagh Presbyterian Church was among the first to announce it would be holding a service on Sunday, July .Rev Trevor Gribben, general secretary of the PCI said: “We look forward to being able to meet again, with our brothers and sisters in Christ, while ensuring that the required health and safety principles are met.” He said any decision when to resume services would be a local decision taken by the minister and elders together.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females. Signicant dferences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityFrontline workers have been seen as coronavirus superheroes by members of the general public and were applauded for their efforts by the nation every Thursday at pm for the first  weeks of the crisis.While the nation has faced restrictions on their movement and social lives, here four doctors from the British Medical Associationdescribe their experiences during the last  days for the PA news agency.ndash Stephanie Rees, a junior doctor at Glan Clwyd Hospital in north Wales, said seeing a patient die without their loved ones at their bedside was a ldquohard moment vw,vw,px, px\"Dr Stephanie Rees said PPE has changed the way she communicates with patients ldquoIrsquom what you would call a lsquohuggerrsquo. Passed an exam  Hug for you. Successfully placed a cannula  Hug for you, said the BMA Wales junior doctor committee member.ldquoEarly on, when social distancing was just being introduced, a friend of mine passed their degree and officially became a registered nurse, so what was my first reaction  A faux pas ndash I hugged her, and she recoiled away from me ndash clearly not the reaction I was going for.ldquoMasks and PPE isolate us from not only our patients, but also our colleagues.On families being able to visit patients, she added: ldquoA quick video call is no replacement for holding their hand.ldquoI canrsquot imagine what it would be like to have a loved one in intensive care, not be able to visit, and only get one or two phone calls a day updating me, she said.ldquoThe hardest part is when these conversations are not good news. When we think a patient has deteriorated to the point where there is nothing more we can do, we invite one to two family members into the unit to visit them and say goodbye, but what do we dotheir relative is shielding or vulnerable  We canrsquot in good conscience recommend coming into the Covid section of intensive care, no matter the amount of PPE we provide them.Dr Rees added: ldquoOne of my hardest moments was when a patient passed away without their family with them. The last time they saw them was when they were admitted to hospital. Two nurses sat with the patient the whole time, holding their hand and playing the music they enjoyed.ldquoThis time has brought with it some of my hardest moments as a doctor, but it has also brought some of the most heartwarming.ldquoWhen one of our patients had their birthday, and we managed to get their close family and friends together to do a video chat of them opening their cards that had been delivered to their unit. It was such a small thing for us to do, but it meant so much to the patient and their family.ndash Dr David Wrigley, Lancashire GP and deputy chairman of the BMA Council said he hopes a silver lining of the crisis will be a reduction in red tape for doctors. vw,vw,px, px\"Dr Wrigely said he hopes the pandemic will lead to less bureaucracy and paperwork for doctors so they can spend more time with patients ldquoThe way I deliver care has shted drastically over the past three months from the usual face to face surgeries, to telephone and video consultations in order to make care safer for NHS staff and patients, he said.ldquoOne small silver lining of these past  days has been the reduction in box ticking, which has allowed us to focus more of our time on patient care.ldquoI hope that, in the future, the NHS will thoroughly investigate how processes can be simplied, so that doctors can spend more time with patients, as opposed to this bureaucracy and paperwork.ldquoWorking closer with colleagues has fostered a greater sense of camaraderie as wersquove had to deal with ious issues such as PPEshortages and handling a very serious pandemic right on our doorstep.ldquoFor many, this has also been a challenge as a large number of doctors have not yet had any time off and their mental health has therefore suffered as a result.ndash Dr Rebecca Acres, chairwoman of the BMA East Midlands regional council, said that seeing patients leave intensive care in full health ldquomakes all the hardship worthwhile. vw, px\"Dr Rebecca Acres described seeing  patients leave intensive care over the last  days ldquoThe past  days have been a steep learning curve for me as I was redeployed at the very beginning from theatre anaesthetics to intensive care.ldquoWhile wersquove probably seen fewer patients over this period, they have been much more unwell than in pre-Covid times. The mortality rate has been four times as high, while patients who are critically unwell remain so for a much longer time ndash in some cases six weeks or more before recovering fully.ldquoItrsquos been a trying period for staff as well as patients. We have had to spend all of our working time in full protective equipment, meaning that communication amongst teams becomes very dficult and comforting colleagues after a hard day is also a challenge.ldquoOver the past  days, wersquove seen just over  patients leave intensive care having made a full recovery. Watching them come back to full health and leave makes all of the hardship worthwhile.ldquoWe keep referring to lsquoafterrsquo in my unit. That time when we can hug our families, go on holiday, hang around in houses with friends, touch patients without full protective gear, talk to relatives without masks on and so on. It seems a while away yet, but Irsquom so looking forward to it.ndash Dr George Gardiner, a member of the BMA Northern Ireland consultants committee and clinical director for the intensive care unit in Belfastrsquos City and Mater Hospitals, who also became clinical director of the Nightingale hospital in Belfast, said: ldquoAs it turned out, the outcomes were much better than we had feared. vw,vw,px, px\"Watching patients leave intensive care after prolonged stays was a lsquohigh pointrsquo for Dr George Gardiner On his experience in Nightingale he said: ldquoWe expected and planned for many more patients than we received, though briefly the admission rate seemed to be rising faster than we could mobilise staff and open beds.ldquoMy colleagues succeeded in preparing clinical areas for use as intensive care and preparing staff from other areas to work within it.ldquoTheir efforts in the few weeks before the patients started to arrive were truly remarkable ndash approximately , staff from all disciplines had an induction to critical care in some form, and  beds were ready to take patients with more in reserve.ldquoI think we all expected the mortality to be high and the work to be exhausting. As it turned out, the outcomes were much better than we had feared but the levels of delirium and burden of multiple organ failure was much higher.ldquoThe high points have got to be watching patients finally leave ICU after prolonged stays, working with colleagues who were entirely out of their comfort zone yet enthusiastic and focused, and finally getting out of PPE..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Four doctors reflect on th day of lockdown article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

in the borough.By The NewsroomFriday, th June , : pm\"\"Photo by Aaron McCracken HarrisonsThe matter was raised at a Council’s monthly meeting by UUP Alderman Jim Speers who asked when caravan sites across the borough would be reopening.“Gosford generates businesses for Markethill and we want to see that opening up as well as a site in Clare Glen,” said the Alderman.“A lot of people will want to be out and about andit can be done safely at these sites, it should be.”In response to these comments, Council’s strategic director,Mark Parkinson, confirmed caravan sites at both Gosford Forest Park and Clare Glen would open from Friday, June .“Gosford will open on June  and so will Clare Glen,” said Mr Parkinson.“The site at Kinnego will reopen on Friday, July , and at all these sites the caravan, camping, toilet and shower facilities will be available.”SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon askedthose who had made bookings before the outbreak of the COVID- pandemic and subsequently had their bookings cancelled, were being contacted to ensure they could still avail of the service.“Some people had booked their slots at these sites early in January and paid for them,” said Cllr O’Hanlon. “They were quickly refunded during the outbreak and that was good and the right thing to do but have we made contact with those people now “They had been on the ball and made their bookings early, it wouldbe a shamethey were now to miss out, when the sites have reopened, through no real fault of their own.”His question went unanswered on the night and when the Local Democracy Reporting Service asked Council for an answer, a spokesperson said it is working to accommodateall bookings.“As Council begins to reopen its caravanning and camping facilities at Clare Glen, Gosford Forest Park and Kinnego Marina, we are working with the public to accommodateall bookings where possible based on reduced capacity and in compliance with social distancing and PHA guidance,” said a Council spokesperson.“We will continue to keep this under review.”\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\"
