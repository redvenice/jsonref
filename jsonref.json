Prices are expected to grow at a broadly similar pace next month, the CBI adds. Its monthly retail sales balance - which shows whether annual sales growth is rising or falling - rose to a three-month high of +39 in November from +30 in October. And a measures of sales for the time of year leapt to +35 from -1, its highest since September 2015. Ben Jones, CBI lead economist, says fears of shortages encouraged people to start their festive shopping earlier: The survey also found that internet sales were lower than a year ago, the first time in the survey’s 20-year higher history. That may be because England entered its second lockdown in November 2020, forcing non-essential shops to close. Web sales are expected to rise in December, as people get their Christmas shopping orders in. The Riksbank left policy unchanged this morning, arguing that currently above-target inflation would ease back next year, saying: It also stuck to its plans to maintain its balance sheet through next year before allowing the portfolio to decrease gradually. David Oxley, Senior European Economist at Capital Economics, told clients that the Riksbank had injected a ‘dash of hawkishness’: The pub and restaurant group Mitchells \u0026amp Butlers has warned that problems caused by Brexit and rising costs will hurt the hospitality sector, just as businesses return to profit after pandemic restrictions eased. The company, which owns pub chains including O’Neill’s and restaurant brands such as Harvester, said Brexit was still “an important event for the market” and had created risks for the sector, most notably around the supply and cost of products and workforce shortages. It said higher energy bills and increased staff wages were also weighing on the sector. Mitchells \u0026amp Butlers – which also runs All Bar One, Toby Carvery and Miller \u0026amp Carter – said customers began to return to its 1,600 UK venues when lockdown restrictions were relaxed in the spring. Its sales bounced back in August and September and it is now receiving bookings for Christmas parties. Announcing its annual results, the group said its suburban locations were trading better than those in city centres, as continued home working meant people visited their local rather than a branch near their workplace. Footfall in major cities has been slowly increasing in recent months, a trend the company expects to continue.... The Office for National Statistics’ weekly indicators also show that almost four in 10 hospitality firms said they were short of workers last week. The number of flights into and out of the UK hit its highest since the first lockdowns in March 2020 - following the reopening of travel to the US earlier this month. Crisps supplies have been disrupted by an IT computer upgrade at the world’s biggest crisp factory.  Leicester-based Walkers said last month that the glitch forced it to slow production, forcing the company to prioritise its most popular varieties – including cheese and onion, ready salted and salt and vinegar, as well as Quavers and Wotsits. Kantar Public’s survey of 275 stores also found that paracetamol and ibuprofen were also in relatively short supply. However, a group of 48 wine and spirits companies yesterday warned that Britain is facing a Christmas alcohol shortage unless the government does more to address the lack of HGV drivers. This is due to “excellent momentum” in China and the United States as well as a strong recovery in Europe, the firm says. Remy Cointreau now expects “very strong” growth in organic operating profits this year, and strong sales too. Chief executive officer Eric Vallat said in a statement. Here’s the full story: And here’s reaction from ITV’s Joel Hills: European equities hit a three-week low earlier this week, as fears of fresh lockdowns rippled through markets. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets thinks it could be a subdued day: However company investment and government spending both declined, while imports and exports both fell quarter-on-quarter, and net trade weighed on growth. GFK’s survey found that people’s propensity to buy has fallen to a nine-month low, with the indicator halving to 9.7 points. This weakness is likely to weigh on Germany’s economy this quarter, especially as yesterday’s IFO survey showed a drop in business confidence. Consumer confidence in Germany has been hit by the surge in coronavirus infections, and the jump in inflation hitting households this winter. The GfK institute’s consumer sentiment index, based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, fell to -1.6 points heading into December, down sharply from 1.0 points a month earlier. That’s the lowest reading since June, and below expectations. GfK economist Rolf Buerkl said the fourth wave in the COVID-19 pandemic, with skyrocketing infection rates and hospitals reaching capacity limits, was causing concerns that more restrictions for shops and restaurants were on the cards. This slide in consumer morale in Europe’s largest economy will dampen business prospects for the upcoming Christmas shopping season, Buerkl adds: Some German states have already cancelled this year’s Christmas markets, due to concerns about the surge in Covid-19 cases, but others are going ahead. America’s central bank could wrap up its stimulus programme and raise interest rates earlier than expected, with inflation at a 30-year high and the jobs market improving. The Fed started tapering its $120bnmonth asset purchase scheme at this month’s meeting, cutting it by $15bn per month -- at which rate it would end by next June. But the minutes drop a clear hint that tapering could be speeded up: Some more dovish Fed members stressed they should take a “patient attitude” toward incoming data given supply chain problems and the pandemic. The prospect of the Fed tightening policy faster than expected has weighed on the pound and the euro in recent weeks. Last night, sterling touched its lowest level of 2021, trading at just $1.3325 to the US dollar. The euro is even weaker - at its lowest against the US dollar since July 2020, and near a 21-month low against the pound. The FOMC Minutes suggested the doves on the committee are “in retreat”, says Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA: The news yesterday that US jobless claims have plunged to the lowest level since 1969 could also encourage the Fed to tighten policy faster. Deutsche Bank expect the Fed to press down on the taper accelerator in December, by doubling the cuts to its purchases of US government debt (Treasuries) and mortgage-backed securities. That would wrap the scheme up three months sooner than planned, as DB strategist Jim Reid explains: Something for investors to ponder. Although...Wall Street is closed for Thanksgiving, while European stocks are expected to open higher despite concerns about the fourth wave of Covid-19.

File photograph: GettyPrimary school-aged children now have the highest Covid-19 incidence of any age group, new figures show.Among children aged 5-12 years there were 5,374 coronavirus infections detected last week or 979 cases per 100,000.This is up from 4,211 the previous week or 767 per 100,000.Based on this data – which shows 10,000 positive cases in a fortnight – education sources estimate the number of children isolating from primary school for reasons linked to the virus is likely to be well in excess of 15,000 when siblings are factored in.This does not include symptomatic children who are isolating at home and waiting for PCR tests.These outbreaks ranged from two cases in a school to 16.“The risk of onward transmission from undetected asymptomatic cases within the school setting remains low,” it states.The report also notes that the infection rate for primary school-aged children has been rising since mid-October.It says the proportion of cases among five- to 12-year-olds as share of the overall population has continued to remain “relatively stable”, despite increase in incidence rates.It adds that increases in the disease incidence among school-aged children, or the detection of an outbreak in a school, does not of itself indicate that transmission occurred within the school. “Clusters of cases may be detected within a particular setting despite exposure and transmission having occurred elsewhere,” it states.Meanwhile, Minister for Education Norma Foley has confirmed that antigen test guidance will be made available for primary schools and parents this week ahead of their introduction from Monday next.The Health Service Executive will post antigen tests to children in cases where another child in their pod tests positive or where there are two or more cases in a class within a week.Staffing crisisShe also confirmed that urgent measures aimed at tackling a staffing crisis facing schools, which include an extra 200 substitutes and moves to boost the supply of students and retired teachers.The Irish National Teachers’ Organisation welcomed the move, but called for a return to contact tracing in schools to ensure they are safe settings.The unions’s general secretary, John Boyle, said while the Department of Education was “playing their part”, it was now up to the Department of Health to organise public health measures such as a return to contact tracing.Ronan Glynn – the State’s deputy chief medical officer – has said that schools are not as safe now as they were several months ago due to a surge in cases.“What I would fully accept is that schools are not as safe now as they were, when incidence was lower a number of months ago,” Dr Glynn told the Pat Kenny Show on Newstalk.“No environment is as safe now as it was then. And we’ve said all along that when incidence is really high in the community, as it is at the moment, then schools are not as safe as they would otherwise be. We’ve never said that schools are a safe environment, we’ve said they’re a lower-risk environment.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"government should remove ban on commercial peat harvesting report","story":"Commercial peat harvesting was effectively banned by the High Court in 2019, which found large-scale harvesting required planning permission as well as a licence from the EPA, and detailed environmental impact assessments. Photograph: Pat SammonThe Government has been advised in a new report that it should legislate to remove a ban on commercial peat harvesting, potentially for the next 14 years.The final report of the Working Group to review the use of peat moss in horticulture, commissioned by Minister for Heritage Malcolm Noonan, makes a number of recommendations aimed at supporting jobs in the industry, which is worth €477 million a year.The working group was chaired by consultant Munoo Prasad, who is a former chief scientist at Bord Na Móna. The report was delivered to Mr Noonan in October but has yet to be published.Commercial peat harvesting was effectively banned by the High Court in 2019, which found large-scale harvesting required planning permission as well as a licence from the EPA, and detailed environmental impact assessments, required under EU law.The group said it was concerned at risks to jobs in a transition period while alternatives to peat were sourced – particularly for the mushroom industry which has warned it is dependent on supplies.The report recommends that “the use of peat in horticulture should be phased out by 2030 or by the very latest by 2035, providing alternative materials were available”.It also recommends peat should be available over the short term in sufficient quantities “from existing ecologically destroyed bogs that were prepared for harvesting for the last few years and are lying fallow”. It called for amendments to the current legislative provisions for large scale peat extraction.“ For the professional horticulture sector, this is absolutely critical for the 2022 season” it said.In a statement Mr Noonan said the “ potential of alternatives to the use of peat moss in the horticultural industry was examined extensively by the group”. He said the report is “being considered and will be brought to Cabinet in due course.”The Minister is known to be opposed to large scale harvesting and has previously said reopening harvesting was not on the Green Agenda or Government policy.Last weeked, he told RTÉ there needs to be an alternative product to peat, but the State should phase out commercial harvesting “completely”On Tuesday Fine Gael Senator Regina Doherty introduced a Bill in the Seanad to “end Irish horticultural growers’ reliance on expensive imported peat as a growing medium for their produce by allowing them to extract Irish peat as part of a just transition”.She said her Horticultural Peat (Temporary Measures) Bill 2021, was necessary as producers have no option but to import peat from places such as Latvia. “We have acres of peatland right here, with only 0.12 per cent of total Irish peatland required for the purposes of horticulture.”But Friends of the Irish Environment, which has taken a number of cases to the courts against harvesting, said that figures released by the Central Statistics Office show that exports of peat for 2021 are now at more than 500,000 tons. with 70,725 tons added in August and September.“The industry’s claim that exports are a matter of the past is not born out by the newly released figures,” spokesman Tony Lowes said."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Scientists fear key attitudes may change if climate change worsensStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"pfizer vaccine immunity starts to wane 90 days after second dose study","story":"Over five million doses of the Pfizer vaccine have been administered in IrelandExperts who have been tracking the effectiveness of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine have found that the risk of Covid infection begins to increase 90 days after people had a second dose.The study backs up the need for booster doses to prevent people suffering breakthrough infections as immunity wanes, according to the team, who published their findings in the British Medical Journal (BMJ).Over five million doses of the Pfizer vaccine have been administered in Ireland, making it the main vaccine used here. However, booster doses are only given here five months after the second dose.Experts from the Research Institute of Leumit Health Services in Israel found a gradual increase in the risk of Covid-19 infection from 90 days after people received a second dose of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine.Israel was one of the first countries to roll out a large scale Covid-19 vaccination campaign in December 2020, but has been battling a resurgence in infections and has been looking closely at waning immunity.The experts examined electronic health records for 80,057 adults (with an average age of 44) who had a PCR test between mid-May and September at least three weeks after their second vaccine injection.None of the people in the sample had evidence of previous Covid-19 infection.Of the group of 80,057 people, 7,973 (9.6 per cent) had a positive test result.They were then matched to people of the same age and ethnic group who tested negative in the same week.The study found that the rate of positive results was found to rise in line with the time since people had had their second dose.Across all age groups, 1.3 per cent of people tested positive 21-89 days after a second dose, but this increased to 2.4 per cent after 90-119 days 4.6 per cent after 120-149 days 10.3 per cent after 150-179 days and 15.5 per cent after 180 days or more.Compared with the first 90 days after a second dose, the risk of infection across all age groups was 2.37-fold higher after 90-119 days 2.66-fold higher after 120-149 days 2.82-fold higher after 150-179 days and 2.82-fold higher after 180 days or more.While the study is observational in nature, the experts said it appears clear that immunity wanes after the first three months of being double-vaccinated.They said: “Large scale Covid-19 vaccination campaigns can achieve control over the spread of the virus, but even in countries with high vaccination rates, breakthrough infections can occur.“The risk of (Covid) infection in adults who received two vaccine injections increased with time elapsed since vaccination compared with the reference (iniduals vaccinated in the last 90 days).”AstraZeneca has said antibody protection from its vaccine also wanes, although its chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said on Tuesday that the jab is thought to offer long-term T-cell immunity for older people, which could be better than other vaccines. –PAStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"big gap remains between eu and uk over brexit deal for ni says coveney","story":" Minister for Foreign Affairs  Simon Coveney: said  there was a chance ‘to seize momentum’ toward finding a compromise in EU-UK negotiations. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireThere is still “quite a big gap” between the EU and the UK in the dispute over Northern Ireland’s post-Brexit trade rules, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said. The Minister told the Seanad Brexit committee that there was “a lot at stake over the next few weeks” given the potential “carryover” for the EU-UK trade deal to be affected if the London government decides to suspend parts of the Northern Ireland protocol over the row.The EU has warned that the protocol and trade agreement were “inextricably linked” and that it would respond “very robustly” to the suspension of parts of the protocol under Article 16.Brussels would regard this “as a fairly serious breach of good faith,” said Mr Coveney. “That is the last place any of us want to be, particularly in Ireland or in the UK,” he said.Mr Coveney said that there was a chance “to seize momentum” toward finding a compromise in EU-UK negotiations aimed at resolving the dispute over the protocol but that it required “a much more positive, much more stable, much more trusting EU-UK relationship.”“We have some way to go to get there,” he added.The EU and the UK are locked in negotiations in a bid to break the deadlock over the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol, which covers the special trading arrangements designed to prevent Brexit creating a hard border re-emerging on the island of Ireland. Unionists oppose the protocol, arguing that it creates a trade barrier between Britain and Northern Ireland. The UK government is seeking changes to the protocol and has threatened to trigger the Article 16 clause of the protocol to suspend parts of its operation if it is not changed. Under the protocol, Northern Ireland remains under EU trade rules for goods. Mr Coveney told Independent senator Michael McDowell that the UK government’s request for all goods coming from Britain sold in Northern Ireland to be exempt from all checks and customs declarations was “a very difficult thing for the EU to deliver.” The EU can “go a long way” to reduce those checks significantly, he said, referring to the EU’s proposals to reduce food checks by 80 per cent and customs checks by 50 per cent.Britain’s Brexit minister David Frost had “shown a lot of scepticism” on whether these proposals are possible but Mr Coveney said the EU’s Brexit negotiator Maros Sefcovic and his team were “very clear and strong” that they can deliver on those proposals. The UK “has got to give something here too”, said Mr Coveney.On the prospect of a compromise being reached, he said he was “more hopeful than I was a fortnight ago.”Mr Coveney described Lord Frost as a “good and tough negotiator” and that the British negotiating tactic has been “very successful in terms of delivering concessions and flexibility from the EU” but it has not been successful in terms of “reputation and relationships.” The Minister said the way the UK government had behaved over the last 10 months had “put a lot of strain” on relationships, between the EU and the UK, between the Ireland and the UK and, at times, between the UK and the US given the responses from the White House and Capitol Hill.However, he said he was very anxious to focus on “the limited but nevertheless limited progress of the last 10 days or so.”He said the Government wanted to maximise the opportunities in the post-Brexit trade deal agreed by the EU and UK and to develop the future relationship with the UK positively.“In order to achieve this, the parties must work together, in a spirit of partnership and trust. When trust is compromised, progress is threatened,” said Mr Coveney.“The recent UK approach to the protocol has unfortunately called that trust into question. I believe, however, that there is an opportunity before us now to seize momentum toward agreeing a constructive way forward.” How is Brexit affecting you?

The clinical trials were done in children. There are mild side effects as with all vaccines but none of them were very serious.”\u0026nbspOn balance, the risk of getting the vaccine is less than the risk of getting Covid, said Prof Mills. In most children, Covid-19 is very mild but for some it can persist for months, he said.Prof Mills said mask wearing among children would lower infection. However, he said getting young children to wear masks is “going to be challenging”.The requirement for children in primary school to wear masks is expected to be discussed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) when it meets on Thursday.Some members of the group believe such a move would help stem the rise in infections in younger children, though the Government does not intend to introduce any new restrictions this week.Nphet member and president of the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland Prof\u0026nbspMary Horgan on Thursday said it has been known for the past few months that the increase of infection in primary school children is higher than the rest of the population.“Probably for two reasons or many reasons. Firstly they are a group that haven’t been vaccinated,” she said, adding that the age group still does not use masks, while the rest of the population does.“Although it is difficult for younger children to wear masks we do need to follow the science,” she told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland programme.Prof Horgan also said it is likely the EMA will recommend vaccinations for the 5-11 age group, which will also reduce infections.Prof Horgan hopes Ireland can avoid a lockdown: “A lockdown is just a blunt instrument and it is really the last resort. We have developed loads of tools that we need to effectively use to avoid a lockdown. The current situation in hospitals is steady.”While Prof Mills said Ireland was not moving quickly enough with its booster vaccination campaign,\u0026nbspProf Horgan said the rollout of booster vaccines is “a big operation”.“I believe it is being done as quickly as possible,” said Prof Horgan. “There is a lot of logistics. Where it is done whether it is by the GP, the pharmacy, the vaccination centres. There is a lot of people involved in doing that.” She said the benefits of boosters were being seen already.Prof Horgan’s comments follow the publication of a study in the British Medical Journal that researchers say backs up the need for booster doses to prevent people suffering breakthrough as immunity wanes.Experts from the Research Institute of Leumit Health Services in Israel found a gradual increase in the risk of Covid-19 infection from 90 days after people received a second dose of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine.Researchers examined electronic health records for 80,057 adults (with a average age of 44) who had a PCR test between mid-May and September at least three weeks after their second vaccine injection.Compared with the first 90 days after a second dose, the risk of infection across all age groups was 2.37-fold higher after 90-119 days 2.66-fold higher after 120-149 days 2.82-fold higher after 150-179 days and 2.82-fold higher after 180 days or more.While the study is observational in nature, the researchers said it appears clear that immunity wanes after the first three months of being double-vaccinated.Meanwhile, the trade union Siptu has called on the Government to reduce capacity on public transport amid a surge in Covid-19 numbers.“That is for the protection of the staff and the passengers alike,” Siptu transport organiser John Murphy told Newstalk Breakfast.Mr Murphy said overcrowded public transport is a fertile breeding ground for infections.“We can’t have overcrowded buses and not expect to have overcrowded hospitals as well due to higher infection rates. We need to take a serious decision here for the winter,” he said.The trade union wrote to the Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan on Wednesday urging the Government to reduce passenger capacity from 100 per cent. The union represents 4,500 staff who work on all forms of public transport.The number of new cases of the virus reported in the State on Wednesday was 3,893.There were 611 Covid patients in hospital and 132 in ICU. The Department of Health said it has been notified of 43 deaths of people with Covid-19 in the past week. – Additional reporting: PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"five garth brooks concerts confirmed as ticket sale prompts huge online queues","story":"Garth Brooks superfans waited all day outside Croke Park to meet their hero.

Demand for the first two concerts on Friday, September 9th and Saturday September 10th outstripped supply very quickly and a third date on Monday September 11th was added. Shortly after 10am Brooks confirmed via social media that there would be also be concerts at the Dublin venue on September 16th and 17th. At 8.10am more than 280,000 people were waiting to buy tickets for the original gigs on Friday, September 9th and Saturday, September 10th. As of 10.10pm some 200,000 tickets had been sold and at 11am over 100,000 were still queuing online to buy. Each concert would accommodate some 80,000 people.Planning permission has been given for five in total but many local residents and their representative groups have opposed the the number of concerts. As the additional concerts were announced, though, and the tickets continued to sell in huge numbers the view seemed to be that that there was no legal route for them to prevent the events happening. The country singer’s previous five concerts at the venue in 2014 were cancelled because of objections from locals and a refusal by Dublin City Council to grant planning permission for the events.Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Brooks played down the possibility of being able to sell five concerts out this time around.Referring to the cancelled dates he said he hoped there would be a “blessing in that curse and now hopefully we have a chance to play Ireland”.When asked would he like to do five shows again, he responded: “I’d like to, but I’d also like to be six foot five and have abs.“You had 400,000 tickets in one city and one show. There’s no way we are going to do those numbers again. Would I like it? Yes. Is it going to happen? I think it would be impossible.”Promoter Peter Aiken said he was “relieved and delighted” by the response to the concerts going on sale.“He is bigger than he was the last time. There were 100,000 people logged on to Ticketmaster before the concerts went on sale.“That’s underheard of even in the United States. You would normally expect 30,000 to 40,000 people in the queue for a big outdoor show.” Ticketmaster is currently managing the system so it does not crash and is letting people in in tranches.Mr Aiken added that he should know by lunchtime what sales will be like for the five shows.

We have all the risk assessments done.”He said it was too early to say whether the situation can be brought under control within days. “It is at present unclear how long the the production stop will be due to the water. This is the first time with this amount of water.”Mr Nystrom added there was no environmental concerns but that it is something that they “are keeping track of”.In a statement, mine owner Boliden said the increased water flow “resulted from drilling of a pilot raisebore hole for a ventilation shaft”.Production has been stopped to “focus on protecting infrastructure and equipment”, while also eliminating unnecessary additional water into the mine, the statement said.Tara Mines is the largest zinc mine in Europe and has 580 direct employees.Meath East TD Peadar Tóibín of Aontú said hundreds more people are indirectly supported by economic activity around the mine . “The first concern from people I have spoken to is obviously that the workers are safe. But they are also concerned obviously that any suspension would have an impact on the incomes of families. They are hopeful and have confidence in management of the mine.“We are hopeful that this won’t be a prolonged experience. But there a concern amongst some people in the town that if is a prolonged experience what effect that would have on the economy of the county and of the town,” Mr Tóibín said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"nphet to discuss requirement for primary schoolchildren to wear masks","story":"A requirement for children in primary school to wear masks is expected to be discussed by Nphet. File photograph: The A requirement for children in primary school to wear masks is expected to be discussed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) when it meets on Thursday.Some members of the group believe such a move would help stem the rise in infections in younger children, though the Government does not intend to introduce any new restrictions this week.If a recommendation is made by Nphet, it is likely to be considered by Government next week.Latest figures show that primary school-aged children now have the highest Covid-19 incidence of any age group, with some 10,000 positive cases in the past fortnight. A report from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) also notes that the infection rate for primary school-aged children has been rising since mid-October, but the risk of transmission within a school still remains “low”, while public health advisers have suggested to Government that much of the infection among children is coming from parents, rather than in school. The report says increases among pre-school and primary-aged children have been consistent with increases across other age groups over the same time period.“The risk of onward transmission from undetected asymptomatic cases within the school setting remains low,” it adds.Booster vaccinesSources also say Nphet may recommend that people avoid visiting older relatives until their relatives have received their booster shot of the vaccine. Some sources say there is a significant danger when unvaccinated children visit older relatives whose immunity is waning.There are also concerns that some people in their 60s will not be fully covered by boosters before Christmas Day. A booster shot takes about seven days to take full effect, meaning mid-December is the cut-off for full protection on Christmas Day itself. The HSE is likely to make walk-in vaccines available before mid-December, while people can also seek a shot in pharmacies, rather than wait to be called, if they are eligible.About 190,000 shots were given last week, and that is to rise to 240,000-270,000 in the coming weeks, though this is still short of the summer peak of about 300,000 a week.Pace of rolloutA meeting of a powerful senior officials group on Wednesday, chaired by the State’s top civil servant, Martin Fraser, emphasised the need to get as many people, especially those in older cohorts, boosters before Christmas, when intergenerational mixing will accelerate. The Covid Oversight Group, which also involves senior Nphet members, examined constraints on the speed of vaccination. Secretary general of the Department of Health Robert Watt is understood to have urged that the pace of the booster rollout be increased in the coming days. The number of staff working on the vaccination programme is lower than during the summer, when healthcare staff were redeployed. However, the pressures associated with the current Covid wave are such that healthcare workers cannot be spared from the front line, with thousands also off on Covid-related absences. Meanwhile, the European Medicines Agency is expected to announce its recommendation on the use of the Pfizer vaccine in five-11 year olds by the end of this week. Any go-ahead would first have to be confirmed by Irish regulatory authorities before rollout here, and it is unlikely the vaccine could be administered to primary schoolchildren before the new year.There is hope in Government circles that the rise in case numbers, test positivity and Covid-19 hospitalisation may be plateauing. However, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar told the Fine Gael parliamentary party that if cases were plateauing, it was at a worryingly high level. He said that everything possible would be done to avoid another lockdown.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Officials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissenters"},{"url":null,"title":"prime minister appears burned perhaps expect much","story":"“Good, of course.”“That sounds wizard.

Quite possibly not. Or Meredith Kercher? The name of the 21-year-old British student raped and murdered in Perugia, Italy, 14 years ago is probably more familiar.Now how about the name Amanda Knox, aka ‘Foxy Knoxy’? Chances are that you will not only know her name, but also the face of the slightly oddball American girl who was accused of murdering her friend in a “sex game gone wrong”.Knox is so inextricably linked to the events of November 1 2007 that the New York Post ran a headline last year saying: “Man Who Killed Amanda Knox’s Roommate Freed on Community Service.” The “man” in that headline was Guede, an habitual criminal who was convicted of murdering the “roommate”, Kercher and who, this week, has been controversially released from jail after serving just 13 years and six months of his 16-year sentence. Yet the public fascination with Knox is so intense that it is her name that remains shorthand for the horrific crime, with that of her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito – who also spent four years in prison before being acquitted by the Supreme Court in Rome – having become hardly more than a footnote. Even now photographers wait outside 34-year-old Knox’s house in Seattle, hoping to snap the first pictures of her with her baby daughter, named Eureka.Little wonder, then, that she has called on the newly freed Guede to confess to the crime – which he has always denied, despite DNA evidence – and clear her name once and for all. “Guede holds a tremendous power to heal others harmed by his actions. He has the power to tell the truth, to take responsibility, to stop blaming me for the rape and murder of Meredith Kercher, which a wealth of evidence shows he committed alone,” Knox wrote on Twitter this week.So is it time for us to let go of our fictionalised version of ‘Foxy Knoxy’ and allow married mother Knox to reclaim her life, and her name? Where can she go from here?According to Knox, “the controversy, not the truth, is what people care about more”, and the reason that controversy lingers on is that the Italian courts have never accepted Guede acted alone.Guede – who was arrested three weeks after the murder and convicted in a fast-track trial – holds in his hands the ability to clear Knox’s name once and for all. The Italian courts could, if they wanted, apologise for the four years she spent in prison and the eight-year legal process in which she was enmeshed, but to do so would be to admit to embarrassing flaws in the country’s legal system.Yet Italian prosecutors would not let go of a bizarre theory that detectives had formed from the off: that Kercher had been murdered because she refused to take part in a “sex game” with Knox and Sollecito. The pair were convicted of murder in 2009 in 2011 their convictions were quashed in 2013 a new trial was ordered, then in 2015 Italy’s Supreme Court exonerated them for good. Knox blames the police’s preferred scenario on a “misogynist fantasy” – one which so excited the public imagination that Matt Damon’s current thriller Stillwater is based on the Knox trial, and it also helped inspire new BBC drama Showtrial, both more than a decade on.She did not, it must be said, help herself in the way she behaved after the murder: having implicated an entirely innocent local man, bartender Patrick Lumumba in the crime. She was photographed kissing Sollecito in public, which was taken as evidence of her guilt – though she insists that she did not, contrary to reports at the time, perform a cartwheel in the local police station. In her 2013 autobiography, Waiting To Be Heard, Knox admits that she is not good at “social norms” and accepts that her behaviour could have been misconstrued.Nowadays, we are more aware of the sexist stereotypes that paint women as “she-devils” and “ice queens” – both accusations thrown at Knox during that time. Would she be treated differently now?Her detractors (and it must be said that the Kercher family has never explicitly accepted she is innocent) accuse her of hypocrisy in asking to be left alone. She has, after all, written a memoir, given numerous interviews to newspapers, television and radio, hosts her own podcast, and has reportedly negotiated exclusive rights for pictures of herself with her daughter, born earlier this year to husband, novelist Christopher Robinson. In her defence, Knox says that she needs the money to pay off her family’s huge legal bills, and that turning around her reputation by standing up to the critics – reclaiming her own story – is her only hope of freeing her daughter from the curse that follows her name. She could hardly, she has also pointed out, get a regular job given the press who still regularly follow her around. She is in touch with Monica Lewinsky, whom she regards as a fellow victim of misogyny in the early years of 24-hour rolling news and social media a woman who for decades was characterised as a guilty party despite being a young intern in thrall to the most powerful man in the world. A woman whose name is still used as shorthand for that scandal, rather than Bill Clinton’s. Twenty years on, Lewinsky has found a new voice campaigning against cyberbullying, in the same way that Knox now hopes to raise awareness of other victims of wrongful conviction.Knox, then, does not intend to disappear, saying this week in response to those who suggest that she changes her name: “My name is not wrong, they’re wrong about me.”“I am not Foxy Knoxy,” she insists – and it is this misinterpretation of her character that she wants to see off. The nickname, unearthed on her social media profile by a reporter, dated back to childhood and, she has always insisted, was given to her because of her wily skills as a footballer.Either way, her rhyming epithet was irresistible to headline writers, and has come to define her in the public eye. In Britain it marked her out as a vamp in Italy it was even more damaging, as the public associated it with fox-like cunning, the sort that would course through the veins of a murderer.“The prosecution and the media crafted a story, and a doppelgänger version of me, onto which people could affix all their uncertainties, fears and moral judgments. People liked that story: the psychotic man-eater, the dirty ice queen, Foxy Knoxy,” she has said. Strangers who sent her lingerie and love letters were, she adds, taken in by the “cardboard cut out” character. “Amanda’s out of prison, but she’s not out of the prison of public vilification,” her husband, Robinson, has explained.Rudy Guede is the only person who knows what happened that night, but he says he “just wants to be forgotten”. Unlike Amanda Knox, he is likely to be granted his wish.Additional reporting by Claudia RowanMore from NewsMigrant crisis latest: Britain is too \u0026#39attractive\u0026#39 for illegal migrants seeking work, says French ministerCovid latest news: Germany announces record number of infections and deathsHow CO2 monitors and crackdown on lorry stowaways drove migrants to the seaRichard Madeley taken to hospital after \u0026#39medical emergency\u0026#39 in I\u0026#39m A Celebrity campEU set to propose \u0026#39nine-month expiry date\u0026#39 on Covid vaccine passports for travelMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"vaccines never route eliminating covid entirely","story":"To understand the effects of vaccines, it is critical to distinguish between three things: their ability to block infection, to prevent clinical symptoms (which may require hospitalisation) and to protect against life-threatening illness.Different immune responses, such as antibodies and T-cells, work in different ways and result in different types of immunity. Focussing on a single immune response can distort our understanding of the epidemic process, especially as we are constrained by what we can easily measure. For example, the antibody studies conducted in the UK last year are likely to have significantly underestimated the degree of exposure to Covid-19 prior to lockdown, partly because antibodies wane rapidly and also because many people fended off infection without developing antibodies, as shown by recent studies on T-cells.While it is not that useful to speculate on whether one vaccine is better than another, we should recognise that infection-blocking immunity is temporary, while immunity against severe disease and death is likely durable. This is in line with our understanding of the transmission dynamics of other coronaviruses with which we exist without complaint because they do not cause a significant burden of serious disease.It is now widely agreed that Covid-19 is close to becoming endemic, in a way we enjoy with other seasonal coronaviruses, where the reduction in risk to vulnerable people is primarily achieved through the maintenance of high levels of infection-blocking immunity in the population (otherwise known as herd immunity) through regular infection. The vaccines that we currently employ appear to be highly effective in preventing life-threatening illness but do not meaningfully contribute to the maintenance of herd immunity.Now that we have protected the majority of the population – including those who did not need it – against severe disease and death from Covid-19, we should focus our attention on those who are vulnerable and yet remain unprotected. This applies to the global population of vulnerable people, especially those in poorer nations, rather than just your sceptical neighbour.It is also important to recognise that our long history of previous exposure to seasonal coronaviruses may well have protected many of us from severe Covid-19. It is my opinion that repeated exposure to related influenza strains has so far averted a pandemic of the proportions of the devastating pandemic of 1918. Prior to 1918, influenza most likely died out completely within inter-pandemic periods. Since the previous influenza pandemic had occurred in 1890, most iniduals under the age of 30 had no experience of it and they are the ones who died.Based on these principles, a shift in focus towards vaccines which prevent death but not necessarily infection is long overdue. Before vaccines, the only viable solution was to protect the vulnerable population through state-sanctioned shielding. The vaccines should have changed that, but instead we find ourselves trapped by the superannuated conviction that vaccines must block infection as well as disease.Sunetra Gupta is professor of theoretical epidemiology at the Department of Zoology, University of OxfordMore from NewsExclusive: France backtracks over claims it may have caught smugglers behind migrant tragedyMigrant crisis latest: Britain is too \u0026#39attractive\u0026#39 for illegal migrants seeking work, says French ministerCovid latest news: Germany announces record number of infections and deathsHow CO2 monitors and crackdown on lorry stowaways drove migrants to the seaRichard Madeley taken to hospital after \u0026#39medical emergency\u0026#39 in I\u0026#39m A Celebrity campMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"eu set propose nine month expiry date covid vaccine passports","story":"The European Union is to recommend a nine-month expiry date on Covid vaccine passports for those looking to travel into the bloc, according to reports. Member states should prioritise vaccinated travellers and continue to welcome those inoculated with doses approved by the EU, documents seen by Bloomberg show. The memo also calls for countries to reopen for fully-vaccinated tourists who have been jabbed with shots approved by the World Health Organisation from Jan 10.The European Commission\u0027s proposals, which cover travel from outside the EU, also include a new time limit for the validity of Covid vaccines, suggesting boosters will be needed for holidaymakers who had their second jabs more than nine months before their trip. It is understood an announcement will be made later on Thursday. National governments will ultimately decide whether or not to act on the recommendation from the EU. Millions of people who have had a booster dose of a coronavirus vaccine are now able to prove this via the NHS app.Travellers who have had an extra jab are now able to display their vaccination status on the NHS Covid Pass, the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) said last week.The feature will enable those who have had their third dose to travel to countries including Israel, Croatia and Austria, where there is a time limit for a vaccine to be valid to skip quarantine.Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the move aims to make it easier to travel abroad.He said: We want to make it as easy as possible for people to show their vaccine status if they are travelling abroad.This update to the NHS Covid Pass will mean people can have their complete medical picture at their fingertips if they are going on holiday or seeing loved ones overseas.Getting a top-up jab is our best defence against this virus and I urge all those who are eligible to come forward and get boosted.It comes amid surging cases in Europe that are threatening a fourth wave of cases. A number of countries -

A Roman Stephen Fry maybe.”Roman high society held Greek philosophy, literature and language in high regard. The placement of the mosaic in the 3rd or 4th century villa complex is significant, according to Mr Carter.“It was placed on the floor of the room used for dining and entertaining, he said. It’s definitely a way to show off at dinner parties, or like us doing up our homes when we can.“It shows off his status - he was high-status, wealthy, intellectual. This was an educated person.”Professor Ken Dark, author and Roman expert, believes that the ostentatious four-panel mosaic indicates “an awareness of Greek literature” and was likely “intended to impress guests with how highly educated the owner was”.He added: “It is displaying erudition, like quoting one of the classics of English literature at a dinner party.”The reference to a Greek epic by the ancient equivalent of rural British gentry, based on what would likely have been an agricultural centre, also supports the view that Roman and early Medieval Britain was not a “cultural backwater”.The find was made in the field of Brian Naylor, a Rutland landowner, by his son Jim Irvine, who contacted heritage authorities in 2020 after finding shards of pottery on a family walk.Excavations by a University of Leicester team revealed significant finds, including two mysterious sets of human remains likely placed at the site after the Roman period.While further work is needed to properly examine and date the site, the uniqueness of the literary mosaic has led John Thomas, the dig leader of University of Leicester Archaeological Services, to hail the artwork as “the most exciting Roman mosaic discovery in the UK in the last century”.Duncan Wilson, the chief executive of Historic England, said: “To have uncovered such a rare mosaic of this size, as well as a surrounding villa, is remarkable.Discoveries like this are so important in helping us piece together our shared history. By protecting this site we are able to continue learning from it, and look forward to what future excavations may teach us about the people who lived there over 1,500 years ago.Visitors will not be allowed at the site, however, as the mosaic crafted from pieces of ceramic and coloured stone will remain buried for the foreseeable future, to protect the artwork from the elements pending further excavation.On Wednesday, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport officially marked the villa as a Scheduled Monument on the advice of Historic England. The public body is now working with Rutland County Council on how best to display other finds unearthed at the site.While the site remains closed to the public indefinitely, the moment of the mosaic’s discovery will be broadcast next year on the BBC’s Digging for Britain, hosted by Prof Alice Roberts. More from NewsMigrant crisis latest: Britain is too \u0026#39attractive\u0026#39 for illegal migrants seeking work, says French ministerCovid latest news: Germany announces record number of infections and deathsHow CO2 monitors and crackdown on lorry stowaways drove migrants to the seaRichard Madeley taken to hospital after \u0026#39medical emergency\u0026#39 in I\u0026#39m A Celebrity campEU set to propose \u0026#39nine-month expiry date\u0026#39 on Covid vaccine passports for travelMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"west now losing modern space race","story":"There are times when mankind’s ability to conquer the challenges presented by outer space can be truly inspirational, such as Nasa’s latest Dart mission to prevent the Earth being destroyed by an asteroid. In what Nasa scientists see as a test run for saving the planet from extinction, they have launched their first spacecraft designed to stop a huge space rock from colliding with Earth.The aim of the Dart spacecraft that blasted off yesterday from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California is to target a small asteroid called Dimorphos, which takes just over two years to orbit the sun. Although this space rock poses no direct threat to Earth, Nasa is keen to test its ability to prevent our planet from being hit by a far larger comet.A comet strike sixty-six million years ago is credited with bringing the reign of the dinosaurs to an end, as well as eradicating most plant and animal species. But while asteroids arguably pose a far greater threat to mankind than climate change, our ability to protect ourselves from such an eventuality has largely been consigned to the realms of science fiction, as depicted in the 1998 movie Armageddon, where the comet is destroyed by flying nuclear bombs into its core.This week’s Nasa mission has more modest ambitions, merely seeking to deflect an asteroid from hitting Earth rather than destroying it completely. But the project, which should result in Dart smashing into its target at 15,000mph in September 2022, just goes to show the rapid advances being made in man’s ability to conquer the challenges of space, for both good and bad.For, while it is hard to question the merits of a programme that aims to save mankind from oblivion, other developments in the realms of space are far more problematic – Russia’s successful test-firing earlier this month of an anti-satellite missile among them.The estimated 3,000 satellites currently circling the globe play a vital role in our everyday lives, such as facilitating communications and travel. They also make a crucial contribution to the modern battlefield, which might explain why the Kremlin is investing so much effort in acquiring the means to destroy them.The destruction of a defunct Soviet-era intelligence satellite by Russia’s new Nudol anti-satellite weapons system, which provoked widespread criticism from the West and caused the seven-man crew of the International Space Station to take shelter, was a dramatic demonstration of Moscow’s ability to destroy key elements of our national infrastructure.China, too, has recently demonstrated alarming new developments in its space-oriented missile capabilities, such as its recent test of a hypersonic glide vehicle, a manoeuvrable spacecraft that can carry a nuclear warhead, which has the ability to fire a separate missile in mid-flight.Rivalry in space between the world’s major powers is nothing new. One of the defining contests of the Cold War era was the desperate race between Washington and Moscow to put a man on the Moon.What is different about the modern-day struggle between the world’s major powers for mastery of space is the potentially devastating impact it could have on our well-being. While the Cold War rivalry was essentially a race to the Moon, today’s contest is all about which power can inflict the maximum amount of damage against an adversary through the application of space technology.Russian President Vladimir Putin, moreover, has a long history of employing new war-fighting techniques to achieve his goals. The current migrant crisis in Eastern Europe, which Moscow has been accused of encouraging, is a classic exercise in hybrid warfare, where Russia and its Belarusian ally are callously exploiting the plight of hapless migrants to cause isions among EU leaders.And if, as many Eastern Europeans fear, the Russian leader were to cause further unrest by launching another military offensive against Ukraine in the coming months, he would almost certainly exploit Russia’s mastery of space technology to his advantage.Russia already has the ability to disrupt navigation systems used by the West that rely on satellites, as RAF Typhoon pilots involved in operations against Islamic State discovered when their systems were subjected to Russian jamming. Moscow would certainly employ these and other space-linked tactics against Ukraine in the event of renewed hostilities.With adversaries like Russia and China seeking to become the dominant powers in space, the priority for the Western powers now is to ensure they are equal to the challenge. There is certainly a widespread recognition that space must be taken seriously as a new frontier in modern warfare, with the US, France and Britain all establishing their own military space command structures during the past decade.The concern, though, with Russia and China demonstrating their technical mastery of this new technology, is that there is no guarantee the West can win the latest space race.     More from NewsExclusive: France backtracks over claims it may have caught smugglers behind migrant tragedyMigrant crisis latest: Britain is too \u0026#39attractive\u0026#39 for illegal migrants seeking work, says French ministerCovid latest news: Germany announces record number of infections and deathsHow CO2 monitors and crackdown on lorry stowaways drove migrants to the seaRichard Madeley taken to hospital after \u0026#39medical emergency\u0026#39 in I\u0026#39m A Celebrity campMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"1 10 families set ask","story":" in  families set to ask for help this winter as cost of living crisis hitsCitizens Advice has warned soaring energy bills and rising inflation will leave the equivalent of . million households strugglingMillions of households are struggling with rising bills Image: Getty Images Tetra images RFByGraham HiscottHead of Business:,  Nov | commentsOne in  families is facing a financial crisis this winter amid a cost of living crunch, worrying research from Citizens Advice has revealed.

He has been claiming Universal Credit as he can’t work, but recently saw this drop by £ a week. “I don’t buy the things I need,” said Gordon, not his real name. “I’m constantly looking at the bank account. “It’s the epitome of being tight but I’ve got to be very careful. “I put things off as I can’t afford the petrol to drive. “I feel isolated and stressed, but what can I do  “I’m living in one room to keep the heat down as low as I possibly can, but everything is just mounting up. “It’s direct debit after direct debit and any minute I think I’m going to be in the minus.” Recently published figures showed inflation jumped from .% in September to a near -year high of .% last month. The cost of everything from petrol and energy to food and drink prices has shot up. With inflation outstripping underlying wage growth, many workers are enduring a real terms pay cut. Citizens Advice analysed average income data against household spending on essentials like rent, bills and food to establish how many families can meet their living costs. Among the three million households facing financial crisis are , who have less than £ spare each month after covering their basic living costs, putting them at risk of hardshipthey faced an unexpected bill. A survey of , adults by the charity shows more than a third of people are worried about paying their bills this winter, rising to nearly half of those on low incomes. One in five have already cut back on their food shopping, or used less heating in the past three months to save money. And one in  of those questioned said they were preparing to ask for help this winter, including from food banks or with fuel vouchers.Citizens Advice said many low-income families have been hit by a “triple whammy” of the £-a-week Universal Credit cut, soaring energy bills and rising inflation.The consequences are already starting to be felt. In the past three months, nearly three quarters of frontline staff at Citizens Advice reported an increase in the number of people coming to them unable to afford essential household costs such as food, rent and heating. Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: “All of us are noticing our bills go up, but for people on the tightest budgets there’s simply nothing left to cut back on. “Many are getting into debt and finding that accessing crisis support like food banks is the only way to get by. “Our frontline advisers are already seeing these dire consequences of the cost of living crisis. “The government has a crucial opportunity to intervene before things escalate even further. We’d urge them to act now and increase benefits in line with inflation this December.” Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON \" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But as it stands, the Standards Committee is not due to report to the Government until January. Image: REUTERSByRachel WearmouthSenior Political Correspondent:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov | comments Double-jobbing Tory MPs are set to rake in more than £, while Boris Johnson dithers over a sleaze clampdown.An analysis of parliamentaposs register of interests has shown more than  Conservative MPs are keeping second jobs, while the government delays a clean-up of parliamentary standards. Between now and the end of January, Tory backbenchers are on course to trouser £, of outside cash, in addition to their £, MP salary, with a total of , hoursapos work. And the practice could continue beyond January  as the Prime Minister may yet kick promised reforms into the long grass. Mr Johnson pledged he would enact a major crackdown on second jobs after MPs voted for new rules last week. It will include an outright ban on political consultancy roles and that any outside role, paid or unpaid, should be within reasonable limits and not stop MPs fully serving their constituents.  But as it stands, the Standardsapos Committee is examining ideas and is not due to report to the Government until January. MPs due to take home cash include former minister Sir John Redwood. Between now and the standards committee report, he is poised to earn around £, for his role working  hoursapos a week as committee chair for the private investment firm, Charles Stanley. Another ex-frontbencher Mark Garnier is set to cream in more than £, for three second roles, one of which is listed as aposprinciple speakerapos for BRI Wealth Management. Former Transport Secretary Chris Grayling is due to earn around £, as aposstrategic adviserapos to Hutchison Ports Europe. And Andrew Mitchell, the former International Development Secretary, is on course to earn himself more than £, from a series of private companies, including Ernst and Young and Kingsley Capital Partners.  It comes after the Toriesapos attempt to rip up the rules and get lobbying MP Owen Paterson off the hook spectacularly backfired and left the PM open to claims of Tory sleaze. The North Shropshire MP, who has since resigned triggering a by-election, was earning more than £, from two private companies and the Standardsapos Commissioner Kathryn Stone had found he made repeated and egregious breaches of lobbying rules. The Conservatives claim that MPs should have a further right to appeal, despite a similar process being available to them via parliamentaposs standards committee. Labour chairwoman Anneliese Dodds told the Mirror: “Given how many hours these MPs are spending on their big money side hustles, constituents will wonderthey ever find any time to do the day job. “Boris Johnson has failed to properly put a stop to this racket. Labour would ban dodgy second jobs, close the revolving door on lobbying and create a genuinely independent Integrity and Ethics Commission to restore standards in public le.”The Mirror has contacted the Conservative Party for comment.Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON Conservative PartyBoris JohnsonChris GraylingPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Labouraposs leader branded the PM a Covent Garden pickpocket over his broken promise that no one would have to sell their home to pay for care. After Mr Johnson claimed he had not broken his pledge - even though some families WILL have to sell up after relatives die - Sir Keir said: “People will still be forced to sell their homes to pay for care. It’s another broken promise - just like he promised he wouldn’t put up tax. Just like he promised  new hospitals. Just like he promised a rail revolution in the north. Sir Keir branded last-minute changes to a planned care cap that will save £m off the backs of poorer residents a “working class dementia tax”. And he twisted the screws over brutal Tory briefings questioning whether Mr Johnson could continue as leader - saying: Senior people in Downing Street tell the BBC it’s just not working.  Echoing the words of a TV interviewer on Monday he added: Is everything okay, Prime Minister He went on: Who knowshe’ll make it to the next election - buthe does, how does he expect anyone to take him and his promises seriously  SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford added: “Has he considered calling it a day before he’s pushed out the door ” It was the second fiery PMQs in a row after Sir Keir last week called the PM a “coward” - a word the Speaker later made him withdraw. Boris Johnson was also slammed by the Speaker for accusing the Labour leader of “Mish-conduct” over a job offer from lawyers Mishcon de Reya.In a deliberate show of unity after empty benches last week, there were rowdy cheers from Tory MPs, with the Prime Minister replying: “Thank you very much”. But mocking his speech, an opposition MP shouted: Forgive me!. And Keir Starmer teased: I see they’ve turned up this week!” It comes after pressure mounted on Boris Johnson from his own party after a string of blunders, U-turns and revolts.The PM has faced anger from backbenchers over tens of billions cut from high-speed rail plans, £m a year cut from social care plans for the poor, a disastrous attempt to rip up sleaze rules, planning reforms and sewage. He then gave a speech to business leaders in which he lost his place, impersonated a car and went on a y ersion about Peppa Pig World.Dutul No civil servants issued an official government transcript of his words, which said: “Arum arum araaaaaagh.” Rumours have started that letters of no confidence have been sent to the backbench  Committee, which has the power to remove a Tory leader. One report by The Sun claimed up to a dozen letters had been submitted, while others put the number at around one or two. Anger has been heightened by a last-minute change to the £, cap on letime care payments from . If you get state help in England, only what you actually pay will count towards the cap, not your council funding.  Sir Keir said: “It’s a classic con game, a Covent Garden pickpocketing operation. The PM’s the frontman, distracting people with wild promises and panto speeches whilst his Chancellor dips his hand in their pocket.But now the PMaposs routine is falling flat. His Chancellor is worried that people are getting wise. His backbenchers say itaposs embarrassing - your words. Senior people in Downing Street tell the BBC it’s just not working. Is everything okay, Prime Minister  The PM replied: I’ll tell you what’s not working is that line of attack. Mr Johnson tried to insist people will not have to sell their home - while they are alive. The  Tory manesto pledged people wouldnapost have to sell homes to pay for care, without mentioning their death. He said: We will disregard your home as part of your assetsyou and your spouse are living in it. You can have a deferred payment agreement. But Sir Keir said a person with assets worth £k, most tied up in homes, has to pay £, and “they’d lose almost everything”. “How on earth does the Prime Minister think they can get their hands on that kind of money without selling their home  he asked. Labour analysis suggests more than  northern constituencies have an average home value under £, - the threshold at which people are affected by the change - compared to zero in the south. The PM shot back at Labour: They haven’t had the guts to fix this in all their time in government. It’s something left over from the Attlee government and we are fixing it. Meanwhile Mr Johnson claimed he would build three new high-speed lines in the north, despite the fact these are all stripped-back from his own previous plans. He said Sir Keir “actually campaigned against HS” adding: If we’d listened to Captain Hindsight we would have no HS at all… and we would all still be in lockdown. The PM said: “I took a decision that it was the right thing to do for the long term interests of the whole country. How can they possibly trust that man.” Sir Keir replied: “I think he’s lost his place in his notes again. “The only thing he’s delivering is high taxes, high prices and low growth.” The PMaposs press secretary refused to repeat the  commitment on care - or to rule out any more pledges being broken. I would just repeat what the plan is, she said, in a testy exchange with reporters. Even the PM’s angriest critics admit a leadership challenge is a long way off, as % of Tory MPs -  of them - would need to write letters. But a senior Tory told the Mirror: “He’s lost his invincibility virginity, and once you lose that you can’t get it back.” They added: “I think what seems to have dawned on a lot of people is we are more than likely looking towards a change of leader before the next election rather than  months after the next election. “It’s like amateur hour at the London Palladium - lurching from one self-inflicted c**k-up to the other.” Dominic Raab today dismissed speculation that fed up Tories want to oustBoris Johnsonas tittle tattle. The Deputy Prime Minister insisted Mr Johnson was on great form and branded growing tensions within Tory ranks over the PMaposs position as Westminster village gossip. Downing Street was forced to tell journalists yesterday that the PM is well following his chaotic speech to business leaders on Monday. Mr Raab claimed: There will always be the scrutiny, the noisiness, that comes to British politics. Frankly, overwhelmingly - and I talk to colleagues, MPs on the back benches on all sides all the time - there is huge support for what weaposre doing and what the Prime Minister is doing.In another interview, he toldBBCBreakfast: The Prime Minister is on great form.The reality is people speak about speeches in the Westminster village, the gossip and all the rest of it. Tensions have been swirling between No and Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs operation in No after the Treasury was blamed for an incendiary briefing to the BBC that there is a lot of concern inside the building about the PM and itaposs just not working. Allies of Mr Sunak denied the Treasury was involved in the briefing - but the Chancellor and PM have clashed several times over summer. Mr Raab said: Itaposs the job of Westminster commentators to pick up on one anonymous source from wherever they found it to criticise the Government of the day, thataposs fine.“Yes”. But adds “I’ve seen ious anonymous source briefings that I’m not going to go into” Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON PMQs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A Whitehall source previously told the Mirror that the aim was to deter people from making the crossing, as passengers were already dying trying to reach the UK. But Amnesty described attempts to intercept vessels as incredibly high-risk, adding that to push people back will endanger their lives which is totally at odds with the legal duty of rescue at sea. Liberal Democrat Home Affairs Spokesperson Alistair Carmichael said: “It is disgraceful that the government is even considering pushing boats back in the Channel after yesterday’s tragic news. Priti Patel must immediately rule out these dangerous and cruel pushback tactics which don’t work and could cause yet more unnecessary deaths. The government’s incompetence and failure to get to grips with this crisis has led us to the heartbreaking situation we find ourselves in. Instead of yet more unworkable gimmicks, ministers must now focus on providing safe and legal routes to take refugees out of the grip of smugglers and traffickers.” Ms Patel is due to speak to her French counterpart Gerard Darmanin this morning before updating MPs on efforts to stop people smugglers sending desperate migrants across the Dover Strait. Mr Foster said The Home Secretary will be speaking to her French counterpart later this morning. Obviously our heart goes out in terms of those who have lost their lives yesterday and their loved ones. As you know, at least  people have died but it is a dynamic situation, the French authorities are investigating and obviously weaposre keen to let them get on with their work and weaposve obviously offered any support we can give. Tensions between France and Britain have been escalating, with a growing blame game over the crisis unfolding in the Channel. Boris Johnson has urged Emmanuel Macron to agree to joint police patrols along coast, but France has so far resisted the call. Dover MP Natalie Elphicke said: “Yesterday we saw footage of French police standing by while people got the boat ready, picked up the engine and took to the water on the French side. They did absolutely nothing. Thataposs unacceptable and thataposs got to change.  The British are standing by willing to put people to help, the EU Iaposm sure will come to the Frenchaposs aid as well, this is a humanitarian crisis on the shores of France, these people smugglers must not be allowed to continue to ply their trade and put peopleaposs lives at risk in these wintry seas. It is vital that actionaposs taken and the only way to do that is to stop people on the beaches of France from getting into the boats and turning them around quickly in French waters. But Calais MP Pierre-Henri Dumont said: Iaposm not sure that having more police officers or more materials on the French shore will help to stop these crossings because we have  or  kilometres of shore to monitor  . It only takes five to  minutes to take a boat and put it at sea filled with migrants, so Iaposm not sure it is only a question of money and the number of men. Charities stepped up calls for the Government to devise safe and legal routes to come to the UK. This tragedy was completely predictable, indeed it was predicted and it was completely preventable,” said Zoe Gardner, from the Joint Council of Welfare for Immigrants. This has to be a time for our Government to mark a turning point, this tragedy must not be allowed to continue and that means changing our approach, not more of the same failed policies. We need to offer people alternatives to the smuggling boats.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Priti Patel\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Arthur died on June  last year aged six, after being subjected to a persistent campaign of cruelty by his Thomas Hughes, , who is currently on trial for his murder. Little Arthur was found with  areas of bruising on his body after he died from unsurvivable brain injuries in June last year, while alone with Hughesapos partner Emma Tustin, . Coventry Crown Court was told that Arthuraposs concerned grandmother Joanne Hughes, took pictures of a large bruise on his shoulder in a failed attempt to show authorities that her grandson was in danger. But she said when she called social services and offered to send the picture they didnapost want to see it. When social workers visited the following day, Ms Hughes said they recorded no concerns, and simply put the marks down to childaposs play. When social workers visited the next day, they put the marks down to aposchild playapos and recorded aposno concernsapos.  One of the social workers later told jurors that she had noticed a yellowing bruise in the middle of Arthuraposs back when she visited, and when she was later shown the picture Ms Hughes took, she was shocked at how she had failed to realise how extensive his injuries were. Recordings of a six-year-old boy crying no-one loves me and no-oneaposs gonna feed me before his death were released as the murder trial nears its end. Hughes and Tustin both deny murdering Arthur, after he suffered a fatal collapse while alone with his stepmother at her Cranmore Road home in Solihull, West Midlands, on June  last year.  The pair also face multiple counts of child cruelty, after it was alleged the boy was force-fed salt-laced meals, kept isolated in the home, starved, dehydrated and routinely beaten by the couple. The court heard Hughes sent text messages to Tustin saying to dig Arthuraposs grave, and kidaposs getting ended when I get back. Tustin has claimed Arthuraposs fatal head injury was self-inflicted, possibly by throwing himself down the staircase in her hallway, where he was forced to spend  to  hours a day as part of the coupleaposs behavioural regime.  Jurors sitting at Coventry Crown Court have heard the boy had  injuries, both old and new, all over his body, including  alone on his head and neck. He did not have his own bed and had to sleep on the lounge floor without a mattress, the court has previously heard. Prosecutors have also alleged Tustin and Hughes withheld food and drink, and when they did feed Arthur they poisoned him with salt, leaving him frail and weak.  Tustin has also accepted recording more than  audio files of Arthur, while he was being punished, claiming they were to show Hughes how his son was behaving. Two of the audio files have now been made public for the first time since the trial began last month. In one, Arthur can be heard crying and pleading: No-one loves me, repeating the phrase four times in a -second recording. In another audio file of  seconds, Arthur cries No-oneaposs gonna feed me seven times.  Arthur fatally collapsed while he and his father were staying at Tustinaposs home during the first Covid lockdown. The jury has heard from one witness who described how Arthur looked broken just a few weeks after he moved in. Video of a weakened and frail Arthur, recorded just hours before his collapse and previously played in court, was also released on Tuesday after being seen by the jury.  The footage, recorded on an internal CCTV camera in the propertyaposs lounge, shows the boy struggling to pick up and then put away his pillow and blanket after waking at .am. It takes him  seconds to get to his knees and finally his feet, with an expression of pain on his face throughout. Hughes and Tustin have both pleaded not guilty to murder. Tustin admitted one count of child cruelty, but has denied further charges of the same offence. Hughes also denies child cruelty offences. The trial - held at Coventry Crown Court - continues.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Murder trialSocial servicesCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Louie Leach has been staying with Bobbi-Anne McLeodaposs mother and two siblings at their home in Plymouth, Devon as police continue to question two murder suspects. Bobbi-Anne, , was reported missing on Saturday when she did not show up to meet Louie and a group of friends at pm. Yesterday, a body was found close to the coastal path and car park above Bovisand beach - seven miles from the bus stop where the teen was last seen. Devon and Cornwall Police are continuing to search the woodland and clfs above a Devon beach for clues.  Police say that while formal identication hasnapost been carried out but Bobbi-Anneaposs were informed and are being supported by specialist officers.One of Bobbi-Anneaposs friends told the MailOnline : Louie is with Bobbi-Anneaposs family now and they are helping each other through this dficult time. They can barely speak. There are no words for the horror they are living through.Bobbi-Anne and Louie were really in love and were a wonderful couple. They had their whole lives ahead of them and now this has been cruelly taken away from Louie and itaposs crushed him.  Late last night brother, Lee, shared an image of the two of them as children and wrote: Until we meet again sis. I love you. Now go rest easy. Two men, aged  and , were arrested last night on suspicion of murder and remain in custody. Today, mourners arrived to lay flowers opposite the bus stop where Bobbi-Anne was last seen in the Leigham area of Plymouth. Many wept and hugged each other as forensic police officers were seen combing the surrounding area for clues.  The assistant chief constable of Devon and Cornwall Police Nikki Leaper said the two arrested suspects were still being questioned and they were not anticipating any charges to be brought today. In a statement read out at a press conference, she said: We are aware of the signicant level of interest in the ongoing murder investigation being run by our major crime team and I wanted to provide you with the latest information in relation to this. The two men who were arrested on suspicion of murder remain in police custody at this time.  We do not anticipate this to change throughout today as enquiries continue at a pace. Yesterday afternoon officers located the body of a woman in the Bovisand area of the South Hams after information received by police led to enquiries being carried out in the area. Formal identication hasnapost been carried out but the family of -year-old Bobbi-Anne McLeod were informed of the development and they continue to be supported by specialist officers.  Officers on the ground have been and are continuing to be supported by specialist resources whilst extensive searches and forensic examination of a number of scenes is carried out. These searches are expected to continue into the coming days and the public can expect to see an increased visible police presence during that time. We apologise for any disruption these searches may cause to our communities. Whilst of course we understand the public interest in the investigation, we remind the public that this is a live and active case and we ask the public not to speculate at this time. I would like to thank the public and the communities of Plymouth for supporting our officers and investigation and I continue to encourage anyone with information which may assist our investigation to contact us.

This group survived the journey, but hours later a child and five women were among those who died when their boat capsized in the ­Channel’s worst-ever migrant boat disaster.PM Boris Johnson tonight said that he was “deeply saddened” by the tragedy. Migrants drag a huge inflatable across the beach to the sea, with French police watching from a pick-up as children are put on the boat for the perilous Channel crossing. The two officers did nothing to stop the dinghy setting off near the town of Wimereux just after am.  Mercully, six-and-a-half hours later it arrived on the coast near Dover, where Border Force officials were there to help. The group survived the journey on the day at least  other desperate migrants, including five women and a young girl, died attempting the same crossing. The death toll was earlier estimated to be as high as , but the French government said late on Wednesday night that its official toll was , down from . French interior minister Gerald Darmanin described the victims’ vessel as “very frail, like a pool you blow up in your garden”. Read MoreRead More French President Emmanuel Macron called for an emergency meeting of European ministers, as he vowed: “France will not let the Channel become a cemetery.” The scale of the tragedy unfolded in the afternoon when fishermen out at sea  miles north of Calais spotted bodies floating in the waves. By evening, French Coast Guard and Navy vessels had retrieved nearly  bodies and at least two survivors, with boats and helicopters searching for more.  Six people had been seen alive in the water. The British Coast Guard was helping the operation and, with more than  dinghies setting out today, officials fear other vessels could have sunk too. Four suspected traffickers were arrested and Dunkirk prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation for manslaughter and “assistance with illegal immigration”. Gangs have been charging refugees more than £, for passage in inflatable dinghies, with le jackets of little use in the treacherous currents and freezing temperatures of the Channel.  The joint rescue operation was called off late tonight. Mr Darmanin said: “There are no words strong enough to describe the criminality of the smugglers.” Before todayaposs tragedy,  people had died attempting the crossing this year. More than , migrants have made the journey in November alone, the most ever in a single month. It brings the total for the year so far to more than ,, compared to , in , and , in . Britain pledged to give France £million to stop the crossings but tonight Boris Johnson, who chaired a Cobra meeting on the crisis, offered more support.He said: “The operation being conducted by our friends on the beaches, supported with £million from the UK to help patrol the beaches, the technical support we’ve been giving, they haven’t been enough. “Our offer is to increase our support and to work with our partners on the beaches concerned, on the launching grounds for these boats.”He said smugglers had to be shown “they can’t simply get people over the Channel”, or they would continue to “get away with murder”. France has refused to let UK officers work on the other side of the Channel to detect people-smuggling operations.The two French officers at the beach near Wimereux were powerless to stop the boat launching with around  families on board. The police truck flashed its lights and circled the migrants but soon gave up and went to patrol another area of beach. Home Secretary Priti Patel posted: “This Government’s New Plan for Immigration will overhaul our broken asylum system and address many of the long-standing pull factors encouraging migrants to make the perilous journey.”  But the Government is under pressure to offer safe asylum routes.Labour leader Keir Starmer tweeted: “The UK Government, France and the wider international community have a duty to prevent people being forced into such peril.” Enver Solomon, of the Refugee Council, called for “safe routes for those men, women and children in desperate need of protection”.British Red Cross chief executive Mike Adamson said: “Everyone deserves to live in safety and it should be unacceptable to us that people have no choice but to make dangerous crossings in their search for this.” aposVictims of inevitable tragedyapos - Comment - by Jason Beattie, Mirror head of politics The deaths in the Channel were a tragedy waiting to happen.We knew that desperate people were risking their lives on a daily basis to seek a better le. And we knew they were being exploited by people smugglers.And we knew that unless something was done, it would result in the loss of lives.Politicians on both sides of the Channel pledged action but what was promised was not delivered.  In September  Home Secretary Priti Patel agreed a joint plan with France for   patrols on the beaches of northern France, greater intelligence sharing and “intense efforts” to tackle gangs. These measures, we were told, would prevent the majority of crossings by the spring of . But so far this year more than , people have crossed and we are struggling to control our borders. It is not for lack of money. The UK Government paid the French £.million in , followed by a further £million in July this year.  With some justication Britain claims France is not keeping its side of the bargain. But much of the blame lies at the door of the Government. It has all but shut the door for genuine asylum seekers. With no safe passage, those escaping bloodshed and oppression turned in desperation to criminal gangs. And now we are out of the EU we are no longer part of the Dublin agreement that states illegal migrants must be processed in the EU country they first entered. Solving this crisis requires compassion and co-operation. Both have been in short supply.

The B... iant, an offshoot of an older iant called B.., has  spike mutations in the spike protein and has been found in Botswana – where it is believed to have first emerged – as well as South Africa and Hong Kong. Only  cases of the new iant have so far been spotted through genomic sequencing but experts believe its identication in three countries suggests it could be more widespread. The single case identied in Hong Kong came from a person who had recently travelled from South Africa, sparking fears that more infections could have spread through international travel. The high number of mutations in the new iant has caused concern among the scientic community, because a number of the mutations may help the virus evade immunity.  Dr Tom Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College who tweeted about the find, described the iantaposs combination of mutations as “horric”. Describing the new strain’s mutation profile as “really awful”, he added that it had the potential to be worse than nearly anything  about”, including the now-dominant Delta strain, which has  spike mutations. He wrote: “Export to Asia implies this might be more widespread than sequences alone would imply. Also the extremely long branchand incredibly high amount of spike mutations suggest this could be of real concern .  Worth emphasising this is at super low numbers right now in a region of Africa that is fairly well sampled, however it very very much should be monitored due to that horric spike profile .” So far, three cases have been detected in Botswana and six in South Africa. The first cases were collected in Botswana on  November. The Hong Kong case was a -year-old man who travelled to South Africa on  October and ed on  November.  He tested negative on histo Hong Kong but went on to test positive on  November while undergoing quarantine at a hotel. In South Africa, cases rose from  on Monday to more than  on Tuesday but scientists believe it is too soon to tell whether there is a link with the new “super iant”.New coronavirus iants are identied all the time and often will not spread beyond a handful of cases.There are currently no cases of the B... iant in the UK but officials and scientists at the UK Health Security Agencysaid they were monitoring and investigating the iant.  Dr Meera Chand, Covid- Incident Director at UKHSA, said: “The UK Health Security Agency, in partnership with scientic bodies across the globe, is constantly monitoring the status of SARS-CoV- iants as they emerge and develop worldwide. “As it is in the nature of viruses to mutate often and at random, it is not unusual for small numbers of cases to arise featuring new sets of mutations. Any iants showing evidence of spread are rapidly assessed.” Professor Francois Balloux, director of the University College London’s Genetics Institute, said the iant may have evolved during a chronic infection in an immunocompromised person, possibly an untreated HIV Aids patient.  He said: “I would definitely expect it to be poorly recognised by neutralising antibodies relative to Alpha or Delta. “It is dficult to predict how transmissible it may be at this stage. For the time being, it should be closely monitored and analysed, but there is no reason to get overly concerned, unless it starts going up in frequency in the near future.” Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON Genetics Institute Inc.University College LondonImperial CollegeEducationSchoolsSTDsSarsCoronavirusMutant Coronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Jonathan Silcock may have just  months left to live, leaving behind new we Cha and daughter Rosaleah, four. The -year-old, from Cheetham Hill, Manchester, had to process the devastating news alone at the hospital due to Covid restrictions - and now has to be fed through a tube.He had begun gruelling chemotherapy sessions immediately after diagnosis but these were stopped as the treatment was causing the cancer to grow, according to Jonathan, reports the Manchester Evening News. The dad - who also has cerebral palsy - went to his GP in February after noticing he was rapidly losing weight and regularly vomiting after eating.Have you been affected by this story  Let us know at webnews@mirror Following a endoscopy and biopsy, he was told he had stage four pancreatic cancer. I was told it would be a few weeks before the tests came back, but it was just four days later when I got a call asking me to go in and discuss the results, Jonathan explained. He said on arrival he was met by two Macmillan nurses and knew it was cancer straight away, admitting it was a shock. I have always been in and out of hospital but I never expected the news and I immediately started worrying about what it would mean for Cha and Rosaleah. But determined not to let cancer stop him, he and Cha moved up their wedding and got married in June. Weeks after the big day he was told his cancer had spread to his bowels and oesophagus, before it was also found to have reached his lungs. This shortened his le expectancy from three years to just  months. Jonathan said: I was in and out of hospital every few weeks - sadly that is all my daughter has ever known. But they told me the cancer was spreading and I had to come off the chemo straight away which was my only treatment option. I had to go home and tell all my family the news and they just kept telling me I had been through worse and could beat this. Jonathan said doctors told him his cancer was so aggressive, but that regular scans would monitor it. I asked doctors to stop telling me when it had spread because I just didnapost want to know, he explained. It was just more bad news I didnapost want to deal with. As well as the feeding tube, Jonathan uses a wheelchair and suffers with breathlessness. We Cha has now become his full-time carer. Jonathan is determined to spend his remaining days making memories with his family so they can look back and smile. My daughter is only four and she has seen me go through all this. It just isnapost right, he said. Cha wants to go to Benidorm and Jonathan has promised Rosaleah they will take her to Disneyland. It really makes you realise how important le is and how you should always make the most of each day, he added. His sister-in-law Suzanne has set up a Go Fund Me page to help the family pay for lasting memories.You can donate to it here.Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON HospitalsLe expectancyTheme parksBasketballCancerCerebral palsy\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Dad-of-four and parenting blogger Simon Harris made the generous offer after parents at Ysgol Dyffryn Nantlle in Gwynedd, north Wales, received a letter warning them that their children wouldnapost be fed unless their accounts were up to date. The letter, sent out in the name of headteacher Neil Foden, said the school cook had been instructed not to give food to any child unless their inidual accounts were in credit by November . A “handful of pupils had run up debts totalling more than £, resulting in an unexpected deficit in the school meals budget, Foden said.Writing on Twitter, Mr Harris called the letter madness and offered to pay the £, that was outstanding on the pupilsapos accounts.However,Man Behaving Dadlyblogger Mr Harris said his offer was not taken up by the school - who have since released a statement saying they are not supportive of any system which refuses the provision of a school dinner. In a post on Facebook, Mr Harris said: After offering to pay the pupil lunch debt at Ysgol Dyffryn Nantlle, I had no reply to the tweets or emails, and it was made clear to me by others linked to the school council that any attempt to transfer the money to them would be refunded.Keen for the money to go to a good cause, the dad-of-four has decided to donate the money to a local foodbank instead.  He continued: Therefore, I’m pleased to say that the £, has now been donated to Arfon Food Bank   Banc Bwyd Arfon who are the closest Trussell Trust-linked food bank to the village. Some of their food packages go to families within the school’s catchment area, and so it’s still going to benefit families with pupils at the school.The Essex-based blogger toldNorth Wales Live: Iaposve tried to be as good as my word in the circumstances. Ysgol Dyffryn Nantlleaposs letter attracted lots of media attention after it was posted on social media last week. Premier League footballer and free school meals advocate Marcus Rashford responded to the letter and called for the school to be more understanding of pupilsapos circumstances.It has now been announced that primary school pupils in Wales will be given free school meals as part of a new deal between Welsh Labour and Plaid Cymru.

He lashed out at the former office complex in the Hengrove area of the city, saying it is not fit for human habitation.Police said they were called more than  times in just over a year to the site, Bristol Live reports.Other residents, including a young mum, have also said they do not feel safe there. The parent claimed that shortly after they moved in to the apartments there was a fight in the corridor and their front door was covered in blood. He also claimed that he witnessed an attempted stabbing and said he had had problems before, including receiving threats and abuse from one of the other residents. Do you have a story  Email webnews@mirror. I feel very unsafe and I am always worried about someone trying to come into the flat and hurt us, he said. I sleep with a hammer next to my bed just in case. It is not very nice. Caridon has said it has security on site every day and night from am until am and that, when it is busier, it has two guards on duty. The developer said guards are trained to deal with ASB and that police would have been called immediately in the case of a serious incident. The developer has said that anyone found to be causing any bother is put into a three-stage procedure starting with a warning, followed by signing an agreement with Caridon and the police and the last stage being eviction. However, it said it reviews procedures regularly and remains open to discussions about their effectiveness. Bristol City Council admitted earlier this week that the use of a former council office block in south Bristol for housing is not an ideal option - but has defended doing so, saying the site has provided housing for more than  people. In Summer , the council revealed it planned to house people in the complex which was being redeveloped by Caridon.The company was the subject of a Newsnight investigation as residents in one of their developments in London complained about overcrowding and the mix of people, speaking about violence and substance misuse.The dad also claimed the family have made more than a hundred complaints to Caridon about the site, including about drugs and violence, but he says that nothing has been done. The resident described the noise at the site as awful and claimed they have found drug needles outside their window before, adding that they have been without hot water or heating for several months now and are having to rely on personal heaters to keep the flat warm. The dad said they feel they never had a choice about whether they wanted to live at Imperial Apartments or not, adding he feels he is battling the council and Caridon to escape the development. He continued: We moved in thinking this would be temporary accommodation, for a maximum of a year, and that we would then be moved somewhere , but it turns out the contract just keeps rolling. We are trying to get them to move us but they [the council] are saying we are adequately housed. Since we moved in, my partneraposs mental health has gone downhill drastically and I feel constantly paranoid that someone is going to come in and hurt us.  It is not fit for human habitation - it is disgusting. It has been like living in hell. They sold us something nice, but in the end it turned out to be our worst nightmare. Caridon has said that Imperial Apartments provide residents with the opportunity to manage an independent tenancy and that, for those that choose to move, it will provide landlord references. The developer said it has only had a handful of tenants that have chose to leave and that the vast majority are very happy at the property and are a positive part of our community, adding that many of its tenants were at risk of becoming homeless and have now found a permanent home at the site. Caridon said that tenant safety is a primary concern and that the private gated development has an extensive amount of cameras, together with front desk security and concierge services. A young mum who has been living in a two-bedroom flat at Imperial Apartments since the end of last year described the situation as appalling. The resident - who is in her s and has a one-year-old child - claimed she experienced serious harassment from another tenant and that the police advised her not to be there because of this. She continued: The person is still living there, he has been moved to a dferent part of the building but he knows where I am. I feel very unsafe there and my mental health has been seriously affected by what is going on. I have been feeling depressed, anxious and scared. I am feeling mentally drained. The mum said she is now on medication for her depression, adding she has been staying at friendsapos houses as she doesnapost want to be at Imperial Apartments anymore. Caridon has said it will reach out to the tenant immediately and offer all the support it can to seek a solution where possible. She said there are lots of young mums living at the development and that, when she was housed there she was told it would be perfect for her and her child as, for instance, the site has a soft play area. The mum - who signed a one year contract - claimed the whole building is in a disgusting condition. I do not think any family with children should be housed here, she continued. I think it is very unsafe for children to be in this kind of atmosphere. I thought I would be able to go where but I am now on a monthly rolling tenancy until I find somewhere to move to. Caridon has said it has a strict referral criteria in place for the building and conducts a risk assessment on all tenants to assess suitability, adding all tenants are offered aposassured shorthold tenanciesapos and that the option to live at the site is choice based. The developer said it has worked very closely with the council in building a safe and thriving community and has heavily invested in breakout spaces and facilities. Caridon said: We pride ourselves on customer service and treating all our tenants with respect. Since Imperial Apartments launched we have done our utmost to really listen to resident feedback with many of their recommendations being put in place. They wanted more onsite amenities which we have provided with our soft play area and children’s playground, for example. We have four communal rooms fitted with flat screen TVs, yoga mats and fitness equipment and all areas are cleaned daily by our full-time cleaner.

Unless they’re popping in to let their colleagues have a cuddle with their newborns, parents don’t take their babies into work.MP Stella Creasy had other ideas. On Tuesday she took her three-month-old son to a debate in Westminster Hall. Much to her fury she was told this isn’t allowed. She immediately took to Twitter to complain, saying: “Apparently Parliament has a written rule which means I can’t take my well behaved -month-old, sleeping baby when I speak in the chamber... Mothers in the mother of all parliament are not to be seen or heard it seems…” Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section  Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has asked for the rules to be reviewed and said it was “extremely important” for all parents to participate in the House. He did, however, point out they have a nursery. Many people, me included, can’t understand why Stella took her baby in at all  Was it to get a pic for Instagram She says she had to come in because, as an MP, while she’s entitled to maternity leave, she doesn’t have anyone covering her role to the detriment of her constituents.But as an MP on £, a year, couldn’t she get a baby-sitter  She can’t have it both ways. No one  does. Not the bus driver, police officer or shop worker. And they earn nowhere near £,.  As a working mum myself, I welcome all conversations about improving work for mothers. But unlike Stella, most of us working mums don’t have the luxury of being able to pick and choose when we bring our children to work. Most of us juggle work with the lion’s share of ­childcare and we do it without grand gestures or wanting a medal. The rules of the Commons are peculiar, but they only affect a handful of women. Meanwhile the UK still has the third highest childcare costs for wealthy countries, according to the OECD. Some mothers don’t go back to work while their children are little because it’s so expensive. Others have no choice. So while it’s important for Stella to take a stand in her little corner of the world, it would be greatshe could go beyond Westminster on this one.

Bedlington Terrier Holly fell ill hours after wolfing down cannabis leaves that had been dumped under a bush around Calf Heath Reservoir near Cannock. Worried owner David Wiliams recognised the half-digested leaves and rushed her to the vet who gave her anti-drug injection. Incredibly, it was just four months after Holly needed tablets to flush out her system after she ate a half-smoked cannabis joint on her daily walkies. David, , from Cannock, Staffs., said: Iaposd taken her for her usual walk and let her off and sheaposd gone snfing behind a bush.  I called her back and when we got in the car she didnapost look right and she smelled strange. I recognised it as cannabis because weaposve had a lot of anti-social behaviour around here so I know what cannabis smells like. When she brought up the leaves it confirmed suspicions and I took her to the vet again. I just couldnapost believe it had happened so soon after she swallowed the cannabis joint. “My friends and family joke that Holly’s got a drug problem.  “I have to say, she is a very laid back dog anyway but this time she was off her legs. We actually think sheaposd make a very good snfer dog. “Four months ago she got ill after swallowing a discarded cannabis joint. We took her to the vets and they gave her tablets. “This time she’d obviously eaten too much of the drug and she needed an injection and we were told to check her regularly overnight. Holly’s latest brush with cannabis happened while David took her on a walk around Calf Heath Reservoir near Cannock on November . David, who has one grown-up son and lives with we Jonanne, , reported it to police and is now warning other dog owners about the dangers of discarded drugs.  He added: “Dog walkers need to be extra cautious, I won’t be going down there again. “My we was horried when me and Holly got home.

He told Closer magazine : “I really wouldn’t be surprisedthey’re planning another Oprah interview. Harry and Meghan have caused chaos and I suspect there’s no stopping them.“I can totally see more of these high-profile, Hollywood-style interviews with A-list TV hosts happening. Especiallythere’s lots of money being offered for it. “Harry will need promotion for his memoir, due to be released next autumn, too. Another Oprah interview,it’s anything like the last, would surely push the royals to breaking point.” Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

The couplehas reportedly been invited to join the rest of the royals at Sandringham for the festive period.It would be the first chance for Royal Family to meet Lilibet, the Queenaposs namesake great-granddaughter, who the couple welcomed in June.Meghan and older son Archie have yet toto the UK since they left for the US last year. The Queen has faced a number of health concerns in recent weeks, after being hospitalised for a night in October and then having to cancel her appearance at the Remembrance Day service after spraining her back.  But a sourcetold Page Six: “There’s a lot that goes into the logistics and the planning of the family Christmas, so of course, staff know that Harry and Meghan are not coming.“If they were, they would have communicated it to their family by now. “But this is Her Majesty’s first Christmas without her husband, so one would have hoped they would want to be with her.” The Sussexes have not commented on the claims.

Itaposs become a bit of a tradition that I stay up apostil midnight with ridiculous amounts of cake mix and icing and I make far too much. But I love it. The Duchess also told Mary Berry that her youngest child would definitely recognise the veteran baker, Marie Claire reports..One of Louis’ first words was aposMaryapos because right at his height are all my cooking books in the kitchen bookshelf, she said. And children are really fascinated by faces, and your faces are all over your cooking books and he would say aposthat’s Mary Berryapos. Adding: He would definitely recognise youhe saw you today. Mary Berry was also full of compliments for Kateaposs baking. Speaking on ITVaposs This Morning, she admitted that the Duchessapos piping work might even be better than her own. “I remember we were down at the RHS at Wisley and she was bringing her garden from Cha, the childrenaposs garden and play centre, Mary said. She was piping cupcakes and they were just...not better than mine, they were beautul and she was laughing away and enjoying it.” Adding: “I think sheaposs a great person, sheaposll have a go at anything.” With Christmas around the corner, there are plenty of opportunities for the Duchess and her children to get stuck into baking festive treats.

Keith Turner, , and Rita Trickett, , decided to tie the knot in a tearful ceremony after  years together. Unfortunately, Keith was admitted to the Royal Derby Hospital a week ago after his condition started to worsen and it became clear he had a limited time left with his loved ones. Sister, Amanda Broad, helped to arrange the special day. Amanda said: “Our ACP Louisa made a wedding cake and the team provided a bouquet of flowers for the bride. “A pinhole flower was also made for the groom too as well as a buffet and decorations all provided by our staff.  “I was extremely privileged to be asked to be a witness and although it was my day off I was so happy to be there on their special day. “It was also a lovely surprise for me to receive a bouquet of flowers and a lovely card for what I had done. “It’s times like this when you realise how le can be so short and I have made one of their last wishes happen, which to me is an extreme privilege.” The couple, who live in Mackworth, near Derby, met through their work for the Red Cross in . Keith said: “Rita was one of the executive officers at the time and was my we’s best friend. When my we passed away from cancer, Rita was there to look after me and we’ve been together ever since. “However, the thought of getting married never was on our mind. I didn’t care too much about labels and we’re both quite independent people.  “It was only when I became more ill that I thought it was time to ask her to marry me, and she said yes.” Keith has been diagnosed with mesothelioma, a form of cancer, and his condition worsened after suffering from a bleed over the weekend. Rita is also a patient at the hospital, recovering from a stroke but is feeling much better and has now been discharged. She said: “This is the longest time we’ve been apart for years, it’s been horrible.” Keith has asked to be taken off treatment once the wedding is complete. Rita added: “It’s what he wants and I agree with him, he’s had enough and is tired.”  The ceremony took place in the day room at the side of ward , with some staff even visiting after their sht to send the couple their well wishes. Rita’s granddaughter, Emma Burd, , attended the ceremony along with hospital staff on the wards to celebrate the special day with the two. Emma said: “It’s been stressful. However, the ward staff have been amazing. Amanda is a star, both medically and personally. We’re eternally grateful.” Ward sister Nicola Salt took photos of the ceremony to help create a lasting memory of the day for the pair. Nicola said: “Sister Amanda did an absolutely amazing job at pulling everything together as well as the team to create a special moment that can be cherished. “It was emotional and had the team in tears but we’re all so proud.” Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON HospitalsLoveMarriageWeddings\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But Zara’s husband Mike Tindall has shared some adorable details about the big day, which saw the babies baptised in front of their great-grandmother the Queen. The ceremony, which took place at All Saints Chapel in Windsor Great Park, was held in honour of Eugenie and husband Jack Brooksbank’s son August and Zara and Mike’s eight-month-old Lucas. And speaking on his podcast, The Good, The Bad  The Rugby, former rugby player Mike revealed how everyone attending had a “lovely day”.He told co-presenter Alex Payne: I had a great weekend, a great few days.  We had the christening on Sunday, it was lovely. It was a lovely day. Alex then asked Mikeyoung Lucas had enjoyed his dunking in the holy water when he was christened. And Mike revealed: “He did actually. I took him swimming in the morning, I think I readied him for it, he was quite looking forward to it.” The Queen attended the christening ceremony on Sunday after she pulled out of a string of public events in recent weeks.

It is thought it was the first time two royal babies were christened together. Eugenie wore a silk white dress featuring embroidered detail, a headband and a blue pendant necklace, while Jack wore a navy suit, crisp white shirt and light blue, patterned tie. Zara opted for a black outfit and dangling pearl earrings as she drove herself to the venue. Mike, , arrived in a separate vehicle dressed in a blazer.  On Monday, a day after the christening, the sad news was revealed that Jack’s father, George, died just days before the ceremony.The -year-old suffered from Covid last year and had been unwell for some time.A royal insider told MailOnline : George had been in hospital with Covid and had not been the same after that.”While another said that it was wonderful for George to have been alive to see nine-month-old August born in February.

She was described as very frightened and nervous when she arrived in July but has started to come out of her shell. However, living in kennels has left her stressed and it is hoped she can find a permanent home before Christmas. In a post on Facebook, Oakwood said: “How has Epiphany been with us  days and still no viewings “Not only is Epiphany absolutely stunning but she has a larger than le personality and is a true bundle of fun! She who loves running around and playing with toys, she also enjoys a fuss once she knows you. She has lots of potential and is a beautul dog. Epiphany needs an owner with a lot of time and patience to help her build up her confidence with people and certain other dogs. The post continued: Epiphany is too nervous to be placed with younger children and needs a mature home. She can be selective about her doggy friends so would be best with a very calm male that will not pester her. She does enjoy the company of other dogs and could live with a male dog and children  years and over. Epiphany will need to live in a home with ft secure fencing and someone who can supervise her in the garden as she has been known to make escape attempts.If youaposre interested in rehoming Epiphany, or any other dogs in Oakwoodaposs care, visit their website.

Yet, some people are worried that with gradual rising cases, ato restrictions could be possible in similar circumstances to last year.An increase in cases around Europe has also led to fears surrounding tighter rules in the UK. Austria went into a -day lockdown on Monday and German chancellor Angela Merkel admitted the country was suffering amid a fourth wave with around , cases every day.While cases are high, the UK did not have such an extensive vaccination programme when it entered lockdown restrictions around this time last year.But what would a Christmas lockdown look like, and is it actually on the cards  Will there be a lockdown at Christmas  There is unlikely to be a lockdown at Christmas from what government guidance and ministers have said. Though officially not ruling anything out, meaning that it is indeed possible, the government would be extremely unwilling to re-enter a lockdown face due to the nature of the restrictions. Bars and restaurants would have to be shut, causing a potential crisis in the hospitality sector with finances having suffered in the past year.  The economy would take a hit too and these are dferent circumstances from last year as we have a vaccine. People are currently being encouraged to take up their booster jab. Scientists are currently not necessarily backing a full lockdown either. Epidemiologist Nigel Ferguson, whose modelling helped the first lockdown in place last year, said: I think it is unlikely we will get anything close to what we had last year, that catastrophic winter wave.We might see slow increases as we did in October, for instance, but not anything as rapid as we saw last year, he told BBC Radio ’s Today programme.How many cases would there need to be before a lockdown is enforced  Currently, there is no plan for a full lockdown and no set figure in place for the UK to enforce a full lockdown.However, the governmentaposs contingency Covid Plan B has not been completely ruled out, although health secretary Sajid Javid has been keen to play down rumours of it.It would depend on a signicant rise in cases, perhaps even a disastrous one.  Last month, Javid told LBC: Itaposs getting darker, we can see itaposs getting colder, we will spend more time indoors, and so we should think about hand hygiene, about getting tested regularly, especiallyyouaposre going to meet your more vulnerable... perhaps an elderly relative or someone - sowe can do all that, Iaposm sure that weaposre going to have a great Christmas.A lockdown would depend more so onthe NHS is becoming overwhelmed. Organisations like doctors’ and NHS groups have argued the health service is close to breaking point due to the backlog of elective care.Why hasnapost Boris Johnson introduced a lockdown already The prime minister, Boris Johnson, said he could see nothing in the data that suggested the country needs to switch to plan B measures.Of the rise in cases on mainland Europe, he said: We don’t yet know the extent to which this new wave will wash up on our shores, but history shows we cannot afford to be complacent.  Plan B measures should, in theory, help bring cases in down, which are expected to go up in the winter as it is darker and colder. This means people tend to spend more time with each other indoors, rather than out and about, which would increase chances of the virus spreading. Under the measures, masks would become compulsory in indoor public spaces , and mandatory vaccine passports would be introduced in England for nightclubs and indoor settings with  or more people. Currently, the government seem confident that the rollout of the booster jab will help combat any surge in cases and prevent plan B measures.

Charles’ romance with Camilla during his marriage to Diana has been part of royal gossip for decades and that his first love was never the Princess of Wales who was forced to suffer in silence for much of the time.It is a version that was also pushed by the Netflix series The Crown where he was seen heading off to meet up with Camilla and Diana was left crying at home.But this take on the marriage has been disputed by a former protection officer who said that Diana first had other love interests. Allan Peters has claimed that Charles began his romance with Camilla again after he found out that Diana was having an affair with another protection officer, the late Barry Mannakee.  Peters also said that he was the one to tell Charles of Diana’s relationship with Mannakee. The popular perception is that the Prince of Wales was straying all the way through his marriage — and that is definitely, unequivocally, not the case, Peters told CNN. The first person that strayed was the Princess. He went back to see Mrs Parker Bowles after he learned about her affair with Mannakee. Diana’s affair with Mannakee is believed to have started in  during a fishing trip to Balmoral. Then a year later he was moved to the Diplomatic Protection Squad where he died aged  in a crash. The version from Peters that Diana strayed first was also claimed by Jonathan Dimbleby in his authorised biography of Charles published in . Peters told CNN: I started to notice her behaviour was unusual whenever we were anywhere near Mannakee, so I decided to talk to her about it. For the first  minutes, she categorically denied it. But then she told me exactly what was going on: she was having some sort of relationship with Mannakee. He said that Charles asked him why Diana was acting dferently, and Peters told CNN that he replied that he had better speak to her about it. “Well, I’ve tried all that, and the only thing that seems to be upsetting her is that Barry Mannakee is going back to unorm. And,she’s that upset, Barry can stay, Peters claims Charles told him. At that stage, I was forced to say: aposWell, Sir,he stays, then I’m afraid I’ll have to leave.apos And, I think, at that point the penny dropped. He was utterly shocked and was clearly very upset.

In recent years, there has been a string of fictionalised TV shows and films about the Royal Family ranging from The Crown on Netflix to Princess Diana movie Spencer. It’s never been confirmedthe likes of the Queen or Kate Middleton have actually sat down in front of their TVs to watch these dramas. But according to Ken Wharfe, a former royal protection officer who worked for Princess Diana from  to , the royals do indeed love to watch these types of TV shows and movies.He told OK! : The royals love that stuff. They will watch it and they have no fear of that. They’re watching it to see how true it is or how untrue it is.However, some of these shows, especially The Crown have recently come under fire, with their historical accuracy called into question. And Ken added: Peter Morgan [creator of The Crown] has said himself that this isn’t a documentary of truthful facts. Some of it is truthful and some of it has a license to draw people in.

But one thing’s for certain, Diana didn’t roller skate around Buckingham Palace.” The Crown season five will be released on Netflix in  with filming for it currently underway.The new episodes will focus on the royals during the s - one of their most turbulent times in recent history.The early s saw the breakdown of the marriages of Prince Charles and Diana as well as Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson.There was also a devastating fire at Windsor Castle in , which the Queen dubbed her annus horribilis. Later in the decade, Diana gave her famous BBC Panorama interview, where she talked about Charlesaposs relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles.And in , she tragically died aged  following a car crash, leaving the world completely heartbroken.Season five of the show will see wholesale changes to The Crown cast with the role of the Queen falling to BAFTA winner Imelda Staunton, who takes over from Olivia Colman.The Two Popes star Johnathan Pryce will portray Prince Philip and is taking over from Tobias Menzies. Meanwhile, the coveted role of Princess Diana has been given to Elizabeth Debicki, who takes the part from previous actress Emma Corrin. However, speaking to True Royalty TVaposs The Royal Beat, royal historian Anne Whitelock said the new season of the show might not be something the royals want to watch when it is released. She said: If the Royal Family have found The Crown uncomfortable viewing up until now, this season is not going to give them any respite.  However, Prince Harry confessed earlier this year he has watched the show - and says it is more accurate than people think.During an interview with James Corden, he explained it is loosely based on the truth. He added: They donapost pretend to be news, itaposs fictional but itaposs loosely based on the truth. Of course itaposs not strictly accurate, but loosely, it gives you a rough idea about what that lestyle, what the pressures of putting duty and service above family and everything , what can come from that. I am way more comfortable with The Crown than I am seeing the stories written about my family, or my we or myself.

Faye Wood, a healthcare assistant at the Queenaposs Medical Centre, told of her shock when she spotted a caterpillar crawling live in her sandwich bought from a Sainsburyaposs store. The -year-old from Mapperley said it happened when she went to her local store in Ransom Road to grab a quick snack after finishing her sht. Ms Wood said she went for a Ploughmanaposs sandwich which she picked from the reduced section at around pm before continuing her journey.She said she had half of the sandwich shortly after she arrived home, and then left the other half in the fridge, Nottinghamshire Live reports. It was not until  minutes later when she reached to the remaining half in the packaging that she noticed the shocking discovery. Ms Wood added: My two-year-old wanted to taste it so I grabbed it from the fridge and when I saw it I started heaving - I was physically sick. It was a big caterpillar crawling out of the sandwich and out of the packaging. I never had a problem before so it was a shock for sure. The angry customer has vowed to never buy sandwiches from supermarkets ever again following the incident. She added: When you have been at work all day and you get back at  you do not really want to cook, you just want a snack or something.

She added: I am not bothered about the money really because it was only p. It is more about making people aware that this is happening and it cannot happen again. We just want them to make sure that everything is checked and washed properly. However I do expect some kind of compensation as well.

Staff at the Etruria Road supermarket in Hanley, Stoke, which is due to shut in , were handed flyers advertising two Christmas parties running from midday to pm and .pm to .pm on  December. The flyer states: The sittings are an hour long. Whatever time you use over your break you will need to either make up or have as unpaid. Please inform us of your decision. As workers only get  minutes as a break, they must either work longer to cover the hour-long Christmas party or lose money. Shoppers and former Sainsbury’s employees said the decision by the “Scrooge” like bosses was “ludicrous”. One former worker said: This is a pretty shabby way to treat people who are about to lose their jobs.” Businesswoman Lynn Shemirani, , of Tittensor, told StokeOnTrent Live : “It’s a bit harsh. It’s going back to Scrooge with that sort of behaviour.“At Christmas time they should show a bit of goodwill, especially after working through the pandemic as front-line workers.” Retired John Hannon, , said: It’s ridiculous. The staff are pretty decent in here and they’ve been loyal to the company. I think the company ought to show them a bit of loyalty.” Chloe Edwards, , of Bucknall, added: “It’s just not fair. You’re a number - not a person.” Sainsbury’s has been contacted for comment but the store has since reportedly changed its policy.  According to the Sun, a spokesperson for Sainsburyaposs said: We have listened to our colleagues’ feedback and will be updating the plans at our Hanley store to ensure all colleagues can enjoy their Christmas celebrations during their break.Last month, the boss of Sainsburyaposs warned that shoppers may have less choice when doing their food shopping over the festive period.In an open letter to customers, Sainsburyaposs chief executive Simon Roberts said: I’m writing to let you know what we’re doing at Sainsbury’s to help you plan and manage your Christmas budget. I also want to reassure you that there will be plenty of food and that we are confident that eventhe exact product you are looking for isn’t available, there will be a good alternative.

Mum-of-two Alana Norman, , lived in a two-bedroom flat in Arnold, Nottingham and was part of the Mother and Baby Unit. The accommodation was provided by Framework and says she paid £, per month for the property.Framework has said they addressed Alanaaposs concerns within two weeks of being notied and did not receive any further correspondence, NottinghamshireLive reports. In , Alana applied to move into the flat through Framework for accommodation when she was a single mum at  and still lived with her own mother and two siblings.  Alana says she was excited to move into her own place but says she had an awful experience and wanted to leave within a month of living there. She said: The whole time I lived there, there was a lot of mould - I raised this on a number of occasions and some damp traps were brought round, and that was it. The mould made me and my first child very ill - I was pregnant and had my second child towards the end of living there too. My first daughter was one-and-a-half years old when we moved in, and some of the sentimental stuff has been ruined by the mould, I have nothing left of her being a baby.  All the bedroom furniture had mould on it, so I got rid of it to be told I was in breach of tenancy as I was told the furniture could have gone somewhere . Her close friend Saskia King, , who also lived in the same block of flats at the same time said she saw them become ill because of the mould. However, Alana did not go to a doctor about the issue. Alana and her family moved out in March .  Dave Newmarch, Frameworkaposs Corporate Services Director, said: Alana made us aware of damp and mould in her bathroom early in January . We responded, undertook treatment, and completed the work within a fortnight - well within our timescales for such work. We have no record of any further correspondence relating to this. We take all safeguarding reports seriously and are confident that any matter that was raised such as the one described would have been addressed at the time.

Essex Fire Service dog handler Graham Currie came to the rescue after the Dogs Trust in Loughborough appealed for someone to adopt the pooch. The expert admitted he was initially worried as labradors can be greedy, and offered to take Bailey on a six-week trial initially. But the pair have got on well, with Graham dubbing the -month-old pooch one of the most natural search dogs Iaposve ever seen. Louise Crawford, the animal welfare scheme coordinator at the charity, united the pair after putting out an appeal to rescue services, to askanyone was looking for a new search dog.  Mr Currie said he had been looking for just under a year when he heard about Bailey. He said: After testing Baileyaposs drive for a tennis ball and checking he had no aggression towards other dogs or people, I offered to take him on a six-week trial. The biggest thing was getting him in the van because he associated it with being taken to a compound, but within  hours he was taught to associate it with fun. By the third day, I was % sure he was the one. In the vehicle barn, there was a rugby ball on a ledge above the gym weights and he wouldnapost give up until he got it – thataposs the kind of determination we are looking for in a search dog. I was reluctant to take a labrador as they can be greedy and distracted with food, and I was looking for a springer, cocker or sprocker spaniel bitch because Iaposve found they are less stubborn and easier to train. Bailey has got that drive though and heaposs not greedy, heaposd take a ball over a bowl of food every time. Graham says Bailey, who is  months to two years old, has excelled at search and rescue activities. He has completed seven days of UKISAR training in buildings and rubble piles with police and national assessors. Graham said: To start with, we were hiding tennis balls to seehe would find them without being scared of the rubble. He is one of the most natural search dogs Iaposve ever seen - heaposs like a mountain goat! Nothing fazes him, he has no fears or phobias. The Mirror is committed to more hopeful news.

He was described as unruly, untrainable, unsociable, rude and stubborn. But a dog that cost us £ has turned out to be the most incredible creature. It usually takes  months to three years to train a dog but Bailey, whose nicknames are Beast from the East and the Polar Bear, because of his size, could be on the run as early as next April. Graham, who is based at ECFRS’s USAR site in Lexden, Colchester, added: Weaposve landed on our feet with Bailey – and so has he, because he has a lovely home now.

Market stalls, brass bands, a pipe band, the Ayrshire Fiddle Orchestra and Santa were the main features and it had been hoped the event would bring some much-needed cheer to the community.  However, organisers admitted defeat in their bid to stage it. In a statement, the Prestwick Business Associationsaid: “It is with the heaviest of hearts that the PBA has been faced with having to take a hard decision to cancel the “Prestwick Lights Up Christmas” events planned for Sunday, November . “We have faced many obstacles which have been placed in front of us by South Ayrshire Council and the Ayrshire Roads Alliance which we have tried to overcome at every turn. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.“But we have learned that Police Scotland have also objected to the Market on the grounds that the Market would cause congestion along the Main Street and also the increased security level across the UK. “It seems South Ayrshire Council just do not want anyone having a Christmas event. “We are sorry that, once again, in spite of our best endeavours, there will be no light up at Christmas or the Christmas Market.” Prestwick councillor Hugh Hunter speculates the organisers, retailers and public have been dealt a raw deal. He told AyrshireLive: “It is very disappointing that it has come to this. This is one of the most important community events in Prestwick for both local businesses and the public. “The event was organised with the safety of the public at the front and centre of all planning. “The police and council were invited to participate in the early planning of the event and having the rug pulled from under it at the last minute are hugely disappointing. Ayrshire Live contacted Police Scotland for a comment but they declined. However, it’s understood that during discussions with the local authority, they raised safety concerns relating to the use of Main Street as it is the main route in and out of town. A council spokesperson cited the recent change in status in the terrorist threat level as one of their main concerns – along with the possibility of Covid transmissions. The spokesperson said: “The safety of the public is always our top priority. “In light of the ongoing Covid- situation and recent changes to the terrorist threat level, we have been in discussions with event organisers about their safety measures. Police Scotland also had safety concerns about the proposed Prestwick Christmas Market.” It comes as the Christmas markets in Bath, Leeds, Portsmouth and Glasgow George Square were already cancelled this year.In Bath, organisers cited Covid concerns and recruitment issues caused by Brexit meant it could not be safely managed.In Glasglow, a Christmas market will still be in St Enoch’s Square this year.

As such many may find themselves taking it out on the doctoraposs receptionist or assuming they are being rude when they are actually just really busy.A former doctoraposs receptionist has recently lted the lid on what itaposs really like to work in this role and shared some of the biggest mistakes patients can make. Speaking to Fabulous, Richard Kellow, who now works as a hypnotherapist at Kellow Hypnotherapy, told how the job is non-stop all day and the receptionist does so much more than just answering the phones.G et the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.He said: It was non-stop from the moment we switched on the phones in the morning. As well as booking appointments, weaposd type referral letters from doctors to specialists and do the filing. Weaposd also liaise with the couriers who collected the blood and urine samples taken, and then weaposd process prescriptions and have to keep the waiting room tidy. Theyaposd also have to deal with patients demanding to see the doctor quicker and assuming the receptionist was making them wait just for fun. Sometimes people felt that we just didn’t want them to see the doctor - asit was our choice when they would get medical attention or maybe we were just making them wait for the fun of it, Richard recalled. In reality, it would make our le so much easierwe could get everyone through as quickly and smoothly as possible. He went on to say how dealing with rude patients was the most dficult part of the job, as when people get stressed they often refuse to listen to logic or reason. As such people often committed some major faux pas towards the receptionists - including making personal comments about their image, booking appointments and then not turning up and making demands to see a doctor. These are the biggest mistakes a patient can make according to Richard, as well as assuming the receptionist is being rude, when really they are just doing their job. Remember that they are there to help and not hinder you, he added. Sometimes it’s easier for us to put our head down and get on with the job. It doesn’t mean we are ignoring you or being rude, it’s just quicker for us to get on and get you seen.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Moscow’s forces are being equipped with deadly “flame-thrower” rockets capable for sending a ball of fire four miles ahead of troops to devastate defending forces. On Wednesday Shoigu told Russian military leaders their top priority must now be: “Increasing their combat effectiveness, maintaining the combat readiness of nuclear forces and strengthening the potential of non-nuclear deterrent forces.”  He told them this was in retaliation for “growing NATO activity near the Russian borders,” in recent weeks, referring to claims US long-range bombers had buzzed the country’s borders. And he warned Russia will react by equipping the military with “high precision weapons, effective means of destruction, modern weapons and equipment.” It is believed Russia has put NATO and Ukraine commanders on a state of near-permanent high-alert regarding the possibility of an invasion deliberately.  This was to both lessen the impact of an actual invasion, as it has been long-expected, and also to induce a sense of repetition so he can take them by surprise when orhe issues the order to attack. In  his troops annexed Crimea in a lightning operation with barely a shot fired, having paved the way with anti-west propaganda for several years. This meant locals were less angered and in many case openly towards the presence of Russian forces when they arrived.  During daily fighting along the Ukraine border with Russia since  around , people are thought to have been killed. It is believed Russian forces are keen to push back the front line further into Ukraine to garner nationalist support back home and strike a decisive victory for local Moscow-backed separatists. Another theory of Putin’s battle-plan is that he will risk all by sending troops in a pincer movement deep into Ukraine by rolling in from Crimea and Belarus. One Russia analyst told the Daily Mirror: “The terrying picture now emerging, is that in mid-winter mass Russian forces would invade Ukraine through Belarus in the north and up through Crimea in the south, heading towards the capital Kiev, an encirclement operation, splitting the country in two.”  The expert said the timing of mid-December for an attack would mean the numerous waterways in central Ukraine would be frozen over. This would mean military bridges would not have to be erected and an advance could proceed at high speed. By sealing a military deal with neighbouring Belarus Russian President Vladimir Putin has ensured his troops can access Ukraine via Belarus. It is believed the Kremlin’s war in eastern Ukraine is costing Russia billions of pounds every year, whilst the Russian economy has tanked in the past year. Western sanctions against Moscow have crippled its economy.

Star failed to clear the danger from a cross and the unfortunate Coll McCallum erted into his own net past Leon Murphy.The Arthurlie equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when winger Sean Ross cut inside before unleashing a spectacular effort into the top corner.The hosts would have been expected to go on and win the game from here but the Star defence remained well-organised and resolute and a fine goalkeeping performance from Leon Murphy ensured the Lochgilphead side ed home with a well-earned point.Star put their unbeaten league record on the line on Saturday November  when they welcome fellow Argyll side Cardross to the Joint Campus G.

It forms part of a wider poundm investment into neurodegenerative diseases which devastate so many families across the Borders.ldquoI am proud to have played a part in pushing for this investment. However, it is the tireless campaigning of Doddie Weir who has raised the profile of this awful disease and raised millions of pounds in the process through his charity that has made this all possible.ldquoHis bravery and determination in the face of adversity has been awe inspiring when he could have so easily given up.ldquoThe UK is a global leader in medical research and this investment will keep our brightest and best scientists at the forefront of the battle to find a cure."},{"url":null,"title":"scott-brash-statue-light-plans-sculpture-dimmed","story":"PLANS to light up the sculpture of Olympic showjumper Scott Brash have been dimmed down.Peebles Community Council had hoped to embark on a project with the voluntary group, Bonnie Peebles, to illuminate the le-size statue of the gold medallist.But the light bulb idea, which was first discussed by community councillors last month, has hit a hurdle.Addressing last weekrsquos meeting of the community council, secretary Anne Snoddy said: ldquoYou will recall that it was Bonnie Peebles who had the idea to erect a sculpture of Scott Brash on Hello Sanctos.

Letrsquos look at the dferent stages in the le of both types of trees.Real treesThe growing time for real trees is approximately - years to reach the most popular size of  ft . During that time, they provide habitat for wildle, capture carbon from the atmosphere, stabilise ground that is often unsuitable for other uses and reduce water run-off that can cause erosion.With estimated sales of in excess of seven million real trees sold in the UK every year, itrsquos clear that forestry also provides much-needed rural employment.You donrsquot need to worry about deforestation either: Christmas trees are a renewable resource, generally grown as a crop with up to  trees being planted for every two-metre tree that is cut down, ensuring that the environmental benefits of woodland are maintained and potentially even improved.As the seedling grows into a tree, itrsquos clear that real trees make positive benefits to our environment but once that tree leaves the forest or the nursery, your choices begin to matter.How can you help the environment  The first step is easy: buy a Scottish-grown tree from a local business and you minimise the carbon miles from the forest to your home.Most reputable garden centres in the area should be able to offer you a Scottish-grown tree, but other outlets may not. We recommend that you check the source before you buy!But itrsquos what happens to the tree after Christmas where you can make a real dference. Research shows that the way in which the tree is disposed of has considerably dferent environment effects.At one end of the spectrum, landfill is the worst possible solution for disposing of your Christmas tree, since decomposition and the release of methane negatively impact on the environment. Surprisingly, even burning the tree is preferable to landfill as that reduces potential emissions by over  per cent.At the other end of the spectrum, one of the most environmentally friendly solutions is to reuse the tree by chipping it for mulch or to compost it.Chipping simply accelerates the plant cycle that would occur naturally on the forest floor.This non-chemical process helps the tree break down more quickly than it otherwise would in the forest, naturally ing fibre and nutrients to the soil.Local authorities often offer a collect and chip service, and East Lothian Council have done so for a number of years now.Articial treesArticial trees, it is argued, are environmentally friendly because they can be re-used year after year and, for many, itrsquos the ideal solution for reasons of practicality and convenience. In fact, the key to determining whether an articial or a real tree is more environmentally friendly lies in the number of times you use the articial tree. Letrsquos consider the factors.Most articial trees are manufactured in China using plastic, PVC and metal, and these are then shipped to consumers around the world.The materials used in production and the global shipping distances involved in delivery combine to result in a considerable negative environmental impact from articial trees.And whilst the tree can be reused year after year, there still remains the problem of disposal at the end of its le articial trees are not recyclable and inevitably end up in landfill.According to the Carbon Trust, the carbon footprints for a m tree are:l Articial tree ndash kgl Real tree to landfill ndash kgl Real tree, chipped ndash .kg.Therefore, their advice is that you need to re-use your articial tree more than  times to equal the carbon footprint of a real tree that is responsibly disposed of. Many articial trees are not built to last that long and soyou decide that an articial tree is best for your lestyle, try to buy one that genuinely can be reused over at least  years.In conclusionCaring for our environment is a complex matter, andit only involved a single issue ndash such as the carbon footprint figures above ndash decisions would be easy. But itrsquos rarely that simple you only need to think about the many iables mentioned in this article to understand the complexity of the decisions we all have to make.We hope that this article offers you a brief overview that will help you decide which type of tree is best for you.As always, our plant team are happy to discuss the options with you and help you decide what tree ndash real or articial ndash is best for you.Theyrsquore also able to explain how you can get the very best from your tree and enjoy it throughout the Christmas

More than  people and organisations contributed to the Toolkit, whose development was supported by the Scottish Government.And Stromness will be among the communities highlighted as a prime example of success as the toolkit is discussed at the Scotland’s Towns Conference on Friday, November .The toolkit highlights how more than a decade of investment has helped revitalise the area, including the new £m Copland’s dock, the Orkney Research and Innovation Campus, and the creation of a new arts centre.Explaining the reasons for the community’s success, town planner Nick Wright, who developed the toolkit for STP and will highlight Stromness at the conference, said: “Everyone pulls together, making the most of every opportunity.“This is an ambitious community where people aren’t afraid to muck in and make things happen — with strong political will and a clear plan of modernising Stromness while maintaining its historical elegance.”That work includes the  year multi-million pound investments secured from the Lottery and Historic Environment Scotland to restore and modernise the town centre. Working with local landowners and organisations, these schemes restored  vacant or dilapidated historic buildings, improved shops, created new business spaces, and revitalised the town’s streets and spaces.Nick Wright added: “This toolkit is about sharing that wealth of experience from across the country — showing that you can do it because it’s been done before. It’s about how to make things happen — a one-stop-shop on how to make towns the best they can be.”While inspiring communities and groups, it is also hoped that the toolkit will prove useful for local authority officials working in planning, community development, leisure, transport and the economy when considering developments in their region, as well as for politicians at every level.For more information, go to www.towntoolkit.scot.

It is important that those who are convincedcan demonstrate.#Addressing the potential for far-reaching consequences to impact people across the world, she said: #We are cushioned now to some extent, although people in the UK have had to suffer from flooding, wildfires, and drought.“Much of our food comes from overseas, andpeople will have to migrate and find somewhere  to live # so people will be moving around the world, so places that are nice and comfortable now might then receive other people.#A huge element of this issue is about all the youngsters and children # the more carbon we put into the atmosphere, the more trouble that they will have to face, meaning there will be less chance for them to turn the situation around.#This issue is critically important.”On Friday th November, as the conference is expected to be closing, there will be a candlelight vigil in Somerled Square in Portree from .-pm.Ms MacLennan added: “There is a sense that people want to show solidarity with what#s happening at COP in Glasgow, and they want to be able to express their concerns.#Holding it in Portree makes it more accessible for people in the north of the island, because Saturday#s march over the bridge is a long way for people further north to travel to be involved, especiallyit is a dreadful day.#For those unable to attend Saturday#s march over the bridge, everyone is of course welcome to walk over the bridge with signage at any point at the weekend.“It might be good for people to be wandering over the bridge to and fro at dferent times to help convey the message.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Uist-beach-Floraidh-Forrest.jpg","title":"climate change and the hebrides the rising sea and an eerily prophetic","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineFor those acquainted with Gaelic oral lore, it cannot be denied that there is something intensely perceptive, and eerily prophetic, about the traditions tied to the steady ingress of the sea.Since time immemorial, the mental record-keeping of a coastal people has documented and predicted the near imperceptible, yet near constant, rise of the waters since the Ice Age. century.In Tobar an Dualchais, there are numerous recordings illustrating similar examples where the sea has conquered the land.In one example from , Dòmhnall MacCuinn and Dòmhnall Ailean MacCuinn were recorded describing old domestic ruins seen at extreme low tides over a mile from the shore in An t-Ìochdar .These homesteads must have once been on dry land, they surmise.In Tracks   , the collector Dòmhnall Eairdsidh Dòmhnallach of the School of Scottish Studies asks Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson about submerged places near An t-Ìochdar, including Sgeir na h-Àtha – The Skerry of the Barn.Similar shore names which incorporate terrestrial features dot the seascape of Uist and evidence the widely held belief that the machair once stretched much further into the west.Anxieties tied to coastal le were not only informed by past experience and day-to-day observation they also manested themselves in people’s visions of the future.There is a prophecy, for example, retold by Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson in Track . It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CoGCGraduation_AlainaMaclennan_PrizeWinner-2-scaled.jpg","title":"skye graduate wins college","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe HND Sports Coaching graduate celebrated at the college’s ceremony held on Mondayin the city’s Royal Concert Hall. Alaina, who attended Plockton High School, and lives in Kyleakin, was surprised and delighted to win the prize, saying: #I am happy that my hard work during my time at college, and through the challenges of adapting to remote learning due to Covid-, have paid off.  “City of Glasgow College gave me the good foundation I needed to build and develop my future career in sports coaching.

However, the service and sacrice of all those who fought in the First World War continues to be remembered,” Sir Jeffrey said.“There is also a growing recognition that those who fought came from dferent backgrounds, but were in the trenches with a united goal. The war truly is part of our shared history and it is fitting that so many have travelled from Northern Ireland to mark the centenary of the tower.”Sir Jeffrey also paid tribute to the Somme Association for ensuring the Ulster Tower and Thiepval Wood are maintained to commemorate the past and keep those stories alive for future generations.

Thank you to Habitat and to the people of Ballymena for welcoming us and allowing us the opportunity to serve vulnerable families here in Northern Ireland.”ReStore Manager Isobel Kerr added: “Alejandro and Pedro came to ReStore Ballymena through the European Solidarity Corps. The programme has been immensely positive for Habitat, and for the communities we serve through our Habitat ReStores. Both Alejandro and Pedro have become a huge part of both ReStore and the community in Ballymena. We are so thankful for the hard work and dedication they have brought to their time volunteering and wish them all the best for the future.” Not only have they been volunteering with the charity, they have also supported a local project in the borough by planting over  trees through the local ‘Friends of ECOS’ group, contributing to Council’s zero-carbon emission pathway and increasing the bioersity of the area. Pedro also has another talent, having been actively involved in youth football in Ballykeel.Mayor, Councillor William McCaughey, said: “It has been a real pleasure to meet Pedro and Alejandro, to hear their stories and how they’ve come to volunteer in Ballymena.

Ms Hargey has said on several occasions she is committed to the reversal of social security service privatisation and ato in-house health assessments.SDLP communities spokesperson Mark H Durkan said he has been clear for years that in my view that Capita should not receive one penny more of taxpayer’s money for their administration of the Personal Independence Paymentsscheme.It is particularly galling to learn that they will now receive another £.m of public money over the next two years, he said.“We have repeatedly seen how the service offered by Capita not does provide value for money,” he said, adding that the y appeals process “leaves us with an even bigger bill to pay”.More signicantly this company leaves applicants traumatised due to the degrading and humiliating experiences they are subjected to and this should not have been allowed to continue,” he said.“This signicant amount of money could have been used to help deal with one of the many crises facing our people or gone towards reforming the PIP system or creating a way of evaluating those in receipt of welfare in a fair and humane way.Our Executive needs to cut its ties with Capita once and for all and stop rewarding these companies for their failure to adequately do their jobs. Minister Hargey also needs to provide clarity on her pledge to bring the assessment process in-house.DfC said: “To ensure value for money for the taxpayer, the Department for Communities has robust contract management arrangements in place.”Earlier this month, Capita apologised for any hurt caused to those going through the PIP process. Since , the firm has carried out around , assessments in Northern Ireland.Read MorePIP assessment firm Capita apologises for any hurt caused to applicantsCapita managing director Anthony King told MLAs on Stormont#s Communities Committee that the majority of PIP applicants have a high quality and empathetic experience, but he admitted this is not always the case.Often when things go wrong we can correct them very quickly, but in the small number of cases when things go wrong they can have very serious consequences for people and their families, he said.Obviously the more serious cases I am fully aware of and they can be deeply, deeply upsetting. I just want to take the opportunity today, in public, to say to anybody that has had a poor experience with Capita and been let down, that we are sorry. We do aspire to very high standards and we don#t always meet them we would like to apologise to those we have let down.Related topicsMark H.

No hunting is allowed on Northern Irish trust land.When the National Trust suspended licences a year ago, there was just one trail hunting licence.

The Moneyneena woman, along with her husband Chris and young son Oisin, had just moved into their new home in Portstewart weeks before lockdown hit in March . The  year-old was on maternity leave at the time and toyed with the idea of releasing her own music. After uploading one of her songs onto her social media account, Kate was spurred on to keep writing following a positive reaction to her music. “I have been writing songs since I was  but I just never really got the chance to go down this road properly,” explained Kate, who is better known in Ballinascreen as Catherine Kennedy. “It really all happened during lockdown and maternity leave. The whole world shut down so I kind of found myself needing a creative outlet so I went down this path and started off with one single and it turned into the whole album.” Growing up in rural County Derry, Kate was inspired by the musical talent all around her. “Ive loved music as long as I remember. Draperstown is a great hub for music,” the former St Eoghans Moneyneena and St Patricks Maghera student said. “The likes of Maurice Regan and Glasgowbury brought music into the town. I actually live a mile from Glasgowbury so Ive always looked up to the scene. “Ive worked in Danny Ottersons music shop in Maghera and I worked in the Empire Music Hall as well when I was younger so I always had lots of music around me.” Even though she has been singing at wedding ceremonies and other events in local churches since the age of , with some encouragement from her older brother, Kate decided to explore songwriting. “My brother bought me a guitar for my seventeenth birthday and suggested I maybe try and write some of my own songs, so thats when it all started and it was always a nice distraction from doing A-levels,” she said. Fast forward  years and Kate has just released her second single Wrong Side of the Town from her upcoming debut album Fallen from Grace, due for release in the New Year. The new single, which features the unmistakable vocals of Cormac Neeson, lead singer of The Answer and successful solo artist. Despite the new song only being released five days earlier, Hotpress announced it as its track of the day on Wednesday. On Friday night past, Kate and Cormac performed the song live for the first time at an In the Round night of music with Sound of Belfast in the Empire Music Hall. The gig was one which Kate had been dreaming about for some time. “I used to glass collect thereand I used to look up at that stage and listen to all the amazing music so its a bit of a dream that this is happening,” said Kate. “Im a really big fan of Cormacs. He was one of the acts that stood out to me when I worked in the Empire. He was playing in his band The Answer and I had to rub my eyes to check it wasnt Robert Plant. He has just one of the best voices in the industry, I think. “I worked with Mojo Furys frontman, Michael Mormecha for the album and I told him that I would love Cormac to sing on this song and he just asked him and sent him the song and he said he was up for it. “Its really funny, a year before this all came about, I was at a gig and Cormac was playing at it. I said to my husband Chris how cool would he be on Wrong Side of the Town  I had the song written and had this all in my head and its happened. Its pretty cool how it worked out. “This is one of my favourite songs to date. I love the blues rock sound we have achieved using inspirations from some Deep South Americana  Blues music and some soundtracks I love, such as True Detective and Sons of Anarchy. “Wrong Side of the Town explores the often fine and blurry line that can exist between having a really great time, and that of self destruction. The song aims to look at this from ious angles.” Kate, who recently became a mum for the second time to baby Tomas, now three months-old, admits that her music doesnt fit neatly into any category and she is heavily influenced by a iety of artists. “I love a big range of music but Dolores ORiordan of The Cranberries is one of my icons. I also like Amy Winehouse. Theres also a big American theme running through my music,” she continued. “I call it alternative country rock – the closest thing to it would be Sheryl Crowe - it doesnt fit neatly into any category.” So, with her newest single receiving rave reviews and an album launch just around the corner, Kate says she is looking forward to more live performances and is even thinking about her next project. “Ive been delighted with the reaction to the singles – Wrong Side of the Town and Street Lamps - I got really great support for it and Im just looking forward to getting the whole album out and hopefully there will be a nice celebration for it. “Im also looking forward to being able to perform to a live audience. Ive played live over Zoom through a group called Mothers in Music with the Oh Yeah Music Centre who have been really supportive. “Charlene Hegarty from Maghera is the talent development officer with the Oh Yeah Music Centre and she has been helping us Mothers in Music as a group. Its been lovely to have her support. “Theres just something very special about playing live in front of real people. Its so dferent compared to performing over Zoom – its like night and day. Zoom was brilliant for the times that were in it but live music is where its at. Theres just something about the atmosphere and having people in the room at the same time. “Thinking about the future, I love Irish traditional music as well so Im kind of thinking along those lines for the next project maybe. Its something a bit dferent.” Kate says she enjoys making the trip home to Moneyneena once or twice a month and says she is delighted with the support she has received from locals. “I love Moneyneena. Its a gorgeous part of the world. I am delighted to still be living in County Derry, so Im not too far away. “Ive been really taken aback by how supportive people have been. Ive had really nice support and I couldnt be more grateful for their support and encouragement but I dont take anything for granted. Im just going to enjoy it,” she added.

Creator and writer of Derry Girls, Lisa McGee, saw the social media campaign and said yes to his request. Eamonn was born with cerebral palsy which affects his movement and speech. The -year-oldgraduated from his drama course in summer this year and wants to follow his dreams to be a writer and actor. Speaking to the BBC, Eamonn said: I want to inspire people to chase their dreams to write and act. I think its great to show that some things are possible evenyou have a disability. I had a massive smile on my face. His friend Sean added: For Eamonn to have a degree and have cerebral palsy is a massive deal for him and his family. Hes a massive Derry Girls fan so we decided to push hard to get on it. Eamonn messaged the cast directly and I tried whatever influence I have on Twitter to contact Lisa McGee too. It might be a small thing to be an extra in the cast but this was a massive opportunity for Eamonn. We cant say anything about the scene really, but Eamonn was in a pretty prominent position so hopefully he will be seen. Filming of season three of Derry Girls is underway in the city after it was postponed due to the COVID- pandemic.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\" * Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo ..detachTo\"  ..detachTo..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A fire broke out in the kitchen of Link  Restaurant yesterday evening Derry NewsFire at Derry restaurant Link  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DerryChristmasPicture Special: Magical procession illuminates Derry’s Christmas lights as thousands line route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way WeatherSnow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  County Derry PostCounty Derry pensioner found guilty of litany of sex offences against ten primary school children overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Shake lsquoNrsquo Frappe forced to close indefinitely after Fitzroyrsquos fireDerry NewsShake ‘N’ Frappe forced to close indefinitely after Fitzroy’s fire overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kate NIcholson from Ballinascreen has fulfilled her dream of recording an album.County Derry PostCounty Derry GP fulfils dream of recording debut album overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\" * Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo ..detachTo\"  ..detachTo..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A fire broke out in the kitchen of Link  Restaurant yesterday evening Derry NewsFire at Derry restaurant Link  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DerryChristmasPicture Special: Magical procession illuminates Derry’s Christmas lights as thousands line route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way WeatherSnow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  County Derry PostCounty Derry pensioner found guilty of litany of sex offences against ten primary school children overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Shake lsquoNrsquo Frappe forced to close indefinitely after Fitzroyrsquos fireDerry NewsShake ‘N’ Frappe forced to close indefinitely after Fitzroy’s fire overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kate NIcholson from Ballinascreen has fulfilled her dream of recording an album.County Derry PostCounty Derry GP fulfils dream of recording debut album overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ieADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\" * Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo ..detachTo\"  ..detachTo..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A fire broke out in the kitchen of Link  Restaurant yesterday evening Derry NewsFire at Derry restaurant Link  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DerryChristmasPicture Special: Magical procession illuminates Derry’s Christmas lights as thousands line route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way WeatherSnow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  County Derry PostCounty Derry pensioner found guilty of litany of sex offences against ten primary school children overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Shake lsquoNrsquo Frappe forced to close indefinitely after Fitzroyrsquos fireDerry NewsShake ‘N’ Frappe forced to close indefinitely after Fitzroy’s fire overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kate NIcholson from Ballinascreen has fulfilled her dream of recording an album.County Derry PostCounty Derry GP fulfils dream of recording debut album overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Cllr Harkin also said that the event would also send a message to Dublin, London and other governments around the world that more pressure must be put upon Israel to end their current policies towards Palestine. He said: “Following a request to the Council, I worked with the charity Medical Aid for Palestine and Derry Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaignand the Guildhall will be lit-up in the colours of the Palestinian flag on November  – the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian people. “Derry and Strabane Council supports the Palestinian struggle for liberation and backs boycott, estment and sanction of the Israeli Apartheid regime. “We encourage people to mark and join actions across Ireland on Monday November  to send a message of solidarity to the people of Palestine and one to the Irish, British, EU and US governments demanding an end of their complicity with Israeli Apartheids carnival of reaction. “We call on all political parties across the island, including those professing support for Palestine, to end engagement with organisations seeking to normalise Israeli apartheid. “Human rights and Israeli apartheid, just as it was in South Africa, is a contradiction in terms. “A state with equal rights for Arabs, Jews, Christians and all who live in historic Palestine is possible, but only through the removal of US imperialism and its backing of Israeli militarism. “November  is a day to celebrate all that is Palestinian, including the struggle over many decades for justice and freedom.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\" * Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo ..detachTo\"  ..detachTo..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A fire broke out in the kitchen of Link  Restaurant yesterday evening Derry NewsFire at Derry restaurant Link  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DerryChristmasPicture Special: Magical procession illuminates Derry’s Christmas lights as thousands line route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way WeatherSnow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Ministers stated that working from home can help reduce the rise of Covid- but stopped short of ordering all employers to facilitate home working. However, Mr Clancy said that this weeks statement from the Executive has heightened concerns and stated that the number of “mixed messages” from Stormont has not provided sufficient clarity for businesses and employers which has made them worry about “being left in the lurch for a second Christmas”. He said: “The latest Executive decisions have done little except raise anxieties among business owners and leaders. “Even though it has been reinforced and reiterated by ministers, the ‘work from homepossible’ guidance has not changed since the start of the pandemic and, as such, this announcement by the Executive is merely tinkering around the edges. However, it has heightened concerns for businesses. “Mixed messaging from separate Executive ministers as well this week is harming business confidence. “We have the Health Minister saying one day that hospitality businesses may be required to close over Christmas, while the next day the First Minister says we are not ‘in a space where we can be looking at closure of businesses’. “These statements are wholly contradictory and do nothing to provide clarity or certainty for businesses at one of the busiest and most important times of the year. “Increased talk by ministers of restrictions or sweeping mitigations are deeply concerning for businesses. However, there has been no talk of financial supports or safeguards in such a scenario. “All this does is raise anxiety levels for small business owners and makes them worry that they’ll be left in the lurch for a second Christmas running. “It’s crucial that the Executive commits to clear messaging over the coming weeks and works together to suppress Covid cases. “We would also encourage shoppers and customers to continue to wear their face masks when out and about this Christmas and take sensible decisions which will keep everyone safe.” Chief Executive of Retail NI, Glyn Roberts warned of a knock-on effect that could hurt the retail sector and stated that the importance of the Executive implementing a support package to traders was “a matter of urgency”. He said: “Whilst we recognise the importance of controlling Covid- community transmission and the part everyone must play, the Executive’s decision to strengthen work-from-home guidance will have a signicant knock-on effect on our local high streets and independent retailers who rely on footfall from office workers.  Chief Executive of Retail NI, Glyn Roberts: If the work-from-home guidance continues, the inevitable loss in trade for our high street retailers will be damaging  “The Christmas period is traditionally one of the busiest periods for many businesses, especially smaller retailers who are the leblood of our towns and cities. “After the severe impact of the pandemic, these businesses need all the support they can get. If the work-from-home guidance continues, the inevitable loss in trade for our high street retailers will be damaging. “Independent traders have been hard-hit in the last  months and are only starting to get back on their feet. It is imperative that the Executive works alongside the retail sector and implements a support package to local traders affected by this decision as a matter of urgency.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\" * Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo ..detachTo\"  ..detachTo..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A fire broke out in the kitchen of Link  Restaurant yesterday evening Derry NewsFire at Derry restaurant Link  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DerryChristmasPicture Special: Magical procession illuminates Derry’s Christmas lights as thousands line route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way WeatherSnow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  County Derry PostCounty Derry pensioner found guilty of litany of sex offences against ten primary school children overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Shake lsquoNrsquo Frappe forced to close indefinitely after Fitzroyrsquos fireDerry NewsShake ‘N’ Frappe forced to close indefinitely after Fitzroy’s fire overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kate NIcholson from Ballinascreen has fulfilled her dream of recording an album.County Derry PostCounty Derry GP fulfils dream of recording debut album overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

It is imperative that the Executive works alongside the retail sector and implements a support package to local traders affected by this decision as a matter of urgency.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\" * Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo ..detachTo\"  ..detachTo..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A fire broke out in the kitchen of Link  Restaurant yesterday evening Derry NewsFire at Derry restaurant Link  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DerryChristmasPicture Special: Magical procession illuminates Derry’s Christmas lights as thousands line route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way WeatherSnow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Wednesday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  County Derry PostCounty Derry pensioner found guilty of litany of sex offences against ten primary school children overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Shake lsquoNrsquo Frappe forced to close indefinitely after Fitzroyrsquos fireDerry NewsShake ‘N’ Frappe forced to close indefinitely after Fitzroy’s fire overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Kate NIcholson from Ballinascreen has fulfilled her dream of recording an album.County Derry PostCounty Derry GP fulfils dream of recording debut album overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

However, Mr Durkan – who is also the SDLPs Justice Spokesperson – accused Ms Hargey of resting “on her laurels” and that her “lackadaisical approach” would leave those in desperate need of support in a vulnerable position. He said: “There is no denying that the winter period will present a huge challenge for already struggling households. “The cruel cuts to Universal Credit, spiralling energy costs and the economic fallout of the pandemic have created a perfect storm. “Yet despite persistent calls for an emergency support package or a Household Support Fund similar to that announced in England in September for vulnerable families, the Minister rests on her laurels. “Minister Hargey cannot laud the North’s ‘unique’ Discretionary Support Scheme as a cure-all amidst the unfolding cost of living crisis. “A scheme, which she seems to have forgotten failed serve its intended purpose of protecting people here, evidenced in theof pound million of unspent funds. “Again, Minister Hargey’s lackadaisical approach to protecting the vulnerable and in this case, outright dereliction of duty will leave people without adequate support at a time when they need it most.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\" * Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo ..detachTo\"  ..detachTo..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A fire broke out in the kitchen of Link  Restaurant yesterday evening Derry NewsFire at Derry restaurant Link  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DerryChristmasPicture Special: Magical procession illuminates Derry’s Christmas lights as thousands line route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way WeatherSnow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

However, Mr Durkan – who is also the SDLPs Justice Spokesperson – accused Ms Hargey of resting “on her laurels” and that her “lackadaisical approach” would leave those in desperate need of support in a vulnerable position. He said: “There is no denying that the winter period will present a huge challenge for already struggling households. “The cruel cuts to Universal Credit, spiralling energy costs and the economic fallout of the pandemic have created a perfect storm. “Yet despite persistent calls for an emergency support package or a Household Support Fund similar to that announced in England in September for vulnerable families, the Minister rests on her laurels. “Minister Hargey cannot laud the North’s ‘unique’ Discretionary Support Scheme as a cure-all amidst the unfolding cost of living crisis. “A scheme, which she seems to have forgotten failed serve its intended purpose of protecting people here, evidenced in theof pound million of unspent funds. “Again, Minister Hargey’s lackadaisical approach to protecting the vulnerable and in this case, outright dereliction of duty will leave people without adequate support at a time when they need it most.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\" * Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo ..detachTo\"  ..detachTo..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A fire broke out in the kitchen of Link  Restaurant yesterday evening Derry NewsFire at Derry restaurant Link  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DerryChristmasPicture Special: Magical procession illuminates Derry’s Christmas lights as thousands line route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way WeatherSnow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.     However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.    Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.     Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.    The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.     More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.    Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

However, with confidence ing as vaccination rates rise, and economies gradually open back up, people are on the hunt again. He commented, “Recruitment is becoming an employee’s market, and the volume of roles available gives workers more options, allowing them to select the business with the best offering. Furthermore, after  months of working from their own homes, many people don’t want to go back to the office full-time.” Some % of respondents to a survey of around , Irish employees by the University of Limerick’s Kemmy Business School said they agreed or strongly agreed that ‘my future career lies outside of this organisation’. This was regardless of whether they worked in multinationals, indigenous Irish companies, SMEs or the public sector. The survey found that % of managers, % of site leaders, % of regional leaders and % of global leaders based in Ireland also feel their future lies outside of their current organisation. Mr Kindlon said businesses that fail to prioritise employee wellbeing, professional development and company culture could see employees leave in their droves in search of an employer that better meets their needs – and struggle to recruit new talent to the business. “It’s crucial that businesses focus on becoming an employer of choice in order to sustain operations and accelerate growth as economies recover from the disruption of the pandemic.” While competitive pay and generous perks are key to employee satisfaction and retention, he said flexibility and the ability to make a meaningful contribution to the job is just as important. “Multiple studies have shown that, more than ever, traditional office-based workers want a better work-le balance. That means flexible, remote or hybrid working to allow them to manage their professional and personal responsibilities in a way that benefits both their wellbeing and productivity.” “It means offering tangible, valuable employee benefits that put employee wellbeing at the forefront – so less of the ping pong tables, more of the competitive pension contributions and annual leave allowances. And it means nurturing a more positive company culture, in which the right to disconnect is respected – and so are employees.” He said the true impact of the great resignation remains to be seen, but employers who take the possibility of mass resignations and stled recruitment lightly will surely bear the brunt of this once-in-a-generation phenomenon as we move into . “Losing employees can be very costly. If multiple employees leave within a short time frame, depending on your company size you could be hit with huge costs as well as stled growth while you backfill positions.” There are a number of ways that companies can retain and engage current employees. These include offering a competitive mix of employee benefits with tangible value – such as enhanced pension payments, health insurance, above-statutory annual leave allowances, and flexible working to support employees’ work-le balance and wellbeing. Offering routes for career progression, either through promotion opportunities or by enabling employees to move to a dferent area of the business where desired and appropriate are also options. Mr Kindlon said the great resignation is both a threat and an opportunity for businesses in a wide range of industries. “While some businesses could see employees leave due to a number of contributing factors, employers with a competitive offering could see an increase in the talent available to bring into their teams.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\" * Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo ..detachTo\"  ..detachTo..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A fire broke out in the kitchen of Link  Restaurant yesterday evening Derry NewsFire at Derry restaurant Link  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DerryChristmasPicture Special: Magical procession illuminates Derry’s Christmas lights as thousands line route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way WeatherSnow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

After continuing with his le, as best he could, he collapsed last year in his garden with back and leg pain. Kevin travelled to Istanbul last month to meet a specialist and will require surgery within a matter of months, which will cost in the region of pound,.

On Friday, June , their  and  U Feacuteile teams will play in a novel charity game, with all the funds going help Kevin and his family. “We are trying to raise as much money for Kevin and his family as possible,” said Philip Muldoon, one of the organisers. “We want the good people off Ballinderry and surrounding areas to come along and donate on the night of the match to keep the date free. “To any business people who would like to sponsor a prize for the raffle in the Bridge Bar afterwards they can do so by contacting myself or Karl Conlan. “Kevin is going to need a lot of help post and pre surgery and this will go a long way to doing that.” To mark the occasion Noel ONeill of Arboe based company ND Sports has made the outstanding gesture of sponsoring a one-off retro top for both teams.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\" * Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo ..detachTo\"  ..detachTo..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About in Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A fire broke out in the kitchen of Link  Restaurant yesterday evening Derry NewsFire at Derry restaurant Link  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DerryChristmasPicture Special: Magical procession illuminates Derry’s Christmas lights as thousands line route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way WeatherSnow in official Met Eacuteireann forecast for Ireland with big chill on the way overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Pic by Tommy Gallagher.Reporter: Orlagh Mullan Nov Email: sport@derrypost  addthis, Steelstown manager Hugh McGrath has urged GAA supporters around the county to back his side in their Ulster Intermediate Championship quarter-final. googletag.cmd.push After beating Donegal’s Cloughaneely in a dramatic preliminary round game on Saturday, the Oacuteg’s will now face Monaghan champions Donaghmoyne in Celtic Park in a fortnight’s time. “Donaghmoyne are a good outfit. I’ve watched them twice now and they’ll not pass up as many chances as Cloughaneely,” said the Down man. “It’s great to have a home tie in Celtic Park and it would be greatwe could get as many people out to support us as possible – I think this group deserve that. “It’s been a long road since last year and losing the final so the more days that you can get with big support, the better. “We have never had that many supporters out and around our own county, it’s been very much our own group within the city, and it shows. “The group is tight, it will always be tight, and we stick together. The more we see of the city clubs sticking together, the better. “For years it was all about parish rivalries in the city but there’s no need for it. “We’re all competing on the same  and the sooner we help each other and get everybody up to the intermediate level to start off with, the better for football in the city.” McGrath’s men dominated the game, but in their first run at Ulster intermediate football the nerves were certainly there, and but for the crossbar in the dying seconds the Ballyarnett men could have exited the competition. Neil Forester tracks his man on Saturday afternoon. Pic by Tommy Gallagher. For the manager, the character on display was no surprise. “It wouldn’t be a Steelstown gamewe didn’t make it exciting for everyone in the stands. It’s a dficult one,” he said. “We were in uncharted territory here and we just had to see how the guys reacted. The positive thing that we got out of it was the result obviously. “The performance wasn’t what we wanted it to be, but I think when we went behind in the first half we showed our character again. “I don’t think that should ever be questioned with this group. They showed what they’re capable of doing. “Even when they go behind, they don’t panic – they just go through their process and make sure they get out on the right end of the scoreline. “We bossed the entire first half bar maybe three or four minutes of it, but Cloughaneely are not champions of Donegal and playing Division One football all year for no reason. A certain Derry manager warned me during the week that Cloughaneely were a very good outfit and they’d be very hard to beat. He’s never usually too far off the mark and he was exactly right. “There’s always going to be a sting from a team like that and they showed what they’re capable of. I think we showed what we’re capable of too. We’re capable of digging deep, we showed what our bench can do as well. “We’ve as many good players coming into the team as have started it and for us that’s a positive. “We need to build on it and take the next step. For us it was about getting a win in Ulster, next step is two wins in Ulster and we’ll see where we go from there.”  PREVIEW: Ulster a chance to throw off the shackles for Steelstown  The intermediate champions take on Cloughaneely in Letterkenny on Saturday.

Friday’s results in the other group threw up St Killians Garron Tower as the team they would facethey beat Knock. In the end it was a comfortable enough morning in Lavey for Maghera against Our Lady’s  St Patrick’s Knock with an early goal from Oisin McNicholl paving the way for a - to - win. McNicholl had opened the scoring within the first  seconds with a breakaway point and four minutes later Knock’s best player and free-taker Eoin Pucci fired over an equaliser. Then in the sixth minute Eoin Scullion played McNicholl in for the goal. The sliotar seemed to die on the heavy pitch and McNicholl scooped it home from close range. Maghera never looked back with Knock very dependent on Eoin Pucci frees to keep them in contact. The Maghera half-back line of Dara McGonigle, James Friel and Fionn McEldowney was in control throughout with Eoin Scullion dropping back from midfield as an extra shield. Scullion and Shea McKenna were on top at midfield and Peter McCullagh was always available to run at the knock defence. It was - to - at the water break with four of the Maghera points coming from McCullaghand that gap stretched to - to - by the interval with Jarlath McCollum eventually getting Knock’s first score from open play in the thminute. McCullagh hit two more frees and Callum O’Kane took a fine point when he took his player on in the thminute. Eoin Scullion and free-taker Pucci exchanged points on the re-start, and then Cormac Mullan’s goal in the thminute made sure that there would be no way back for Knock. The spade-work was done by McCullagh but Mullan still had plenty to do before he crashed the sliotar past Tiarnaacuten Davis. Davis brought off a good save from Shea O’Neill at the start of the last quarter that only produced three points, all of them top class scores. Knock could claim the score of the game when Shea Pucci fired over left-handed from right on the side-line. But that point was cancelled almost immediately by a fine long-range effort from Callum O’Kane and Fionn McEldowney fired over another fine point late in the game. Both semi-finalsare due to take place next week with the final scheduled for the weekend of December  .

Given the challenging times that all communities have experienced recently, it is important to acknowledge those young people who have risen to the challenge. This is the fth year of the initiative and all of the young nominees will hope to emulate -year-old Niamh Rafferty from St Brenda’s Camogie Club, Ballymacnab, Co. Armagh, who was the winner of the prestigious award last year. The winner will receive a prize package including specially commissioned Volunteer of the Year merchandise, a Translink Enterprise Plus travel voucher for two people to Dublin and a set of jerseys for their club youth team. Gaelic Football, Hurling, Camogie, Rounders and Handball clubs across Ulster are encouraged to nominate young people aged - years old whose actions best demonstrate the volunteering ethos and community spirit of the Association during the year. Encouraging the GAA community to seize the opportunity to celebrate its young people, Stephen Montgomery from Translink, said: “Translink recognises the importance of promoting an active and healthy lestyle and values the impact a strong community spirit can make in local areas – something the Young Volunteer of the Year Award is all about. “It is great to see this awardfor another year and I’d like to thank Ulster GAA for working in partnership with Translink to deliver this fantastic celebration of volunteering. I’d also like to pay tribute to all the clubs and coaches who train, motivate and inspire their players to be the best they can be, as well as the young people who volunteer hours of their time for their local clubs. Good Luck!” Ulster GAA President Oliver Galligan said: “Volunteerism is at the heart of everything that happens in the GAA across the province and we are delighted that our initiative with Translink recognises the positive impact that our youth members have with their clubs and communities through a wide range of volunteer activities, including coaching, well-being schemes, fundraising and committee membership. “At the end of the GAA season, I would encourage all of our clubs to celebrate their own young leaders by entering a nomination for this award”.

It’s a fairly cringeworthy experience watching so many people pretend to like each other and dance and act like they’re not in it for the next round. The reason I get so worked up about it is that I was watching musicians for years and years, before the Arts Council handed out cheques, just making great music. Some of them still do. Jeanette Hutton still does. I’ll end up sounding like a lick but it’s a small price to pay to get across her importance to music here. The easiest way to explain her is that she’s the real thing. An incredible vocalist that you’ve undoubtedly heardyou were ever out on a Saturday night in Derry. A gted songwriter that has changed yet again for her third record. An irreplaceable friend and all-round cool girl with the best taste in music you’re going to find. A genuinely fine human being.She once told me that hearing Let There Be Rock by AC DC on Tommy Vance’s rock show inspired her to pursue music and to join Philby, who toured with Mama’s Boys and played with Rory Gallagher. Philby gained a local following which got bigger and bigger and that eventually meant they could buy a transit van and move to London . But the dficulties of constant touring around a circuit that covered a lot of distance around England with little to no pay to, even worse, pay-to-play gigs caught up with them and the band parted ways. Not that this was a bad experience and the band had gained enough acclaim to get write ups in Kerrang magazine and gigs in the famous Marquee venue in London . After a year out back home, Jeanette got involved in a local jam session with Frankie Robinson and Mickey the Hat and that has developed into her becoming one of the most recognised and respected musicians in the town. This led to her band Lady J’S first album with husband Ruairi O’Doherty, bassist David Doherty and guitarist Marty McGill and produced the self-titled album and some of the best gigs the parish has seen. Like I said earlier, this lady, J, has the best taste in music you’ve ever heard, and she took an absolute swerve in her next project with her sister Noella. Blood, the album and the live experience was all things to all music fans, loud and acoustic, heavy, and sweet, lyrical, and melodic set against loud guitars, quiet guitars and familial vocal harmonies that can only be captured by relatives. The perfect storm and another chapter in the book of big Hutton. Now we’re at the next chapter, the one where it’s just Jeanette. “Melancholy Me” is described a collection of dark, reflective, and weighty tunes that showcases her as a more introspective writer with brooding stories to tell. I’ve always found her music to be like that, the delivery is ever changing in a way that a great musician seems to be able to do that without taking a wrinkle out of them but the over-arching substance that fills her songs is a constant. There are a lot of musician and listeners out there who have a lot to learn from Lady J Hutton. Keep up to date with all happenings Hutton on her Facebook page, Jeanette Hutton Music. She’ll also be supporting Damien Dempsey in the Millennium Forum on Saturday th January and tickets can be got for that herewww.millenniumforum shows damien-dempsey .

However, the scoreboard remained the same as heroic UCC defence and a lack of accuracy at crucial times undid all the hard work.A forward pass undid one multi-phase attack and a penalty given away in an attacking position from an otherwise excellent line-out maul foiled another.Then a superb scrummaging effort won the home side a penalty on the UCC five-metre line. Ballynahinch looked to turn the screw and opted for another scrum, only to give away a penalty and come away from another stint in the UCC  with nothing.As the opportunities came and went UCC continued to defend well and kick superbly and when Squires got them out of trouble with a brilliantly executed - kick to give them a foothold in Ballynahinch territory they were visibly lted and reasserted themselves in attack.They were able to close out the game, despite missing a penalty in front of the posts and having another kick and chase try disallowed for a knock-on, leaving Ballynahinch reflecting on how they failed to turn all their possession and territory statistics into points.The league table, which is the only statistic that counts at the end of the season, shows Ballynahinch at the bottom, having been defeated by their nearest rivals in their last two outings.There is no respite as Munster giants Cork Constitution roll into Ballymacarn Park this weekend on the back of three consecutive wins, having shrugged off their uncharacteristically slow start to the season.Ballynahinch : John Dickson, Zack McCall, Kyle McCall, James Simpson, John Donnan, Thomas Donnan, Oli Loughead, Bradley Luney, Chris Gibson, Jack Milligan, Aaron Cairns, Rory Butler, Tagen Strydom, Shane Ball, Yasser Omar, Josh Hanlon, Nacho Cladera Crespo, Diego Vidal Souza, Callum Irvine, Conor McCauley, Greg Hutley..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/24Novemeber2021_StreetBoost.jpg","title":"Business boost for high street  ","story":"BUSINESSES across the district are being given a unique opportunity to help shape the future of high streets across the Newry, Mourne and Down area.Members of a Stormont task force spearheading a new initiative will be in Downpatrick next week for a workshop designed to provide local people with their say on how to rejuvenate town centres in a post-Covid world.Junior ministers Gary Middleton and Declan Kearney mdash who are leading the task force mdash will be at Denvirrsquos Coaching Inn on Thursday,December , and are encouraging business owners and residents to come along and have their say during what is being billed as an evidence gathering exercise.A number of local councillors have echoed their appeal for people to take part in the two-hour event which starts at pm.Designed to help make town, city and village centres places where people can do business, socialise, shop, be creative and use public services, the task force is determined to make a dference, with its membership including a raft of government departments and key organisations including Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster.The junior ministers say while there are many common and shared challenges, they recognise that every high street is dferent and has its own character, personality and needs that will each require bespoke local solutions.They want to hear views and evidence from far and wide, across both urban and rural areas and are urging e everyone with an interest in the future of their local high street to respond to the call for evidence and share their views.The task forcersquos visit to Downpatrick comes after it was revealed that there are currently  empty shop units in the town centre.In addition, the finishing touches are being put to a pound, revitalisation scheme in Church Street, while work is continuing to redevelop the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty, adjacent buildings as part of a major retail and commercial development opportunity which, it is hoped, can attract a number of leading retailers.Ahead of the Downpatrick consultation event, the business community and wider civic society is being asked to put forward ideas on what success in high streets could look like, with the focus on family friendly destinations where people want to shop, socialise, live and work.The task force said the series of workshops provide important opportunities for everyone to have their say and make their views known, with the junior ministers particularly keen to hear from a wide spectrum of people.Mr Kearney added: ldquoOur high streets are for everyone.

This was due mostly to a long, very arduous hill along the back straight but there were also some very tricky tight turns which were treacherous.There was a long downhill which some used as recovery but others saw this as a chance to gain places and they threw caution to the wind, flinging themselves down the descent in an alarming fashion.The spectators had plenty to watch and saw the runners several times per lap.Mackenzie Murray found it hard to get himself into the groove in the U-  race and despite coming second overall, he felt that his performance was under par.Looking back at how well he ran in Ballyclare recently, it is hard to argue with this self assessment.

I canrsquot answer that. I only know he was very supportive of me as a female and an Anglican and as an outsider. He asked me to be in the administration in  which I have always been very thankful for.Mrs Foster said her Christian faith helped her to seek common ground with people she did not agree with, adding that her reason forgoing into government with Sinn Fein was to make sure that her children and others did not endure what she went through as a child.This included the attempted murder in  on her father, John, an RUC reservist, living on the Fermanagh border, and a bomb attack on her school bus driver in which her friend was left severely injured.Recalling the gun attack on her father, when she was around eight years old, she said he came crawling back from the barn, after gunshots were fired, with blood dripping from his forehead.ldquoIt was a very strange time, she said. ldquoMy mother was sitting at the kitchen table and I donrsquot know what she was doing but I will never forget her face.

While the police could do more, I realise they may not have all the resources they require at their disposal and this situation also has to be addressed, he declared.BALLYNAHINCH mdash All takeaways in Ballynahinch should be close at midnight to cut down on sectarian trouble in the town, according to a local politician.South Down Assemblyman Jim Wells has called upon Down Council to introduce a blanket closure time on all takeaways claiming that the late opening hours, especially on Friday and Saturday nights, has led to an increase of sectarian trouble in the town.At a meeting of the Corporate Services Committee last week, Mr Wells claimed that a large number of residents living around Main Street are being wakened in the early hours of the morning by drunken youths hanging about the shops.He also pointed out that a large number of violent incidents occur in the early hours outside takeaways in the town.Mr Wells said he received complaints from an  year-old woman living close to a takeaway, who is left terried by drunken shouting at around am on a Saturday and Sunday morning.ldquoI really think it would be a good idea to consider closing these places at midnight. Once people leave the bars they then head over to the takeaways where they hang out until around .am.ldquoEveryone is usually very drunk and I believe this is leading to a lot of the sectarian trouble in the town. It is completely unfair to any residents living close by who are trying to sleep and are kept awake by drunk people hanging around the streets, he said.SEAFORDE mdash A mother of five feels she has no choice to to move house following plans to erect a telecommunications mast at Seaforde.Siobhan Devlin recently moved into her home at Dunnanew Road and was horried to discover that a number of mobile telephone companies are planning to extend an existing mast close to her house to accommodate  new antennae.She is so concerned about the effects the mast could boast to her childrenrsquos health she is seriously considering selling her newly build dream house.Accusing mobile phone companies of being completely undemocratic by putting masts up against the wishes of the local community, she said she cannot understand why a decision was taken to extend a mast so close to a large number of houses.The Seaforde community is overwhelmingly behind Siobhan and a group of parents, concerned for the health of their children, have written a letter to planners demanding the development is stopped.She said: ldquoEveryone is completely shocked that such a major proposal has ben put to planners so close to our homes. A large area of residential land will be affectedthis plan goes ahead and nobody is happy about it.ldquoWe feel that we are being used as guinea pigs as nobody can tell us they are  per cent sure that these masts do not pose any health risks.ldquoDo planners honestly believe that residents, especially those with young children, will accept this proposal  If the plan goes ahead I really think I will have to move as I do not want my children living so close to that mast.KILLOUGH mdash Plans for the regeneration of Killough were put before Down councillors at a meeting on Monday night.Representatives from the Palatine Trust met with members of the councilrsquos recreation and technical services committee to give an update on how the regeneration work in the village is developing and discussed future plans for the area.The council has funded pound, towards the refurbishment of the harbour area since the trust was first set up in .

Monaghan.DAERA officials have also confirmed, late last night, the presence of Avian Influenza in two wild birds retrieved from the Belfast Waterworks site earlier this week.Disease control zones have been put in place around all infected premises to mitigate against onward disease spread.Under the new housing measures, all bird keepers in NI will be legally required to keep their birds indoors or otherwise separate from wild birds, and to follow strict biosecurity measures.This applies to owners of pet birds, commercial flocks or just a few birds in a backyard or hobby flock.Announcing the decision to introduce a housing order, Minister Poots said: ldquoI took the decision to introduce the new housing measures in order to try to prevent an incursion of avian influenza into the poultry flock in Northern Ireland.ldquoIt is now a legal requirement for all poultry and captive bird keepers to keep their birds housed or otherwise separate from wild birds.ldquoThis decision was based on sound expert advice and in consultation with industry.ldquoThis decision to house is an additional step to the Avian Influenza Prevention Zoneintroduced on November , and is another necessary precautionary measure requiring all bird keepers to keep their birds housed.ldquoThese housing measures build on the strengthened biosecurity measures that were brought in as part of the AIPZ.ldquoSince my decision to introduce the housing order, we have now discovered avian flu in two wild birds in Belfast ndash that tells us unequivocally that the disease is already here and in our wild bird population.ldquoKeeping it out of the commercial flocks is now down to our poultry sector and the measures they take to keep the disease out.ldquoAdhering to, and a constant review of, all biosecurity measures is the best weapon we have to avoid an incursion.ldquoMy officials will continue to liaise closely with stakeholders and colleagues in GB and the Republic as the situation develops.To assist all bird keepers in complying with the new rules, a Biosecurity self-assessment tool has been developed that is available on the DAERA website.If avian influenza were to enter NI, the disease would have a signicant and devastating impact on our poultry industry, international trade and the wider economy.Poultry and captive bird keepers are advised to be vigilant for any signs of disease in their birds and any wild birds, and to seek prompt advice from their vetthey have any concerns.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Had the result stayed that way, the Republic under Jack Charlton might not have qualied for the  World Cup.The pleasure of the Green and White Army at going ahead in such a crucial match, when Northern Ireland could not itself by that stage qualy for the tournament, was interpreted as deep sectarianism. But people who reached that conclusion were mis-interpreting the NI fans, who were celebrating for reasons such as the long rivalry between the two teams and the fact that NI were underdogs. Perhaps also there was a sense that the Republic’s much-discussed progress towards the finals was somewhat smug.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

There had indeed that night been some disgraceful sectarian conduct, leading to a number of NI fans being excluded from the grounds. But not only was there no suggestion from any journalist or credible sources who attended the match that there was widespread sectarian chanting, it is still possible to watch the game online and see that there is no sign of such behaviour.Yet there has been a shocking but unfounded claim that fans chanted ‘Trick or Treat’, as a taunting reference to the Greysteel loyalist murder of Catholic civilians weeks earlier.Today our reporter Mark Rainey, who was at the game, helps to set the record straight — that the crowd at the game had been well behaved, which at the time was a relief to everyone given the then communal tensions due to Greysteel and the preceding republican massacre at Shankill.Why in so many contexts does this happen in Northern Ireland  Constant accusations of loyalist or unionist sectarianism, often involving exaggerations and distortions, and typically pushed by people who are convinced of their own rectitude.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Photo: Arthur Allison PacemakerPeter Hain said the current shadow secretary of state’s position is “absolutely correct” and “loyal to the Good Friday Agreement”.Lord Hain, who served as NI secretary in Tony Blair’s government between  and , made his comments after Ms Haigh was criticised for having a “puzzling” and “contradictory” stance on the UK.On Tuesday, Ms Haigh told GB News that the United Kingdom had already said it had no selfish interest in the Province.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It is not my job be a persuader for the Union.”Ms Haigh’s claims prompted ex-Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken to say: “The approach of the shadow secretary of state is very puzzling and her comments are contradictory to say the least.”Mr Aiken added: “Certainly, nobody considers it even remotely likely that the Republic of Ireland’s government would adopt a stance of neutrality. If the shadow secretary of state has her way, we would be facing a future referendum campaign whereby the Dublin government would be campaigning actively for unity, but a Labour administration in London... not caring either waythe UK as we know it, continues to exist or not”.However, Mr Hain said that by adopting the position of an “honest broker” he was able to forge close links with both Dr Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness leading up to the  settlement between the DUP and Sinn Fein.“Partly the reason that they were able to come together was that I was able to build trust with both of them. Now, you can only do thatyou are trusted by all sides,” he told BBC Talkback on Wednesday.Commenting on the prospect of a border poll, he said: “That is determined by the Good Friday Agreement. I don’t advocate a united Ireland and more than I advocate a dferent option for Northern Ireland”.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
