IT’s JUST BIOLOGYKatharine Graves, hypnobirthing expertCradling a bump is something that’s hardwired into women from a biological perspective.Women are instinctively drawn to touching their babies because, even when they’re in the womb, it produces a hormone called oxytocin. This hormone is known as the bonding hormone, but it also affects the strength of your contractions in labour.The more oxytocin in your system, the stronger your contractions will be, which can lead to an easier birth. Placing your hands on your bump comforts the baby, comforts you, and helps create the optimum conditions for labour.kghypnobirthing.com  The left hand touch: Cusping baby in London last month (right), in Birkenhead, (centre), and with Harry in Australia (left)DUCHESS OF SHOWBIZ IS JUST SEEKING A PHOTO OP Jo Elvin, Editor of You MagazineI’ve tried not to find it annoying, but I’m sorry, it just is. A casual cradling of one’s bump is to be expected. It’s new, it’s exciting and there really is nothing like feeling that thing kick and jump around in there.But Meghan’s positioning is always so fixed into one singular, rigid pose that it’s becoming uncomfortable to watch. I’m getting arm aches just looking. It’s all very Baby Bump Barbie.Kinder people would point to an excited new mother’s natural, unconditional love already blossoming. True enough, in which case I hope its sibling isn’t far behind, or that poor kid’s clearly in for a smothering.But come on, this is the Duchess of Showbiz we have here. It smacks to me of a focus that’s contrived and relentlessly photo-op ready. Meghan would be well advised to take the ‘world’s only pregnant woman!’ vibes down a notch or two.  Talk to the bump! The Duchess seems to be including the baby in her conversations in London this month (right) and last month (left)A WOMAN SHOWING A NEW-FOUND RESERVE Harry Witchel, body language expert Meghan tends to cup her bump by knitting her fingers together – a sign of holding back and being more grounded. That’s quite a contrast to her usual behaviour, which involves dealing with the world with gusto. As a Royal she is expected to be more reserved, so is this a subconscious attempt to be so?This doesn’t look like acting. This looks like a woman aware of a change in her body.          The handbag shield: Meghan covers the bump with her clutch bag in  in Fiji  Ultimate Accessory: Meghan covers the bump with her handbag in London this month (right) and in October (left)A SIGN OF HER DELIGHT AT BEING PREGNANT Alexandra Shulman, Mos columnistA lot of women feel comforted by touching their baby bump but Meghan appears to indulge more than most. It happened even before she had a discernible bump, and I imagine some of this is because she is so delighted to be pregnant. Possibly, at 37, she wasn’t sure it would happen so quickly.But there may be another story. All Royals have a method of preventing their arms from flailing around in a chaotic fashion when they are out and about. Meghan is using her bump as a way to keep her hands calm, while showing how protective she is.SHE LOOKS AS DEMURE AS THE VIRGIN MARY Alison Jackson, photographer Meghan\u0027s arms framing the bump very clearly shows that she is pregnant, rather than just looking large. I think she’s also very consciously making the effort to break up the solid colour of her outfits.After years as an actress, she’ll be very aware of camera angles and how to work them, and how to create flattering shapes with her body.I also think she resembles the image of the Virgin Mary: demure and regal, carrying the most precious cargo. She’s definitely very pleased with herself about that.instagram.comalisonjacksonartist          Photographer Alison Jackson says Meghan\u0027s arms framing the bump very clearly shows that she is pregnantIGNORE THE BACKLASH, THIS IS A BIG POSITIVE Julianne Boutaleb, psycholgistIt’s interesting to see such a backlash against a woman who is interacting with her bump in this way. But I see it as a very positive thing. It indicates a good attachment to the unborn baby.I work with a lot of women who struggle to develop a bond with their child, whether due to difficulty conceiving, miscarriage, or birth trauma. But a woman who is cradling her bump is showing that she’s very engaged, both emotionally and physically, with her unborn child.parenthoodinmind.co.uk    Psychologist Julianne Boutaleb sees it as a very positive thing and it indicates a good attachment to the unborn babyIT’S MEGHAN’S CLOAK OF INVULNERABILITY Linda Kelsey, former editor of Cosmopolitan  Everyone else constantly paws you when you’re pregnant, so why shouldn’t Meghan take things into her own hands? Personally, I’ve never felt as strong and invulnerable as when my belly was ballooning.I would march into meetings with my Managing Director, who was not at all happy to have one of his editors about to go on maternity leave (I was editor of Cosmopolitan at the time), knowing there was nothing he could say to burst my sense of well-being. And in case he missed the point I’d cradle my belly one more time for added effect.  Meghan has had a hard time of it lately with attacks on a number of fronts. But when you’re pregnant and loving it nothing else really matters.Every time she cradles her bump, it’s a case of you and me against the world, babe – and she’s rocking it.IF THIS IS HER ACTING, IT’s A MASSIVE CLICHE Dee Cannon, acting coachWhen you’re teaching an actor to ‘play’ pregnant, the preparation involves holding the back. Cradling the bump is not really something you’d ask an actor to do – it’s such a demonstrative gesture that it could be seen as a cliche. So when a woman is doing that in real life, you can choose to interpret it in either a positive or a negative way – either it’s a subconscious, instinctive, nurturing, maternal gesture, or they’re proud and overly protective.deecannon.com          Acting coach Dee Cannon says cradling the bump is not really something you’d ask an actor to do – it’s such a demonstrative gesture that it could be seen as a clicheWHAT’S SO UNNATURAL IN LOVING YOUR BUMP?Bonita Turner, editor of Junior Magazine I imagine it’s reassuring for Meghan to put her hands on her baby. I don’t think she’s doing it to show off, and I imagine that people saying that have never been pregnant. It’s natural to be proud of your bump. You only have it for nine months and it is quite special.CONSTANT STROKING IS HELPING BABY LEARN Tamara Bugembe, paediatrician WE HAVE known for a long time that babies respond to voices and sounds from outside the womb, and they also move their arms, head and mouths more when the bump was stroked. Some babies would reach out and touch the walls of the uterus.Touching your bump is good for the baby’s development. Meghan may not know it, but her constant stroking and rubbing is helping develop the baby’s co-ordination and movements.drtamarab.comA POSITIVE SIGN SHE LOVES HER NEW BODY Holli Rubin, body image expertSome women love how they look when pregnant. Others hate it. A woman’s body image pre-pregnancy very much influences how she feels, looks and presents herself. When we feel good in ourselves, we tend to present ourselves in a very different way to when we don’t – and putting your hand on the bump in this way is a positive sign.hollirubin.com          Body image expert Holli Rubin says putting your hand on the bump in this way is a positive signMAKING THE MOST OF HER NEW SHAPE Renee Rispin, stylist \u0026amp blogger Some women find it hard to make the most of their changing body shape and hide their bumps – but Meghan isn’t one of them. Choosing to wear striking colours such as the purple dress and red coat she wore on a recent visit to Birkenhead is a clear message that not only does she want to show off her bump, but also that being pregnant doesn’t mean she’s taken her finger off the fashion pulse.mummystyle.co.ukSHE LOVES TO SHOW THAT SHE’S A ‘FAT LADY’ Katie Nicholl, royal authorHaving observed Meghan on official engagements, her bump patting seems to be second nature – it’s her new prop.It’s endearing, but a little distracting. I think she genuinely feels a connection with what Harry calls ‘our little bump’ and cradling her tummy is instinctive and protective.Even when she’s wearing a coat, Meghan flicks it to one side so her tummy is on show.I’ve loved the way she’s not been afraid to display her bump.

Why don’t you join them?NORTH WESTTown councillor Sue Helliwell, 56, has recruited more volunteers for a pick-up in Alsager, Cheshire. ‘Alsager’s litter is mainly plastic bottles and takeaway cups,’ she says.‘People drink on the hoof and, if there’s not a bin, they’re thrown out of cars. There needs to be more litter bins along routes.’          Dundee-based Shoaib Khan, 37, is a regional youth leader for the Ahmadiyya Muslim Youth Association.

Cooperators who spent time with him during his heyday said he often spoke about wanting to see either a movie or book made about his life story.  The Post described Edda as diligently taking notes during the testimony of Guzman\u0027s former bodyguard Isaias Valdez Rios.Seeking to get a better look at \u0027El Chapo,\u0027 Edda at one point even borrowed a pair of binoculars from a reporter. He also kept an eye on the kingpin\u0027s wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, 29, who showed up in court dressed in an all-black ensemble.During a break in the proceedings, Edda got to meet the former beauty queen.The two were seen exchanging a kiss on the cheek and greeting one another in Spanish in the hallway.          Edda is seen throwing a Molotov cocktail while playing a young El Chapo in Narcos: MexicoGuzman\u0027s defense team joined Coronel and Edda and discussed the prospect of making a movie about the defendant\u0027s life in the future.One of the drug lord\u0027s attorneys, Eduardo Balarezo, quipped that he would like Academy Award winner George Clooney to portray him on the big screen. In recent years, Guzman has courted publicity, seeking to make a movie about his life and giving an interview to actor Sean Penn for Rolling Stone magazine in 2015. Speaking later to a gaggle of reporters outside Brooklyn Federal Court, Edda appeared starstruck by his encounter with El Chapo, saying his hands were sweaty and his heart was \u0027pumping fast,\u0027 according to the New York Daily News. He said it was strange for him to come face to face with the real El Chapo and that he never experienced anything like this trial.  Last week, a former Guzman assistant testified that he witnessed the defendant viciously torture his enemies before they were killed. He was one of the government\u0027s final witnesses.Federal prosecutors rested their case today, after three months of testimony by more than 50 witnesses. Jeffrey Lichtman, one of Guzman\u0027s lawyers, said in his opening argument in November that his client was framed by the cartel\u0027s true leader, Ismael \u0027El Mayo\u0027 Zambada, with the help of corrupt government officials.Lichtman said on Monday he planned to call two U.S. law enforcement agents, whom he did not name, as defense witnesses on Tuesday morning. Lichtman had said in a court filing on Saturday that he wanted to call the agents to rebut testimony by two of the prosecution\u0027s witnesses about their earlier statements to law enforcement.Judge Cogan said prosecutors should expect to begin their closing argument on Wednesday morning.

After excusing the jury, U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan asked Guzman directly whether he understood it was his decision, not that of his lawyers, to testify or not.\u0027Yes, but they counseled me about it and I agree with them,\u0027 Guzman answered.Had Guzman, 61, testified, it would have provided a fitting climax to an already dramatic trial. However, Guzman\u0027s decision was widely expected, as testifying would have exposed him to cross-examination by prosecutors.Guzman, the alleged leader of Mexico\u0027s Sinaloa Cartel, was extradited to the United States in 2017. He has been on trial since November on charges of trafficking vast quantities of cocaine, heroin and other illegal drugs into the country. The main defense argument, as put forth by Guzman lawyer Jeffrey Lichtman in his opening statement, has been that the real leader of the Sinaloa Cartel is Ismael \u0027El Mayo\u0027 Zambada, and that Zambada bribed the Mexican and US governments to frame Guzman.Guzman\u0027s lawyers have discussed multiple potential witnesses with prosecutors in open court, and have filed a motion suggesting they might call an inmate in the US prison system, but they have not publicly revealed any names. The defense was expected to call two witnesses Tuesday.

Volunteers can pledge to pick up litter inidually, or join or host their own group.          The Duke of Cambridge has backed the Daily Mail’s campaign to clean up Britain, saying litter is not just an eyesore but ‘a threat to the health of our environment’William, a father of three, also advised that getting out in the fresh air to take part in a clean-up can be great for family bonding and a wonderful way to teach children how important the environment is to everyone.A Kensington Palace spokesman said: ‘The duke encourages everyone who can to take part in the Great British Spring Clean.‘Litter is more than just an eyesore – it is a threat to the health of our environment.‘Litter pick-ups are great things to do as a family and can help teach children about how they can care for the natural world.’An aide said the duke was supportive of any attempt to clear up the litter that blights our towns and countryside.

As father to Prince George, five, Princess Charlotte, three, and one-year-old Prince Louis, William, 36, has as much invested in the success of the scheme as anyoneWilliam said: ‘He took us litter picking when we were younger, on holiday.‘We were in Norfolk on school holidays and we went out litter picking with him. We thought this is perfectly normal, everyone must do it. We were there with our spikes stabbing the rubbish into black plastic bags.’The passion for litter picking clearly runs in the family. Only last week the Duchess of Cornwall called for action to combat the ‘shaming’ levels of litter in the nation’s streets and countryside.Camilla, who has been on several litter picking drives herself, said on a visit to Tower Hamlets in East London that pressure needed to be put on companies such as McDonald’s to encourage their customers to dispose of their rubbish properly, possibly even through fines.Yesterday Prime Minister Theresa May lent her support to the Daily Mail and Keep Britain Tidy campaign and said she would get involved in the Great British Spring Clean.The campaign has been endorsed by a host of celebrities and campaigners including TV naturalist Sir David Attenborough, who Prince William interviewed at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Generation web addicts Children spend time YouTube friends","story":"    The major Ofcom study comes as analysis shows iPads can stunt children\u0027s development          Nearly 20 per cent of under-fives have a tablet , rising to half of older children (stock image)Campaigners described the report from media watchdog Ofcom as frightening.‘In the early years, children need interaction with other people, and play – it is key to their social skills,’ said Sue Palmer of the group Toxic Childhood. ‘If that doesn’t happen when they are small, I don’t know where it leads.

You could, of course, be saddened by the fact that the original environment has disappeared. When you move a cultural heritage to a museum, you move it outside. However, this shifting is also a creative act.”The same could be said for the Acropolis Museum created in Athens, said Fischer. “Nothing that we admire at the Acropolis Museum was created for the Acropolis Museum. They are close to the original environment, but they have again moved away from it and have been transformed through this act.”There are many who will not see the early 19th-century removal from Greece of the marbles by agents of the 7th Earl of Elgin as “creative”. Lord Byron likened it to vandalism, lamenting in verse in Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage: “Dull is the eye that will not weep to see  Thy walls defac’d, thy mouldering shrines remov’d  By British hands.”George Vardas, the secretary of the International Association for Reunification of Parthenon Sculptures, tweeted: “Seriously. What was so creative in the destruction of the temple and looting and pillage of a nation’s keys to its ancient history?”He called it “astonishing historical revisionism and arrogance”, and added: “The imperial condescension of the British Museum knows no bounds.”Elsewhere in the interview, Fischer rejected the idea that Greece was the legitimate owner of the marbles. “The objects in the collection of the British Museum are owned by the museum’s commissioners,” he said.There would only be a possibility of a loan if Greece were to recognise the British Museum’s legitimate ownership of the marbles, he added.Myrsini Zorba, the Greek culture minister, issued a statement on Saturday condemning Fischer’s “legitimate owner” comments as exhibiting “a narrow and cynical managerial mindset”.“It is regrettable to hear this by the director of the British Museum and a well-known art historian. His remarks downgrade cultural heritage from an invaluable universal value to a mere exchange sale.”The British Museum is prevented by UK law from returning the marbles, although the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has said he would repatriate them if his party were elected.A spokesperson for the British Museum said: “Hartwig Fischer was stating the longstanding position of the British Museum. We believe there is a great public benefit in being able to see these wonderful objects in the context of a world collection. The museum lends extensively across the world, and some loans are long-term but not indefinite’.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba1b0dec7be569654853598ed8df9d009b5f8bff/0_445_6981_4189/master/6981.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bf43450113c87aa5935a5e581dd5f81","title":"man booker prize sponsorship","story":"Hedge fund’s departure as £1.6m backer of the UK’s leading fiction award has prompted feverish speculation about the prize’s futurePrevious Man Booker prize winners are among those keenly awaiting the announcement of the new sponsor of the prestigious literary award, after the prize’s sponsor of almost two decades, Man Group, became the latest in a wave of companies pulling out of backing book prizes.The hedge fund, which has sponsored the £50,000 literary award since 2002, announced on Sunday that it would end its association with the prize after 2019, which cost them £1.6m a year.

It looks as though they’ll get sponsorship but it would be an interesting climatic change over the book industry if they don’t.”While it is not the only financial corporation to take on a literary prize – investment management firms Baillie Gifford and Rathbones currently sponsor the Samuel Johnson and Folio prizes respectively – some have speculated that Man Group pulled out due to criticism of their role as a financial institution, as well as their influence on the prize. In July, author Sebastian Faulks branded Man Group “the enemy”, saying: “Man Group are not the sort of people who should be sponsoring literary prizes. They’re the kind of people literary prizes ought to be criticising.”Man oversaw several big changes to the prize, including the 2005 introduction of the Man Booker International prize, for translated writers, and a controversial change to eligibility rules that allowed writers from the US to enter for the first time in 2014. This led to widespread concerns that American authors would dominate, with two American winners in a row following soon after – Paul Beatty in 2016 and George Saunders in 2017.Irish novelist John Banville, author of The Sea, which won the Booker in 2005, suggested that a new sponsor could restore the prize to being only open to writers from Commonwealth countries.“As we know, public interest in the prize has seriously lapsed since eligibility was widened to allow in American writers. Indeed, this could be the chance to return the prize to what it used to be, an exclusively British institution – along with the Commonwealth and Ireland, that is – that the world regarded with keen if bemused interest, like cricket or the monarchy,” he said.“It’s one of the most effective literary prizes in the world, but it’s obviously a good time for there to be a more collegial attitude from the existing management and a proper rethink of what the prize is and can continue to be in the future.”Another inidual in publishing who asked not to be named said: “We knew they were coming up for 10-year renewal, and I think the feeling was, from Man’s point of view, that there were more negative stories that they were having to absorb than positive ones. Obviously the opening-up to Americans was the most controversial one. I think everyone agrees that was really pushed through by Man themselves. They spent £25m over 18 years they must have felt, ‘Is it really worth the hassle?’ It could be that for Booker this is a really positive thing, having a chance to reboot. There’s a lot of speculation they might return to the UK and Commonwealth parameters.”At Curtis Brown, leading literary agent Jonny Geller said the news was not a huge shock. “I don’t know where the suggestion to open it up to become a global prize came from, but wherever it did, I think it was seen as a mistake and to have slightly backfired,” said Geller. “Everyone in publishing needs whatever help they can get to get books into people’s hands, and these prizes do that, so we all want it to work.”Former Booker judge Alex Clark said: “There’s also been a feeling that some of the glitz and hoopla gets in the way of celebrating the writing itself – perhaps a new sponsor might decide to dial some of that down.”The Man Group’s withdrawal comes after drinks company Baileys announced it would no longer solely sponsor the Women’s prize for fiction, later agreeing to remain with assistance from entertainment company Fremantle and NatWest bank.In response to the news, Joanna Prior, chair of the board of the Women’s prize, said corporate support was vital for literary awards: “Without corporate sponsorship, the work of bringing books into the lives of as many people as possible becomes ever harder.” Despite the new sponsor remaining a mystery, most agreed that the prize’s future was guaranteed. “It sounds like they already have someone lined up,” said one former publisher. “The Booker brand is still the Booker brand, the most famous prize in the English speaking language, full stop.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ead1d6402c2c9a2f09172b58fdcb7e44dce780a/0_291_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2310d79c97a4ee229f98f394324b22bd","title":"did you work for a uk high street chain that has closed","story":"For an upcoming project, we would like to hear from former workers of chain shops that shut about how it affected their livesWith thousands of high street shops closing over the last decade, communities have been rightly concerned about the decline and what the future holds.If you worked for a high street chain that shut down, we’d like to hear from you.

Tesco said it could not confirm how many outsourced jobs would be affected.Jason Tarry, the chief executive of Tesco’s UK and Irish business, said the market remained challenging and Tesco needed to adapt to remain competitive: “We’re making changes to our UK stores and head office to simplify what we do and how we do it, so we’re better able to meet the needs of our customers.”He said shoppers had less time to spend and so were using fresh food counters less frequently. Fish, meat and other fresh food counters will close in about 90 stores but remain trading in 700 more, some with reduced hours. Tesco said it did not plan any significant changes to its in-store bakeries this year.Staff canteens, which provide hot food in about a third of Tesco stores, are to replaced by self-service kitchen areas with vending machines.The company, Britain’s biggest retailer, said it was also moving to a simpler and leaner structure at its head office.Pauline Foulkes, the national officer for the Usdaw union, which represents thousands of Tesco staff, said: “Staff at Tesco are shocked and dismayed by the scale of yet another round of potential job losses, which clearly demonstrates the pressure retailers are under in the current very difficult and uncertain economic climate, as the cost-cutting continues. “This is devastating news for staff, who have played a crucial role in Tesco’s turnaround project, contributing to 12 successive quarters of growth, solid Christmas trading and over £1bn of profit.”The cuts are part of a plan to slash £1.5bn from Tesco’s cost base as the chief executive, Dave Lewis, tries to rebuild profits, which have never recovered from an accounting scandal in 2014.The company is also trying to simplify and cut costs to help it fight back against the discounters Aldi and Lidl, which are taking an increasing share of the market.Bruno Monteyne, an analyst at Bernstein Research, suggested that the latest cuts were likely to save Tesco up to £170m annually and would have been planned and tested for at least a year.“This not a knee-jerk reaction to the ‘competitive and challenging market’. The market is obviously tough but we think this language is as much about reminding staff and unions why Tesco had to embark on this four-year restructuring programme rather than indicating that things got worse recently,” he said in a note.Since Lewis took over five years ago, he has cut thousands of jobs. Last winter, 1,700 employees were affected when Tesco stripped out a layer of middle management. It has also closed its Cardiff call centre, with the loss of 1,100 jobs.All the major supermarkets have made job cuts in recent years as they have tried to reduce costs and lower prices for their shoppers while enduring heavy competition and rises in business rates, the legal minimum wage and some food costs.The retail sector as a whole shed 70,000 jobs in the final three months of 2018, according to recent data published by the British Retail Consortium trade body. It warned that nearly a third of retail businesses planned to shed staff in the coming months."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/936cb826e8c24b5b3a68de390b645b0695f0efaa/0_379_4146_2488/master/4146.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d31eae56dba1e81d86b01c2cfdff72a","title":"mugged by macaques the urban monkey gangs of kuala lumpur","story":"The next 15 megacities #10: As Malaysia’s ever-expanding capital swallows up their rainforest habitat, the macaques are turning to guerrilla warfare by  Jamie Fullerton in Kuala LumpurThe gang stop and stare, attention spiked by our car doors slamming. Ten pairs of eyes flit between our backpacks and our faces. Is it worth mugging us? Do our bags contain bananas or useless, inedible wallets and cameras? The monkeys of Kuala Lumpur’s Ampang district decide against it and head further down the road in the hunt for victims. The morning joggers here run with sticks.“Twenty years ago this was jungle,” says Viswa Hattan, an accountant jogging in the area. Gated high-rises loom ahead of us, the roads leading to them flanked by forest too dense to enter without machetes. Four macaques, babies clinging to their chests, loiter on a metal road barrier uphill from a construction site. “This was their area,” says Hattan as a nearby male macaque begins vigorously masturbating. “We’ve taken it from them.”By 2035 another 15 cities will have populations above 10 million, according to the latest United Nations projections, taking the total number of megacities to 48. Cities is exploring these newcomers at a crucial period in their development: from car-centric Tehran to the harsh inequalities of Luanda from the film industry of Hyderabad to the demolition of historic buildings in Ho Chi Minh City.We\u0027ll also be in Chengdu, Dar es Salaam, Nanjing, Ahmedabad, Surat, Baghdad, Kuala Lumpur, Xi\u0027an, Seoul, Wuhan and London.Read more from\u0026nbspthe next 15 megacities\u0026nbspseries here.The Malaysian capital’s dramatic urban expansion over the past 30 years has shunted much wildlife, including elephants and tigers, from its boundaries. The long-tailed macaques, though, have stayed, with the city’s growing human population providing them with a tempting source of thrown-away food.In 1980 the (human) population of Kuala Lumpur was less than 1 million it is now estimated at 7.6 million, and United Nations projections suggest it will surpass 10 million by 2032. While some of that growth has been in the central city zone, in massive structures such as the 90s-built Petronas Towers, the most rampant expansion has been at the outskirts of the city and in the surrounding lush forest.At suburban campuses such as that of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), complaints of messy monkey bin raids are rife. “They chase lecturers to the toilets,” says Prof Siti Aminah Osman, a deputy dean, as she stifles a laugh. In 2015 students mixed shrimp paste, spicy chilli and peanuts to feed the monkeys, to repel them. Now staff are working on “anti-monkey bins” with heavy lids.In KL Forest Eco Park, a slab of city-centre rainforest protected as a reserve since 1906, the macaque population is celebrated via cartoons on information boards. At Batu Caves, a popular Hindu temple site in north Kuala Lumpur, monkeys probably attract more tourists than the site’s enormous gold-painted statues. The caves back on to jungle, and the macaques crowd the area’s garishly painted staircase, swiping bags and creating top content for vloggers.Sethu Pathy, Batu Caves’ secretary, says the monkeys here rely on tourists for food, seemingly abandoning jungle foraging for a diet of chewing gum, stolen flower necklaces and hurled fruit. He supports his claim by lobbing bananas on the ground, causing a monkey melee before a macaque tips over a full cup of coffee left on a table. On the stairs, a monkey scoops its hand into a splatter pool of brown human vomit, then licks it clean.“Now we can’t see elephants or tigers in this district,” says Pathy, as the banana supply ends and the monkeys move off to explore nearby wheelie bins. “Day by day, land is being cleared for housing and factories. Natural habitats have been disposed of, but monkeys are still around. We occupied their habitat.”It is not all happy monkey families in the caves. Pathy says locals complain about the macaques stealing from them, and that eight years ago the Malaysian government’s wildlife department relocated many monkeys from the site to the forest.Around that time the department, reacting to complaints from the public about macaques across the peninsula, got tough. More than 57,000 long-tailed macaques were culled in Malaysia in 2010 – double the number from the year before. The figure rose above 97,000 in 2012, prompting a backlash from animal rights groups who claimed monkeys were sometimes shot out of trees, or captured in cages before being shot.With an average of 3,800 complaints from the public about long-tailed macaques made nationwide every year, the wildlife department’s culls have continued, with up to 70,000 of the animals killed annually between 2013 and 2016. The department declined to speak to the  but Ahmad Ismail, a biology professor at Universiti Putra Malaysia and president of the Malaysian Nature Society, says culling has been reduced over the past couple of years.Animal rights groups such as Sahabat Alam Malaysia have called for monkeys to be sterilised rather than culled, but although the wildlife department has experimented with castrating macaques, mass sterilisation would be very expensive. Ismail believes that focusing efforts on educating humans about interacting with monkeys is the most realistic way of reducing conflict between the species.Organisations including the Malaysia Nature Society already organise talks in schools about behaving around monkeys. Prof Badrul Munir of the UKM’s School of Environmental and Natural Resource Sciences says that if enough people refrain from feeding macaques where they congregate, the snack association eventually fades and they harass humans less.Whether monkey handouts decline or not, with Kuala Lumpur’s population due to surpass 10 million within 15 years, its human and its monkey residents look likely to have to share more and more living space. Many people in Malaysia are hoping for a future in which slightly fewer monkeys chase lecturers into toilet blocks, harass joggers and steal confidential military documents from postmen.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, explore our archive or sign up to receive our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/423e46473008ac5c7d15d8b95a28653baeffcb62/0_365_4061_2436/master/4061.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=421ced7651d94a0619a58f170b235c9d","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of sweet","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘sweet’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘sweet’.Share your photos of what sweet means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 30 January at 10am.

I spent a summer season in the kitchen of a restaurant in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, when I was 18 and had the time of my life. The people, the countryside, the food, I loved it all, and I’ve longed to go back ever since. Last year, I finally returned on an epic six-week food tour of the country.When you think of Canada, I guess you think of mountains, forest, and bears, right? That’s only half the story, but it’s true: the country has a vast natural beauty on a scale we just don’t see in Europe. As I travelled all over, Canada’s vistas constantly stopped me in my tracks. Just when you think you have seen it all – “Nothing, surely, can top Lake Louise, this has to be Canada’s most breathtaking spot!” – two days later you’re on a ranch in Alberta, riding a stallion, hearing about a cougar or a grizzly bear sighting nearby. Canada makes you look at the world through the eyes of a child. Constantly fascinated, completely immersed.The wildlife I expected, what I was not prepared for was how vibrant and unique Canada’s cities are, and the rich foodie scene that each deserves to be proud of.Time and time again I experienced cultural centres humming and sparkling with the day-to-day life of food shopping, eating out or grabbing a coffee. I was astonished and delighted by the quality of the markets and shops, and Canada’s incredibly strong field-to-plate movement, which ensures the freshest, tastiest raw ingredients. Below are a few of my culinary highlights from the trip.Montréal is a befuddling enclave of Francophone culture in this mainly English-speaking country. The city practically fizzes with fierce French passion and values, which you can’t help but be charmed by. I fell in love with its French-style model economy of independent boulangerie, boucher and pâtisserie.Montréal to me was more than just foodie heaven, it was a blueprint for how a city could be. It’s a city that cares about the little things, such as bookshops, delicatessens, decent coffee and croissants the provenance of goods, and the importance of heritage. Montréal is full of independent shops that have been around for generations. From opening their doors every morning to closing at night, they are committed to the simple idea of creating just one thing of value – a coffee or a salt beef sandwich – and taking enjoyment and pride in the “means”.The aforementioned perfect salt beef sandwich was enjoyed at one of Montréal’s ultimate foodie landmarks, Schwartz’s. The smoked-meat experts have been trading on Saint-Laurent Boulevard since 1928, when established by Jewish immigrant Reuben Schwartz. Unlike many places, Schwartz’s still smokes its meat the old-fashioned way: with a 10-day marinade and then an eight-hour smoke before it’s sliced in front of your eyes. Frank Silva, the manager, has worked here since he was a boy, something I found time and again in Montréal. In an age when there is often little customer or staff loyalty to establishments, I found it truly enchanting.The city also lays claim to the world’s best bagel – or, rather, two of the world’s best. Locally, it is considered an undisputed fact that you won’t find a better bagel than the ones made here, but the jury is very much out over which Montréal institution is superior: St-Viateur Bagel or Fairmont Bagel. Some favour St-Viateur for the honey water they boil their bagels in, while Fairmont is so in demand it stays open 24 hours a day. Both, to me, were perfection – yet another example of the city’s impassioned, artisanal approach to food.Halifax, the capital of Nova Scotia, has a kicking live music scene, along with a fabulous market culture. The city’s Seaport Farmers’ Market on the waterfront is the oldest continuously operating farmers’ market in North America, the hub for a long list of cheese makers, fruit and vegetable producers, and wine growers from the plentiful farms in the nearby Annapolis valley. At the stall for That Dutchman’s Cheese Farm, I sampled Dragon’s Breath – one of the stinkiest, creamiest, most kick-ass blue cheeses you could imagine.But it is Halifax’s craft beer scene that rivals anything I’ve seen anywhere else. At the Good Robot Brewing Co, the female brew team of Erica Fraser and Kelly Costello create beers with locally foraged herbs and medicinal plants. The list of brews is extensive – on reflection, I may have investigated it a little too thoroughly.And the restaurants also punch way above their weight. I found classic comfort food at 2 Doors Down, where the braised Prince Edward Island beef short rib is knockout, while Halifax’s privileged coastal position also makes it a hotspot for seafood.Ontario in east-central Canada is the province I have spent the most time in over the years, since working here as a teen, and it still feels like a home away from home. Capital city Toronto is such an enthralling city, with so much going on. What sets it apart from other cities is the sheer wealth of its ethnic communities happily living and eating together. It is one of the world’s most multicultural cities – in fact, a survey by BBC Radio named it the most erse, ahead even of London. Just over half of its residents are foreign-born, hailing from 230 different nationalities. This shows in the food scene, a heavyweight collection of authentic ethnic cuisines alongside young chefs developing and modernising traditional flavours.Here, I had stand-out Indian and Vietnamese, while Mexican food is on the rise in a big way. My favourite restaurant, and the one that sums this all up, was Snack Bar 416 (pictured above). A small hipster joint near bohemian Kensington Market, it uses all the city’s main ethnic communities as inspiration, taking one hero dish from each cuisine. Often when this pick-and-mix approach is attempted it falls flat on its face, with compromise and inexperience resulting in bland creations. Not here, not in Toronto.One of the best ways to take the culinary temperature of a city is to see how its various establishments serve brunch. I hit two spots and became addicted to Chambar on the edge of Gastown, the hipster area of the city, and the waffle heaven of Medina, which served incredible dishes with imagination and attention to detail. And then came the holy grail: a killer cup of coffee. Revolver, again in Gastown, is the coffee shop St Peter would open outside the pearly gate. Trust me.For more information and inspiration, see explore-canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/597305e020ab2ad32cb503da49f25aff335f0cf4/0_432_5197_3118/master/5197.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a048cd5a81fdd7e6e30a6f0caf192af1","title":"the lowdown on nova scotia canadas seaside paradise","story":"Sandy beaches, snug harbours and (possibly) the best lobster roll in the world.

It can be reached in just over six hours from the UK with flights departing all year from Heathrow and, during high season, also from Gatwick and Glasgow. This year-round destination offers all manner of adventures in the great outdoors, plus a thriving live music scene and out-of-this-world seafood. Here’s how to pack the best of Nova Scotia into your trip …Nova Scotia is best known for its seafood – you’ll be hard pressed to find a better lobster roll anywhere (don’t miss those at Capt. Kat’s Lobster Shack in Barrington). It is also one of Canada’s premier wine regions, with no fewer than 18 vineyards and wineries. The Wolfville Magic Winery Bus is the first of its kind in North America, a hop-on, hop-off bus tour of five scenic and storied wineries in the Annapolis Valley.The Nova Scotia lobster and chowder trails will spoil you with remarkably fresh seafood, offering the most authentic boat-to-table experience possible – from lobster dinners to hearty chowder and everything in between.And you can’t visit the region without trying the donair (a pitta filled with roasted shaved beef, tomatoes and onions, slathered in a sweet, garlic sauce). Go directly to the source: King Of Donair in Halifax, Nova Scotia’s capital and the biggest city in Atlantic Canada. Enjoy seaside dining at The Bicycle Thief, located on the thriving, ever-developing waterfront locals love the tuna carpaccio and meatballs stuffed with fior di latte mozzarella. The Wooden Monkey, meanwhile, is a sustainability-minded, award-winning eatery that prides itself on sourcing almost all of its ingredients, produce and drinks locally. Visit its Dartmouth location across the harbour for stunning views of the Halifax skyline, afterwards visit Edna in Halifax’s booming North End is great for tapas and cocktails.Nearby is Peggy’s Cove, one of the province’s most popular and most photographed destinations, thanks to its famous lighthouse and breathtaking coastal views. Enjoy the Oceanstone Resort’s Ultimate Lobster Feast and Peggy’s Cove Adventure, where the resort’s executive chef guides you as you choose your own lobster from Ryer’s Lobster Pound, and after experiencing Peggy’s Cove and craft beer tasting, feast on lobster at sunset.In September, Halifax hosts the FIN: Atlantic International Film Festival celebrating both local and international film-makers. Then, in October, 150 musicians, comedians and speakers come together for the Halifax Pop Explosion, showcasing emerging music and art. A popular draw in the summer, the Halifax Jazz Festival, the oldest in Atlantic Canada, attracts some of the best musicians in the world to a city-wide extravaganza.One of Nova Scotia’s most famous artists is Maud Lewis (played by Sally Hawkins in the award-winning 2016 film Maudie), many of whose naïve, child-like paintings depict rural Nova Scotia. Her work is on display at the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia. The province is also home to a rich and erse cultural heritage, including Mi’kmaq and First Nations, African Nova Scotian, Acadian and Celtic and Gaelic peoples, all of whom have shaped Nova Scotia’s story.There are many museums dotted around the province that bring to life the story of all these peoples. You can find out about African Nova Scotians at the Black Loyalist Heritage Centre in Birchtown on the South Shore – it takes visitors through the journey of early black settlers in Nova Scotia. And discover the history of the Acadian people – descendants from the French settlers – at the Grand-Pré national historic site and at Le Village Historique Acadien de la Nouvelle-Écosse. While, the Highland Village Museum is a living history museum and cultural centre that celebrates the Gaelic experience in Nova Scotia.The Bay of Fundy boasts the highest tides in the world – around 16 metres – and thanks to the Tidal Bore Rafting Resort you can – literally – ride that wave. The Shubenacadie River (don’t worry, the locals just call it “Shubie”) is known for its beauty and for regular sightings of bald eagles. Unforgettably, you can enjoy a seafood and wine tasting on a sandbar before 160bn tonnes of water fill up the estuary.Kejimkujik national park and national historic site is a special place to experience the outdoors with great camping, canoeing and hiking opportunities. Also, learn about the Mi’kmaq, a founding people of Nova Scotia and, to this day, the biggest indigenous group in the province. Hear their stories, see ancient petrogylphs (carvings in stone) and a re-created Mi’kmaw encampment, and paddle the ancient waterways.Biking is another great way to see the province. Train Station Bike \u0026amp Bean in St. Margaret’s Bay is a hidden gem where you can rent a bicycle and enjoy a magnificent ride along the Rum Runners Trail on a former railbed. You will get to see several seaside communities along the South Shore, including Mahone Bay and Chester all the way to Lunenburg.The world-famous Cabot Trail winds its way around and through Cape Breton Highlands national park the 185-mile loop is one of Canada’s genuine wonders. Save a few days to drive around and enjoy the cultural heritage sites and scenic coastal viewpoints. Leave time, though, to hike one of the many trails such as Skyline or Franey in the national park for glimpses of moose, bald eagles and other wildlife.While summer and autumn are the most popular times to visit, there’s plenty to enjoy all year round.

Walker, the same age as Taylor and of similar background, found himself confronting a gang of local racists and, after first fighting back, went to extraordinary lengths to fit in and gain their friendship.The film features interviews with Walker looking back 15 years on from the events he describes, which are re-enacted in the locations where they took place, with Kai Francis Lewis playing Walker.Responding to the nomination, Walker said that he was, “humbled and proud.

Now she’s in a brutal sex-trafficking drama and speaking out about skin lightening and shortsighted directorsFreida Pinto’s role in her new film Love Sonia is shocking. She plays a desperate sex worker in a brutal tale of trafficking. Rashmi is complex, edgy and selfish – everything you wouldn’t expect of a Pinto character. After all, the Indian actor, who made her name in Danny Boyle’s phenomenally successful Slumdog Millionaire, has spent much of her career playing eye candy. And she is sick of it.Love Sonia is relentless. A debt-ridden father sells his teenage daughter Preeti to a landlord, who then trafficks her to a brothel in Mumbai. Her sister Sonia, brilliantly played by newcomer Mrunal Thakur, goes in search of her, and is also ensnared in the trafficking web. She is anally raped to preserve her value as a virgin. Having lost her virginity, she is stitched so she can once again be sold as untouched. Just when you think things can’t get worse, they do.Pinto’s older sex worker appears to befriend Sonia, but ultimately betrays her to protect herself. This is a world without love or loyalty and reflects a stark reality. Last year, India was named the most dangerous country for women in terms of human trafficking, by a Thomson Reuters Foundation survey of 550 experts on women’s issues. Love Sonia has been 10 years in the making. Pinto was first shown an early version of the script by director Tabrez Noorani the day after she finished shooting Slumdog Millionaire. Noorani, a line producer on Slumdog Millionaire, wrote Love Sonia after helping to rescue trafficked women from brothels. But it took another decade to finesse the script, get financial backing and find the right Sonia.After Slumdog Millionaire, in which Pinto played Latika, a street kid described as “the most beautiful girl in the world”, she was keen for a more demanding role. But in hindsight, she says she wasn’t ready for Love Sonia. She was too unworldly. “I thought it was exaggerated when I read the script. I couldn’t believe what I was reading.” Later, when she met trafficked sex workers advising on the film, she began to think that, if anything, the story had been understated. She winces when she recalls a question she asked one of them. “I said: ‘Hypothetically speaking, if you had a chance to leave this world, let’s say you fell in love and found somebody who’d treat you right for once, would you escape?’ And she said to me: ‘Madam, love only exists in your world. In my world, there is just betrayal.’”The trajectory of Pinto’s career in the years after Slumdog certainly didn’t suggest she would ever make a hard-hitting film about sex trafficking. Time after time, she played the vapid love interest, characters so underwritten that they struggled to be one-dimensional. So in Woody Allen’s You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger, Josh Brolin’s author, Roy, spends his time staring longingly out of the window at Pinto’s Dia in the flat opposite. When he confesses this to her, she says: “I’ve always wanted to be someone’s muse.” In Terence Mallick’s Knight of Cups, she is a pouting femme fatale who states: “I don’t want to wreak havoc in men’s lives any more.” In Miral, directed by Julian Schnabel, she plays a Palestinian heroine whose boyfriend tells her she has “beautiful eyes”, while an Israeli interrogator tells her: “You have a beautiful face … you won’t recognise it when you get out of here.” Some of the world’s best-known directors have been so fixated on her looks that they forgot to create a character for her. “They couldn’t go past what they saw on the outside,” Pinto says. “And that’s their problem, not mine, right, because I know what I can bring to the table as talent.”It has been a strange, decade-long career, including an unexplained extended break. Meanwhile, off-screen she has been an assertive force for good, consistently campaigning for the rights of women. Does she see a contradiction between her feminism and the films she has made? “Completely! There was no way I agreed with so much that I did in my early career.” Pinto takes me through some of her experiences, with jaw-dropping honesty. She loved working with Brolin on the Allen film (“Josh taught me to relax because I would get really worked up before each take – I was too nervous to breathe and my body would stiffen”), but has nothing positive to say of her part. “I was just the muse, the ingenue.” Would she work again with Allen, who has been accused by his daughter Dylan of sexual assault (an allegation he denies)? “No. Absolutely not. I wouldn’t work with him because I’m in solidarity with women who have come out with their stories, whether they are proven or not. I’m just going to stick to what my gut instinct tells me. I’m 34 years old, I’ve worked for 11 years in this industry, I’m not desperate and I will never be desperate.”Then it is on to another unhappy experience, Rise of the Planet of the Apes, made in 2011. Pinto was looking forward to playing a smart, independent-minded primatologist. But it didn’t work out that way. “I felt completely undermined as the only female perfomer in the film who wasn’t given a task other than to be a primatologist in frickin’ high heels and follow the men around. Have you seen Jane Goodall wearing high heels and running on the Golden Gate Bridge? I don’t think so. I spoke to one of the producers and asked why I was put in high heels because it didn’t make sense for my character – if she was so hands-on with animals, she needed freedom of movement and her body language needed to be different. I wish I’d been more confident in putting my case forward back then, but I remember asking him what his reference was and I was told Megan Fox from Transformers and I was like – that is a completely different film.” Again, she doesn’t write off the experience – she got to work with some of her favourite actors, including Andy Serkis and John Lithgow – but she does write off her role in the film.Pinto is not finished yet. Now we are on to Black Gold, a historical epic about the scramble for oil in the Arabian desert in the 1920s. “In Black Gold, what was I? Like a princess who had no say, who was just in love … I can’t even remember the story, that’s how bad it is.” And she is really trying hard to remember her character now. “Oh my God! What was my role? I have no frickin clue! Oh my God, that’s terrible.” In 30 years of interviewing, I have never heard somebody trash their career so comprehensively – or honestly.Pinto is on a brief visit to Britain from Los Angeles, where she now lives, to promote Love Sonia. We meet at the central London hotel where she is staying. She arrives quietly, orders a camomile tea and gets on with it. Pinto is, of course, gorgeous slightly built, but strong-looking. She is also bright, intense and combative. In her tracksuit top and bottoms and surprisingly large trainers (size eight and a half), she resembles a Hollywood action hero. Her accent is a weird global confection – cut-glass English, Indian, American, with an upward Aussie inflection. She says people tell her she sounds South African.Pinto was born in Mumbai (then still Bombay) to Mangalorean Catholics – her mother was a school principal, her father a bank manager. She went to convent school and was a confident, outspoken girl. She says she soon felt stymied by the dogma of the church. “I was 13 or 14 when I heard a priest talk about homosexuality in a sermon. He asked us to pray for them through this illness, this sickness, what they’re going through, hoping that they would come out the other side, finding the answer in Jesus. After mass, I questioned him. I said: ‘What makes you think it’s an illness?’”Her parents worried that she was too opinionated, and she admits at times she was. “I was very candid a bit too honest. When I was six or seven years old, there was this young boy, probably about 16, who sang a Christmas carol during Sunday mass, and he was terrible. He came over to wish the family happy Christmas and I said: ‘Hey, you sang terribly at mass today, you shouldn’t sing.’ And my mum was like: ‘Oh my God, I’m so embarrassed, I’m so sorry that my daughter is so rude.’” Would she do that now? “Of course not because I’ve been told not to do it, or I’ll find a better way of putting it, but I was a bit too blunt as a child, and that was terrible. I hurt the poor boy’s feelings.” How did he react? “Apparently he was very upset. My mum told me he never sang again after that.”She studied English literature, and after graduating in 2005 went into modelling. Two years later, she was cast in Slumdog Millionaire, despite having no acting experience. The film won eight Oscars, including best picture and director. She and her co-star, British actor Dev Patel, were suddenly world famous. Everybody wanted a share of their fairytale – they became a couple in real life, and were together for six years. Pinto found herself in demand across the world – not just as an actor, but also to flog products. In 2009, she signed a lucrative contract to became the face of L’Oréal.Life really was amazing. “I was riding the waves and going to all the fashion weeks on the front row. And travelling first class, and holidays and blah blah blah. And every director I wanted to meet wanted to meet me too.”And then they offered her parts. And time after time they disappointed. For the first time in her life, she lost confidence. Did she feel exposed because she hadn’t trained as an actor? “Yes, I felt like people around me knew more how to do things. All I had was instinct. I lost the innocence that comes with confidence. The blind faith. Spontaneity.”Even the films she was proud of prompted uncomfortable questions – in Michael Winterbottom’s Trishna, based on Tess of the D’urbervilles, she wanted to know why she had to be so passive. When she was cast as the eponymous Palestinian heroine of Miral, she wondered why. “I worried that I wasn’t Arab enough to play the role, so how were they going to convince the audience?” Again, she stresses the positives – Schnabel treated her with respect and she learned about the politics of the Middle East. In Desert Dancer, she was cast as an Iranian, and again asked why. But she knew the answer really. “It’s the same reason Ridley Scott was questioned on why they had non-Egyptian actors playing Egyptian roles in Gods of Egypt. To get the film financed and sold, they came to the person they thought was closest to that culture. Having said that, Iran and India have nothing in common. We’re two different parts of the world.”Did she ever think of sticking two fingers up at the film industry and walking way? “Yeah, I did. And it cost me two and a half years. I didn’t work for two and a half years.” At 28, she says, she had an existential crisis. “I thought: is this something I really want to do, or am I just doing it because I got this amazing start to my career and now this is all I know how to do?”So she waited for a good job to come along. And waited. “I didn’t know if I’d ever get a job again because out of sight could be so out of mind.” Was she offered lots of roles? “Yes, but – trust me – they were not worth my time.” Does she regret turning any of them down? “No. The films were big, but the roles were not good enough to regret.”I ask if she ever struggled for money. “No, no. That was the saving grace. I had a lucrative brand endorsement deal – a seven-year contract that kept me afloat. I’m grateful to L’Oréal for ever.” In 2011, her L’Oréal contract came under scrutiny when it was suggested that the company had lightened her skin in a campaign. Had they Photoshopped the image? L’Oréal denies altering her skin tone but she says: “I’m sure they did, because that’s not the colour of my skin you saw in a few of the campaigns.” Did she complain? “I said to my agent after the first controversy that I would like to see the pictures before, and I would like to be able to question them on colour correction.” She also insisted on having a clause written into her contract. “All the brands, including L’Oréal, have a skin-lightening range that they sell in India and I made them put it in my contract that I would not touch that with a barge pole. If you don’t put it in your contract before you sign on, they can come and you will be compelled to do it.” After she protested about the skin-lightening, she says, it never happened again. (L’Oréal has been approached for a comment.) Pinto has lived in Los Angeles for nine years, and says she feels at home there her boyfriend, adventure photographer Cory Tran, is also LA-based. She often spends time in Mumbai, where her parents and sister still live.In 2017, she returned to the screen with Guerrilla, a TV drama about Britain’s black power movement. Pinto’s underground activist Jas Mitra was a formidable character, leading from the front. She says this was the start of her reinvention as an actor. At one point Jas says to one of the men in her life: “The first chance you get, you reduce me to my looks.” I tell her it feels personal – that it could be aimed at directors such as Allen or Mallick. “Yep!” she says, with a broad smile. She says that bit of dialogue was the result of a conversation she had with Guerrilla director John Ridley. “I talked to John about looks and how they hold people back and I told him how crazy it is to be a little fed up to be told you’re beautiful. I know I sound ungrateful, but I’m not. I’m very grateful for what I have, but I’m fed up of hearing other people tell me that or remind me of that.”As for now, Pinto could not be happier that nobody is likely to come out of Love Sonia discussing her looks. On its release in India, the film was not been warmly received. “People haven’t welcomed a film that exposes the underbelly of the country. It hasn’t done well.” But she says she is not going to judge the film’s success by its box-office takings – highlighting the trafficking scandal is far more important.In many ways, Pinto is just starting out as an actor – and still has much to prove. But despite everything she has said today, she insists there is nothing she would change. If she hadn’t done all the naff work, she says, she wouldn’t be where she is now – and it’s great to have got her existential crisis out of the way. “I’m glad the reality check happened. Now I think I can finally say I’ve figured things out for myself.”Love Sonia is on general release"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8138d3b4f59cc47527bca8a5c08b8d4a07bfed2/313_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55b7bc6754b15978a3ee4fa754cb28c8","title":"knock down the house review alexandria ocasio cortez doc brings down the house","story":"An inspiring documentary about four female insurgents taking on the system proves impossible to resistGrowing up in the United States, one of the bigger selling points our elementary school teachers had for our system of government was the concept of No More Kings. Anyone could run for office and win! As I got older, I saw how this wasn’t really the case. To win an election you need to be part of the establishment. Maybe this isn’t quite the meritocracy I was sold? (Also, slaveholders wanting to be free: what’s up with that?)Recent elections have upended the system. Donald John Trump, mouth-breathing narcissistic xenophobe he may be, does (and I really hate admitting this) somewhat live up to the “anyone can do it!” promise I was taught as a child. A complete novice from outside the political class bankrolled (and steamrolled) himself into the White House. He’s a disaster, but his victory is undeniably remarkable. But the pendulum swings back, and two years later a young bartender from the Bronx pulled her own upset, using nothing but wit, will, knowledge, perseverance and confidence, and did it with practically no money. The victory of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez over the entrenched political “boss” Joe Crowley isn’t quite winning the presidency, but Rachel Lears’ documentary Knock Down The House rolls up its sleeves to show just how extraordinary her campaign was.Lears follows AOC and three other insurgent, nothing-to-lose female candidates “primary”-ing longtime incumbents from the left. They include Cori Bush, an African American woman in the Missouri district where unarmed teen Michael Brown was killed by police officers in 2014, Paula Jean Swearengin, a West Virginia woman whose community has been upended by fracking, and Amy Vilela, a no-nonsense Las Vegas woman who went from being a single mother on food stamps to having a C-suite position whose core issue is healthcare. (Her daughter passed away after being refused treatment for not having the right insurance.) All four were “selected” (though it’s a little fuzzy how) by the groups Justice Democrats and Brand New Congress as part of a push for ersity in political representation.The bulk of this spry, under-90-minutes film is on AOC. How could it not? She’s an international superstar and ratings-driver for both leftwing and rightwing cable news. While this is not Frederick Wiseman-esque pure “direct cinema” there are enough sequences that lean into that fly-on-the-wall type of film-making. As such, one comes away with really knowing what makes AOC tick, proving that she really is as good as she seems on TV and social media. (Also we get to meet her boyfriend, which was a first for me he seems quite nice.)It was interesting to watch this at its premiere at the Sundance film festival, with a crowd of supporters, some of whom clearly knew the candidates. The audience launched into applause numerous times at great quotes, but, weirdly, I think that somewhat belittles the project. Anyone can make a propaganda video to rile up the base, especially when these four women are saying such noble things about civil rights and the betterment of the working class. But Knock Down The House is far more effective when it is about the people and the process, not landing quips. There is a lot of tedium in running for a local election. Knocking on doors, being friendly when people blow you off, making calls for $50 donations, taking “three hours now” to scrutinized collected signatures so they don’t “waste six of your days later in court”.I can’t imagine anyone not finding this movie inspiring. It is a classic David and Goliath scenario, with clueless, dopey Joe Crowley disrespecting his challenger (sending a proxy to a debate!) until it is far too late. Everyone likes an underdog story, and when the underdog is as eloquent, passionate and righteous as these four women are, the final reels of this film feel like a Rocky movie. Knock Down The House (and AOC) rightly positions a victory for one woman as a step forward for everyone, and her final interview, a childhood reminiscence of her late father on a road trip to Washington DC, is one of the most touching speeches about government I’ve ever seen. For a minute, I once again believed what my teachers once told me."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df20d3a1a74de7232b56845d773b80c3cdb2c43e/406_129_1597_958/master/1597.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81cd9ed93631d73d32f8823491eb4caa","title":"the lego movie 2 the second part review chris pratt","story":"Duplo figures from outer space threaten the world of Lego in a ceaselessly inventive, eyeball-popping, nonstop gag-stormThe second Lego Movie is even better than the original: a sophisticated new adventure that gives us a new look at how the universality of the Lego universe was more gendered than we thought. There’s hilarious voice-work artistry, ceaselessly inventive pop-culture riffs (“Ooooh – reference!” says someone), eyeball-popping graphics and a 107-minute nonstop gag-storm of a screenplay from Phil Lord and Christopher Miller.My favourite moment of superfluous script brilliance comes when an intensely annoying teenage vampire announces in a sensitive voice: “I also DJ on the side and wear women’s jeans.” My only qualification is that the Lego figures are permitted a supernatural ability to operate in the live-action real world of the family’s house, which is arguably a bit of a cheat – but that’s done with great wit, like everything else.We left the first movie on a note of existential anxiety. The kid in the real-world basement is informed that from now on his younger sister will be playing and the creatures of the Lego universe were horrified by the appearance of Duplo: great big blocks with new pinky-cutesy colours. The masculine world of Lego is threatened.The Duplo figures are, in fact, resident in a distant spaceship and make irregular incursions that the indigenous Lego creatures consider to be hugely aggressive. After years of bitter warfare, their hometown has been grimly renamed Apocalypseburg (“a heckish place to live”), no longer is everything awesome, and the chipper singing of Emmet (tremendously voiced by Chris Pratt) is out of joint with the times. He is increasingly considered inappropriate to what Apocalypseburg needs: a tough warrior. This is especially true of Lucy (Elizabeth Banks), a badass who not so secretly despises Emmet’s inability to master stereotypically manly mannerisms.Then the creatures of Duplo arrive with an order: Apocalypseburg’s foremost citizens must travel to the distant outpost of Sustar to attend a wedding. Their enemies’ leader Queen Watevra Wa’Nabi (voiced by Tiffany Haddish) has imperiously announced her desire to get hitched to Apocalypseburg’s most eligible unmarried man: Batman (growlingly voiced by Will Arnett) who furiously announces that he wishes to remain a “Bat-chelor”. Is this an overture of friendship or an insidious plan to undermine our heroes’ masculine toughness and self-reliance with the girly stratagem of a wedding?There is no doubt about it: some of the protagonists are beguiled by the avowedly feminised concept of a lavish wedding, but Emmet’s own crisis of masculinity appears solved by the appearance of tough, attractively stubbled adventurer Rex Dangervest (also voiced by Pratt), who keeps curtly telling everyone he doesn’t want to explain his backstory before doing just that.TLM2 is speckled with references to 2001: A Space Odyssey (the “stargate” has become the “stairgate”, which leads to the disturbing world beyond the basement), to the Toy Stories and to The Matrix. The characters are periodically besieged by worries about the reality of what they experience and by their own inevitable obsolescence. They are terrified of being banished to the exotic land of “storage”, pronounced like a French word. But the structure and themes of the film have to be perceived within a pointilliste spray of brilliant gags. Each inidual joke is the point the movie keeps delivering a dizzying rush of material. What a rush."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e401bbea839951e0fe3d7559a1963b40471ec1f1/0_49_2755_1653/master/2755.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0dbeb2359d403b42dff9d159915ef531","title":"barnet brentford fa cup fourth round match report","story":"Barnet, the last non-league side in this season’s FA Cup, refuse to leave the competition without a fight. They may yet advance to the fifth round for the first time in their history. Brentford will certainly not expect an easy ride in the replay at Griffin Park after this thrilling, see-sawing and controversial draw at the Hive.“Brilliant, what a game!” said Barnet’s manager, Darren Currie. “I loved it. That’s what football is supposed to be about. And we get to do it again next week.”Apparently Barnet’s players were initially underwhelmed by this tie, several of them apparently groaning when they were pitted against Brentford, rather than more prestigious opponents, after pulling off a shock win at Sheffield United in the third round. So the fifth-round draw, made just before kick-off here, was probably not greeted with euphoria in the home dressing room, a potential trip to Swansea City being no closer to the stuff of dreams. But making history surely is and Barnet’s players were clearly fuelled by the knowledge that they could boldly go where their club had never been. There was a record crowd of 6,215 at the Hive to witness their valiant attempt to confound expectations again.Nine miles separate these London clubs but in terms of ability they are supposed to be worlds apart, with 70 teams between the Championship side and their non-league hosts in the football pyramid. For a while Currie’s men even threatened to win, as Shaq Coulthirst’s second goal of the game put Barnet 2-1 in front early in the second half. Brentford soon drew level thanks to a penalty by Neal Maupay and might have thought they had definitively restored the natural order when Sergi Canos made it 3-2. But there was a final sting in the tail from this clash of Bees, as Dan Sparkes made it 3-3 by curling a brilliant free-kick into the net via the underside of the crossbar.“My biggest credit to Darren Currie, the Barnet players and their crowd,” said Brentford’s Danish manager, Thomas Frank. “They did everything to create this moment. I definitely felt the English culture of the FA Cup.”There was little sign in the early stages of the high jinks to come. Will Huffer, making only his second senior start after being loaned from Leeds United because of suspension to Barnet’s first-choice goalkeeper, Mark Cousins, did not need to make a save until the 20th minute thanks to the vigilance of his defence. But moments after stopping a tame effort by Canos he was beaten by a fierce long-range shot from Moses Odubajo that bounced out off the post.Despite having less of the ball, the feisty hosts posed plenty of problems to their visitors but were undone by a flash of class from Ollie Watkins five minutes before the break. The midfielder rammed a low shot beyond Huffer from nearly 30 yards.Home supporters in the Bees Terrace spent half-time dancing to keep themselves warm and their spirits up. Five minutes into the second period they jumped for joy as Barnet drew level. Ephron Mason-Clark created the goal with a run down the right before crossing for Coulthirst, who poked into the net from 10 yards. The home team were not satisfied: three minutes later they seized the lead, provoking mayhem in the visitors’ defence before Coulthirst, once a teammate of Harry Kane in Tottenham’s U-23s, fired into the net. “I encourage him to express himself,” said Currie of Coulthirst. “I expect him to express himself,” said Currie.”When he gets into the final third, whatever makes him happy, just go do it.”Brentford equalised quickly but not without controversy, Maupay converting a penalty kick awarded when Watkins went down under a challenge by David Tutonda. “It was a wonderful e, to be fair,” deadpanned Currie, who said he was told that Watkins apologised to Tutonda after Maupay scored. Frank insisted his player is no er. “For me Ollie Watkins is one of the most honest players I know and he will never e on purpose,” he said.Both teams chased victory in a rollicking last half-hour. Brentford struck through a high-class counter-attack in the 72nd minute, Canos finishing neatly after a pass from the right from Henrik Dalsgaard,, who had just been sprung from the bench.

But then football has always liked to sell itself as an intangible global force for good, as opposed to a highly successful global force for merchandising, sponsorship and soft power.From the branding of Qatar 2022 as an underdog “new frontier” to Sven-Göran Eriksson’s famous “ball of peace” – a Fifa-backed plan that saw Sven travelling the world getting assorted embattled groups to kick the same football, thereby bringing about, er, world peace – there is a general doublespeak about football’s ever more complex place in the tides of geopolitics.It is a process laid out in the most fascinating way at the current Asian Cup. The tournament has already entered its endgame. Japan beat Iran 3-0 in the first semi-final on Monday. In the second, scheduled for 6pm local time on Tuesday in the Mohamed bin Zayed stadium in Abu Dhabi, Qatar will face the hosts, the UAE, in the second of the tournament’s “Blockade Derbies”.For Qatar this represents real footballing progress and a shot at a first ever final in this competition. Football aside, it is also perhaps the most fascinating fixture in world football’s calendar right now, a meeting of the sport’s two most aggressively expansionist states – Manchester City versus Paris Saint-Germain by proxy – and a primer on exactly how Fifa, football and Gulf state politics remain irrevocably tangled.Qatar is, of course, in a state of blockade by the UAE and its immediate neighbours. The current stand-off reached a nadir last summer when the Saudis announced plans to build a trench along the shared border filled with sewerage, effectively turning Qatar into an island cut off from the rest of the world by a river of radioactive human excrement. Quick, Sven! The ball of peace!None of this has stopped the current tournament rolling on well enough. There has already been one Blockade Derby – Qatar beating Saudi Arabia 2-0 in the group stages. Some booing aside, the game passed off without rancour, although it is this lack of obvious fire, and indeed any overwhelming public interest, that has been a concern.Crowds have been spare to middling. Five thousand watched Iran play their opening game against Yemen in the 40,000-capacity Bin Zayed. Some fans have reported being asked by officials to move to seats directly in line with the TV cameras, while there have been unconfirmed reports of mass ticket giveaways.Otherwise, as a regional dry run for Qatar 2022 – and consumed at one remove – it has looked to be a fun and occasionally sparky tournament. Temperatures have hovered manageably between 25 and 30 degrees.The success of the Qatari team will come as a huge relief back home after a series of painstaking false starts. The semi-finalists have been a potent counter-attacking force under the former Barcelona youth coach Félix Sánchez Bas, with five wins from five, 12 goals scored and none conceded.Of more concern is the way this has all bubbled away largely unnoticed beneath Europe’s steamrollering winter club programme. As the clock ticks down there is as yet no solution to the logistical problem of what happens to all this scheduled football during the World Cup winter of November and December 2022.What is certain is leagues will be suspended. Broadcasters will be miffed. Revenues will be interrupted. Deals will be cut. As Fifa and Uefa continue their power struggle over football’s hyper-lucrative future, it all feels a bit like a game of global power-Jenga, with interests and influence stacked up over one another in a teetering superstructure. Its point of gravity will continue to linger over the Gulf, a source of heat and light that draws every part of the modern footballing world into its orbit.Even as its national team was battling through to the last four, Qatar released pictures of a glowering José Mourinho being led around half-built World Cup sites, Mourinho trying hard to smile and look interested but resembling instead a furiously indignant minor Soviet despot dragged from his bed and forced at gunpoint to wear a hard hat and frown over architects’ plans as part of his presidential captivity deal.The same day it was reported that the well-known human rights campaigner David Beckham would be providing his football services to Saudi Arabia as part of the Saudi’s National Transformation Programme, a £60bn entertainment power-play also featuring Broadway-style musical productions, a monster truck rally, a Pamplona-style bull run and “hologram performances by dead musicians”.As things stand, Fifa will meet in Rio in February to discuss the next steps in its Gulf-centred four-year cycle. It is a conference some had previously suggested Uefa executives might boycott over Fifa’s Saudi-backed plans for a new global competition.In the meantime, as Qatar and the UAE prepare to face each other on the pitch, the notion of football as a tool for cohesion rather than just another carpetbagger in the middle of blockade and vested interests continues to look mildly delusional.

A spokesman said no final decision had been made and the leadership was studying the proposal closely.Doubts were raised on Monday when Jon Trickett, the shadow Cabinet Office minister,said voters in his constituency would regard support for the measure on Tuesday as a failure to respect the result of the 2016 referendum.“Over the weekend, I was speaking to some people in my constituency. They weren’t actually people who voted for leave, though the majority of people in my constituency had voted for leave. What they said was: people have struggled for the vote, people have died pursuing the vote. Other people have been sent to Australia or put in prison – and the vote actually is a precious thing,” Trickett said.“What they said is: look, we voted remain, but we’ve had a vote get on with it. And I think that probably does capture a large swath of opinion in the country. That’s how I feel about this amendment. I feel that it may look to people as if we’re trying to somehow remove the earlier decision, which was to Brexit.”He suggested he might consider backing the measure if the time period for extending article 50 was shortened – something Cooper and colleagues have suggested MPs could achieve by amending their bill when it comes forward, at a later date.“I think people might say, if it’s before the summer, it might be a reasonable kind of period of time. Nine months sounds like the British establishment doing what it always does, which is ignoring the views of millions of ordinary folk, and that I am not prepared to tolerate,” Trickett said.But he suggested Labour must continue to respect the result of the 2016 referendum, underlining the tensions in the party, with activists overwhelmingly supportive of a “people’s vote”.“It’s not how I see things: we are servants of the people, and it’s our job to implement, give effect to, what they want – and they clearly voted for Brexit,” he said.The shadow cabinet is expected to discuss Brexit at its weekly meeting on Tuesday, but another shadow minister who is sympathetic to the Cooper-Boles amendment said the leadership could yet decide not to whip MPs. “Free vote territory, I suspect,” he said.Without the explicit support of the Labour leadership, the amendment may struggle to win a majority. A Labour spokesman said the party was looking closely at mechanisms to avoid a no-deal Brexit, but no final decision had been taken on specific amendments.Cooper was due to meet Labour MPs from leave-supporting areas on Monday to try to win their support for the measure – and convince them it is not an attempt to thwart Brexit but to avoid the UK leaving without a deal on 29 March, which remains the default position if an agreement is not reached and ratified before then.Trickett is one of Corbyn’s inner circle, alongside Diane Abbott and John McDonnell as well as key advisers including Labour’s head of strategy, Seumas Milne.Together with the party chair, Ian Lavery, he is one of the shadow cabinet figures who is most sceptical about the idea of Labour swinging its weight behind a second Brexit referendum.McDonnell had previously signalled that Labour could back the Cooper-Boles amendment, calling it “sensible”. The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, has also spoken warmly about the proposal.Labour has tabled its own amendment, calling for MPs to be allowed to vote on options, including the party’s own Brexit policy and a second referendum. There are also alternative amendments in play, including one from Rachel Reeves calling for an extension to article 50.Another, from the Labour MP Jack Dromey and the Conservative Caroline Spelman, simply rejects the idea of no deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2de6b4540c1f403af453cd6008a0e58a08c947bc/0_214_6891_4135/master/6891.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b72ba0e969093479fb4159872b95584","title":"scientists create super thin sheet could charge our phones","story":"Breakthrough means large sheets of energy-harvesting material can be producedWe have all been there. In a rush to leave the house we grab our phones and head out the door, realising all too late that the battery is dead because we forgot to plug it into the tablecloth.Or perhaps we have not. But this could be the future that scientists hope to usher in with electronic sheets that charge our mobile phones, laptops and other gadgets by harvesting energy from the world around us.In a step in that direction, scientists at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have created super-thin, bendy materials that absorb wireless internet and other electromagnetic waves in the air and turn them into electricity.The lead researcher, Tomás Palacios, said the breakthrough paved the way for energy-harvesting covers ranging from tablecloths to giant wrappers for buildings that extract energy from the environment to power sensors and other electronics. Details have been published in the journal Nature.“When you have one of these energy-harvesting devices you are collecting energy 247 and you could be storing that in a battery to use later,” Palacios said. “You could cover your desk with an electronic tablecloth and even though you’re only at the desk for so many hours a day, it would be harvesting energy the whole time.”Palacios and his colleagues connected a bendy antenna to a flexible semiconductor layer only three atoms thick. The antenna picks up wifi and other radio-frequency signals and turns them into an alternating current. This flows into the molybdenum disulphide semiconductor, where it is converted into a direct electrical current.“It doesn’t sound like much compared with the 60 watts that a computer needs, but you can still do a lot with it,” Palacios said. “You can design a wide range of sensors, for environmental monitoring or chemical and biological sensing, which operate at the single microwatt level. Or you could store the electricity in a battery to use later.”Medical devices are another potential application. Because wifi and similar radio-frequency signals pass through people, energy-harvesting covers could be applied to implants to provide them with enough power to beam health data to an outside receiver.Researchers have made energy-harvesting “rectennas” before, but existing devices are made from conventional semiconductors which are rigid, fragile and practically impossible to make in large sheets. By contrast, molybdenum disulphide film can be produced in sheets on industrial roll-to-roll machines, meaning they can be made large enough to capture useful amounts of energy.“In the future, everything is going to be covered with electronic systems and sensors. The question is going to be how do we power them?” said Palacios. “This is the missing building block that we need.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebb573281467845123c913d9421c2a30fed36dbb/0_0_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02c7b6e3c51370d323220fac24c7a5cd","title":"young people how do you feel about your future","story":"With 18-year-olds watching the outcome of Brexit unravel in front of them, we want to hear what you thinkFor years, it has been assumed that young people do not vote, do not take part in politics, and do not care.

A similar result was found when children’s screen time at three years old was compared with their development at five years.“What is new in this study is that we are studying really young children, so aged 2-5, when brain development is really rapidly progressing and also child development is unfolding so rapidly,” Dr Sheri Madigan, first author of the study from the University of Calgary, told the . “We are getting at these lasting effects,” she added of the study.The authors say parents should be cautious about how long children are allowed to spend with devices.“Excessive screen time can impinge on children’s ability to develop optimally,” they write. “It is recommended that paediatricians and healthcare practitioners guide parents on appropriate amounts of screen exposure and discuss potential consequences of excessive screen use.”But the results have been contested by others in the field who say the study did not take into account what the children were using the screens for, and that the influence of screens had a smaller effect than other factors such as family income, the child’s sleep and whether they were read to.Writing in the journal Jama Pediatrics, researchers from the University of Waterloo, the University of Calgary and Alberta Children’s Hospital Research Institute describe how they investigated the issue by looking at the screen time and development of more than 2,400 children between the ages of two and five. Data was collected at least once for each child.At two years, three years, and five years, mothers were asked to record how much time their child spent using screens, including time in front of the TV, computer or other devices. They also completed standard questionnaires to assess their child’s development, with questions including whether the child could complete tasks such as drawing particular shapes, copying certain behaviours or forming sentences – tasks covering areas from fine motor control to communication skills. Other aspects of the child’s life, such as their sleep and whether they had books read to them, were also considered.On average children spent about 17 hours a week in front of screens at two years old, increasing to almost 25 hours a week at three years, before falling to 11 hours a week at five years of age.The team say a clear trend emerged: the more time children were reported to be spending in front of screens, the worse they did on development tests. Those who spent longer with screens at 24 months showed worse performance on tests at 36 months, and a similar trend was seen for screen time at 36 months and test performance at five years.“When young children are observing screens, they may be missing important opportunities to practice and master interpersonal, motor, and communication skills,” the authors wrote.Others said a study that followed children over time, rather than just offering a snapshot of development and screen time, was welcome but they noted that the study had limitations, including that it did not consider developments in technology since 2016, or look at which types of screen were being used.The study also relied on questionnaires completed only by mothers and did not consider what the child was using the screen for, or whether they were using it alone. Furthermore, it did not show which areas of development in particular were most affected by screen time or give an idea of how much was too much when it came to using devices.The issue of whether screen time is bad for children has become a battlefield. While some argue screen time is harmful for children’s mental and physical health, others warn of moral panic, and say evidence on the issue is of poor quality and that there is no clear sign of harm.And there are other issues. “If parents think that their child is not making expected progress over time, they are likely to think their child spends a lot of time with screens,” said Prof Natalia Kucirkova of University College London.Dr Max Davie, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health agreed other factors had a larger impact on how children fared.“In fact the data shows that the association with screen time is weaker than that between developmental outcomes and good sleep, reading to the child, and maternal positivity,” he said.Nonetheless, he said, parents should balance screen time with other activities. “We would, in the light of this paper, reiterate our advice that families spend time interacting as a family, that screens are not allowed to interfere with sleep, and that screen-based interaction is no substitute for in-person contact,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5ac05faceacc0b92a126600c09b8145d14c3135/0_51_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a706b80f5d14ac8a0dcefbd26733bff","title":"european tour serious bogey visiting saudi arabia","story":"Golf penalises players for scorecard errors, yet is going cap in hand to a regime with an appalling human rights recordGolf’s obsession with irrelevance was in evidence again on Sunday. That Li Haotong’s caddie was adjudged to have assisted the player with the lining up of a putt in the final round of the Dubai Desert Classic cost the defending champion by way of a two-stroke penalty. Commentators, players and caddies blasted this marginal call, rendered possible by recent amendments to the rules of golf. Muirfield’s members had fresh meat to titter about over Monday gins.By Monday afternoon, the European Tour and the R\u0026ampA were at odds regarding the implementation of said rule. Keith Pelley, the Tour’s chief executive, bemoaned the lack of discretion available to his referees. Sceptics may suggest Pelley was seeking to create controversy where one does not exist in the hope of creating a handy ersion.Pelley had earlier appeared on television in the US attempting to do something which is never wise defending the indefensible. If Pelley’s willingness to cut a deal to host a tour event in Saudi Arabia caused minor ripples when announced last year, subsequent events and the fact this tournament begins on Thursday has thrust a reputational own goal firmly back into the spotlight. Suffice to say the R\u0026ampA, which many feel allowed gender discrimination to prevail on its watch for centuries, has kept out of this one.Recurring horrors in relation to Saudi Arabia and human rights barely need revisiting. The CIA’s claim in November that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, most likely ordered the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi added a further layer of negativity – to put it mildly – that the European Tour could have done without. There have also been reports of the torture and sexual harassment of women’s rights activists in Saudi detention centres.As it attempts to show the world it is actually a misunderstood utopia, Saudi Arabia turned towards the world’s leading golfers and found a depressingly willing audience.Four of the world’s top five are scheduled to tee up in Saudi. That comes with hefty reward Justin Rose, Dustin Johnson, Brooks Koepka et al are being richly compensated by way of appearance fees for just turning up. Low-ranked players might feel a necessity to play as they battle to maintain status. Paul Casey made it clear last week that he would not travel on human rights grounds – a view shared by plenty of others who have opted to keep counsel.“You have to look at the entire Middle East region,” Pelley said. “We have an excellent relationship with the Middle East and it’s very important why it’s important is we can’t play anywhere in Europe at this time of year. Saudi is just an extension of the Middle East strategy.“The European Tour is one of many global companies who operate in Saudi Arabia. We understand their goal to make parts of the country more accessible to global business, tourism and leisure over the next decade.”If not so serious, this would of course be hilarious. Here is a sporting body which penalises competitors for making an error with a scorecard yet thinks it reasonable to go cap in hand to a regime which, according to Amnesty International, oversaw the execution of 146 people in 2017.What Pelley understandably fails to mention in regards to Saudi Arabia is commercial necessity as his tour falls further and further behind its US equivalent. But must that arrive at all costs?To his credit, the Golf Channel analyst Brandel Chamblee highlighted the Tour’s woefully bad call.“I cannot imagine what economic incentive it would take to get me to go to a place that is so egregiously on the wrong side of human rights,” he said. “I don’t think they fully understand what they are doing.“I don’t understand it from an economic point of view, I don’t understand it from a business point of view and I don’t understand it from a moral point of view. They are legitimising and enriching the rulers of this regime. I won’t even watch it on the TV. They should not be there. By participating, they are ventriloquists for this abhorrent, reprehensible regime.”Rose shrugged off such a notion. “I’m not a politician, I’m a pro golfer,” the Englishman said. “There are other reasons to go play it. It’s a good field, there’s going to be a lot of world ranking points to play for, by all accounts it’s a good golf course.”Rose’s explanation isn’t good enough, not least for someone so intelligent. When adding that he looked forward to “experiencing” Saudi Arabia, he should have contemplated what that has meant for so many others . Golfers readily skip events for all manner of trivialities. The problem is many of those around them rarely have the gumption to point out how poor scenarios may look in the real world. Commercial deals for players have spin-offs for managers, of course.The next time football or rugby is urged to view the world through golf’s lofty prism, the retort should be straightforward. The next time golf preaches about a genuine desire to be inclusive and erse, we are entitled to burst out laughing. Quests for the moral high ground in sport are infamously tricky but this represents an extremity the European Tour should have readily avoided."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c451c119190bba67e22c05b1753be31631af5bc5/0_0_2495_1497/master/2495.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b61d412c7a7d8ce59accdf898ed0968","title":"six newcomers 2019 six nations","story":"This year’s most exciting potential debutants, from the lightest player in the championship to France’s brightest young thingsCurry has five caps but has never before appeared in the Six Nations after missing out last year with a long-term wrist injury. He began the autumn in the No 7 jersey but was injured again in England’s opening match and such was Sam Underhill’s form thereafter that it is hard to imagine Curry would have come straight back in to the side but for the Bath flanker’s similarly awful luck with injuries. Curry then is set for another chance to answer the ongoing question as to who is Eddie Jones’s first-choice openside. The 20-year-old was one of the few shining lights of England’s tour of South Africa last summer and has more in his attacking armoury than Underhill. He is an effective operator at the breakdown but if there is one concern about Curry it is that he struggles to adapt if on the wrong side of the officials.At 19, he is the youngest player in the championship but deemed ready to make his transition to the senior setup, having steering France to the Junior World Cup title last summer. The son of the former France wing Emile, Ntamack has made 18 appearances for Toulouse this season, playing an instrumental role in their resurgence on the European stage. A fly-half by trade, Ntamack has made inside-centre his home for Toulouse this season but Jacques Brunel is keeping an open mind as to where he plays for France. “In matches Romain Ntamack starts as a centre but in open play he changes between positions. So we’ll say he’s a fly-half-centre,” the head coach said. It may come later in the tournament but the first of what is likely to be many caps beckons.Another promoted from France’s Under-20s side, Bamba made his senior international debut against Fiji in the autumn. Currently on loan at Brive from Lyon in France’s second tier, Bamba is a ferocious scrummager, bulldozing carrier and fond of the odd offload as well. Like Ntamack, he was part of the French side that won the Under-20s Six Nations title but it was the Junior World Cup where he really caught the eye as part of a pack that scrummaged both New Zealand and England off the park in the semis and final respectively. Aged 14 Bamba was a national judo champion before making the transition to rugby where he began life as a No 8 before moving to tighthead prop, which explains his thunderous runs, for which is beginning to make a name for himself.A pocket rocket who earned a surprise call-up to the Scotland squad in the autumn on the back of some eye-catching displays for Edinburgh in the Champions Cup against Montpellier and Toulouse. Gregor Townsend clearly likes what he sees and has no concerns over Graham’s size, stating last week: “I believe the game has never been more suited to smaller players. You look at Darcy Graham who has made more tackle breaks than the super-size wingers out there.” Graham has drawn comparisons with the former Wales wing Shane Williams, is similarly quick and has the ability to get crowds on their feet. He managed only one league start in his first season at Edinburgh but the former Scotland sevens player has five tries in his six Pro14 appearances this term.Williams started his first two Tests last year, the second against Tonga in the autumn, but looks poised for a first Six Nations appearance against France on Friday. Gareth Davies may well have recovered from a thigh injury but Williams – the lightest player in the championship at 78kg – is primed for a place among the replacements with Warren Gatland recently describing the scrum-half as “a young player who is pretty talented. He could be something pretty special”. Williams has been knocking on the door for a few years now, having previously been part of Wales’s sevens setup, and with Gatland looking for more depth at scrum-half, Williams now has the platform to push for a World Cup spot.Young’s cause is not helped by the limited amount of time he has been able to train with Wales as someone based in a different country but anyone who has seen him perform consistently well for Wasps this season will know he warrants a Six Nations debut at some stage of the tournament. The riches of openside flankers available also explain why this is the first time Warren Gatland has ever selected him (his previous involvements have come when the head coach was on British \u0026amp Irish Lions duty) but with Ellis Jenkins a long-term injury absentee Young has been called up. Justin Tipuric and Josh Navidi are ahead of him in the pecking order, while there is Aaron Wainwright for competition too, but Young’s all-round excellence means he merits his chance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c91c93c8ee7f55b3c2b3ab5c20e7027cb0f3ccc/0_0_3540_2370/master/3540.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d64220b8b1bc1b8c5976535d21eadc8a","title":"the boy in the dress by david walliams to become stage musical","story":"Following in the footsteps of Roald Dahl’s Matilda, the book is to be adapted by the Royal Shakespeare CompanyDavid Walliams’ journey from comedian to one of the most popular children’s authors of his generation is to continue, with a musical version of his first book destined for the main stage of the Royal Shakespeare Company.On Monday, the company announced details of a stage version of his bestselling 2008 novel The Boy in the Dress, which tells the story of a schoolboy who cross-dresses to help him cope with the death of his mother.Six years in development, it will be the RSC’s big Christmas show, playing in Stratford-upon-Avon for 18 weeks with the possibility of a West End transfer.Robbie Williams and his songwriting partner Guy Chambers are supplying music and lyrics and playwright Mark Ravenhill has written the book.Walliams said the show was “a dream collaboration” and he had always imagined the book as a musical. “It’s now 10 years since The Boy in the Dress was first published, and we’ve come a long way in that time,” he said. “Ultimately, I wanted to write a story that encouraged people to recognise that difference can be celebrated, that it’s OK to be yourself.”The Boy in the Dress tells the story of 12-year-old Dennis, who loves football and daytime TV, especially Trisha, and misses his mum. It was a book, Walliams acknowledged, deeply indebted to Roald Dahl. It was warmly reviewed in the  by the writer Philip Ardagh, who wrote: “I hope Walliams writes more for children.”He did, achieving colossal sales figures with books such as Mr Stink, Gangsta Granny and Grandpa’s Great Escape. He came top of an annual author’s rich list last year and in 2017, when his books made more than £16m. JK Rowling was in second place both years.Ravenhill, the playwright who first burst on to scene with his play Shopping and Fucking, said he came across The Boy in the Dress when he was the RSC’s playwright in residence in 2012. “I remember thinking that it was such a gripping, entertaining and life-affirming story with all the ingredients of a great stage show,” he said. “The RSC has a fantastic track record of producing family shows, so when David suggested making his novel into a musical, I thought, let’s go for it!”The London production of Les Misérables, a collaboration between the RSC and Cameron Mackintosh, is entering its 34th year, while Matilda the Musical, adapted for the RSC by Dennis Kelly with music and lyrics by Tim Minchin, has been staged for seven years in the West End.The company’s 1988 musical adaptation of Stephen King’s Carrie was considerably less successful. Some audience members applauded, some recall being scarred for life. ’s Nicholas de Jongh called the show “a resounding mistake”, a view shared by Broadway, where it was transferred before closing after 16 previews and five performances.Much more favourable reactions will be expected for The Boy in the Dress, to be directed by the RSC’s artistic director Gregory Doran.Williams and Chambers said they were “beyond excited” and “genuinely delighted” to be working with the RSC and Walliams, adding: “There’s a real freshness, cheekiness and heart to David’s writing which we’ve worked really hard to capture in the music.”The show was announced as part of the RSC’s winter season which will include a production of Shakespeare’s King John, directed by Eleanor Rhode, and two new plays which shine light on British imperial history: A Museum in Baghdad by Hannah Khalil, and The Whip by Juliet Gilkes Romero."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab0ef1ee9a04b72d9bcf287d3b02e84b291b175e/0_0_3864_2318/master/3864.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fac44f26c5dbcb8c70432dfa1cd50db0","title":"inside europe 10 years of turmoil review the road to brexit","story":"Despite the notable absence of Theresa May and David Cameron, this impressive feat of analysis lays bare the machinations of Britain and Europe One of the hits of last summer’s Edinburgh fringe was Kieran Hodgson’s ’75, an unlikely comedy set that compared our current European crisis with that of the mid-70s. It was surprisingly soothing, and it made the point that Britain’s relationship with the rest of Europe has always been fraught and isive. Inside Europe: 10 Years of Turmoil (BBC Two) is an elegant, thorough and balanced look at how those longstanding isions have played out over the past decade and, more crucially, on the eve of the next big Brexit vote, why it has come to this.For anyone struggling in the quagmire of information surrounding Brexit, this is an impressive feat of coherent analysis that is just pliable enough to allow the viewer to lean in either direction, depending on which side you take. It begins with the Eurozone financial crisis of 2011, which gave Eurosceptic MPs a renewed sense of purpose and a louder voice. From there, through interviews with an incredible range of state leaders and key figures, from Nicolas Sarkozy to Jean-Claude Juncker and Mark Rutte, the machinations of Britain and the rest of the EU are laid relatively bare. This is a well-mannered documentary, though, and it leaves little space for bias. When Angela Merkel addressed the UK parliament in 2014, she knew that whatever she said would be exploited by both sides (and it was – Nigel Farage, absent here, leapt on it as a sign that Europe would not budge and mocked Cameron’s response). The documentary team are equally cautious.For those who voted leave, I imagine there is plenty of grist to the mill. If you were looking for evidence of Europe’s threat to British sovereignty, you could see it in Cameron’s limited ability to negotiate for the UK, particularly when it came to immigration or, as his former press secretary Gabby Bertin calls it, euphemistically, “direction of travel”.For remainers, this could equally paint a portrait of an internal Tory squabble taken to diabolical extremes. Even William Hague, who believes there was a public appetite for some kind of inout showdown that made it all but inevitable (“Either we had to lead that or be the victims of it”), can’t seem to avoid talking about it primarily as a party issue. Nick Clegg speaks of Cameron “mixing apples and pears”, attempting to use the Eurozone crisis as leverage for unrelated negotiations for Britain. Sarkozy, Juncker and François Hollande make the same point – that Britain thought it could be an exception, and that any concessions given by Europe would never be enough. It wanted to be part of the club and excused from its rules. Clearly, under Cameron’s government, under the pressures he gave in to, the situation was untenable.I wish Cameron had been interviewed. The producer, Norma Percy, said he was asked, but he “has an exclusive deal with his publisher that he speaks first with his memoirs, and in order not to interfere with Theresa’s deals, he put off the memoir from last October to next October”. But even without him, this is a robust, detailed and very timely reminder of what led to this state of disunity. I did not come away from Inside Europe feeling particularly hopeful, but certainly better informed. This is the first of three parts, with the other two looking at the financial turmoil in Greece and the migrant crisis of 2015."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da3e66fbc622db9bbce4887df1ab09ea7c0e100d/27_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0fc4cea3a60d93faffe21f5a7a920aa","title":"moon and me the new baby tv show from the genius behind teletubbies","story":"He’s been accused of ‘dumbing down’ toddlers, but Andrew Davenport is still the top hit-maker of preschool TV – and the name Pepi Nana is about to become very familiar to every parent in the worldWe’ve not even started watching Moon and Me, the new CBeebies show by Teletubbies creator Andrew Davenport, and it’s already a hit in our house.“I need that one! I need that one!” pleads my two-year-old daughter, pointing at a tiny thumbnail image of the show’s characters – Pepi Nana and Moon Baby – while it downloads for our test screening. Before I have time to explain to her once again the difference between “need” and “want” (you need food and oxygen, you only want to throw my umbrella in the bath), she’s dancing to the theme tune, talking to the characters like old friends and marvelling at the huge moon the show revolves around.Another child transfixed! Just how does Davenport do this? Sadly for those looking for a quick childcare fix, the answer seems to be: incredible instinct and a lot of painstaking research.For Moon and Me, Davenport, 53, teamed up with the University of Sheffield to develop a project in which cameras were set up all over a toy house, so they could observe a day in the life of a toy while they’re being played with.“It was like the Big Brother house only with toys,” he laughs.Their spying revealed some interesting findings – a fascination with stairs, and an insistence that there’s no better party than a tea party. Such things informed Moon and Me’s narrative, which is inspired by the Rumer Godden and Enid Blyton toyhouse stories of the 1930s and 40s. Pepi Nana is a toy who comes to life whenever the moon comes out (and her owner is asleep). Moon Baby visits them from the moon and, in what some people might deem a rude guest, proceeds to wake the rest of the toyhouse with an African thumb piano. He then guides them to Storyland for a story and a song. The whole thing retains the magical vibe of In the Night Garden, yet has a more traditional and homemade feel.It’s hard to imagine it causing the same uproar Teletubbies did when it arrived in 1997. Back then there were tabloid panics that it was turning toddlers’ brains to mush, or that the show contained secret gay messages (Tinky Winky carried – shock! Horror! – a handbag). Locals staged protests. Helicopters would fly over the field in which it was filmed, with photographers onboard hoping to reveal the faces of the actors in the costumes. Visitors to the set had to be blindfolded, for fear they might give away the location.“We just hadn’t prepared for that kind of interest at all,” says Davenport. “People’s relatives were getting doorstepped, which is a surprising place to be in thanks to a pre-school children’s television programme. And the show took on a meaning of its own in the culture that was a little uncontrollable, which in hindsight was fine, but did mean a lot of things were said about it that weren’t true.”When Davenport wrote In the Night Garden, a gently psychedelic affair conceived as a way of guiding children to bed, he was braced for more mayhem. But the only drama came when the BBC tried to move the broadcast time – the show was so popular with parents that it had already become an essential part of the bedtime routine.That hasn’t stopped people projecting wild meanings on to the show. Buzzfeed called it a “surrealist orgy of sex and death”, which seems a bit much given the claim was mainly centred around Upsy Daisy occasionally flashing her knickers. Elsewhere online, someone has constructed an ambitious theory that the show is all a dying hallucination in the mind of Iggle Piggle, who is actually a dehydrated sailor lost at sea. Has Davenport heard that one?There’s a pause. “Er ... no. In a word. I don’t know whether to look that up or not! But if you worry about stuff like that you’re in the wrong business. People are creative, they write their own jokes and obviously there are readings that are ... less savoury, that I probably wouldn’t want to know about.”I wonder if the murky world of the internet, which has taken over culture in the 20 years since Teletubbies landed, plays any part in his writing. Davenport says Moon and Me had to be versatile to different formats, and accepts that lots of viewers will be watching on phones and tablets. Teletubbies was actually conceived as a way of helping children understand the new world of screens, but it seems almost quaint compared to the technology today. What does Davenport make of it?“I think it’s a double edged sword,” he says. “I remember when my godson was younger, the first thing he’d say was ‘hello’ and then ‘can I have the iPad?’ and I wouldn’t see him again. It did slightly devalue the experience of going to see him.”In a way, Moon and Me is a reaction to such technology – a show about play that doesn’t involve screens. “The characters are constantly shown drawing, reading books, painting, making things, doing things with their hands,” explains Davenport. “Hands are a big theme of the show. There are over 500 objects in the toy house and every one is handmade, handpainted.”Davenport also banned any computer generated imagery (“quite a fight”), instead turning to puppetry, stop-motion animation and homemade effects. “Children are fascinated by real objects,” he says. “They will be able to see the weave of the fabric, the joins in the wallpaper, the printing on the wallpaper. There’s a joy in seeing the messiness.”Davenport’s background is an arty one: you can see him flinging his limbs around impressively on a Soho roof for Mehdi Norowzian’s short film Joy (which “inspired” the famous Guinness advert Anticipation – the whole thing ended up in court). And he was once a model for Gilbert and George, after he heard they were looking for a model with “big eyes”. They were paying £30 cash in hand – “which was significant back then” – so he found them in the Yellow Pages under “artists” and gave them a call. George answered, invited him for tea the next day, and he ended up staring out from one their artworks entitled Eyes. “I’ve never actually seen it in person,” he confesses. “But I remember sitting on a train reading a Big Issue feature about them, and suddenly realising that the piece of work I was looking at was me!”Yet it was his rather less arty degree course in speech sciences that proved the bigger influence on his TV work.“Back in the early 90s, a lot of teachers had become television makers and there was an emphasis towards schooling,” he says. “Where I came from, the focus was very much on the early years, the first three years of life, where the fundamental processes of becoming human are all happening – learning to speak, learning to walk and crawl. All of that happens in an incredibly short time, which is where my fascination with play comes from. You can largely tell what’s going on by the way a child is playing.”Davenport’s ideas were pretty radical at the time – incorporating the likes of Jean Piaget and Noam Chomsky into his surreal stories – but that didn’t stop people criticising Teletubbies. Stephen Byers, the schools minister at the time, even said it represented a “dumbing down” of British culture, due to its supposedly unintelligible language. “I think the rigour in which it was constructed was largely missed,” he says.Even now, Davenport is glad of the chance to explain how much thought goes into his hit shows. Yet despite his slightly terrifying insight into these unknowable little minds, he still gets extremely nervous before any new programme airs.“The whole thing only comes together fully at the very last minute, so you never really know how it’s going to go down until the audience get to see it.”Given that every morning since our interview, my daughter has woken up and asked “Where’s Pepi Nana?” repeatedly until we put it on, I think he’s probably going to be ok.Moon and Me starts on CBeebies on 4 February."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/418ad4a9b12340538da211463b6527940d4befa7/0_662_8765_5259/master/8765.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=094948fdd769dcd0652c0d7c7274b7be","title":"shipwrecked is back and its the love islandfyre festival mashup you need","story":"The first true reality show has reinvented itself. Frankly, there’s never been a more apt moment to throw a bunch of attractive nitwits into a tropical hellscapeThe return of Shipwrecked has come at the perfect time. Thanks to all the Fyre festival documentaries, there has never been a more apt moment to throw a bunch of gormlessly attractive nimrods into a tropical hellscape and make them fight each other for basic essentials. If producers were smart, they would re-edit tonight’s opening episode to include several clips of Ja Rule profoundly misunderstanding the concept of fraud. It would be a ratings winner. The whole world would watch.Unfortunately, it looks as if Shipwrecked might have another target in its sights. Most of the publicity afforded to the show’s return – this is the first series in almost a decade – seems to heavily nod towards Love Island being a primary influence. The popularity of ITV2’s series has clearly sparked something deep within the heart of Shipwrecked. If people go nuts for reality shows about swimwear-clad nitwits pawing at other swimwear-clad nitwits, the theory goes, then they should get a load of Shipwrecked, because Shipwrecked basically invented the idea.It seems cynical, but cynicism has always been Shipwrecked’s modus operandi. Most reality shows follow a simple trajectory: they start, they grow, they crater, then they drag on unwatched until an executive kindly kills them off. But Shipwrecked is different. Shipwrecked leaves huge gaps between series and re-emerges transformed, like a millennial version of Michael Apted’s Up documentaries.This week’s series marks the third revival of a show that first began two days before the turn of the century. Back then, when it beat BBC One’s Castaway 2000 to air by a matter of days (there’s that famous cynicism for you), it was widely hailed as one of the first true reality shows. It was a grand social experiment interested in the idea of how communities form. There was no cash prize, there was no automatic stepping stone to fame. There was just a bunch of fit young people toiling on a desert island.This approach lasted for just three series. But when it returned in 2006, Shipwrecked found itself stranded on a landscape of more sophisticated imitators. Reality television was now about Big Brother and The Apprentice and I’m A Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here shows that explicitly antagonised their participants. Compared to Shipwreck’s relative purity, these shows were cockfights. And so it was forced to fall in line, adding tribes, rules and voting, plus a cash prize and, very much in keeping with mid-noughties reality television, an out-and-out racist. Shipwrecked: Battle of the Islands, as it was known then, was a much more aggressive affair. And yet it only lasted for a handful of years.The last Shipwreck re-invention came back in 2011 a stripped-down, back-to-basics affair that overcompensated for the viciousness of Battle of the Islands by being relentlessly dull. Sure, the cast included a full-dressed, all-black goth, but that was too little too late. It clung to the schedules for a single series before drowning.And now here we are, in a world where Love Island rules the seas. As such, if I’ve read between the lines correctly, this new Shipwrecked will have much lower stakes. It will be intently designed as a Love Island-style screensaver, playing out images of beautiful youngsters barely doing anything in the blind hope that viewers will project their own feelings into the screen to pad out the abject nothingness of the show itself.It might work. It might not. But Shipwrecked is more than willing to change things up to reflect the television landscape, so maybe we will get the Fyre festival version next year. Please god, make it happen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36dd869290c52be44af6695db4861a71aec92536/0_119_5024_3014/master/5024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a9245b92ebd944a7307fc6ed97300ef","title":"duke university chinese students speak english email backlash","story":"University apologizes and opens investigation as email sent to foreign scholars denounced as discriminatory﻿Duke University moved quickly Monday to offer apologies, launch an investigation and reassure a core group of graduate scholars after a medical school administrator sent an email warning to Chinese students to speak in English.Outcry mounted after an email sent Friday by Megan Neely, who teaches in the biostatistics master’s degree program and served as its director of graduate studies.Neely’s message to an email list for about 50 biostatistics students said two faculty members approached her to complain about students loudly speaking Chinese in a common area. She wrote that both were disappointed the students weren’t working to improve their English and wanted their names. The email urged international students to “keep these unintended consequences in mind when you choose to speak in Chinese in the building”.She had also sent an email last February to students saying that “many faculty” noticed students were speaking other languages in break rooms.“As a result they may be more hesitant to hire or work with international students because communication is such an important part of what we do as biostaticians,” she said in the email.Over the weekend, screenshots of the emails got scores of views and angry comments on social media networks in the US and China. A petition demanding a thorough investigation has drawn more than 2,000 signatures of students, alumni and others, organizers said.The Duke Asian Students Association also issued a statement slamming Neely’s emails as discriminatory and harmful.“For international students, speaking in their mother tongue is a means of comfort and familiarity with a home and culture that is already oftentimes suppressed within the United States,” the association said.Amid the angry response, Neely stepped down as the program’s director of graduate studies, according to a letter from Dr Mary Klotman, the medical school dean.Klotman apologized to students in the program in her letter, saying there was no restriction on using foreign languages in conversations. She said the university’s Office of Institutional Equity would conduct a review of the biostatistics master’s program. It’s expected to examine which faculty members complained to Neely. Neely, who remains an assistant professor, also apologized in an email to program members, saying: “I deeply regret the hurt my email has caused. It was not my intention.”The Duke administrator’s message came at a time when Duke and other elite US universities are working hard to remain attractive to top international students despite negative rhetoric toward foreigners by Donald Trump and other politicians.“Duke’s engagement with China, with Chinese students and with Chinese scholars is broad, deep and longstanding,” the Duke vice-president for public affairs, Michael Schoenfeld, said in an interview Monday.“We deeply regret that this particular incident might have compromised the very valuable and mutually beneficial relationship that Duke has with its Chinese students.”Across all of Duke’s graduate and professional programs, 1,300 of about 8,500 students come from China, according to university data. Duke also partners with Wuhan University on Duke Kunshan University in China, which began enrolling students in 2014.Thirty-six of the 55 students in the biostatistics master’s degree program are from China, and Chinese scholars represent one-fifth of the program’s approximately 50 faculty members, Duke said.International students are particularly attractive to US graduate programs because many countries abroad place more emphasis on math and science education, and because foreign students with the means to study in the US often can pay full tuition rather than seek financial assistance, said Scott Jaschik, the editor of Inside Higher Ed.He commended Duke for moving quickly to investigate, but said the school’s reputation could still suffer.“There is a quite a grapevine of information about international students back home,” he said in an interview. “You can be sure people will hear about this.”Chi Liu, who’s pursuing a chemistry PhD at Duke, said the university can maintain a good reputation abroad if it shows it’s taking the situation seriously. Liu, who’s from China’s Hunan Province, believes Duke should fire Neely and the two unnamed faculty members who complained to her.“All of us are angry.

The boy repeated the story to his aunt, Breanna Hathaway.“He said he hung out with a bear for two days,” Hathaway wrote in a Facebook post. “God sent him a friend to keep him safe. God is a good God. Miracles do happen.”This seemingly remarkable tale of Jungle Book-style inter-species friendship was most likely the product of Casey’s imagination, however, according to one veteran bear expert.“I’ve never known such a thing to happen, bears don’t do that,” said Chris Servheen, a bear researcher at the University of Montana.“Wild bears aren’t friends with people. I don’t want to say he’s not telling the truth, he obviously thinks he’s seen things and maybe he’s got a teddy bear at home. But I’ve seen no evidence anything like that has ever happened.”There are examples of apparent bear-human comradeship, although they typically involve captive bears that have been raised by human handlers. For example, in 2016 a video was taken of Jimbo, a bear that stands 10ft on its hind legs, cuddling Jim Kowalczik, director of a New York wildlife centre, and allowing Kowalczik to administer a back rub.A wild bear is a very different proposition, however, due to a natural aversion to dealing with humans. Bears that break into homes or attack people are usually killed themselves. With a sense of smell around seven times stronger than a bloodhound’s, a bear would have smelled Casey long before seeing him and would most likely have then left the scene.“Bears are by and large afraid of people no matter how big the person is,” Servheen said. “Bears that move towards people don’t survive long, so they get selected out. The only reason it would go near the child would be to be predatory, although black bears are very rarely predatory of humans and obviously that didn’t happen here.“In a situation where a bear is raised by a human they can become very tame, just like a dog. But a wild bear is very different.“I don’t want to cast aspersions on the child but I think the little boy had a fantasy. The bear wouldn’t feel sorry for him, thinking he’s alone. That’s ascribing human characteristics on wild animals, which is anthropomorphism.“But if the boy felt comfortable under the watch of a wild animal that’s fine. Whatever helped him get through it.\u0010”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f683dac8affb4d46a26eb4601a5166f59a36d4d5/0_237_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15298e4d9f683a4be5a2683a59e06887","title":"fate of castles in the air in turkeys 151m ghost town","story":"Drone footage of 300 chateaux in abandoned development lays bare challenges facing Turkish economyDrone footage of an eerie abandoned urban development of mini castles in Turkey has shone a light on the troubles facing the country’s economy.Burj al Babas, billed as a luxury housing development near Mudurnu, a village roughly halfway between Istanbul and Ankara, was left unfinished last year after its developers Sarot Property Group went bankrupt.The future of the 300 closely packed chateaux – which cost an estimated £151m to build – is now uncertain and the project has become a cautionary tale for other developers in Turkey’s debt-laden construction sector.Work began in 2014 on units primarily designed as holiday homes for wealthy Gulf tourists. The plans also included Turkish baths and an entertainment complex.Only a handful of the £379,000 Disney-style homes were sold, however, and several investors have since pulled out, Mezher Yerdelen, deputy chair of the Sarot Property Group, told Agence France-Presse.Of 732 planned buildings, 587 were completed, and the company is now £20m in debt.The construction project has long been hated by Mudurnu locals, who say it is not in keeping with the area’s traditional architecture, characterised by Byzantine buildings, traditional Ottoman wooden houses and a 600-year-old mosque.Since Burj al Babas got the go-ahead, the Turkish government has introduced new building regulations designed to preserve local character and heritage. In several places, housing developments must now be low-rise and fit in with existing neighbourhoods.But it may be too late to undo some of the damage, said Yaşar Adnan Adanalı, an Istanbul-based urban development researcher. “I worry that projects like Burj al Babas opened Pandora’s box, in some respects,” he said. “Developments without proper planning that do not contextualise the geography and history of their surroundings have exploded in Turkey since.”The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has encouraged a construction boom during his time in office, hailing large, job-heavy infrastructure projects as the engine of the Turkish economy.However, the weakening Turkish lira has left many companies struggling to pay off the foreign currency debt borrowed to finance projects, stalling work and bankrupting companies. The collapsing construction bubble has resulted in half-finished high-rises and ghost towns all over the country.Atilla Yesilada, Turkey analyst for GlobalSource Partners, an emerging markets analysis firm, said Burj al Babas’s fate was a snapshot of the wider malaise plaguing the Turkish construction sector. “It’s not just the homebuilders who go bankrupt. The people who supply goods to those industries – the architects, the technicians, the glass makers – those people suffer too,” he said.Last year, Turkey slashed the financial and investment criteria for foreigners to become Turkish citizens, in a move it is hoped will double annual property investment by foreigners to around £7.6bn.Despite no sure indications that the country’s economic woes will reverse in the near future, Sarot Group is still hopeful Gulf investors, lured by the prospect of Turkish passports, will return and Burj al Babas will be finished.“We only need to sell 100 villas to pay off our debt,” said Yerdelen. “I believe we can get over this crisis in four to five months and partially inaugurate the project in 2019.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f7caf88ce2526fcb7f194baca311a70d19c9267/53_189_1892_1135/master/1892.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25ed4fe42af7acff90ae6c02f44aff82","title":"us and taliban reach framework peace deal reports","story":"US troops would withdraw from Afghanistan within 18 months of full agreementUS and Taliban officials have agreed in principle to the framework of a deal that could pave the way for peace talks in Kabul and ultimately the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan, raising hopes of a breakthrough in the country’s 17-year conflict.Under the terms of the draft framework, the insurgents would promise to stop Afghan territory being used by terrorists. The US special envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, confirmed the existence of the draft in an interview with the New York Times (NYT).The draft, thrashed out in lengthy talks in Qatar that ended on Saturday, requires the Taliban to agree to a ceasefire and to talk directly with the US-backed Afghan government led by President Ashraf Ghani – two conditions which the Taliban have not agreed to.If the talks led to a full deal, US troops would be withdrawn from Afghanistan within 18 months.The optimism expressed by Khalilzad in his NYT interview may yet be dashed by dissent within the Taliban or opposition from the government in Kabul. Ghani immediately expressed his doubts about a rushed process from which his ministers had been excluded.Last week Ghani acknowledged that more than 45,000 members of the Afghan security forces had died since 2014, a far higher number than previously thought. The Taliban run more than half the country and have not slowed the rate of attacks during winter, which is normally a lull. The group is increasingly confident that the US is losing the will to continue the war.Khalilzad said: “The Taliban have committed, to our satisfaction, to do what is necessary that would prevent Afghanistan from ever becoming a platform for international terrorist groups or iniduals. We felt enough confidence that we said we need to get this fleshed out, and details need to be worked out.”Working groups would iron out details on the timeline of the withdrawal, but Khalilzad said there had been no discussions about the possibility of a Taliban role in a transitional government. The US stressed that the agreement was conditional on a ceasefire and direct talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban. Pakistan would be expected to play a key role in persuading the Taliban to show flexibility.Khalilzad returned to Afghanistan on Sunday to brief the Ghani government in Kabul after the six days of talks in Doha.In an address to the Afghan people responding to the talk of a breakthrough, Ghani recalled his country had struck deals with the Taliban before only to see the terms violated. “We want peace quickly, we want it soon, but we want it with prudence,” he said. “Prudence is important so we do not repeat past mistakes.”There appear to have been few, if any, assurances from the Taliban about the kind of society Afghanistan would become, including about issues such as the future of girls’ education and women’s role in wider society.Ghani is nervous that the US president, Donald Trump, is so intent on withdrawing his troops from the country that he will sideline the Afghan government in the process, and even try to force Ghani’s ministers to share power with the Taliban in a transitional government.The Taliban refused to let the Ghani government, which it regards as a US puppet, accompany the Americans in the Doha talks. The Americans regarded the talks as serious since one of the most senior officials in the Taliban movement, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, was chief negotiator.Ghani is running for a second five-year term in elections now scheduled for July.The talks in Doha, Qatar, lasted much longer than planned and longer than any previous attempt to end the Afghan conflict. Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates took part in the last round of talks in December, but the Taliban insisted this time that only the US attended.The US sent troops to Afghanistan in the wake of the 911 attacks on New York and Washington in 2001, and at the peak of the deployment had more than 100,000 troops in the country. It withdrew most of its forces in 2014, but still keeps about 14,000 troops there as part of a Nato-led mission aiding Afghan security forces and hunting militants.Khalilzad’s comments gave weight to reports last week that the Taliban had agreed to oppose al-Qaida and Islamic State in Afghanistan.The US invasion of 2001 was driven by the Taliban’s harbouring of al-Qaida, but more than 17 years later the jihadist group appears diminished in the region. Isis, however, is a growing and potent presence in Afghanistan, where it is fighting a fierce turf war with the Taliban in some areas."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Karen McEvoy (24) died on Christmas Day, a week after giving birth in Coombe hospitalKaren McEvoy (24) died a week after giving birth at Coombe hospitalAcademics warn fruit and vegetable intake will fall due to higher prices on food importsLabour Court: Attempts to stop what is expected to be widespread disruption continueNorth\u0026rsquos most senior police officer will not take up offer of three-year contract extensionChildren should also learn about LGBTQI+ relationships and contraception, says committeeLocals left wounded and emotional as four of their finest young men taken in one fell swoopAll in their 20s, three of the men had been seeing the fourth off ahead of a move abroadReport confirms decision to centralise cancer care in eight hospitals \u0026lsquois working\u0026rsquoIrish Ferries rejects findings saying they are \u0026lsquocritical factor\u0026rsquo in route cancellationFarmers\u0026rsquo association estimate between 300 and 400 dog attacks take place a yearMaria Browne says proposed nearby block is too tall and could jeopardise State privacyDeveloper concerned a challenge over part of 220 unit site could delay entire project, court toldMan allowed to seek change to address reports of \u0026lsquoincommunicado detention\u0026rsquo facilities in AlgeriaImportant \u0026lsquonot to throw the baby out with the bathwater\u0026rsquo regarding meat and potatoesYoung friends who died in \u0026lsquodevastating\u0026rsquo incident near Gortahork described as \u0026lsquolovely lads\u0026rsquoDavid O\u0026rsquoLoughlin\u0026rsquos attack on vulnerable 59-year-old \u0026lsquothe stuff of nightmares\u0026rsquoHospitals in Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Galway still to receive new bedsCourt reserves judgement on extradition of alleged IRA bomber on NI murder charges"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3773507.1548692988!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the brexit amendments what the uk parliament is proposing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAny successful amendments will not have the force of law, but will carry heavy political weight as a signal to Downing Street and Brussels of what kind of Brexit MPs are likely to approve. Photograph: Tolga AkmenAFPGetty ImagesThe House of Commons is due to vote on Tuesday on a series of amendments relating to the Brexit process.This follows the defeat by 432 votes to 202 earlier this month of the withdrawal deal secured by prime minister Theresa May, and procedural moves by backbenchers ensuring that MPs got the opportunity to vote on amendments proposing other options.There are 19 currently submitted, including some amendments to amendments. However more can be submitted up to 10.30pm on Monday, and the Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow will then select a smaller number - expected to be in the range of four-to-six - on which MPs will vote on Tuesday evening.The British government’s tactics are also unclear. We do not yet know if the government is tabling its own amendment or whether it will encourage its MPs to back one of the anti-backstop amendments.Any successful amendments will not have the force of law, but will carry heavy political weight as a signal to Downing Street and Brussels of what kind of Brexit MPs are likely to approve. Here are some of the most prominent amendments and the view the Irish Government is likely to take of them:1. Grieve and Cooper amendments: In a bid to prevent a no-deal Brexit, the cross-party backed proposal from Conservative MP Dominic Grieve would effectively wrest control of Commons business from the government for six inidual days in the run-up to the UK’s scheduled withdrawal date of March 29th with the intention of getting MPs to reach a consensus on how to handle it.In a similar vein, a move by Labour former minister Yvette Cooper, supported by Tories such as Nick Boles, calls for a vote on a Bill that would give parliament control over the Brexit process if Mrs May fails to secure a deal by February 26th. MPs would get a vote on extending Article 50 to the end of the year and preventing a no-deal exit under the terms of the Bill. The Labour frontbench has been publicly flirting with throwing its weight behind the amendment. Irish view: As pressure grows on Dublin over its preparations for a possible no-deal at the end of March, the Government will welcome any move which stops a lurch towards a no-deal Brexit. The Government here would also hope that more discussion in the House of Commons might move the UK’s approach towards a softer version of Brexit, given the fact most MPs favour this outcome. An extension to Article 50 would be welcomed by the Government to avoid a no-deal.However Irish Ministers and officials are also conscious that this could also prolong the uncertainty. The debate in the UK also seems to take for granted that the EU would agree to an extension of Article 50 and thus a delay in the UK’s exit date. It probably would, but only if presented with a clear reason to do so and and the EU side may seek certain conditions on an extension.2. Brake on the backstop: Senior Conservative figures , including 1922 Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady and former minister Andrew Murrison want a deadline of the end of December 2021 put on the backstop proposal intended to avoid a hard border in Ireland. The amendment is believed to be viewed favourably by Downing Street as a way of showing Brussels that the withdrawal agreement could get through the Commons if concessions are made regarding Northern Ireland. Another amendment from the same two MPs seeks that the backstop is “replaced with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border”, though it does not say what these alternatives might be.There are also proposed amendments calling for a six-month limit on the backstop or a right by the UK to exit it unilaterally. Irish view: The Government has said that the backstop, as included in the withdrawal agreement, must remain and cannot be time-limited. However, on Monday The  reported that the Government would consider re-opening the withdrawal agreement if the British red lines moved. Similarly, the EU has indicated it would be prepared to reexamine the issue if the UK changed its red lines – for example, as the Labour Party has called for, committing to remain in a customs union and aligned to single market regulations.However if, on the basis of a Commons vote, Mrs May just requests that the backstop be dropped or time-limited then the answer will be ‘No’ and the uncertainty will continue. Irish Government sources were clear on Monday that both Brady and Murrison amendments in their current form were a non-runner.3. No to no-deal: A cross-party effort headed by Tory Dame Caroline Spelman has widespread support and rejects the UK quitting the EU without a withdrawal agreement. This would probably be more palatable to Mrs May’s government than either the Grieve or Cooper bids for MPs to take back control.Ireland’s views: Ireland supports the withdrawal agreement so this approach would provide some comfort. However, the House of Commons still has to agree on a way forward if a no-deal exit is to be avoided. Just deciding that it should not happen will not be enough. “We are still at the stage of Westminster negotiating with itself,” said one Irish Government source.4. Labour’s twin track approach: This calls for MPs to be able to vote on options to stop a no-deal exit, such as a customs union with the EU, as well as the possibility of a new Brexit referendum. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, however, has been careful not to commit his party to officially back a second poll.Amendments have been tacked on to the Labour “options” proposal, with the Liberal Democrats calling for Remain to be on the ballot paper in any referendum, while Labour backbenchers want parliament to legislate for a public vote. Separately, the chairman of the Exiting the European Union select committee Hilary Benn wants a series of votes on various Brexit options to see where the most support lies.Ireland’s view: For Ireland, the prospect of a second referendum raises the possibility of the UK deciding to stay in the EU, clearly the ideal outcome for the Irish Government. However all sides say that the outcome of a vote cannot be taken for granted.With a majority in the House of Commons seeming to favour a softer Brexit, any mechanism allowing a series of votes may point in this direction. However time is running out.While Dublin may face difficult choices in the weeks, it now must wait to see what the House of Commons decides on Tuesday - and how this affects the British government’s position - before deciding how to proceed. - Additional reporting PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Hannah McKayReutersTheresa May has told Conservative MPs that she will seek to replace the Northern Ireland backstop with alternative arrangements to prevent a hard border.The prime minister urged them to vote on Tuesday for an amendment calling for her Brexit deal to be approved on condition that the backstop is replaced.But on Monday night hardline Conservative Brexiteers rejected Mrs May’s call, saying that the amendment proposed by 1922 Committee chairman Graham Brady did not go far enough. Jacob Rees-Mogg said they were opposed to anything short of a promise to renegotiate the text of the legally binding withdrawal agreement Mrs May agreed with other European Union leaders last November.“The amendment gives conditional approval, which is an issue. It does not say what the backstop would be replaced with and Graham has said he could live with a protocol rather than changes to the text. From our point of view it has to be changes to the text,” Mr Rees-Mogg said.MPs will on Tuesday vote on a series of amendments on how the prime minister should proceed with Brexit following their overwhelming rejection of her Brexit deal this month. The EU’s deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand said on Monday that the withdrawal agreement would not be reopened and warned that Britain could be heading towards a no-deal Brexit by accident.Ms Weyand was sceptical about the amendment the prime minister is backing and about “alternative arrangements” to the backstop.“We are open to alternative arrangements. The problem with the Brady amendment is that it does not spell out what they are. It’s not a criticism of them because they don’t exist,” she said.She said negotiations between Britain and the EU were over and that Mrs May now needed to assemble a stable majority to ensure that the Brexit deal and all its implementation legislation would pass.“Our impression is the discussion is much more about the future of the country and the future of the UK-EU relationship than about the content of the withdrawal agreement. In fact much of the conversation is uninhibited by any knowledge of what is actually in the withdrawal agreement,” she said.Mrs May told MPs that they would be able to vote on another Brexit motion in the middle of February, so that Tuesday night’s vote would not be their last opportunity to tell the government how to proceed. This was viewed as an attempt to dissuade moderate Conservatives from supporting an amendment that could instruct the government to seek an extension to the article 50 negotiating deadline.Meanwhile in Dublin, the Cabinet will discuss further preparations for a no-deal Brexit this morning when Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe is expected to present a memo on its implications.\u0026nbspMr Donohoe and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar have ruled out an emergency budget in the event of a no-deal outcome, insisting that the October budget was drawn up with Brexit in mind. But the Central Bank warned last week that a no-deal Brexit would deliver a serious blow to the Irish economy, slashing projected economic growth this year. Sources said that they expected the Finance memos to be similar to the Central Bank expectations.\u0026nbspDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

File photograph: Leon NealGetty ImagesBritish prime minister Theresa May on Monday asked her party to support a proposal which calls for the Northern Irish backstop in her Brexit deal with Brussels to be replaced with alternative arrangements.Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis confirmed the move after Mrs May addressed her party colleagues at a private meeting in parliament.The backstop is an insurance policy aimed at avoiding a hard border in Ireland in the absence of a future trade deal between the EU and the UK. It would keep the UK in a common customs area with the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Mr Lewis said Mrs May told her MPs that they should vote in favour of an amendment, proposed by senior Conservative lawmaker Sir Graham Brady, which calls for the backstop to be replaced with “alternative arrangements”.“It allows the PM to give a very clear message about what the parliament wants and where the party is,” Mr Lewis said.The European Union has ruled out renegotiating the principle behind the backstop. Its deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand said on Monday that the bloc was “open to alternative arrangements” on the Irish Border but that the problem with Sir Graham’s proposal was that it did not spell out what they were.She also said if and when EU leaders discuss delaying Brexit by agreeing to extend negotiations, they “will require certain elements of information . . . and one of them is the purpose of extension”.“They would want to be reassured about that at the end of the extension there will be clarity,” she said. “The idea of going into serial extensions is not very popular on the EU side.”Ms Weyand also said she was unsure the UK would be able to handle the consequences of leaving the EU without a deal.Strong support for Sir Graham’s amendment – if it is put to a vote on Tuesday – will allow Mrs May to demonstrate to the EU that changes to the backstop could be enough to allow her to get parliamentary approval for a deal.But the chairman of the European Research Group, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said that its members, thought to number at least 60, would not support the scheme.Mr Rees-Mogg said the group would not support any amendment, but would decide on the day whether to abstain or vote against. MPs in the ERG were concerned that the amendment did not spell out what would replace the backstop and did not specify that changes to the text of the withdrawal agreement were required, he said.It will be down to speaker John Bercow which amendments are selected for a vote on Tuesday.On Sunday, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said there would be no change to the backstop.Mr Coveney said the backstop was already a compromise and a review mechanism had already been stitched into it.However, The  reported on Monday morning that the Government would be willing to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement if the UK wanted to stay in a permanent customs union with the EU or allowed Northern Irish specific measures to avoid a hard border. – AgenciesDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Victoria JonesPA WireTwo weeks after MPs overwhelmingly rejected her withdrawal agreement, Theresa May’s Brexit strategy faces a fresh, disabling blow on Tuesday. The decision by Conservative Brexiteers to vote against backbencher Graham Brady’s amendment, which the government is backing, suggests that the prime minister cannot win parliamentary approval for a deal on the basis of Conservative and DUP votes.The Brady amendment calls for the Brexit withdrawal agreement and political declaration to be approved – on condition that the Northern Ireland backstop is replaced with alternative arrangements to prevent a hard border. The prime minister has made clear she is willing to seek changes to the text of the withdrawal agreement, something she has previously ruled out on the basis that the EU would never agree to it.The Brady amendment’s demand is unacceptable to the EU but winning a parliamentary majority for it would at least put the prime minister in a position to tell her European counterparts what she needs to persuade enough MPs to back the deal. After consulting MPs when her deal was voted down in the Commons, May concluded that her only chance of keeping her party together was by seeking changes to the backstop that would win over Brexiteers and the DUP.By rejecting the Brady amendment, Conservative Brexiteers will confirm the conviction in Brussels that the prime minister needs to find a different majority for a softer Brexit. The Brexiteers’ action could persuade moderate Conservatives that their only hope of avoiding a no-deal Brexit is to support Labour MP Yvette Cooper’s amendment that would open the way to postponing Brexit by up to nine months.If Cooper’s amendment succeeds, MPs will take control of the parliamentary timetable for one day next week to debate and vote on a Bill that could postpone Brexit. The government hoped it could block the legislation by filibustering in the House of Lords, where all amendments are debated, and talking the Bill out.On Monday night, peers foiled the plot by backing a motion calling on the government to rule out a no-deal Brexit and promising\u0026nbspto ensure the timely passage of “any legislation that is necessary to implement any deal or proposition that has commanded the support of the majority of the House of Commons”.The prime minister could yet persuade hardline Brexiteers to back the Brady amendment on Tuesday night if she toughens up her promise to demand changes to the withdrawal agreement itself that would remove the backstop. But to do so would be to render the chance of securing a deal in Brussels all but impossible.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Jesse DittmarNew York TimesRoger Stone has always lived in a dog-eat-dog world. So it was apt that he was charged with skulduggery in part for threatening to kidnap a therapy dog – a fluffy, sweet-faced Coton de Tuléar, belonging to Randy Credico, a New York radio host.Robert Mueller believes that Credico, a pal of Julian Assange, served as an intermediary with WikiLeaks for Stone. Mueller’s indictment charges that Stone called Credico “a rat” and “a stoolie” because he believed that the radio host was not going to back up what the special counsel says is Stone’s false story about contacts with WikiLeaks, which disseminated Russia’s hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman.As the owner of two Yorkies, Stone clearly knows how scary it is when a beloved dog is in harm’s way. When he emerged from court on Friday, he immediately complained that FBI agents had “terrorised” his dogs when they came to arrest him at dawn at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.The last thing Stone posted on Instagram before his arrest was a video of a terrier, with a high-pitched voice-over, protesting, “Roger Stone did nothing wrong.”Always bespoke and natty, living by the mantra that it’s better to be infamous than never famous, Stone looked strangely unadorned as he came out of court to meet the press in a navy polo shirt and blue jeans.As the master of darkness who had been captured in darkness stepped into the bright light of Fort Lauderdale, he was his usual flamboyant, unapologetically meretricious self. He proclaimed his innocence, flashed the Nixon victory sign and reiterated the old saw from his mentor, Roy Cohn, that any attention is good attention.But it fell flat. Being Roger Stone had finally caught up with him.He has always said Florida suited him because “it was a sunny place for shady people” borrowing a Somerset Maugham line. But now the cat’s cradle of lies and dirty tricks had tripped up the putative dognapper. And it went down on the very same day that Paul Manafort – his former associate in a seamy lobbying firm with rancid dictators as clients, and then later his pal in the seamy campaign of Donald Trump – was also in federal court on charges related to the Mueller probe. Manafort’s hair is now almost completely white.One of Stone’s rules – along with soaking his martini olives in vermouth and never wearing a double-breasted suit with a button-down collar – is “Deny, deny, deny.” But his arrest for lying, obstructing and witness tampering raised the inevitable question about his on-and-off friend in the White House, the man who is the last jigsaw-puzzle piece in the investigation of Trumpworld’s alleged co-ordination with Russia: Is being Donald Trump finally about to catch up with Donald Trump?Stone, who famously has Nixon’s face tattooed on his back, is the agent provocateur who is the through line from Nixon, and his impeachment, to Trump, and his possible impeachment.As Manafort said in the 2017 documentary Get Me Roger Stone, Trump and Stone “see the world in a very similar way”. And that way is theatrical and cynical. Do whatever you have to do to get what you want playing by the rules is for suckers.In 1999, when I went on a trip to Miami to watch Trump test the presidential waters, Stone orchestrated Trump’s Castro-bashing speech to Cuban-Americans. The bodybuilding, swinging strategist, christened “the state-of-the-art sleazeball” by the New Republic in the 1980s, said he was “a jockey looking for a horse”.Stone, who was mixed up in Watergate at the tender age of 19, “made the transition from the Stone Age of dirty tricks to today”, as David Axelrod puts it.He watched Nixon rally the silent majority with a law-and-order message and racial dog whistling. He helped Ronald Reagan create Reagan Democrats.For decades, believing “past is prologue”, Stone urged Trump to be the successor to those pols, revving up angry, white working-class voters who felt belittled or scared of “the other”. It would be so easy to ide and stoke resentment, as Stone and Trump proved when they inflamed the birther controversy against Barack Obama.“Hate is a stronger motivator than love,” Stone told the documentarians. “Human nature has never changed.”The tribal tensions in America made Stone’s favourite tricks easier than ever he didn’t have to operate in the shadows. He wore a T-shirt with Bill Clinton and the word “Rape” at 2016 campaign rallies. As Stone boasted in the documentary, his “slash-and-burn” tactics “are now in vogue”.Trump has had periods of estrangement with Stone. In 2008, in an interview with the New Yorker, he called the strategist “a stone-cold loser”, a state Trump himself has been relegated to this past week, courtesy of Nancy Pelosi.Stone will not go gently. When he is asked about the tattoo of Nixon, he says he got it to remind himself, “A man is not finished when he is defeated he is only finished when he quits.”At the moment, though – dogged by Mueller – Stone and Manafort are the dog’s breakfast. The pair have given practising the dark arts a bad name."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

He also sent the letter to Theresa May, the Prime Minister.I am writing to ask you to stop this illegitimate transaction, the 35-year-old opposition leader wrote.If the money is transferred it will be used by the illegitimate and kleptocratic regime of Nicolas Maduro to repress and brutalise the Venezuelan people.Sir Alan Duncan, minister of the Americas, on Monday said it was a decision for the Bank to make, and suggested they should decline to release the gold.The Bank of England holds a significant amount of Venezuela\u0027s gold. This is a decision for the Bank of England, not the government, he said. No doubt they will take into account when they do the fact that a large number of countries across the world are now questioning the legitimacy of Nicolas Maduro and recognising that of Juan Guaido.  Nicolas Maduro inspecting the troops on Sunday - his military has, so far, largely remained loyal Mr Maduro has been attempting to repatriate the gold from the vaults since last year. The bullion in London makes up 15 per cent of Venezuela\u0027s foreign currency reserves.The  understands that each request for a release of gold made to the Bank of England is subject to fresh risk assessment procedures. The Caracas Chronicles, a Venezuelan publication, claims the Bank has twice refused gold transactions requests from the regime citing “compliance-related reasons”.A Bank of England spokesman said: “The Bank of England provides banking services – including gold custody services – to a large number of customers. The Bank does not comment on any of those relationships, which are subject to customer confidentiality. In all its operations, the Bank observes the highest standards of risk management and abides by all relevant legislation, including applicable financial sanctions.”The request from Mr Guaido came hours before the US imposed sanctions on oil exported from the country, and adds to mounting diplomatic and economic pressure on Mr Maduro to stand down.Steve Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, said on Monday afternoon that the oil was a “valuable asset that we are protecting for the Venezuelan people.”From now on oil revenues must now be placed in “blocked accounts”, which cannot be accessed by Mr Maduro. Mr Mnuchin said that there would also be limitations on the selling of oil products, but stopped short of announcing a total embargo on oil sales.Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world.“Effective immediately, any purchases of Venezuelan oil by US entities, money will have to go to blocked accounts,” he said, adding the US would continue to buy Venezuelan oil, but only if the money from the sale went into blocked accounts. “The purpose of sanctions is to change behaviour. When there is the recognition that PDVSA is the property of the rightful ruler of Venezuela, Juan Guaido, then it will go to him.“There is no reason for the poverty, the starvation, the humanitarian crisis.”John Bolton, the national security adviser, added: “The authoritarian regime of Chavez and Maduro has allowed the penetration of adversaries, not least Cuba. We think that is a strategic threat to the United States, and there are others – not least Iran.“It is our mission to make reality what the people of Venezuela want.”Directives sent on Friday to the US Federal Reserve will make it very hard for Mr Maduro to access Venezuela\u0027s overseas assets and earnings, including those from Houston-based Citgo, a subsidiary of state-owned oil giant PDVSA and the major source of revenue for the bankrupt government.Oil constitutes close to 90 per cent of Venezuelan exports. Some 75 per cent of the country’s cash-generating oil shipments go the US, according to Barclays, but Mr Maduro retains the support of Russia, China, Turkey and Iran and is likely to ert shipments to them.Venezuela collapse | Mothers and children pay the priceHowever, processing international financial transactions will be a challenge, without going through the US or European banks. Transport costs would also jump because Venezuela\u0027s ports are not well-equipped to load supertankers for transporting oil to such distant markets.Mr Maduro has had the door slammed in his face by Canada, Australia, Israel and a host of Latin nations, including Colombia, Chile, Argentina and Brazil, who have all followed the US lead and recognised Mr Guadio.Several EU countries have further said that Mr Maduro has eight days to call elections and end the stand-off, or else they will back Mr Guaido.Britain is yet to formally recognise Mr Guaido, but last week Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, said Mr Guaido was “the right person to take Venezuela forward”.Sir Alan also hit out at Labour MPs who wrote a joint letter to , criticising the far-Right governments of the US and Brazil, and saying they offer no hope to Venezuela.The letter, signed by shadow chancellor John McDonnell and shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, alongside other Labour MPs, iniduals and campaigners, insisted there is no justification for backing the US attempt at regime change under way and backed the call for dialogue from the Mexican and Bolivian presidents.Jorge Arreaza, Venezuela’s foreign minister, on Monday backed the talks suggested last week by Mexico and Bolivia, saying: “We’re even willing to meet with the devil so that we have sovereignty and peace.”But Sir Alan told the Commons he had little time for the Labour-led suggestion.I think we should all be saddened that in our midst are people who seem to have still sympathy for the regime of Nicolas Maduro despite what it has done to poor people, it has not just made them poorer, it has made them destitute and in many cases has forced them to flee,” he said.So let the signatories of that letter in the  be pinned on every wall as a list of signatures of shame.Rafael Uzcategui, director of the Venezuelan Program for Education-Action in Human Rights, said that eight people were murdered last week by the government in extra-judicial killings, while another 35 died in the recent protests, which began a week ago. Mr Guadio has called for more demonstrations this week.Speaking at a press conference, Mr Uzcategui said the extra-judicial executions happened in operations conducted by the police special forces unit, FAES, in socially deprived areas.Bank of EnglandPlease review our commenting policyBrexit latest odds: Best bets on how (and if) Brexit will happenThe 12 Brexit amendments in full: What each one does, who supports them and their chances of successWhat is Article 50?

Perceived to be boring and nerdy, it’s looked down upon by its “cooler” banking and investment brethren. It’s even less cool than accounting. Just imagine that existence… Which is why it is surprising to find someone like Amanda Blanc, CEO of EMEA for Swiss insurer Zurich, operating in this market. She is rare in financial services, never mind insurance. First of all, she is a woman – famously, there are more CEOs in the UK called Dave than there are female CEOs. But, more than that, she is not the kind of personality you expect to find operating in an insurance boardroom. There is little, if any, corporate front. She is driven, compassionate, outspoken, funny, challenging and infectious company. Even a bit sweary. And she talks at a mile a minute in her strong Welsh accent, so much so it is often hard to keep up.

To achieve all of that by the age of 50 while holding down a succession of high-pressure jobs must require a hard-nosed determination to succeed from the outset. But apparently being a high powered CEO was never part of the plan. In fact, if she’d had her way, she would have been a professional musician but freely admits she wasn’t good enough. The FCA\u0027s report into insurance pricing is deeply troubling City watchdog to probe home and car insurance marketsAdults carry out 109 \u0027life admin\u0027 tasks every year, research reveals“When I started working, I had two job offers,” she says. “One for the local council and one for the insurer, Commercial Union in Luton. I didn’t really know what insurance was. All I knew was that if I worked for the council, I would never leave Wales and I wanted to do something different.” Although she did indeed leave Wales, finally settling in Hampshire, she has made a point of maintaining her roots with regular visits “home”. “It’s still very important to me. I love Wales and the people there. It is completely grounded. When I go back home, I’m not a chief executive, I am who I’ve always been.”So how did a working class woman from the Rhondda Valley navigate her way to the top in what is a notoriously cutthroat and unforgiving environment? Blanc places a lot of the credit for her progress at the feet of some very supportive and encouraging mentors throughout her career, a role she in turn has assumed for others. Although she has never felt that either her gender or background has held her back, she is acutely aware that a lack of ersity in her industry is a problem and that women in particular require greater support and encouragement.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Union flag flies from a pole in front of the Elizabeth Tower, commonly known as Big Ben, near the Houses of Parliament in central London.

I see it in the women I mentor and the women I work with,” she says.“They’ll see a role they want to go for but if they can only fulfil nine out of the 10 requirements they will go away and create a development plan for that one thing. Only once they can tick that box will they think they can do the job. “You don’t see men respond in the same way. They think, ‘I can do five out of 10, I’m raring to go!’” A risk-averse culture within the industry is a major part of the problem, she says, and believes that without change, insurance will continue to be the land of men in dark\u0026nbspgrey suits and the boring alternative in financial services.“We need to encourage people to take risks – whether it’s headhunters, regulators, organisations or the women themselves. It’s like there is no room for error for women ... You don\u0027t see men respond in the same way“We need to work much harder at ensuring people get the opportunity to develop their careers in the way they want as it’s only then we will start to change the culture.”While she freely admits that changing the culture and the makeup of an organisation, never mind an industry, is incredibly difficult, she is adamant that the introduction of greater ersity is vital for the survival of both.“Any ersity changes things for the better. If you look back to the financial crisis of 2008, one of the main criticisms was, that around the boardrooms, everyone was the same. They indulged in group think.“The only way you can get away from group think is to introduce greater ersity, whether that is by age, gender, ethnicity or whatever. It doesn’t really matter.“What matters is having people that will come at things from a different perspective. Once you have that, you need to have an open enough mindset to listen to these iniduals and then act on what they are telling you.”Taking up the industry’s defence, she pushes against the perception that insurance is an old boys’ club cloistered in the heart of London’s financial district and is at pains to highlight the core role it plays in the country’s economy. “There are hundreds of thousands of people working in insurance across the country, doing a fantastic job every day. “The country would not function without insurance. Planes would not take off. Schools would not open. Public transport wouldn’t leave the depot. Without insurance, how does the infrastructure of the world operate?”\u0026nbspshe asks. It is a compelling defence, but insurance continues to labour under its boring and old-fashioned personality and accusations of poor practice. However, if Blanc can walk the talk and others like her can drive change from within, perhaps insurance can indeed move out of the shadows of its financial services peers and finally get its house in order.A View from the TopOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Just last week, Hinds said teachers should not be spending their evenings and weekends responding to emails. The minister also revealed proposals to give more support to teachers who want to work part-time and share jobs.If the rhetoric has remained the same since 2014, despite three different education secretaries, at least\u0026nbspnow the government has announced plans to provide more funding to improve retention.Teachers at the start of their career – who are often those who need the most support –\u0026nbspwill be given a training package and a reduced timetable, backed by at least £130m a year, under the proposals. \u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Syrian refugee in Lebanon: Education is the foundation of my dreams Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Sara, 11, is a Syrian refugee living in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley in an informal tented settlement.

But for the strategy to be effective, headteachers must be on board. They are in charge of school workload polices.And let’s not forget that more than 50 per cent of children in state schools in England are now taught in an academy. And these schools have many more freedoms to decide how they will manage their staff.It will take a lot more to change the culture in schools. Marking and planning lessons late into the evening and at the weekends is normal for many teachers. And headteachers who fear bad exam results, or a poor Ofsted inspection result, may be reluctant to take a more relaxed approach.Meanwhile, funding pressures will inevitably increase the pressures on staff as they struggle to keep the same provision in place with fewer teachers and resources.The extra cash and resources to reduce workload and normalise part-time work is welcome. But I would not be surprised if we hear similar ministerial rhetoric and pledges in years to come. There appears to be no magic bullet to poor work-life balance and shortages within the profession.Department for EducationOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However, bear in mind that, by doing so, you’ll lose the ability to see when your own sent messages have been read. 312 Hide your \u0027last seen\u0027 timePrevent your friends from finding out when you were last online by hiding your last seen time. Go to Settings \u0026gt Account \u0026gt Privacy \u0026gt Last Seen. As is the case with disabling read receipts, hiding your ‘last seen’ time will also stop you from seeing anybody else’s.You can control how much data you munch through on WhatsApp by limiting the types of media you automatically download on a mobile connection. Go to Settings \u0026gt Data Usage and choose the best option for you. If you’re expecting an important WhatsApp message from someone, set a custom notification for them by opening the chat, tapping their name at the top and hitting Custom Notifications.612 Format your messagesTo jazz up any of your messages, simply highlight it by tapping and holding it, hit the More Options key on the pop-up menu and tap the formatting option you want - bold, italic, strikethrough or monospace.You can get Siri or Google Assistant to type your WhatsApp messages out for you by saying either “Hey Siri” or “Okay Google”, followed by the name of the person you want to message and the actual contents of the message. 812 Mark chats as unreadWhen you’ve read a message but can’t reply to it straight away, you can set a visual reminder by marking it as unread. On Android, long-press the conversation, and on iOS, swipe from left to right on a chat.You almost certainly won’t do this on a regular basis, but it’s a handy option to have. You can export entire conversations - complete with emoji and media attachments - by hitting More inside a chat a selecting Email Chat.You can send the same message to lots of your contacts without lumping them all into one group, much like the BCC option on email, by hitting the New Broadcast option on the app’s main menu.You pin up to three contacts and groups to the top of your WhatsApp conversation list by tapping and holding a chat, then hitting the pin icon. 1212 Make things easier to findYou can easily mark key messages with a star, allowing you to find them easily when you need to. Just tap and hold a message and hit the star icon to save it, and return to it later by selecting Starred Messages in WhatsApp’s main menu.No official details have been released, but the merger is expected to take place by early next year,\u0026nbspThe New York Times\u0026nbspreported.The messaging app merger is a backtrack on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u0027s original stance that both Instagram and WhatsApp would operate autonomously from the social network.Facebook acquired photo-sharing platform Instagram for approximately $1bn (£761m) in 2012, before taking over\u0026nbspthe messaging app WhatsApp in 2014 for an estimated $19.3bn.Both apps have since experienced rapid growth – Instagram has around 1 billion monthly active users and WhatsApp has 1.5 billion users –\u0026nbspthough all original founders of the apps have since left Facebook.Facebook \u0027tricked children\u0027 into spending money on in-app gamesWhy Facebook might be about to ruin WhatsAppWhatsApp employees were\u0026nbspreportedly upset by plans to merge the app\u0027s messaging services with the other apps, making their views known during a contentious\u0026nbspstaff meeting in December.One of the main points of contention with integrating the apps could be related to data privacy. Currently WhatsApp users are not required to provide their name or any other identifying information beyond their phone number to use the messaging app.Merging with Facebook Messenger and Instagram could force WhatsApp users to reveal information about themselves that they would prefer to keep private.Data privacy expert Tim Mackey, who works at the software firm Synopsys, told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspthat Facebook should take considerable care in how the integration ws handled given the firm\u0027s spotty history with user privacy.Merging personal information and privacy configurations from three significant applications won’t be trivial, he said. Facebook development teams would do well to look at this precedent and prioritise user privacy.With the integration project currently expected to take a year to complete, and with end-to-end encryption as part of the plan, we should expect the Facebook engineering teams to focus attention on uniform data security both in their platform and in the apps themselves.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To do it, go to Settings and Blocking. Annoyingly, you have to block people on Messenger separately. One of Facebook’s handiest privacy features is the ability to review posts you’re tagged in before they appear on your Timeline.

That hasn\u0027t ever been possible before.At the moment, the three are entirely separate. Though they are all developed by the same company, and so share some data between themselves and work together, they are in practise three different apps that can\u0027t talk to each other.But this state of affairs has been gradually changing, even before this news. WhatsApp years ago started sharing data with Facebook, and the founders of both WhatsApp and Instagram have left the company in recent months amid suggestions they were concerned about their apps being subsumed into the parent company.Mark Zuckerberg hopes the decision will make each of the apps more useful, according to the original\u0026nbspNew York Times\u0026nbspreport. That in turn should make people engage with them more – and potentially encourage them to stop using rivals, like Apple\u0027s iMessage.“We want to build the best messaging experiences we can and people want messaging to be fast, simple, reliable and private, a Facebook spokesperon said.\u0026nbspWe\u0027re working on making more of our messaging products end-to-end encrypted and considering ways to make it easier to reach friends and family across networks. As you would expect, there is a lot of discussion and debate as we begin the long process of figuring out all the details of how this will work.”In short, Facebook believes the combined infrastructure will make the apps better, and therefore more likely to be used that, in turn, will help generate more of the data and advertising opportunities that Facebook relies on to make its money. But there might be other less obvious reasons to bring the three together, as well.Until now, the apps have been kept separate, and so the data they each collect has been partly compartmentalised too.People have also been able to share different data with the companies themselves. WhatsApp only requires a phone number for people to use it, allowing them to stay relatively anonymous if they wish on Facebook, people have to use their real name and are asked to give over far more personal information.Many people choose to share more on WhatsApp or even entirely forego Facebook, because the latter has always had a more lax approach to people\u0027s personal data. WhatsApp has repeatedly stressed how important it is safeguard people\u0027s privacy – but that was largely led by its founders, who have left the company, and is thought to be getting eroded as it is subsumed by Facebook.\u0026nbspIn short, the move could be a concern for anyone who prefers to keep their data separate – and away from Facebook. The sense of having some contacts, information or messages safe on WhatsApp and away from its owner, or vice versa, will be lost.It\u0027s possible that same data will be used for advertising, and there have already been rumours about WhatsApp using information for marketing or showing ads within the app itself. No final decision on how the integrated services will be monetised has been decided yet, the\u0026nbspNew York Times\u0026nbspreported.Regulators are likely to share those concerns, and it\u0027s almost certain there will be yet more questions about whether Facebook should be more restrained than it is now.Facebook is still in the early stages of the work, according to the reports. But the plan is set to be finished by the end of this year or the beginning of 2020.As with most Facebook projects, the rollout will probably be small at the beginning and gradually take place across users. It\u0027s likely that such a major update will be made available to a small number of beta testers initially before being added in stages.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In the same year, the company\u0027s shares dropped 30 per cent.\u0026nbspJosie Cox\u0026nbspexplains how\u0026nbspit got there and where it\u0027s going nextClick to followThe IndependentApple Park, the new headquarters in Cupertino designed by Lord Norman Foster, cost roughly $5bn, and will house 13,000 employees when everyone has moved inFor an interview published in the\u0026nbspFinancial Times\u0026nbspback in 2006, journalist Richard Waters hauled himself to a nondescript corner of the Californian city of San Jose to meet with a corpulent computer scientist called Steve. As Richard walked into a vinyl-clad diner called The Hickory Pit, Steve sat –\u0026nbspbearded and burly – hunched over some sort of hand-held device, engrossed in a game of Tetris.The setting of the interview was unusual for the FT. The salmon pink daily is more widely known for its profiles of the buffed and manicured business elite, lounging in grand villas, chalets and penthouse pads, preferably in Davos or Cannes. But Steve – eating cherry pie in a washed-out T-shirt – had certainly earned his column inches: 30\u0026nbspyears earlier, together with another Steve and an electronics industry worker called Ronald, the Hickory Pit’s favourite tech geek created what would later become the world’s largest publicly traded company. For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHis unremarkable appearance and the profoundly mundane setting of his encounter with the FT, convey a banality neatly reflected in the origins of the very firm he was instrumental in founding: An experimental three-man band (the original start-up, if you will) that took a crazy punt on a simple motherboard and now has more cash than the vast majority of countries.Apple was founded on 1 April 1976 by the late Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne in Cupertino. It wormed its way on to the tech scene with a creation named the Apple I, a computer designed and built by Tetris-loving Wozniak, and sold for the ominous sum of $666.66 – or about $2,900 in today’s inflation-adjusted money. Unremarkably, the name reportedly stems from Jobs’ fondness of the humble fruit.Less than a year later, the company was incorporated. Wayne had already jumped ship, having sold his stake in the group for the paltry sum of $800, but –\u0026nbspunhampered by the exit of a third of its staff –\u0026nbspApple’s operational revenues were heading north. According to media reports, they almost doubled every four months during the first five years of the company operating. Between September 1977 and the same month in 1980, sales increased by more than 500 per cent, on average annually.Apple’s mysterious new charger might be about to arriveThe Apple II and Apple III followed, and the company’s success grew with every launch. On 12 December 12 1980 it listed on the stock exchange, publicly floating around 4.6 million shares at $22 apiece. The offering turned scores of Apple’s early employees into instant millionaires. Shares in the company ended the day at $29 each, giving Jobs a net worth of well over $200 million. He was 25 at the time.In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh. Its debut was marked with a high-budget neo-noir dystopian commercial, aired during that year’s Super Bowl and directed by Bladerunner’s Ridley Scott. The release was hailed a watershed moment not just for the tech world, but also for the advertising industry. Already then Apple was inventing itself as a generation-defining, industry straddling brand a firm that challenged the status quo and confronted the norm ruthlessly.Though Jobs and Wozniak both left the company in the mid-1980s amid disputes with management, predominantly over strategy, Apple’s success initially continued untarnished.In 1991 the company created the PowerBook, presenting a blueprint for all modern laptops. That same year it launched System 7, adding colour to the interface. But not all its products proved a hit. The company was struggling to tap into its client base and it was failing to gain traction with its strategy of marketing high-end products with a high price – dubbed the High-Right Policy – while simultaneously battling heavyweight rivals, like Microsoft, which in many cases were offering similar technology at a vastly smaller price.By 1997, marred by constant leadership change, an unclear approach to the market and a series of painful restructuring exercises, Apple was forced to choose between sticking to its poorly performing guns or risking a dramatic high-stakes turnaround. It chose the latter. It snapped up NeXT, – Jobs’ new venture – for $429 million and scrapped the High-Right Policy. Shortly after, it launched the iMac G3, an affordable machine with a quirky, futuristic look that jarred with Apple’s previous designs, but spoke to a new generation of tech-savvy, progressive professionals. The move proved a lifeline for the financially bruised group and catapulted it into a new era. Apple computers were no longer just the tools of businessmen and accountants, but the product of choice for students, designers and artists. It had won over the creative elite and would continue to claim there support for many years to come.Jobs, who had returned to Apple as an adviser in early 1997, assumed the position of interim CEO when Gilbert Frank Amelio, the company’s boss since February 1996, was pushed out for overseeing several quarters of lacklustre earnings. And it was at this time too that Jonathan Ive joined the upper echelons of management, injecting fresh energy into the brand and later designing the decade-defining iPod and iPad.\u0026nbspThe 2000s were a period of revival for Apple, which the company kicked off with a wild buying spree. It snapped up a portfolio of corporations, including a DVD authoring platform and a music software group. In May 2001, doors to its first retail stores opened and it debuted the iPod, of which more than 100 million were sold over the subsequent six years. The iTunes Store launched in 2003. Within just two years it was the world’s largest music retailer. The MacPro, MacBook, and MacBook Pro hit the market with resounding success, marking the dawn of Apple’s gradual shift away from computers and towards the future of portable consumer electronics.At the Macworld Expo on January 9 2007, Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone of which hundreds of thousands were sold within hours. A year later the App Store was introduced, allowing users to buy third-party applications for their devices and generating millions of dollars of revenue within its own right.\u0026nbspIn 2010, shortly after Jobs took his first medical leave of absence, Apple introduced the iPad which was met with massive demand globally, helping the company’s market capitalisation eclipse that of arch rival Microsoft for the first time in over two decades. The iPhone 4 was released in June of that year, offering a range of new features, including video calling, and sporting a now iconic stainless steel design. The iPod Nano, iPod Touch and iPod Shuffle were also relaunched and the MacBook Air was updated, powering Apple to the top of the list of the world’s most valuable consumer brands.In dire contrast to his professional success though, Jobs’ health was deteriorating. In January 2011 he announced to staff that he would be taking another period of leave of indefinite length, handing the reigns to chief operating officer Tim Cook.\u0026nbspIn August 2011 he officially resigned as CEO. He passed away in October in Palo Alto, succumbing to a rare and aggressive form of pancreatic cancer. Jobs was 56 years old.In many ways, Apple’s post-Jobs years were an era of superlatives. Thanks largely to the launch of the iPhone4S and iPhone 5, and later the iPad mini, Apple’s market value in 2012 soared to an unprecedented $624bn, beating the previous record set by Microsoft. It used that financial momentum to further its quest to ersify into newfangled fields like augmented reality and artificial intelligence. It also remained fiercely committed to design and in 2013 recruited the former CEO of Yves Saint Laurent, as well as former Burberry executive Angela Ahrendts to oversee its digital strategy.Why Apple plans to stop putting a number on iPhone salesApple boss says data is being ‘weaponised with military efficiency’Tim Cook responds after Apple becomes first trillion-dollar companyThe company became a staple on lists of the world’s most valuable, best-known and influential brands. By January 2016 a billion Apple devices were reported to be in active use around the world. It moved into smart home technology and ride-sharing, through its investment in Chinese Uber rival Didi Chuxing. It bought Shazam, a music recognition service, launched its own video unit and signed a content partnership with Oprah Winfrey. Several series are reportedly in development as well as a film. Elsewhere collaborations with Hermes and Nike spurred sales of the Apple Watch, and in October 2018 it launched the twelfth generation of the iPhone. Its slogan? “Brilliant. In every way”.In\u0026nbsp2018, Apple became the first company in history to have a market value in excess of $1 trillion, an amount greater than the gross domestic product of most countries in the world, including TurkeyIn late summer 2018, Apple became the first company in history to have a market value in excess of $1 trillion, an amount greater than the gross domestic product of most countries in the world, including Turkey, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia and Sweden.\u0026nbspEmployment hit more than\u0026nbsp90,000 and, according to some reports, the company has more readily deployable cash than the US Treasury. The combined wealth of the world’s 10\u0026nbsprichest people – a list that includes Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, financier Warren Buffett, and Facebook founder Mark Zuckergerg – doesn’t even come close to the size of Apple’s market capitalisation.The “too big to fail” economic theory prescribes that some organisations, particularly banks, are so large and influential, that their failure would be catastrophic for the broader economy. Apple is undoubtedly one of those organisations, and in the last few months of 2018 markets were offered a taste of what that could actually mean.Shares peaked around the launch of the latest iPhone, and started trending lower shortly thereafter. Between early October and the end of the year, Apple’s shares lost more than 30 per cent of their value, taking them to below $160 from a peak of over $230 just a week earlier, and dragging swathes of the broader stock market with them.Analysts said that investors were falling out of love with the name for a slew of reasons. Product sales were slowing and consumers were becoming more sensitive to prices amid fears of an impending economic downturn. After reporting a set of quarterly results on 1 November\u0026nbspthat reflected a weakening in crucial emerging markets, Apple’s shares fell by 7 per cent in a single day wiping an estimated $70 billion off the group’s value.Executives at the time said that they would stop providing quarterly updates for the number of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers sold, unnerving investors further. The cost of new products also spawned worries, with the average selling price of iPhones climbing to $793 during the final quarter of 2018.After reporting quarterly results that reflected a weakening in emerging markets, Apple’s shares fell by 7 per cent, wiping $70 billuon off the group’s value“Our worry is there must be a limit to Apple’s pricing power,” George Salmon, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, told Reuters at the time. “The group is now charging close to $800 per phone, and while that’s helping revenues climb despite flat sales volumes, one has to wonder how the strategy to shimmy up the price ladder fares in a downturn. If consumers start feeling the pinch, those price tags could put the punters off.”Analyst Chaim Siegel at Elazar Advisors told the agency that trade issues between China and the US are also threatening to throw a ner in the works if they make it hard for Apple to get the supplies it needs. “As for emerging markets slowing, that’s also contagion from China. Both trade war issues coming to reality,” he said.Elsewhere analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch slashed their recommendation on the stock to “neutral” from “buy”, explaining that they are “incrementally concerned that not all the weakness is captured in the near-term” and that there are likely to be “further negative estimate revisions” to Apple’s financials. Analysts at Goldman Sachs cut their share price target on the stock repeatedly.Others have shown concern about the company’s emphasis on its services business: ApplePay, Apple Music and the App store. Potential for growth is undoubtedly there, but the company has yet to share concrete plans about its strategy going forward and how it intends to keep growing.\u0026nbspNot helping the situation, Tim Cook in early January wrote a letter to shareholders in which he announced that Apple’s results for the quarter that ended on 29 December\u0026nbsp2018 were likely to be worse than previously anticipated. Cook cited the unforeseen “magnitude” of the economic slowdown in markets such as\u0026nbspChina. The profit warning was Apple’s first since 2002 and dealt a fresh hefty blow to the share price, as well as the performance of dozens of smaller suppliers and competitors whose fate is closely linked to that of Apple. It also sent shockwaves through broader financial markets, sending stocks – which are generally considered a fairly risky asset – sharply lower in most regions and driving demand for perceived safe havens, like gold and Japan’s yen. The sell-off was a dramatic reminder of the sheer scale of the Apple ecosystem. If Apple sneezes many parts of the financial system will most certainly catch a cold.Since then Apple shares have continued to trade sideways, keeping the company’s market capitalisation well below that psychologically significant $1\u0026nbsptrillion\u0026nbspmark and raising questions about how much more correcting still needs to be done, before – or if – the trajectory can turn.So what will 2019 hold for the company which is no longer quite the world’s largest (having\u0026nbsprelinquished that role to Microsoft and Amazon)? Opinions are ided. While many experts who have been tracking the stock for years predict this to be a turning point, others consider it more of a blip.“When we get into these situations where the current product may not be moving as well as investors expected, some get scared and then the fear compounds itself,” Jason Benowitz, a senior portfolio manager at Roosevelt Investors, told Bloomberg. “We’re not really too concerned. Some of this is probably just noise like it always is.”Also speaking to the news agency, Ross Gerber, co-founder of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth \u0026amp Investment Management, described the climate of fear around Apple as “absurd”. “It doesn’t make any sense. It’s a solid business even if it’s not going to grow as much as it did,” he said.Apple is still hugely profitable. It’s sitting on well over $200 billion of cash, and shares – despite their recent brutal tumble – have roughly doubled in the past five years. The omnipresence of Apple devices across the planet also suggests that if the company’s heyday really is over, then its decline would likely be glacial rather than sudden. It simply has too many dependents, both in the corporate world and the consumer world, to swiftly fizzle out.As for Wozniak, the smiley 68-year old with a penchant for pie and Tetris, is unperturbed the ultimate bull, in market parlance. In an interview with CNBC at the end of last year, he said that Jobs would be proud of what Apple had become. Speaking of rivals, like Samsung, Wozniak said that they don’t present a real threat. They’re not innovating, he explained. They’re simply creating “fun features”. Apple, meanwhile, is concentrating on innovations that “literally affect everything we do all the time in life”.If Wozniak is right, then Apple’s dominance is far from over. Technology famously knows no limits and it’s increasingly evident that consumer appetite hardly does either. We want lives that are interconnected, homes that are smarter than us, phones that manage our whole existence and privacy that is safeguarded unconditionally.Amid all this, the most serious challenge for Apple will be to keep up with contracting attention s. In a world of instant gratification, it’s becoming clear that he who fails to innovate is lost. Perhaps, just perhaps, that will prove Apple’s greatest obstacle yet.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

For Diane Abbott, a politician with extensive media experience, the show was a “horrible experience”, the worst of her many appearances on the programme. Having appeared on something like 30 episodes, that’s significant. After all, some of her early experiences were almost as eventful. \u0026nbspHer appearance on Question Time in July 1987 was particularly memorable. Abbott shared a panel with Liberal MP Cyril Smith and Conservative minister Michael Heseltine, with Robin Day in the chair. Then, as now, it was the discussion of opinion polls that caused uproar. The polls, Smith commented forcefully, showed that Labour was unelectable, “and one of the reasons for it,”\u0026nbsphe added, “is Diane Abbott and people like her...”\u0026nbspThe largely white audience applauded, and after a moment’s delay chuckled, seeming to get some unspoken joke. Abbott called him out:\u0026nbsp“If Mr Smith believes that having black people in parliament for the first time is in some sense a backward step, thousands of people that voted for me in Hackney North would disagree.”\u0026nbspFor exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe response was immediate. For Heseltine this was beyond the pale. He appealed to Day to intervene. The audience protested vocally. “I honestly believe,”\u0026nbspsaid one white man, “that the vast majority of the audience here do not see Diane as a black person.”\u0026nbspThis went down well, as did his thought that Abbott was the panellist showing true prejudice for assuming that white people perceived race. Day wrapped up the discussion apologising to the audience for calling Abbott black, his implication being that unless he had said so, none of the white people in the crowd would have been able to tell.The way I was treated on Question Time was a disgraceThe 1987 episode exposes the nature of the assumptions of many white Britons about race in Thatcher’s Britain. Britain was, as Heseltine put it, a harmonious and tolerant country, white people were effectively “colourblind”, and black people who claimed otherwise were either deluded or harbouring their own anti-white prejudice.In the same way, last week’s Question Time says something important about the nature of our politics, its entrenched biases, and which political figures are taken seriously.Evidence of bias on the show is best illustrated through comparison. Abbott was interrupted twice as often as prisons minister Rory Stewart, even though Stewart spoke more often, and for more of the show. The introductions at the top of the show were far from even-handed. Stewart’s introduction covered his ministerial career, past and present, as well as his governorships in Iraq.For all her achievements, for all of her experience, Abbott was not treated with the same degree of respect as Stewart or Oakeshott, her voice was not given as much weightBy comparison, Abbott’s introduction was short on detail. What is more, by linking her position as shadow home secretary to her relationship with Jeremy Corbyn, there was an implication that Abbott owed her job to a personal relationship, rather than merit. Indeed, according to several audience members, this was precisely the point made by Fiona Bruce before the show. Equally, in introducing Abbott, Bruce failed to mention her time as shadow minister for public health, her years on the Foreign Affairs Select Committee or the Treasury Select Committee, nor did she mention that Abbott is the first black woman to be elected to the Commons.Then there was Bruce’s decision to side with journalist Isabel Oakeshott’s wholly inaccurate statement that Labour was “way behind... miles behind” in the polls. At the same time, she was quick to assure the audience that Abbott was “definitely” wrong in her contention that the two main parties were essentially “level pegging”. In reality, as the BBC has subsequently acknowledged, Abbott was correct.Although this was never said explicitly, the constant interruptions (21 times compared to nine interruptions of Stewart and eight of the SNP’s Kirsty Blackman), the minimisation of Abbott’s achievements, the willingness to “correct” Abbott when she was in the right, all indicate that in some important sense, Abbott was out of place. For all her achievements, for all of her experience, Abbott was not treated with the same degree of respect as Stewart or Oakeshott, her voice was not given as much weight:\u0026nbspin short, she was not treated as a serious political figure.Why not? Abbott’s treatment is perplexing. In some ways, her biography is similar to many of our political leaders. Educated at an elite university, she went on to have a career in Whitehall, then the media, and then parliament. But the fact that Abbott is a black woman, from a working-class family gives each stage of this story a different significance.She won her place at Cambridge in 1973, at a time when only 10 per cent of the university’s students were women. While the university did not collect data on student ethnicity at the time, recent research shows that she was the second black person to study at Newnham in its century-long history, and only the third black person to study history at Cambridge in the 750 years since the university’s foundation.For politicians such as Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson, success in university politics was part of their path to Westminster. Not so for Abbott, who had little time for college debating societies. Her antipathy to university politics is easy to explain. Enoch Powell was honorary president of the university’s Conservative Society when Abbott started at Cambridge, and women were excluded from many of Cambridge’s student societies. But more than that, Abbott found the concerns of student politics essentially elitist.Abbott’s path from university to parliament was anything but straightforward. She entered the Commons in 1987, at a time when there were no black people in the house, at a time when fewer than 5 per cent of MPs were women, and at a time when there was widespread suspicion of black radicalism. Abbott’s historic success was the result of a decade of activism, working with black organisations, and within the Labour Party.Accusing the BBC of bias over Diane Abbott is a step too farDiane Abbott rejects BBC response to Question Time rowLabour demands BBC footage and apology amid Abbott Question Time rowDiane Abbott accuses BBC of anti-Corbyn bias in stinging attackDiane Abbott accuses Question Time of legitimising ‘bias and abuse’In 1978 Abbott became involved with the Organisation of Women of African and Asian Descent (OWAAD), an umbrella organisation for black and Asian women’s groups. Founded by radicals including Stella Dadzie and Olive Morris, Abbott believed that the black womanism she encountered at OWAAD was far more sophisticated and rooted in the concerns of working-class black women\u0026nbspthan the student politics she had experienced at Cambridge. \u0026nbspIn 1983 Labour politics and black radicalism came together. Together with Russell Proffit, Elaine Foster, Marc Wadsworth\u0026nbspand others, Abbott founded the Labour Party Black Sections movement, which fought for black representation at all levels of the party, with a view to gaining black representation at all levels of government. Black Sections was\u0026nbspextraordinarily controversial. The right-wing press dubbed Abbott, Paul Boateng, Linda Bellos, Bernie Grant, Sharon Atkin and other LPBS activists “Black Extremists”, “Black Militants” and “Loony Left”.\u0026nbspIn 1997, Abbott led the first backbench rebellion against Tony Blair’s cuts to lone parent benefits. She was credited at the time for being the first MP to damage the new prime ministerThe movement was\u0026nbspno less controversial inside the Labour Party, and in the run-up to the 1987 election, black candidates were regularly deselected –\u0026nbspthe party leadership seemed to feel that white voters would not turn out for black candidates. In spite of this apparent hostility from the party leadership, in spite of constant attacks in the media, four Black Sections candidates won seats in the 1987 election, Abbott\u0026nbsp(the only woman) among them.Since 1987, Abbott has had a distinguished parliamentary career. Her first major campaign\u0026nbspas an MP\u0026nbspwas against the imprisoning of refugees on Britain’s first private jail, the Earl William, a recently privatised and hastily repurposed car ferry. Abbott visited the Tamil refugees, many of whom had fled torture, highlighting their squalid conditions, and the absence of medical care. The Thatcher government refused to back down, even when the floating prison, nicknamed “the hulk” due to its obvious disrepair, broke its moorings and ran aground in the great storm of October 1987.In 1997, Abbott led the first backbench rebellion against Tony Blair’s cuts to lone parent benefits. She was credited at the time for being the first MP to damage the new prime minister. Abbott also played an important role in exposing evidence of government complicity in the “arms to Africa” scandal. Someone at the top of government was clearly irked by Abbott’s efforts on the Foreign Affair Select Committee, for a government dossier on Abbott was leaked, containing material stolen from her a decade earlier.Abbott’s skill as a parliamentarian was not lost on The Spectator. The venerable right-wing journal awarded her parliamentary speech of the year in 2008, for her forensic critique of Gordon Brown’s proposed anti-terror laws. Abbott stood for the leadership of the Labour Party in 2010, and since joining the shadow cabinet she led Labour’s attack on the government over last year’s Windrush scandal.The first thing my staff have to do in the morning is go online and delete and block all the stuffIn spite of this long, pioneering and successful career, in spite of all of her experience in parliament, and working with grassroots campaigns, Abbott was treated with derision on Question Time.Anti-politics, and a generalised distrust of politicians is part of the current zeitgeist. Yet, even in an age of distrust some politicians are derided more than others. Privilege insulates some iniduals and groups at the expense of others. So, Oakeshott can get polling data wrong and still be taken seriously. Stewart can pull figures out of the air, and still expect to be treated with respect. But as a black woman, Abbott is routinely ridiculed, and her infrequent gaffs are seized upon as “proof”\u0026nbspthat she has no right to be at the centre of British politics.Boris Johnson is, perhaps the best example of a British politician insulated by privilege. As an exceptionally wealthy, white man he can get away with accusing the Turkish president of having sex with a goat he can brush off criticism following his use of the word “piccaninnies” he was even able to accuse Barack Obama of “ancestral dislike” of Britain, and still be given the job of foreign secretary – one of the highest offices of state.None of this is without personal consequences for Abbott, who experiences more racism now than at any time in her 35 years in politics. “Twitter has put racists into overdrive,” Abbott remarked in response to research published by Amnesty International in December 2018. The research showed that black women in journalism and politics were 84 per cent more likely than white women to be mentioned in abusive tweets. “The first thing my staff have to do in the morning is go online and delete and block all the stuff,” she said.\u0026nbspAn earlier study by Amnesty of 900,223 tweets sent in the six months before the 2017 election\u0026nbsprevealed that Abbott received 45 per cent of all abusive tweets sent to women MPs, 10 times more than other women in parliament. According to Abbott: “It’s highly racialised and it’s also gendered because people talk about rape and they talk about my physical appearance in a way they wouldn’t talk about a man. I’m abused as a female politician and I’m abused as a black politician.”During the 2016 US election, Trump claimed infamously\u0026nbspthat he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue without losing any voters. He was so insulated by his status that “his people” would still support him, even if he was guilty of murder. Sadly, as last week’s Question Time shows, a similar relationship between privilege and bias is at work in British politics.Robin Bunce is a historian based at Homerton College, University of Cambridge Paul Field is a lawyer, writer and human rights activistOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ashley Cowburn looks at some of the crucial amendments the Commons are set to vote on and considers what might happen nextClick to followThe IndependentIs the cliff edge in sight?Following Theresa May’s historic Brexit defeat a fortnight ago, MPs now have the opportunity to put their own plans to the Commons and shape the next step in\u0026nbspBritain’s exit from the European Union.More than\u0026nbspa dozen amendments from various factions of MPs are currently on the order paper for tomorrow, but it is not yet known which will be selected for a vote by the speaker of the Commons, John Bercow.He is expected to reveal his decision around midday, with votes subsequently taking place from 7pm once debates have concluded.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe majority of the amendments, if they win the backing of MPs, will not have the immediate force of law, but instead act as a signal to the prime minister of the kind of Brexit MPs are likely to accept.There are a few crucial amendments that have focused minds in the past week.No-deal Brexit puts UK food security at risk, warn Sainsbury’s, AsdaMay ready to demand removal of Irish backstop after Tory pressureBrexit fears drag UK consumer confidence to 18-month lowMay’s Brexit hopes dealt blow as Ireland says backstop won’t changeThe first is from\u0026nbspLabour MP Yvette Cooper, whose cross-party motion seeks to prevent a no-deal scenario by giving MPs the power to request an extension of the Article 50 process if the prime minister fails to secure backing for her plans by the end of February.As things stand, this amendment appears to have the best chance of passing, as\u0026nbspLabour frontbenchers have strongly hinted it will receive official backing from the party. Its passage would be significant, as it would give MPs –\u0026nbspnot the executive –\u0026nbspthe ability to control the UK’s exit date from the EU.A second group of amendments are concerned with\u0026nbspthe backstop proposal –\u0026nbspthe EU’s insurance policy in the withdrawal agreement against a hard border in Ireland, which is despised by Brexiteer MPs.One has been tabled by the Conservative MP Sir Graham Brady, who chairs the influential 1922 Committee of the party’s backbenchers in Westminster. His plan requires the backstop to be replaced with “alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border”.It is hoped that if the government backs this move and it eventually passes the Commons on Tuesday, it would give the prime minister a mandate to return to Brussels and request changes.Created with Sketch.

Tom Brown’s Schooldays by Thomas Hughes (1857)This moving, charming and poignant tale of boarding school life is included partly for its own merits, but also as it was the first in the school story genre which spawned so many thousands of books, through Enid Blyton right up to J K Rowling.  And, of course, the bully Flashman, without whom we wouldn’t have George McDonald Fraser’s hilarious series detailing his further adventures. 230 29. The Tale of Peter Rabbit by Beatrix Potter (1902)Even Potter knew she was writing nostalgically about an imagined past but who could not fail to love this slyly observed tale of a naughty rabbit? Potter’s arch, almost Austen-esque prose interacts seamlessly with her keenly observed studies of flora and fauna. Avoid the new film, and stick to the original.330 28. How to Train Your Dragon by Cressida Cowell (2003)Quite simply, Cressida Cowell has an exceptional  ability to give children what they like. Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III is a Viking who doesn’t fit in: gawky and geeky, his adventures with his hunting-dragon Toothless are madcap and marvellous. Give it to a child, and see them become engrossed immediately. 430 27. The Lie Tree by Frances Hardinge (2015, Macmillan)The recent winner of the overall Costa Book Awards is a remarkable novel from a remarkable writer. Hardinge is a true original, her sentences poised and poetic, her alternative 19th-century world fully imagined, and her intelligent, inquiring female lead not simply a good role model but also a fine addition to literature.530 26. Noughts and Crosses by Malorie Blackman (2001)Former Children’s Laureate Malorie Blackman’s novel described a world in which black Africans had enslaved white Europeans. Whites, or noughts, were economically impoverished, whilst the blacks, or crosses, were in power. An inter-racial love affair between two teens brings first passion and then tragedy. Powerful, provocative and original.630 25. The Mouse and His Child by Russell Hoban (1967)A bittersweet and unusual tale, in which a clockwork mouse and his child are thrown out of a toy shop, and then must embark on a journey to find safety. Unlike the film Toy Story, in which the toys are complicit in their servitude, this allows discarded toys to find a world of their own, constructed according to their own terms. Full of striking imagery and exciting scenes. 730 24. Down with Skool! A Guide to School Life for Tiny Pupils and their Parents by Geoffrey Willans and Ronald Searle (1953)As any fule know, reading Molesworth is like being a member of a secret skool gang. Complemented by Ronald Searle’s satirical drawings of depressed, deluded schoolmasters and grubby, disobedient schoolboys, all the world’s vanity and hypocrisy is on display through Molesworth’s cynical, instantly likeable and badly spelled voice. A grate writer, indeed.830 23. Artemis Fowl by Eoin Colfer (2001)A wondrously clever book that upturns children’s literature convention. Its hero, Artemis Fowl, is a 12 year old boy who also happens to be a criminal mastermind. Containing such characters as a kleptomaniac, flatulent dwarf, and a centaur called Foaly who’s also a technical whizz, this is a hilarious delight. 930 22. The Scarecrows by Robert Westall (1981)I’ve chosen The Scarecrows over The Machine Gunners, which is perhaps Westall’s better known book, as I think this has a quality of terror and an understanding of adolescence that is matchless. It focuses on a boy’s tortured relationship with his stepfather, and the encroachment of a murder that happened many years before. Unforgettably spine-tingling, and profoundly affecting.1030 21. The Harry Potter series by J K Rowling (late 20th century)First published over 20 years ago, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone blazed into the world’s consciousness like a bolt of lightning. Moving from the initial wonder and quirky charm of the first three books, the series took on a darker tone, resulting in an enthralling septet and a cultural phenomenon.1130 20. The Ghost of Thomas Kemp by Penelope Lively (1973)Penelope Lively once said that “Children need to sense that we live in a permanent world that reaches away behind and ahead of us.” Her writing encompasses a huge range, and this, her Carnegie-winning novel about a house beset by the spirit of a sorceror, is eerie, effective and involving.1230 19. Tom’s Midnight Garden by Philippa Pearce (1958)Considered by many to be one of children’s literature’s most outstanding examples. Tom is packed away to stay with his aunt and uncle: but when the clock strikes thirteen, he finds a gorgeous garden, and in it a little girl called Hatty, who seems to come from a different time. Emotionally rich, it will leave a lasting impression on any child. 1330 18. The Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula Le Guin (1968)The recent death of Ursula Le Guin, aged 88, has brought renewed attention to her works. Ged, a dark skinned boy from the goat herding island of Gont, demonstrates exceptional powers and is sent to learn how to be a wizard. His resulting quest is epic, with a depth and strangeness that lasts.1430 17. The Wolves of Willoughby Chase by Joan Aiken (1962)This has all the hallmarks of classic children’s literature: missing parents, a usurping adult, terrible injustices and the romance of winter and wolves. Set in an alternative historical era, where James III rules, little Bonnie’s fortune is snatched by a sinister governess. Children will cheer when she gets her comeuppance.1530 16. The Story of Ferdinand by Munro Leaf (1936)What at first seems to be a delightful story about a little bull who hates fighting becomes a potent fable about what’s expected of boys. Rejecting masculine violence, Ferdinand prefers just to sit under a cork tree. The illustrations of Spanish matadors, picadors and their arenas are astoundingly evocative. 1630 15. Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak (1963)A picture book that reveals more about itself each time it’s read. Note how the pictures expand as Max’s imaginative world grows how the text, poetic and spare, interacts with the visuals how Max, through his journey into the interior of his self, meets and conquers his anger at his mother. The drawings are lovely, too.1730 14. Matilda by Roald Dahl (1988)I’m willing to bet that after reading this, many children stared at pencils, hoping they might be able to move them with their mind alone. Dahl’s exuberant imagination is on full display in this emotionally weighty story about a little girl’s fight for love and escape. Miss Trunchbull, the vicious headmistress, is one of literature’s great villains.1830 13. The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling (1894)Raised by wolves, Mowgli must face the terrible tiger Shere Khan, with the help of Baloo, a “sleepy brown bear”, and Bagheera, a panther. Full of invention and adventure, the stories were an immediate hit, the behaviour of the animals believable and, paradoxically, human. Their wildness and subtleties have become thoroughly imbued into the popular imagination.1930 12. Five Children and It by E Nesbit (1902)A representative from the first Golden Age of children’s fiction in the early 20th century. Nesbit’s grumpy, vain wish-granting Psammead (or “sand fairy”), an immortal who used to eat Pterodactyl for breakfast, offers adventure in a world without oppressive evil. The brothers and sisters find that magic doesn’t always offer a solution.2030 11. The Once and Future King by T H White (1958)Captivating, wise, witty, this collection of three earlier books treats the Matter of Britain. TH White’s masterstroke was to imagine the young king Arthur as Wart, an ordinary boy thrust into extraordinary situations and his Merlin as a kindly, forgetful old man (viz. Dumbledore). Neglected in recent years, White deserves a place in the limelight once more.2130 10. The Wind in the Willows  by Kenneth Grahame (1908)There is some debate as to whether The Wind in the Willows is a children’s book, or whether it’s really a book to lift up the spirits of down-trodden city clerks. Either way, the gentle adventures of Mole and Ratty, and Toad’s ridiculous shenanigans, express a lyrical love of the pleasures of rural life.2230 9. The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien (1937)In The Hobbit, an odder book than it at first appears, the tiny hairy-footed Bilbo Baggins goes on a journey with some dwarves, and is actually rewarded for being a thief. The charm of the hobbits’ world is matched by the excitement of the adventures Bilbo finds himself entangled in and many readers will be led on to its vast sequel, The Lord of the Rings. 2330 8. Northern Lights by Philip Pullman (1995)Philip Pullman’s daemons, in his lavishly-imagined alternative world run by a sinister religious organisation, are among the most enduring creations of children’s literature. His themes are cosmic and vast, with a dizzying sense of possibility his story spellbinding and in Lyra Belacqua, he made a heroine at once appealing, spiky and enduring. 2430 7. The Narnia series by C S Lewis (mid 20th century)The best children’s books have a way of altering the universe around them. Everyone can remember their first encounter with Narnia, and then trying to get through the back of the wardrobe afterwards into the enticing other world. Lewis’ stroke of genius, of course, was making the animals talk the knightly adventures of the children are gripping.2530 6. The Pilgrim\u0027s Progress from This World, to That Which Is to Come by John Bunyan (1678)One of the first books enthusiastically taken up by children, this is now largely neglected, even by adults and scholars unjustly so, as its allegorical power and beauty are unsurpassed. Its humour and colloquial nature mean it is still accessible. From the Slough of Despond to the Celestial City, it brims with memorable places and people. 2630 5. Peter and Wendy by J M Barrie (1911)Some would argue that this novelised form of the play Peter Pan is not a children’s book, being instead complicit with an ironic, adult viewpoint however this, and all its variants, are enjoyed immensely by children. There is the theme-park like world of Neverland the sense of unbounded imagination and the dizzying allure of flight and magic.2730 4. The One Thousand and One Nights by Anon. (Folk tales)This scintillating series, which Scheherazade spins to her royal husband every night so that he spares her life to hear their conclusion, first came to Europe in 1704 in a French text that also contained Aladdin, Ali Baba and Sinbad the Sailor. Elemental, opulent and wondrous, the stories are full of passion and revenges, and remain enormously influential.2830 3. Fairy Tales by Hans Christian Andersen (19th century)A strange and shy man, Hans Christian Andersen produced some of the most beautiful and reverberant literary fairy tales in the world, about loss, love and longing. Gerda’s search for her brother Kay in ‘The Snow Queen’ the Little Mermaid’s mute passion for her prince gorgeously written, they offer solace and enchantment. 2930 2. Kinder- und Hausmärchen (‘Nursery and Household Tales’) by The Brothers Grimm (19th century)Exceptionally influential, this collection of over 200 tales underwent many editions in the Grimms’ lifetime. Though the seamier elements were altered for a prudish bourgeois audience, the fairy tales retain a depth which resonates with children and adults alike.  We all know The Frog Prince and Hansel and Gretel but have you read “Hans my Hedgehog”, about a half boy, half hedgehog? 3030 1. The Alice Books by Lewis Carroll (19th century)Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, and Through the Looking Glass, and what Alice Found There, are an extraordinary brace of books, written by the mathematican Charles Dodgson, under his pseudonym of Lewis Carroll. He employed logic, humour and inventive fantasy, fashioning the most powerful and unusual works in children’s literature. Some have tried to work out why a raven is like a writing desk. But most will be content to be drawn away into enchantment.130 30. Tom Brown’s Schooldays by Thomas Hughes (1857)This moving, charming and poignant tale of boarding school life is included partly for its own merits, but also as it was the first in the school story genre which spawned so many thousands of books, through Enid Blyton right up to J K Rowling.

Lewis’ stroke of genius, of course, was making the animals talk the knightly adventures of the children are gripping.2530 6. The Pilgrim\u0027s Progress from This World, to That Which Is to Come by John Bunyan (1678)One of the first books enthusiastically taken up by children, this is now largely neglected, even by adults and scholars unjustly so, as its allegorical power and beauty are unsurpassed. Its humour and colloquial nature mean it is still accessible. From the Slough of Despond to the Celestial City, it brims with memorable places and people. 2630 5. Peter and Wendy by J M Barrie (1911)Some would argue that this novelised form of the play Peter Pan is not a children’s book, being instead complicit with an ironic, adult viewpoint however this, and all its variants, are enjoyed immensely by children. There is the theme-park like world of Neverland the sense of unbounded imagination and the dizzying allure of flight and magic.2730 4. The One Thousand and One Nights by Anon. (Folk tales)This scintillating series, which Scheherazade spins to her royal husband every night so that he spares her life to hear their conclusion, first came to Europe in 1704 in a French text that also contained Aladdin, Ali Baba and Sinbad the Sailor. Elemental, opulent and wondrous, the stories are full of passion and revenges, and remain enormously influential.2830 3. Fairy Tales by Hans Christian Andersen (19th century)A strange and shy man, Hans Christian Andersen produced some of the most beautiful and reverberant literary fairy tales in the world, about loss, love and longing. Gerda’s search for her brother Kay in ‘The Snow Queen’ the Little Mermaid’s mute passion for her prince gorgeously written, they offer solace and enchantment. 2930 2. Kinder- und Hausmärchen (‘Nursery and Household Tales’) by The Brothers Grimm (19th century)Exceptionally influential, this collection of over 200 tales underwent many editions in the Grimms’ lifetime. Though the seamier elements were altered for a prudish bourgeois audience, the fairy tales retain a depth which resonates with children and adults alike.  We all know The Frog Prince and Hansel and Gretel but have you read “Hans my Hedgehog”, about a half boy, half hedgehog? 3030 1. The Alice Books by Lewis Carroll (19th century)Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, and Through the Looking Glass, and what Alice Found There, are an extraordinary brace of books, written by the mathematican Charles Dodgson, under his pseudonym of Lewis Carroll. He employed logic, humour and inventive fantasy, fashioning the most powerful and unusual works in children’s literature. Some have tried to work out why a raven is like a writing desk. But most will be content to be drawn away into enchantment.By the time they start school, a quarter of children show some degree of deficient or delayed development in language, communication, motor skills and “socio-emotional health”, according to the team, led by Dr Sheri Madigan from the University of Calgary.To investigate the possible link between screen time and developmental delays, the scientists used a standard milestone screening measure which involved questioning parents about their children’s abilities.Higher levels of screen time at the ages of two and three years turned out to be “significantly associated” with poorer test results at three and five years.Researchers said the findings suggested too much screen time can hold back children.They pointed out that child development “unfolds rapidly in the first five years of life”.“When young children are observing screens, they may be missing important opportunities to practice and master interpersonal, motor and communication skills, the researchers said.The study found that overall, children watched screens for an average of 17.09 hours per week at age two, 24.99 at age three, and 10.85 at age five.The authors urged health professionals to work with families to develop “personalised media plans” designed to place boundaries on children’s screen time.Facebook \u0027tricked children\u0027 into spending money on in-app gamesChildren offered depression therapy via smartphone to cut NHS waitsKate Hudson discusses taking a ‘genderless’ approach with parentingThe plans, customised for each family’s needs, would provide advice on setting and enforcing rules and imposing “screen-free zones” and “device curfews” in the home.British experts said more research was needed but agreed that parents should be encouraged to promote healthy interactive behaviour in their children.Dr Bernadka Dubicka, from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: “This is the first study to show that increased use of screen time in very young children can be associated with slower development.\u0026nbspThese results add important weight to existing concerns that too much screen time can prevent young children from having the best start in life, by potentially reducing important opportunities for social interactions, physical activity and other experiences necessary for development.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The best way to do this is to support a people’s vote on the Brexit deal, and to truly give us a final say.”The fall in student support for Labour could be explained by several different reasons, but the concurrent rise in support for a new vote just as Mr Corbyn’s own MPs accuse him of prevarication over the issue is stark.At an event on the steps of parliament last week Labour and Tory MPs announced they would not table a cross-party amendment for a second referendum because it stood no chance of passing the Commons without Mr Corbyn’s support.Created with Sketch.Final Say petition delivered to Downing Street Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Today the Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivered to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit dealL to R:  Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Holly Baxter, Co-Editor Independent Voices and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote hand in a petition to Downing StreetFront row L to R: Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for PutneyThe Independent\u0027s editor Christian Broughton delivered over one million Final Say signatures and People\u0027s Vote spokesman Chuka Umunna MP delivered 300,000 signatures to Downing Street on Monday December 3 at middayA supporter of the second referendum helps Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham out of the rain during a protestL to R:  Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote on their way to hand in a petition to Downing StreetChristian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna hand in the petition to Downing StreetCaroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney hand in petitions to Downing StreetToday the Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivered to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit dealL to R:  Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Holly Baxter, Co-Editor Independent Voices and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote hand in a petition to Downing StreetFront row L to R: Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for PutneyThe Independent\u0027s editor Christian Broughton delivered over one million Final Say signatures and People\u0027s Vote spokesman Chuka Umunna MP delivered 300,000 signatures to Downing Street on Monday December 3 at middayA supporter of the second referendum helps Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham out of the rain during a protestL to R:  Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote on their way to hand in a petition to Downing StreetChristian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna hand in the petition to Downing StreetCaroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney hand in petitions to Downing StreetLuciana Berger, a former shadow health minister,\u0026nbspsaid: “Regrettably the Labour leadership won’t commit to an achievable policy and yet we know that the majority of Labour voters, supporters and members want a final say on any Brexit deal.“Yet at a time when Labour should be championing a people’s vote, the leadership avoids answering that call.”She added: “There are millions of young people in our country that supported the Labour Party at the last general election. Over two million of them were under the age of 18 in 2016. They would today now have a vote. And so many whom I speak to cannot understand why Labour is standing in the way of the younger generation having a say on this.”Three of Mr Corbyn’s MPs later moved in parliament to redraft his strategy, so it ties Labour unambiguously to giving Britain a new referendum.The leader has already submitted the Labour Party’s own amendment setting out how he thinks the country should proceed, but it disappointed many backers of the People’s Vote campaign because it failed to fully commit the party to backing a new referendum.Mr Corbyn’s approach would require ministers to find time for MPs only to “consider and vote on options” including renegotiating the withdrawal agreement and also then “legislating to hold a public vote” on any deal that successfully passes through the Commons.The Labour Party has been contacted for comment.HEPI sponsored Wave 5 of the HEPIYouthSight Monitor, which was answered by 1,048 full-time undergraduate students and undertaken between 4-8\u0026nbspJanuary.

They don’t exist.”She also warned the risks of a no-deal Brexit were rising, saying: “There’s a very high risk of a crash-out not by design, but by accident.”Tuesday’s “next steps” debate will also see an attempt, led by Labour’s Yvette Cooper, to force the government to seek a nine-month Article 50 extension, if the Commons has not passed a deal by the end of February.However, the radical attempt for parliament to “take control” – by passing its own legislation to delay Brexit – can only succeed if Jeremy Corbyn backs the amendment.That support was cast into doubt when Jon Trickett, the shadow cabinet office minister and a key Corbyn ally, said it would be “ignoring the views of millions of ordinary folk”, by failing to respect the referendum result.The warning raised the prospect of no amendments passing – leaving the UK still in dangerous limbo, with just 59 days until the 29 March deadline for withdrawal.In the meeting of Tory MPs, Ms May also faced down Boris Johnson, after he challenged her on what difference the Brady amendment would make.“We won’t know unless you support us Boris,” she told her former foreign secretary. “Get behind it and we will find out.”One Tory MP described the exchange as the prime minister at her “spikiest”, adding: “It got one of the loudest cheers.”Brandon Lewis, the Conservative party chairman, confirmed the Brady amendment would be whipped, saying: “It is about giving a message to Europe about what can go through parliament in terms of dealing with the backstop issue.”Ms May had insisted the backstop is unavoidable, telling MPs in November: “There is no alternative deal that honours our commitments to Northern Ireland which does not involve this insurance policy.”The latest Westminster drama came as supermarkets issued a stark warning they could run out of food and be forced to hike prices if the UK crashes out of the EU with no deal.Nine senior executives signed an open letter to MPs, organised by the British Retail Consortium (BRC), arguing items with disappear from supermarket shelves.Meanwhile, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, told MPs that medicines “will be prioritised” over food if a no-deal Brexit disrupts supply chains.He told the Commons health and social care committee that “of course medicines should get priority over food”, arguing the proportion of food imported into Britain is “much smaller” than medicine.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

another referendum on EU membership, with Remain as an option on the ballot paper.United Kingdom will ‘split apart’ because of Brexit, Spain warns“With her deal defeated by a thumping majority in the Commons, the prime minister needs to start listening and thinking seriously about where compromise and accord can be found.“In Scotland, at least, Brexit has not had the iding effect that we’ve seen at Westminster.“In fact, over the past two-and-a-half years Scotland has become more united than ever in support for our continuing place in Europe and against the damage that Brexit will inflict.”He said the UK government needs to “face reality”, adding: “Tinkering around the edges of their deal is a doomed strategy, no-deal brinkmanship is reckless and leaving that option on the table with just over 60 days until we’re due to leave the EU is unconscionable.“We face the political challenge of our times, and we mustn’t allow the Brexiteer Tories to run down the clock and drag us all into

party conference, should be to support a people’s vote, and it’s time for the leadership to come off the fence and get fully behind this.“All political parties should be working together in the national interest, so that we can offer the people of the UK the opportunity to keep the best deal we already have as a member of the EU.”Glasgow University principal Sir Anton Muscatelli will also

How do you provide energy for those electronics?We have come up with a new way to power the electronics systems of the future - by harvesting wi-fi energy in a way that\u0027s easily integrated in large areas - to bring intelligence to every object around us.In experiments, the rectenna generated about 40 microwatts of power when exposed to typical wi-fi signals of around 150 microwatts.That is more than enough to light up a simple mobile display or activate silicon chips.The research is published in the latest online issue of the journal Nature.Spanish co-author Professor Jesus Grajal, from the Technical University of Madrid, said a key application could be in the field of medical implants and pills that stream health data after being swallowed by patients.He added: Ideally you don\u0027t want to use batteries to power these systems, because if they leak lithium, the patient could die.To create the rectenna, the team used a novel 2D material called molybdenum disulphide, which at three atoms thick is one of the world\u0027s thinnest semiconductors.All antennas produce electricity, but normally in very tiny amounts.In a portable radio, for instance, an amplifier boosts the signal to allow broadcasts to be heard.The amplifier needs a suitable power source, such as a battery.The electricity obtained from radio waves comes in the form of a high-frequency alternating current (AC).In the new device, the semiconductor converts the AC signal into a more usable direct current.The scientists are now planning more complex devices with improved efficiency.Additional reporting by Press AssociationBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There was the time a shisha cafe owner quickly ushered him out a back door amid anti-American murmurs by customers. There were the numerous checkpoints manned by suspicious teens armed with assault rifles peering into his vehicle. But the worst day had to be when he narrowly missed being surrounded and possibly captured by Isis militants on the outskirts of the eastern Libyan city of Derna. For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“We’ve had some bad days,” he acknowledged during a phone interview. For Mr Guidry, perseverance paid off. This month the Libyan seaport authority agreed to grant the former security contractor the $1.5bn (£1.1bn) deal to build the country’s first port suitable for the world’s largest cargo vessels at the eastern Libyan city of Susah. \u0026nbsp“If we’re lucky, this will be the jewel of North Africa,” he told The Independent. Libya sinks into poverty as the oil money disappears into foreign bankVast, oil-rich Libya, which toppled its longtime ruler Muammar Gaddafi in a 2011 Nato-backed uprising, is in tatters.\u0026nbspSeparate governments claim\u0026nbspauthority in the east and west and armed groups sometimes don’t recognise either of them. Security in the capital, Tripoli, hit a new low last week with clashes in the southern suburbs between rival militias vying for control of the country’s largest city. Residents complain of a lack of any public services.The de facto ruler of Libya’s east, army officer Khalifa Haftar, has made a\u0026nbspmove\u0026nbspon the country’s southern oil fields, sparking clashes in the country’s most impoverished region and claims that the eastern army was engaged in acts of “intimidation, kidnapping and looting”.Foreign powers – primarily the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Turkey and Qatar\u0026nbsp– are meddling, even allegedly sending arms to their favoured clients in violation of a UN embargo, something they deny.\u0026nbspThe UN hopes for a June election, an aspiration many Libya observers consider unrealistic. But some see the country eventually settling down. Despite the political isions and failed attempts to create rival regional institutions, the country’s central bank, finance ministry, national petroleum company, utility authorities\u0026nbspand several other institutions still strive to operate as single units. The International Monetary Fund\u0026nbspsaid Libya grew 11 per cent last year. The Falanx Group, a London-based security and risk advisory firm, said in an assessment this month that Libya would this year achieve a maximum oil output of 1.6 million barrels per day for the first time since the fall of Gaddafi. Mr Guidry is also optimistic, because, he said,\u0026nbspthe Susah port project shows the country can still come together when something significant is at stake. “What’s happened is that the seaport authority of the east has talked to the seaport authority of the west, convinced them this is a national priority,” he said. In a statement, Hassan Jwaili, one of the seaport chairmen in eastern Libya, said both sides of the country were “working closely together on everything related to the ports and\u0026nbspmaritime capabilities”.The Susah port, located 25 miles northeast of the east’s de facto administrative headquarters in Bayda, will be situated in a natural harbour 18 metres deep and suitable for the modern supertankers considered the most cost-effective vessels\u0026nbspfor\u0026nbsptransporting goods across oceans. The project has already caught the attention of port and maritime specialists. Despite 1,100 miles of Mediterranean coastline, Libya’s ports are badly outdated, with antiquated technology for moving shipping containers on and off freighters. Mr Guidry said the new port will equipped with the most up-to-date technology, surpassing the speed and efficiency of major Mediterranean ports in Egypt and Tunisia. Sudan and land-locked Chad have already voiced interest in using the Susah port to import goods. Mr Guidry estimates the port will generate at least $60m\u0026nbspin annual revenue by 2022 and twice that by 2040. “Now it’s time to bring the economy where it needs to be,” said Mr Guidry.Ceasefire agreed to end fighting in Libya’s Tripoli, says UN30 dead in Tripoli militia clashes Libya sinks into poverty as the oil money disappears into foreign bankAt least 33 dead after double car bombing in LibyaThe Susah port project is on a design, build, operate and transfer model that would allow Mr Guidry’s firm to run it for at least its first 25 years. He and his eight-person team won the deal in a bidding competition, beating eight proposals from firms in China, Russia, France\u0026nbspand Italy. He said he received no help other than security warnings from US consular officials holed up at a temporary embassy in neighbouring Tunisia.Mr Guidry came to Libya as a security contractor four years ago and said he fell in love with the country, and wanted to invest in something that would also create work for the people who welcomed him into their homes. He said he put his own money into the project, even drawing from his retirement savings. He noted that Susah lies near an ancient archaeological site where legend has it Mark Antony built his love Cleopatra a swimming pool. “Five years ago people would have said:\u0026nbsp‘He’s crazy. They’re going to cave in on him,’ or:\u0026nbsp‘He’s gonna break,’” said Mr Guidry. “But it’s real and it is happening.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In a roll down game, if the jackpot or rollovers limit is reached one of the following things happen: The cash that could have made the jackpot bigger is allocated to the next tier of prizes, or if no one won the grand prize, the entire jackpot is given to the next tier.\u0026nbsp In other words, the roll-down rule would give the second-prize – and perhaps even third prize – winners a lot of money.\u0026nbspIn the WinFall lottery, Mr Selbee discovered if nobody\u0026nbspwon the $5m\u0026nbspjackpot, the money would be awarded to people who matched, five, four, or three of the winning numbers. Since lottery bosses often announce when the jackpot limit is reached, Mr Selbee would buy thousands of tickets to ensure he would get several tickets with five, four, and three matches.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A tornado and pounding rains smashed into the eastern part of Cuba\u0027s capital overnight, toppling trees, bending power poles and flinging shards of metal roofing through the air as the storm cut a path of destruction across eastern HavanaPolicemen and soldiers keep watch as body bags (in white), containing the remains of blast victims, as seen in a cordoned area outside a church in Jolo, Sulu province on the southern island of Mindanao.

The match is being held in Madrid, a neutral ground, after it was twice delayed due to violenceIn an interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes, Mr Selbee explained if he were in a scenario where he played $1,100 worth of tickets, he’d have about one ticket with four numbers matched, and that’d guarantee him a $1,000 return. He would also have about 18 or 19 tickets with three numbers matched, and each ticket would have about a $50 winning, creating an additional\u0026nbsp$1,900 return.\u0026nbspThe first time he tried to crack the code Mr Selbee bought $3,600 in Winfall tickets and won about $6,300, doubling his money. For the next roll-down game,\u0026nbsp Mr Selbee put down $8,000 and won double in award winnings again.After telling his wife about the lottery loophole, the couple began playing the games for hundreds of thousands of dollars. For about seven times a year, the Selbees would spend around 10 hours a day for 10 days straight to look over and organise their lottery tickets, often putting down over $600,000 per play. \u0026nbspWinning lottery ticket worth $437m sold in New YorkThe couple kept all their losing tickets, which is estimated to have cost around $18m, in 65 buckets in their barn.When the Michigan lottery game shutdown due to “lack of sales,” the Selbees started to pick up on a Massachusetts lottery.\u0026nbspMr Selbee, who once worked at a Kellogg’s plant to design boxes to increase shelf life for freeze-dried products, used his lottery winnings to set up a corporation called GS\u0026nbspInvestment Strategies where he invited relatives and friends to buy shares for $500 each.The corporation, comprised of 25 members, monopolised the Cash WinFall lottery game during “rolldown weeks,” which often had prizes increase by five to 10 times the original jackpot amount.\u0026nbspIn 2011, the Boston Globe received a tip about Cash Winfall tickets being sold at an enormous volume. In their reporting, the newspaper discovered that Mr Selbee’s group and a handful of MIT math students were dominating the state lottery game. Over a seven-year-period, the MIT group bet between $17m to $18m\u0026nbspand profited at least $3.5m.In light of the Boston Globe report, the Massachusetts state treasurer shut down the lottery game due to suspicions of the players rigging the game, and launched an investigation.The investigation found that high-volume betting did not affect the odds of winning the lottery.GS\u0026nbspInvestment Strategies, Mr Selbee’s corporation, earned about $26m\u0026nbspfrom the games, and the married duo profited approximately $8m\u0026nbspbefore taxes from playing.Mr Selbee told CBS he didn’t find their ability to win the lottery game “remarkable,” but is rather just the satisfying result of using simple math.“It is actually just basic arithmetic,” Mr Selbee said. “It gave you the satisfaction of being successful at something that was worthwhile to not only us personally but to our friends and our family. The only thing I found really remarkable is nobody else really seemed to grasp it.”But that didn’t deter Hollywood producers from being amazed by their story, who bought the rights to the Selbees story to make a film about their lives.The Michigan couple used the money profited from the lottery games to renovate their homes, and financially assist their six children, and to pay the education for their 14 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren. \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

His family were forced to sell their belongings to fund the three-day journey through the mountains to the southwestern city.He said he now relies on food, mattresses and blankets from Islamic Relief.My relatives in Hodeidah tell me that they live amid terror... they expect death at any moment“I am dependent on organisations to help me eke out a living for 26 family members, some of them need\u0026nbspmedicines. There is not enough water in the house and we have to fetch it from\u0026nbspfar distances,” he added.\u0026nbspAbdu Muqbel, 65, and his family of seven also fled Hodeidah under fire to an IDP camp in Taiz after his wife was hit by shrapnel in her neck.He said his family barely survived in the camp for two years until Islamic Relief recently came to help.But despite the hardships they face in Taiz, Mr Muqbel said it is not possible to go back to Hodeidah because fighting is still plaguing the city and stopping access to food.“I heard about the ceasefire but my relatives there told me that battles have started again, and they do not dare to sleep with the buzzing of warplanes over them day and night,” he said.\u0026nbsp“My brothers and my cousins returned to their houses and they told me that life is very difficult.\u0026nbspYou need to travel 60km to bring food,” he added.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He also co-owns a house in Surrey.Mishcon de Reya first hired him in  as a part-time consultant for its business crime unit.He quit client work for the firm in April , but was reappointed as a consultant to its in-house academy in June this year.The MP stood down from that role after being appointed to the shadow cabinet last month.Starmer is the third key figure from the lacklustre £.m Operation Elveden witchhunt of Sun reporters to be employed by Mishcon de Reya.His former principal legal adviser at the Crown Prosecution Service Alison Levitt and former politan police assistant commissioner Sue Akers – who headed the bungled investigation – have also done work for the firm.This week Starmer refused to apologise after reporter Anthony France had his conviction overturned - meaning not one of  Sun journalists arrested were convicted.A spokeswoman for the law firm said: “Keir Starmer was a consultant to the Mishcon Academy, our in-house centre for learning and development.“The role did not involve client advice on any issue. Keir resigned as a consultant to the academy when he was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet.”A spokesman for Starmer’s office said: “MPs are required to register and declare fees received since the May  election even where those fees were earned before the election.“The register makes it very clear that in the case of Keir Starmer, the vast majority of his declared earnings represent payment for work undertaken by him as a lawyer before he became MP.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Billions of Dollars,  lives, will be saved!He continued on December : We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirelythe Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall  also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with.Hard to believe there was a Congress  President who would approve!Democrat Senator Dick Durbin said Trump had taken the government hostage.No end in sight to the President’s government shutdown.He’s taken our government hostage over his outrageous demand for a billion border wall that would be both wasteful and ineffective.Trump has announced that he has set a deal to reopen the US government after a shutdown of federal agencies.Sources say the pact does not include any funds that the Republican president has demanded to build his wall on the Mexican border.Trump said a deal had been reached on legislation that would reopen the U.S. government through February .I am very proud to announce today that we have reached a deal to end the shutdown and reopen the federal government, Trump said at the White House.Trump said in the meantime a bipartisan committee of lawmakers would meet to discuss the nations border security needs.The Democrats in the House of Representatives  made their first day back in charge by passing legislation to end the government shutdown on January .The White House as threatened to veto the move, which would create a stalemate between the Republicans ruling the Senate.There is no indication of how the long the shutdown is expected to last and it has added concerns over the outlook for the US economy in .Hundreds of thousands of federal employees will have to work furloughed, which is a temporary leave, or unpaid work.Over , federal employees across ious agencies will still work during the government shutdown, as  per cent of the federal government is fully funded until September .Federal programmes will still , as will the military, border patrol, coast guard, federal judiciary, air traffic control and airport security.The US Postal Service will not be affected by the government shutdown as its an independent agency.Under the government shutdown, sections of these nine federal departments will be closed along with the government:"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT0004609318361.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"john bercow out of parliament tories replace him","story":"Today the chairman of the Tory Buckingham association is meeting the Conservative party’s national head of candidate selection Gareth Fox to find a suitable figure to fight the seat.He wants the party to start advertising the position from today.The Speaker has stood unopposed in his Buckingham seat since standing down as a Tory MP in  to take the neutral role of Speaker.But the Tories are hoping he will quit before the next election to free up the seat.The move will put pressure on Mr Bercow amid the outrage over claims he is helping Remainer MPs thwart Brexit in the Commons.When he was elected in  Mr Bercow had pledged to only serve until  but has cited the uncertainty over Brexit to justy staying on.It was understood he would only extend his tenure until June this year but Tories now fear he will use the deepening Brexit crisis to cling on longer and even beyond the next General Electiona snap vote is called.But that would be the fourth General Election in a row at which the Buckingham seat is left uncontested.Buckingham Tory association chairman Cllr Clive Harriss said anger was rising among constituents over their lack of a choice for MP at elections.He said the party would traditionally only start looking for a new candidate when the Speaker stands down.But he told The Sun: “We’ve started to put feelers out with a view we’ll have someone in place soan election is calledhe decides not to stand we’ll have someone in place to fight the seat in the normal way.“I’ll be talking to central office on Friday to make sure they advertise the position.”However he admitted the party has “absolutely no influence” over when Mr Bercow decides to stand down.Mr Harriss added: “We don’t know what’s going to happenthere is a General Election.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And I think just because we’re saying ‘birds aren’t real,’ that should be true with the same respect as when people say birds are real.”Although they are predominantly based in the US, the group has recently come over to the UK, with seagulls arent real stickers appearing around Brighton in October last year.The Birds Arent Real movement havent as of yet addressed the question of eating chicken - or any other bird meat for that matter.And while the theory that all birds are faked may seem far-fetched, last year it was revealed in the South China Morning Post that  Chinese military and government agencies were deploying drones that looked like doves to spy on citizens.The programme, code-named Dove, is led by Northwestern Polytechnical University in Xian, and each bird is built with GPS technology, a high-definition camera and a flight control system.The scientists behind it say they replicate  per cent of the movements of a real dove.In , German engineering company Festo launched a flying machine that looked like a herring gull.Named SmartBird, the drone is so realistic that real seagulls actually fly alongside it believing it is one of their group.So while the conspiracy theory - which Birds Arent Real describe as a nightmare that makes the Illuminati look like a toddler playing in the Burger King play place - seems incredibly bonkers, there is a slight amount of truth in it.So be careful next time you look up to the skies... Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At least one of them needs to pass.If one does get the support of a majority of MPs, then Theresa May can go back to Brussels and say, look, this is what will get the deal through my parliament.It will strengthen her negotiating hand, make the EU engage and give her a chance of securing some changes.As one secretary of state says: “She needs to demonstrate she can carry something through.”No insiders tell me that May will only go back to Brussels “when we have a very clear set of proposals”. Butnone of these amendments can muster a majority, then the EU will just sit tight.It knows this parliament is fiercely opposed to No Deal and so isn’t concerned that the UK will actually go down that route.Instead, the EU will wait, confident that the UK will request either an extension to the Brexit process or a softening of it.So far, there are a iety of amendments down. One from the shop steward of backbench Tory MPs, Graham Brady, says the Commons will support the withdrawal agreementthe backstop is replaced by “alternative arrangements” to prevent a hard border in Ireland.Another from the Tory chairman of the Northern Ireland Select Committee, Andrew ­Murrison, seeks to time-limit the backstop. Influential cabinet ministers have also been pushing for the Government to put down its own amendment.They are confident that they are winning that argument and one will go down before Tuesday — though some in Number  still prefer to put their faith in the Murrison amendment.The signicance of a Government amendment would be that Speaker John Bercow would have no choice but to call it. One indispensable minister involved in these discussions tells me: “A Government amendment could well be a more objective exit mechanism which would allow us to ­demonstrate that this is not going to be permanent.”The outline of this amendment has, I understand, been discussed with the DUP and ministers believe that the “likelihood” is that they will support it. But one cautions that “what may seem a given one day can suddenly unravel”.No won’t be drawn on whether a Government amendment will be tabled or not. But leading cabinet ministers are confident it will be. One says: “This is the best chance of moving everyone forward together.”One option being discussed is for a series of clear tests which,met, would allow the UK to exit the backstop. The aim is to make it clear that the EU couldn’t keep the UK — or Northern Ireland — in the backstop forever.There is also, I understand, “a parallel conversation” going on about what the EU will accept in terms of changes to the backstop. If a Government-backed amendment passed the Common it would also, in the words of one source, give the Government “half a chance of stopping Cooper-Boles”.The amendment from Labour’s Yvette ­Cooper and former Tory minister Nick Boles would require the Government to ask for an extension to Article  to avoid No Dealthe UK and the EU can’t come to an agreement.As this source points out: “Cooper-Boles does best when people think there isn’t an alternative.” There is no guarantee that a Government amendment will carry the day.“To pull this off, you need the ERGto come in behind it — and that’s quite a big ask,” says one of those intimately involved in these discussions.This source warns that “emotionally a lot of them will find it very dficult”. But these Brexiteer MPs need to realise thatnothing passes on Tuesday, then parliamentary efforts to extend Article  will gather more support.Brexit itself will be in danger and this country will end up with a super soft Andrex Brexit — or no Brexit at all.MPs should not do anything to suggest that they want to take No Deal off the table. This week, the EU and the Irish government have been all over the place about what No Deal would mean for the Irish border.The contradiction at the heart of the backstop is beginning to become apparent. It is, the EU and ­Ireland say, necessary to prevent a hard border. Butthe backstop results in there being No Deal, then it will lead to precisely what it is meant to avoid: A hard border.As this inconsistency becomes more and more obvious, there is more chance of member states pressing the EU to move on this issue.One minister who has been talking to his ­counterparts across the EU in the last few days tells me: “They’re ­definitely budging.”So, this would be precisely the wrong moment for MPs to undermine May’s negotiating position by talking about taking No Deal off the table. As one of those close to the PM puts it: “This has been a dficult week for the EU. Don’t make it easy for them.”This is one of the reasons why MPs MUST REJECT the Yvette Cooper amendment. At the moment, this amendment looks like it will probably pass. But given how many Labour MPs in leave-voting seats have qualms about it, this is far from certain.Tory MPs, let alone ministers, shouldn’t help it through as doing so would pull the rug from under the UK’s negotiating position.VENEZUELA is a sorry tale of where state socialism leads. In an oil-rich country, people are starving. It is embarrassing, and shaming, that Jeremy Corbyn’s ideological blinders mean that he can’t see what is happening there.Labour talk about opposing “outside interference” in Venezuela even as a slew of democracies in the region recognise the head of the national assembly, Juan Guaido, as the legitimate president.Labour’s opposition to outside interference puts them in the same position as Russia, China, Turkey, Bolivia and Cuba. This is the company we’d be keepingCorbyn became Prime Minister.AT Cabinet this week, Theresa May told ministers that to get the deal through she would have to go to the Commons and “present a changed backstop”.This is signicant because it is her recognising that she needs substantive – not just cosmetic – changes to the backstopshe is to get her deal through.TALK of an early election just won’t go away at Westminster. It is not that the Tories want one, but that there is a sense that the Commons is so deadlocked on Brexit that it might end up as the only option.One possible route to an election is that Yvette Cooper’s plan to extend Article  passes the Commons, a deal is then eventually agreed but can only pass with the rider that there is a second referendum. I understand that, in these circumstances, the Government would rather go for an early election.One senior Cabinet Minister says that Theresa May’s “reddest of red lines is we have to leave the EU”. A ­referendum with Remain on the ballot paper would threaten that.“Political parties ought to make sure they are ready to fight an ­election”, a member of the Tory party board tells me as he explains why they are rapidly stepping up candidate selection and the like. But I am told that “no one is planning an election”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Taxes will rise. We’ll even run out of Mars bars.But across the Atlantic, something has been ­happening that should give us all some perspective.Over the past decade, Venezuela has plunged into the abyss — but there’s been no civil war, no earthquakes or hurricanes.Just a brutal, corrupt government that has turned what was once Latin America’s richest country into a hellhole.Starvation rations plunged millions into hunger and ­malnutrition, with some resorting to eating dogs, cats, even zoo animals.People got into kne fights over the right to scavenge from a dumpster.Its economy is more than three times smaller than in . Inflation climbed into the thousands, then millions of per cent.The result has been a refugee crisis on the scale of the Syria conflict.No wonder tens of ­thousands of people took to the streets of the capital Caracas this week, declaring national assembly head Juan Guaido the legitimate president.All this is awful for the poor bloody Venezuelans.But what does it have to do with Britain The answer is that Venezuela wasn’t just a ­disaster. It was an experiment — cheered on by Jeremy Corbyn and his cronies.In , Hugo Chavez took over Venezuela.He ruled until his death in , when he was succeeded by his hand-picked protege Nicolas Maduro.Chavez modelled himself on Latin American ­revolutionaries like Fidel Castro and Simon Boli. He nationalised much of the oil industry — which dominates the ­Venezuelan economy — and imposed punitive taxes on foreign firms.He introduced price controls and later currency controls. He declared “economic war” on the “stateless ­bourgeoisie” and seized the goods of private companies he denounced as saboteurs.For Corbyn, the Chavez regime was an inspiration — a chance to see true socialism brought to le.Venezuela, Corbyn has said, “showed us that there is a dferent, and a better, way of doing things. It’s called socialism”.It wasn’t just Corbyn. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott and Corbyn’s media chief Seumas Milne have all praised the ­Venezuelan revolution.That “better way of doing things” has ruined tens of millions of lives but there has not been a hint of an apology from Corbyn.Normally, the fact that people are taking to the streets to free themselves of a vicious regime would be cheered to the rafters by the Left.Instead, there is the silence of those who find themselves ­hideously embarrassed.The few who are not ­staring at their shoes claim that Venezuela has been the ­victim of an American plot.That Maduro took, in McDonnell’s words, a “wrong turn” from Chavez’s true socialism.That it was all down to a falling oil price.Yes, Maduro took a wrong turn. But that turn was to follow the path laid out by Chavez.From the Soviet Union to Cuba to Venezuela, there is a long and shabby history of British left-wingers acclaiming a workers’ paradise — only to declare, once its ­failure is clear, that it wasn’t really socialist after all.Never mind the millions of lives ruined — let’s have another go!If he became Prime ­Minister, Corbyn might not succeed in turning Britain into Venezuela. But we’d be Caracas to let him try.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They are paid to inspire you to buy stuff.Most insist they only endorse ­products they actually believe in — and we’d all hope they take their responsibility seriously.But it is easy to see how an offer of, say, £, to endorse something they “sort of” believe in might make it harder to hang on to those principles.Equally,guidelines aren’t strictly enforced, you can understand the temptation to convey the impression that you just happen to really like a particular laxative herbal tea, say, or a moisturiser that gives you a “glow”.It’s a grey area. And you might ask why it matters.But given recent news about the ­negative impact social media can have on the mental health of young people — and young women in particular — regulation of this brave new world affects us all.I need only point to another big story this week.Schoolgirl Molly Russell was  when she took her own le after showing “no obvious signs” of severe mental health issues.Her family later found she had been viewing material on social media linked to anxiety, depression, self-harm and suicide.Her father even went as far as accusing Instagram of “helping to kill her”.Social media makes it so easy to tap into someone’s daily le, their home-decor proclivities and their innermost thoughts.The intimate nature of Instagram lets you feel like these influencers are your friends, and the products they rave about their personal ­recommendations, not the outcome of a business deal.This is a real problem. But the mistake is much harder to makeadverts are clearly labelled as such.Part of the problem is how obsessed with celebrities our young people have become.When I was growing up, my main influenceswere my parents and my friends.Now, young people are influenced by people they will never meet.Some of these people, dare I say it, are talentless nobodies.You might argue you would have to be naive not to realise they are selling you something.Perhaps young people are not as cynical as the likes of me.And that is why regulation is key.IT’S hard to sympathise with Fungi, a “star” of hit telly documentary Benefits Street, who says universal credit is “the worst thing in the world”.Tracked down by this paper, James Clarkeclaimed his monthly payments had been more than halved and the all-in-one benefit was causing “hell” for him and others like him . . . because their booze budget has been cut.Fungi was claiming £ a month to spend on food and sundries.

Sorry, what Here’s another way of looking at it. People who work for eight hours a day don’t have the time to down three litres of cider a day.If Mr Clarke got a job, he might recover some of his self-esteem – and probably save his le in the process.Just to be clear – I BELIEVE in the benefits system.But it was invented to help people get back on their feet, to help those who can’t help themselves because of illness or disability.It should be a short-term measure, not a lestyle choice.In the meantime, the rest of us go to work to pay for this man’s rent and booze.All because he can’t be bothered to sort himself out.No wonder people get angry.In fact, I suspect most readers will have steam coming out of their ears.This man must start taking responsibility for himself.I SUPPOSE it was worth a shot for Diane Abbott to complain that Fiona Bruce was “badly briefed” and that her treatment as a list on Question Time was racist.But she can’t blame Fiona for her own incompetence in answering questions – and not just on Question Time.There are so many car-crash interviews to choose from . . . although the one in which Diane suggested police officers could be paid £ a year springs to mind.WHAT a nasty piece of work Dancing On Ice judge Jason Gardiner seems.We expect the judges to give feedback.And we know it won’t all be good.But his comment to Gemma Collins last week – “We are not going to see big lts from you” – came across as body-shaming.Because his real point is that she is overweight, right It’s shocking, really. I’m surprised ITV allowed it.THE secret behind Elle Macpherson’s phenomenal bod has been revealed.In an interview, she said it all comes down to . . . late breakfasts.Hmmm. No matter when we eat breakfast, most of us will never come close to looking how she does at .Actually, forget breakfast times. What struck me is her diet seems to contain just FIVE ingredients . . . one of which is nut cheese.And the only liquid is water.Elle looks great.But by God, she must be miserable.THE Premier League’s popularity continues to soar, as a study into attendances across Europe proves.And I was immensely proud to see West Ham ranked seventh by attendance in all of Europe last year.We are up there with the Continent’s elite, in a table headed by Barcelona.And that will only get better now the capacity of the London Stadium is up to , – adding to the incredible support we get from what I believe are the league’s best fans.This week, accountancy firm EY published a report on the impact the Premier League has on our economy.It generates £.billion a year in tax for the Exchequer, supporting , jobs and contributing £.billion overall to the country’s GDP.Last season, Premier League players paid more than £billion in taxes.But never mind the money.It’s still the best league in the world.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

These people are ­consistent and have my respect.But there are just as many who are in danger now of sitting on the fence until rigor mortis sets in, coming up with process rather than substance.They are simply hoping that others will do the dirty deed and respect the will of the people.It is also, for every Labour and Conservative MP, the manesto ­promise that we stood on at the last election. We voted for a referendum. We promised to respect the result.We got re-elected promising the same, yet Parliament continues to sit on the roundabout to nowhere.It is time to stop the shenanigans and work across the political ide to bring our country and our people together.At stake is our democracy. And in a democracy the winner prevails.Of course, in future years, people can argue that we have got it wrong and that people are entitled to change their mind. But for democracy to be true and real, we have to deliver the mandate we have been given and leave the EU on March .The referendum ided people and families, with lots of strong and dfering views. But in cherishing our democracy, we now need to come together to deliver a Brexit that respects the people’s vote and helps heal that ide.In le we have to compromise. We all have our own perfect Brexit, me included. And with ten of my colleagues we have forced through a big part of that, guaranteeing in law workers’ rights, health and safety and environmental standards. We will be competing with Europe by being the best, not by being the cheapest.I would love to have been a fly on the wall when Theresa May told union bosses that she was meeting their key demands not just with a promise but with a legal guarantee. But then she knew it was only right, because union members were the bedrock of leave voters across the country.And, I believe, we can get more in the next fortnight. A clear commitment to a once-in-a-generation investment into the Leave-voting areas that have long been starved of our fair shares — those former coal, iron and steel industrial heartlands, the unfashionable places, the areas still manufacturing. I think, as well, that union bosses and industrialists can be brought to act as advisers to the trade negotiations when we have left the EU, bringing their expertise into play to ensure a jobs-first Brexit for Britain.A country, proud and independent, standing on its own two feet, ­confident again in our democracy, bold enough to compete by being the best, British workers making high- quality products and delivering high-quality services.A country that says it will be the best by having better pay, conditions and a healthier environment than anyone  in Europe or worldwide.Is that not something to be confident in voting for, my fellow MPs  Let’s get on with it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Along with the likes of megabucks Remainers Tony Blair, Peter Mandelson and PR guru Roland Rudd, he seems to think Brexiters are basically pond le.That theory should be buried forever after this weekend’s passionate plea from leading academic Sir Noel Malcolm for MPs to stop wrecking Brexit.Writing in the devoutly pro-EU Financial Times, this distinguished Fellow of All Souls, Oxford, spells out the essence of the Leave case: “Brexit is about sovereignty — and parliament must respect that.”“If the UK is now on the brink of a constitutional crisis,” he adds, “one major reason is that a signicant number of MPs still oppose any version of Brexit, and seek a second ­referendum solely for the sake of reversing the decision of the last one.”Sir Noel does not believe people voted Out because they were racist.“The most important reason was democracy,” he says.“They wanted to live under laws made by the people they elected. Immigration came second.What they objected to was a supranational government ­making some of their laws and lting all immigration controls on the inhabitants of  other countries.”Another Remainer fiction is that Brexiters are narrow-minded Little Englanders.Yet the Daily Mail found space for a German view that Brussels should stop “insulting Britain” and honour us as champions of peace in Europe.“Such blinkered and sour responses are wrong-headed,” says Alexander von Schoenburg, a senior editor of Germany’s biggest newspaper, Bild.“They ignore the great debt Germany and the whole ­Continent owes our friends across the Channel.“We must always remember that throughout your history, independence and sovereignty have been paramount.“Germany in particular should tread lightly when it comes to dealing with your proud nation. It was Great Britain that first stood up to Hitler in .And it was Britain that opened its doors to thousands of ­Jewish refugees fleeing certain death during the Holocaust.“Put simply, there would be no free Europe without you and the bloody sacrice you made to rescue the Continent.”This remarkable tribute ­follows a recent love letter to the UK from Germany’s next Chancellor calling for a friendly Brexit orce and an end to bitterness.It is now clear hardline Remainers have over-reached themselves. The worm has turned.Talk of a second referendum is dead and voters are on the warpath against MPs plotting to scupper Brexit in tomorrow’s Commons showdown.Brussels is in chaos over the Northern Ireland backstop.Michel Barnier has started muttering about new tech- nology to police post-Brexit ­frontiers — a UK idea initially dismissed as “magical thinking”.EU allies are breaking ranks to demand a decent deal — for their sake as much as ours.It is way past time now for Theresa May to scrap the backstop and tell Brussels exactly what she needs to get her deal through Parliament.“There is absolutely no truth in speculation that ­passengers are being advised not to book,” stormed Brittany Ferries as it announced plans to INCREASE services.Meanwhile, mischief-making aviation giant Airbus admits it was asked by Downing Street to warn – incredibly – that it would shut up shopBritain left without a deal.Project Fear is shameless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So a night bedevilled by sound issues, rotten acceptance speeches and foul Danny Dyer language was crowned by Special Recognition winner David Dimbleby eulogising the BBC and ordering us to be nicer to politicians, in a speech that could hardly be descri- bed as “mood capturing”.It’s the awards themselves though, that I know get viewers’ goats the most, starting, painful as it is to admit, with the fact perennial winners This Morning absolutely robbed Piers Morgan’s Good Morning Britain operation in the Daytime category.Given that Jack Whitehall’s Travels With My Father managed to scrape on to the Comedy shortlist, there’s also an argument that says Chunk, Charlotte Hawkins, Richard Arnold and Susanna Reid — who was styled quite magnicently on the night as Waitrose’s answer to Vicky Pattison — should have made that final five as well.Because almost no show made me laugh as loud or as regularly as Good Morning Britain did in .A glaring omission too in the TV Judge section — always won by David Walliams — which included X Factor’s Robbie Williams on the shortlist, but not Craig Revel Horwood, who didn’t take a two-week sabbatical in the middle of Strictly, cost the BBC £million or throw in his other half as part of the deal.The award that made a nonsense of the whole occasion though was Ant  Dec winning Best Presenters for the th time in a row, despite the presence of Bradley Walsh and Graham Norton on the shortlist, and the fact Ant spent far more weeks in rehab than he did in a TV studio.The mutual affection is touching in one way, of course, but it ultimately does neither them nor the NTAs any good at all and has robbed both of a glorious moment of redemption when they win the  award.Before that foregone conclusion takes place, please stay tuned to This Morning and sit tight until mid-March, when Dr Chris will be along with part II of his bottom-wiping masterclass: Flushing, FLU-SHING.Practially the only programme I watched at the weekend that wasn’t punctuated by uncontrollable sobbing fits from the participants was BBC’s landmark Holocaust documentary The Last Survivors.Men and women who are all in their late eighties and nineties now and understand that time is precious.When you’re a living part of history you also know facts are far more precious than tears.So in the words of the remarkable Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, who avoided the Auschwitz gas chamber purely because she could play the cello: “I won’t give people the pleasure of seeing my emotions.”The very least we owe all of them is an audience. The Last Survivors is available on the BBC iPlayer and will probably be the most unforgettable  minutes of television you’ll watch all year.At approximately : hours, Sunday, Gemma Collins stumbled over while Dancing On Ice.The tectonic plates groaned a little on impact, the front row scattered like ten pins and there was a surge on the national grid as several million viewers went “click, rewind, play,” then “click, rewind, play,” again.In fact, by the time I’d stopped rewinding and playing, Gemma had “bounced back,”and Piers Morgan, no doubt angling for a Le Stories interview, had claimed it was “the gutsiest thing I’ve seen on a talent show” – probably since the days Piers himself was wedged in behind the judges’ desk on Britain’s Got Talent.It was an undeniably great television moment, though.A proper face plant, with a full Klinsmann snow plough to finish.The downside, obviously, is that it’s guaranteed she’ll be back next week, when Melody, Wes, James and the others will be performing to a Fairytale theme and Gemma will be clearing the B Fettercairn to Banchory road,ITV want to find a proper use for her.Click, rewind, play.Things remain cheerful as hell on EastEnders.Alfie Moon’s car has been discovered near some clfs and a policeman has the job of breaking the most awful news imaginable to Kat and the Slaters.“Considering the location and the evidence at hand, we would suggest you prepare yourself for the worst.”Big Mo: “You understand what they’re saying ”Yes, bloody Redwater’s getting a second series.

But she also says Britain will not leave the EU without a deal.And her deal — the only one on the table at this late stage — was defeated in the House of Commons by a record majority just two weeks ago.Tonight’s Brexit votes are not quite the final shoot-out between the dferent factions in Parliament. The Government has promised that MPs will vote soon on a new plan.Remainers and soft Brexit supporters in government are pushing to hold that vote as soon as possible.And MPs — backed by a Speaker who will rewrite any Commons rules to soften or stop Brexit — will force more votes on what happens next.Nevertheless, tonight’s votes do matter.One proposal comes from Yvette Cooper, a Labour MP.Her Yorkshire constituents voted to leave the EU by more than two to one and, during the election, she promised them she would “not vote to block Brexit.”Yet that is what her plan does:     MPs vote for her   amendment, they will be able to stop Brexit happening this year.Cooper has the support of several rebel Tories, soJeremy Corbyn whips his MPs to vote for it, she stands a good chance of getting her way.Caroline Spelman and Jack Dromey, Conservative and Labour, have an amendment that calls on the Government to avoid a no-deal Brexit.Dominic Grieve wants MPs to control the Commons timetable, allowing Parliament to vote on dferent ways of watering Brexit down.Labour want to present MPs with options that include, predictably, a second referendum.Despite drafting a manesto saying “Labour accepts the referendum result”, the Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer says in a second referendum he would campaign to overturn the result of the first.It is possible that none of these amendments might pass.Remainers and soft Brexiteers are ided about what should happen.Some want to delay Brexit, some want to tie us to European rules and regulations, and others want another referendum to stop it altogether.Evenno proposal wins a Commons majority, the votes cast by MPs will probably demonstrate that there is a majority to water down Brexit one way or another.For Brexit supporters, this is very dangerous indeed.Some believe they simply need to run down the clock and, in  days, we can leave without a deal.For Leavers who want a negotiated departure, this feels like a serious risk.But Leavers who favour no deal need to ask themselves, can they really be so sure they will get what they want With several Cabinet ministers, many more junior ministers and a Commons majority against no deal, it seems increasingly likely that MPs will ultimately find a way of stopping no deal.When they do, Brexit will only get softer and softer.This is why the amendment proposed by Graham Brady, a senior Conservative, is so important.His idea is to approve the Prime Minister’s original Brexit deal, but with the “backstop” removed.The backstop is hated by unionists, because to prevent barriers to trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland, it creates new barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.And it is hated by Leavers, because it ties the UK to the EU’s customs union, and Northern Ireland to EU single market rules.Brady wants MPs to vote simply for “alternative arrangements” to the backstop.By avoiding a specic proposal, he hopes the amendment can win a Commons majority and, in doing so, demonstrate to Brussels that the deal they struck with Theresa May can be ratied — but only without the backstop.Critics, largely Remainers, say this is impossible.But in the past week or so, Angela Merkel has questioned whether the backstop is such a good idea after all.The Polish foreign minister has suggested it should expire after five years. And the European Commission effectively conceded that in the event of no deal, they would use policy and technology to prevent a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.In other words, they proposed solutions they once dismissed as “unicorns” and “magical thinking” when they were suggested by the British — and which could render the backstop unnecessary.But this is not all. Some European officials have floated, in private, a more inventive solution: that the UK and Ireland should form a British Isles customs zone, with Britain compensating Ireland for any new friction in their trade with Europe.So it is clear: whatever Remainers claim, alternatives to the backstop are technically and politically feasible.Recognising this, the Brady amendment would give the Government one last chance to negotiate something better.Yet Tory Brexiteers say they might not vote for it. They fear the ambiguity of “alternative arrangements” could allow ministers to negotiate an even worse deal, perhaps tying the whole of the UK to the EU’s customs union and single market rules for good.They do not trust May, her advisers, or most of her Cabinet and demand a specic time limit on the backstop.Butthey vote down the Brady amendment, they will not get what they want, and are more likely to get what they fear.As the clock ticks on and bottoms get even squeakier, MPs will coalesce around a plan to stop a no-deal Brexit.The EU will have no reason to compromise, and Parliament will soften our departure by aligning us with more and more European laws.If Leavers vote against Brady, they will be shooting themselves not in one foot, and not even in both feet, but in the head.As the Commons debates the proposals today, Leavers need to start compromising with reality. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No excuses.”Guaido has continued to ramp up his challenge against Maduro, calling for anti-government protests on Wednesday and Saturday.Protests have already resulted in burned out cars, looted shops and deaths as civilians take to the streets to support the effort to oust Maduro.Maduro has turned Venezuela into an economic basket case during his five-year reign, with uncontrolled inflation hurting the lives of everyone in the oil-rich nation.Maduro was sworn in for a second term earlier this month after an election marred by an opposition boycott and allegations of vote-rigging.Since Guaidó swore himself in, China, Russia and Syria have all backed Maduro, with Russia warning America off military force.On Sunday, colonel Jose Luis Silva, Venezuelas top military representative to the US, defected from Maduros government.In a statement, apparently read in his Washington office, Silva said: Today I speak to the people of Venezuela, and especially to my brothers in the nation’s armed forces, to recognise President Juan Guaido as the only legitimate president.Guaido has said he will continue as interim president until a free and fair election can be called.Last week Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told CNN: We warn everyone, not just the US, but some others that can entertain these ideas from this type of action.He said: The resort to military power would be catastrophic."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000115056185.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"kim jong un north korea citizens human poo fertilizer","story":"The tubby tyrant, , believes his barmy order will save North Koreas tanking economy by turbocharging the farming sector with cheap manure.According to RadioFreeAsia, the pariah states starving population is expected to hand over an unbelievable kg of human excrement EVERY DAY.If they cant, the can supply kg of compost instead, the radio station claims.The demand for manure means some workers have allegedly asked to be paid in POO rather than cash.A DPRK source said: The entire population has been mobilized to produce manure as the first major task of the year.The authorities in each local region task factories, institutions and citizens groups with assigning production quotas to each inidual.They are demanding that each person produce kg of human feces per day, or about  tons per month.But how on earth can it be possible for one person to make  tons of human feces and deliver it Desperate citizens are reportedly trying to make up the deficit by buying excrement from specialist poo merchants.Another source added: The residents of Chongjin City have been fully mobilized to fulfil this task.People are angry, criticizing the regime for [deliberately setting quotas so high] to force people to pay cash, then claiming it’s for agricultural production.”In winter, there isn’t as much manure and compost.Cash payments exceed the value of the manure that actually ends up being delivered, so people are saying the regime is just using the quota as a means to collect more money from the citizens.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000385716074.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sainsburys asda kfc no deal brexit","story":"A study also claimed higher fruit and veg costs will lead to thousands more fatal heart attacks and strokes — though this was dismissed by critics.Lettuces, tomatoes and fruit could all run out in April, say chains including KFC, McDonalds and Pret A Manger.The inflammatory claims come as MPs prepare to vote on the next steps ahead for Brexit.In an unprecedented show of unity, the bosses of Sainsbury’s, Asda and Lidl, plus the UK arms of McDonald’s and KFC, today urged them to find a solution that avoids the shock of a No Deal Brexit on March .They told MPs their “complex, just-in-time” supply chains would be “signicantly disrupted”.The Commons could back a controversial amendment which would see Brexit delayedBritain is heading for No Deal.The letter from retailers warned that a third of food consumed in the UK comes from the EU, and more in March, when produce such as lettuce and tomatoes is out of season, they claimed.It said: In March, the situation is more acute as UK produce is out of season:  per cent of our lettuces,  per cent of our tomatoes and  per cent of our soft fruit is sourced from the EU at that time of year.We are extremely concerned that our customers will be among the first to experience the realities of a No Deal Brexit.“For consumers, this will reduce the availability and shelf le of many products in our stores.We anticipate signicant risks to maintaining the choice, quality and durability of food that our customers have come to expect in our stores, and there will be inevitable pressure on food prices from higher transport costs, currency devaluation and tarfs.It was also signed by the bosses of Marks  Spencer, Waitrose, Pret a Manger, Lidl and Costcutter.

Christopher Snowdon, from the Institute of Economic Affairs, added: “It would be perverse to impose tarfs on food we do not produce. There are many problems with a No Deal Brexit, but paying more for bananas and satsumas is unlikely to be one of them.” Professor Patrick Minford said: The effect of Britain quitting the EU customs union and quickly striking a free-trade agreement with the US would be a huge double bonus for our economy.“We should think of the US economy as a giant supermarket, a kind of global Walmart, which we are currently barred from entering.But once we are out of the protectionist EU customs union, as a nation we would be allowed to go shopping at this giant Walmart.

get behind us and you’ll find out’.“It was the sparkiest that she was, and it got a cheer.”One Tory whip tonight put the number of refusenik Tory Brexiteer MPs as low about  diehards, meaning tomorrow’s Commons vote will be very close -

There is no great appetite for it but the appetite would changeit becomes new government policy.”As insults flew between Tory MPs today, one likened Mr Rees-Mogg’s hardliners to Millwall-style football thugs.The PM’s former policy chief George Freeman branded Jacob Rees-Mogg’s European Research Group members as “hardline Brexit ultras”.He tweeted: “Everyone will have to compromise a bit. But hardline Brexit “ultras” need to compromise, too, to secure Brexit”.Issuing another appeal tonight, Tory party chairman Brandon Lewis said: “I would hope the ERG, when they look at this and actually look through the detail of what this gives the PM tomorrow, in terms of a meaningful vote that will come back later,it is about giving a message to Europe about what can go through Parliament in terms of dealing with the backstop issue and why that matters.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Yet again the Government has entirely caved in to the business lobby.“This is an astonishing concession before the situation of the million British people living in the EU has even been considered.“Most of the public want to see a reduction in immigration, not to see it prolonged for years on end.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government is introducing a one-year trial for proxy voting to protect pregnant MPs. But the vote is not due until .pm - hours after bedtime.MPs were left furious after Labours Tulip Siddiq delayed her caeserean birth to ensure she voted on Theresa Mays Brexit deal.The heavily pregnant MP was pushed into the Commons in a wheelchair after Tory whips were accused of breaking previous pledges to pair pregnant MPs to give them a night off. But after the backlash the Government rushed through reforms to allow a one-year trial of proxy voting. If MPs approve the pilot, it will allow MPs expecting a child or with a new child to nominate another MP to vote on their behalf.   Pregnant and sick MPs are usually allowed to “pair” with members of the opposing party who abstain to avoid them having to physically travel through the lobby. But the systems flaws were exposed when Conservative chair Brandon Lewis broke such an agreement with the heavily pregnant Liberal Democrat Deputy Leader Jo Swinson in July .It helped Theresa May narrowly avoid a humiliating Commons defeat on Brexit trade plans.Pairing also means MPs do not have their names recorded as having voted - especially important on contentious issues. Ms Swinson, who has long campaigned for proxy voting, described the change as another step towards making it [the Commons] a workplace fit for the st century . But she described the timing of the vote, scheduled for .pm, She said: Of course in the ultimate irony, we will be voting on this modernisation at around :pm tonight! Valerie Vaz MP, Shadow Leader of the House said:“Proxy voting for MPs on parental leave is long overdue. After Tulip Siddiq MP was forced to delay the birth of her child two weeks ago, it couldn’t be clearer that we need to drag Parliament into the twenty-first century. “But a system of proxy voting could have been in place today. The Conservatives have dragged their feet on this important issue for too long. A trial is a step in the right direction, but Labour believes that proxy voting rights must be permanent and implemented immediately to ensure no MP is blocked from representing their constituency.”"},{"url":null,"title":"health secretary backs firm profiting","story":"NewsHealth Secretary backs firm profiting from patients who cant NHS dentist due to cutsEXCLUSIVE: Mark Hancock has thrown his weight behind MyDentist - an enterprise that targets areas with a shortage of NHS servicesShareCommentsByMartin BagotHealth and Science Correspondent:,  JAN NewsThere is a chronic shortage of NHS places - including in Matt Hancocks own constituency\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA firm profiting from patients whocannot get to an NHS dentist because of cuts is being endorsed by Health Secretary Matt Hancock. Access MyDentist targets areas with big shortages of Health Service practices and offers more expensive private work. Visiting one of its surgeries in shyrural Mildenhall, Suffolk, Mr Hancock said: “Companies like MyDentist play a really important role in delivering a good service to keep our nation’s teeth strong.” Half of all NHS surgeries are closed to new patients because of a Tory funding crisis, it is estimated. In Mr Hancock’s West Suffolk constituency, fewer than one in  is taking new adults and some patients face a -mile round trip for a place. Access MyDentist is expanding in such areas, promoted as “almost as cheap as the NHS”.  But some treatments cost more than double and children, pregnant women, the unemployed and disabled are charged despite getting NHS work done free.

That has served Britain well for a long time and any ideas for how to strengthen that offer are welcome.” Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth said: “Surely the priority should be expanding access to NHS dentistry for everyone, not endorsing private firms for the better off.” MyDentist boss Tom Riall said: “We’ve developed an affordable range of private dentistry because so many shypractices are closed to NHS patients.” Askedhe hoped to see Mildenhall re-open to NHS patients soon, Mr Riall said he would prefer people to “take up an affordable private option”.

A Brexit deal was agreed between the UK and the EU, but it was voted down in the House of Commons. So with time running out, plans are being put into action in case a deal doesnt happen. The government has published  technical notices outlining the practical effects of No Deal - from driving licences to cats. Meanwhile ministers have , troops held at readiness, could call up Army reserves and declare martial law. Ministers could quit in protestNo Deal happens while supermarkets and hospitals are stockpiling food and medicine. If theres no arrangement in time, well lose  international trade deals in a blink, shed access to EU criminal databases and troops couldto the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.   A lot of the effects are on business. UK farmers face a nine-month wait for approval to export organic goods to the EU. Fishermen could be blocked from EU waters. And manufacturers fear their supply chains drying up. But businesses are not what whove written this guide for. Instead we have tried to establish  ways No Deal Brexit will affect you, the reader and your everyday le. Of course, these are worst case scenarios. Theyre not exhaustive. They may never happen. But youd better wise up...   What is a No Deal Brexit  No Deal is the default optionMPs, the EU and the UK government cant agree a Brexit Withdrawal Agreement by  March . The -page deal on the table will ensure businesses arent cut off by continuing rules in a transition period until December . But it comes at a cost - a backstop that could trap the UK in an EU customs union from . That means MPs have opposed it. Leaving with no deal will mean falling back on World Trade Organisation trade tarfs - increasing the price of imports and exports - and could leave legal black holes where EU law stood before. The UK government has been ramping up preparations for no deal since the beginning of summer . MPs believe they can find a way to block No Deal through Parliament - including by delaying the March  date - butthey dont its still the default option at pm on March .  More than , troops are being held at readiness in case there is a disastrous no-deal Brexit. Army reserves are also legally able to be called upthere is civil unrest, while councils are braced for possible runs on banks, fuel and food. Local Resilience Forums are reporting back to Whitehall and expect several months of disruptionthere is no deal. The government has plans in case it needs to impose martial law - military law - and curfews to restore order. Cabinet minister Matt Hancock admitted the plans existed but insisted the government was not specically looking at martial law and it was not the focus of our attention.  At the moment, British citizens can enter Schengen area countries with a valid passport eventhey only have a day left before they expire. But in a no deal Brexit, after  March  you may not be able to travel to these countriesyou have less than six months left on your passport. The government is advising travellers to renew any passports older than nine years and six months. . Usually this means renewing six months before your passport expires. Butyour passport had more than  years validity, youll have to renew earlier, because the extra months on top of  years dont count. The following are members of the Schengen Agreement: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.  There is a huge surge in red tape for pet owners who want to take their beloved animals abroad. Currently dogs , cats and ferrets can travel anywhere in the EU as long as they have a pet passport. The main requirement is that three weeks before the first visit, owners must go to the vet to have their pet vaccinated against rabies and microchipped. But in the worst case no-deal Brexit, pet owners must visit a vet at least four months before taking their pet the EU. And because talks are ongoing, that means youd better book in now. The animal must have a rabies vaccination followed by a blood test at least  days later, to prove the vaccination worked. Pet owners must then wait at least three months before visiting the vet to obtain a health certicate. But this cannot be done more than  days before the date the holiday starts.  Food is being stockpiled forwe crash out of the EU without a deal, and ministers have promised an adequate supply. But thats not the same as having the range of food we do now. Leaked plans in December warned Brits could have to y their diet. And in January, big names KFC, Pret, Lidl, Co-Op, MS, Waitrose, Sainsburys, Asda and McDonalds signed a damning letter warning food supplies could run short because of disruptions to the supply chain.They wrote in a joint letter to MPs: Our ability to mitigate these risks is limited. As prudent businesses we are stockpiling where possible, but all frozen and chilled storage is already being used and there is very little general warehousing space available in the UK. They added: Retailers typically store no more than two weeks inventory and it becomes dficult to restock storesthe supply chain is disrupted.  A string of firms have either moved jobs out of the UK or are threatening to do so in a no-deal situation. Airbus, which employs , people in the UK with around , more jobs in supply chains, warned it may move where. Car plants are moving forward standard shutdowns to be around Brexit in case there are supply chain issues. And critics fear new investment will not come the UKs way, hitting jobs in generations to come.  Major motorways in the South of England are set for serious disruption in case of a no-deal Brexit. From early  the Mwill be closed as needed from junctions -, with a contraflow of both directions on the opposite side, so it can be used as a lorry parkthere is gridlock at Dover. A backup lorry park will be in place at Manston Airport. The M in Kent is also expected to be used as a holding area for lorries. And a similar fate could befall a -mile stretch of the M towards Southampton.  The International Air Transport Associationwarn up to million plane tickets could be cancelledthere is no deal. Currently it is not known exactly which tickets could be hit, or how passengers would find outthey are at risk. The situation arose because in a no deal, there will be no automatic legal basis for flights between the EU and UK after pm on  March . Under a pact struck between the UK and EU in December, basic connectivity will be maintained for a -month periodtheres No Deal. But according to the IATA - which represents  airlines including British Airways - that only means maintaining the number of flights in . It does not allow an increase in services - yet tickets have already been sold based on a predicted increase. Talks are ongoing, but Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, previously warned flights could be groundedgoodwill fails.  Currently a UK driving licence is the only thing visitors need to get behind the wheel on the continent. But under a no-deal Brexit, you should get an International Driving Permit. The pound. documents were due to be sold at , post offices from February. Before they were sold at fewer than . The number of permits issued would have to soar from , a year to million. Meanwhile you will also be forced to apply for a green card to prove you have the right car insurance. The certicates are free of charge and available from insurance companies. But the government warns firms may increase administration fees in order to cope with the extra bureaucracy. Those who forget their green cards would be forced to buy expensive frontier insurance in the country they are visiting. . Up to a million Brits may be forced to take a new driving test  British people driving in Europe could be forced to take a new driving testtheres a no deal Brexit. Up to a million Brits living in Europe were told to replace their driving licence with a local permit immediately. Guidance issued by the Department for Transport said: If you are aUKlicence holder living in theEUorEEAyou should exchange your UK driving licence for a local EU driving licence before  March . From that date, in the event that there is noEUExit deal, you may have to pass a driving test in theEU country you live in to be able to carry on driving there.  More than million EU citizens living in the UK will have less concrete rights to stay. Whether theres a Brexit deal or not, EU citizens can stay in Britainthey register for settled status with the government. But the rules are stricter in a No Deal Brexit. In No Deal, only EU citizens arriving before  March can apply, not those arriving by December . The deadline to apply will be  December , instead of  June there is a Brexit deal. And family members will only be able to join settled EU citizens in the UK before  March . As for the other way round - major EU nations have inidually said theyll allow UK ex-pats to stay, but this could y by country.  Pharmacists have requested special powers to ration medicinesthere is no Brexit deal. Under plans by the Healthcare Distribution Association, they would have special powers to y doctors prescriptions and offer something a drug is unavailable.  million packs of medicines are imported to the UK from the EU every month, and the NHS is preparing for a doomsday scenario to prevent supplies running dry. Government and NHS chiefs have set up a war room called the Operational Response Centre and industry firms are creating six-week stockpiles of medicine. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has chartered a plane to fly in short-shelf-le products, like isotopes for cancer treatment, from Maastricht. Insulin could also be stockpiled. Mr Hancock claimed hes become the biggest buyer of fridges in the world, after fitting out facilities for storage of the crucial drugs. NHS staff are being directed to urge patients not to stockpile medicines personally to avoid shortages throughout the system.  Mobile phone roaming charges could be hiked - less than two years after they were slashed across the EU. Costs were cut in June , meaning there is no extra fee for using a British device on the continent for calls, texts and data. Operators would not be bound by the agreementthe UK crashes out without a deal. The biggest companies, servicing % of customers - Three, EE, O and Vodafone - have no plans to reimpose roaming charges after Brexit. But in terms of the entire mobile market, surcharge-free roaming when you travel to the EU could no longer be guaranteed, the government has warned. . You should get insurance and flexible tickets for Eurostar disruption  Eurostar services could be suspended in a worst-case no deal Brexit. The government has told international train passengers - including the Eurostar - to make sure they have insurance and ticket terms and conditions that are sufficient to cover possible disruption. That implies passengers should buy FLEXIBLE tickets - not the fixed cheap ones that are popular for their low cost. The UK will need bilateral deals with France, Belgium and the Netherlands to ensure international trains keep running. Without such a deal, Britain has proposed recognising EU operator licences until March  to ensure services can continue. But this isnt guaranteed, and UK operators would have to reapply with the EU. Former Transport Secretary Andrew Adonis claimed the notice seems to be saying that the vital train link between Britain and Europe could be severed. . You might have to go through airport security twice  Air passengers changing flights in the EU may have to undergo two security screenings under a no-deal exit. Travellers boarding a plane in the UK to fly to a European airport, before changing flights for an onward destination, would be screened in Britain as they are now. But they might have to have a second check in the EU before getting their connecting flight. “Currently passengers flying from the UK and transferring at an EU airport for an onward flight do not have to be re-screened at that EU airport, because the UK applies, and exceeds, the EU baseline aviation security measures,” says a Department for Transport briefing note. “If there is no deal, and the EU decides not to recognise the UK aviation security system, then passengers and their luggage will have to be re-screened when changing flights in EU hub airports.” . You could be barred from using Netflix and Spoty on holiday  Britons could be barred from accessing their accounts for Netflix, Spoty and other online entertainment while travelling to EU statestheres a no-deal Brexit. Under the EU-wide portability regulation, which took force in April, citizens can access accounts set up and based in one country while visiting other member states. But a government technical notice said: The portability regulation will cease to apply to UK nationals when they travel to the EU. This means online content service providers will not be required or able to offer cross-border access to UK consumers under the EU Regulation. UK consumers may see restrictions to their online content services when they temporarily visit the EU. . If you live in Northern Ireland, you face electricity blackouts  Northern Ireland will be forced to take drastic measures to stop the lights going out. A worst-case No Deal Brexit would scupper the all-island electricity market shared by Northern Ireland and the Republic - leaving it without any legal basis. This would make both markets less efficient, with potential effects for producers and consumers on both sides of the border, the government warns. And it may be necessary to seek additional [legal] powers to preserve security of supply. To stop the lights going out, Northern Ireland would have to take more electricity from British power stations through an interconnector running under the Irish Sea. But Northern Irelands Transmission System Operator may need to rely on fall-back arrangements to ensure power keeps flowing, the government warns. That is why, eventheres a no deal, the government will take all possible measures to keep the all-island market running. There has been talk of barges in the Irish Sea. Dustin Benton of Green Alliance warned:Any emergency action to keep the lights on, both in Northern Ireland and across the rest of the UK, would likely be highly polluting and expensive. . You could be stranded on your package holiday  Package holidaymakers could be left with no legal protectionthe firm they booked with goes bust. Currently Brits have insolvency protectionthey book with a package holiday provider thats based anywhere in the EU. But in a No Deal Brexit, that protection would only applythe firms are targeting the UK market. That means those booking with, say, a cheaper Spanish firm online that has no UK presence could be unprotected. Eventhe UK government could act, in practice it will be much harder to take enforcement action against foreign firms because other countries will no longer recognise UK courts. . Youll lose rights to take action over dangerous products  Government documents reveal the same problem - UK courts not being recognised - will strip Brits of their consumer rights for EU goods bought online. Alex Neill of consumer group Which  warned: A no-deal Brexit would massively weaken peoples rights to take action when they purchase faulty or dangerous products from outside the UK. The Governments advice that we all become experts in international consumer law is hopelessly unrealistic. Securing a good deal with the EU is vital to ensure that Brexit doesnt result in a bonfire of consumer rights and protections.” . Your cigarette packets will change  Graphic warnings on cigarette packets will be replaced by Australian versions in a no-deal Brexit. And in some ways they are even more gruesome than the ones we have now. The grim pictures show a foot ridden with peripheral vascular disease, a clogged artery, a bleeding brain and high-resolution teeth stained black. The photos will be changed in a No Deal Brexit because the European Commission owns theon ones we currently use. That means the UK would be unable to use them after  March . . If youre going through a family breakdown, you could be trapped in limbo  Families who are midway through orce or child custody cases involving another EU country could find themselves trapped in limbo. If there’s a no deal Brexit, the UK will cease to be part of co-operation between EU family courts on  March . Instead the UK will fall back on legal conventions drawn up in The Hague. But these are complicated and do not cover every area of the law. The government has advised families with ongoing cases to seek legal advicethey will not finish by Brexit Day. A government technical note says: Broadly speaking, cases ongoing on exit day will continue to proceed under the current rules. However, we cannot guarantee that EU courts will follow the same principle, nor that EU courts will accept or recognise any judgments stemming from these cases.” . Your everyday medicines and perfumes could become more expensive  Currently, popular ingredients in cold medicines can usually be traded within the EU without a licence. In a no deal, a licence will be required to trade these so-called precursors. Sowe leave without a deal, firms who want to trade such chemicals with the EU will have to register with the Home Office, which can cost between pound and pound,. They will also need an import export license, which costs pound. Critics say this could push up prices for consumers in the shops. Similarly, cosmetics firms will be slapped with more red tape to prove their products are safe for human health. Currently they can use one legal “nominated person” to certy a product for the whole EU market. Butthere’s a no deal Brexit, UK checks won’t be recognised in the EU - and EU checks wont be recognised in the UK. That means two sets of checks. Labour MP Owen Smith claimed drug giants will look to pass on the costs. And finally... your regular caviar parties are doomed!  Caviar imports will be snarled up or stop completely in a No Deal Brexit. Sturgeon eggs join snowdrops, orchids and reptiles in endangered species that would need import and export permits to cross an EU border. Youd only be allowed to bring in g of caviar for personal use. A tragedy.

Amber Peats body was discovered three days after she went missing from her home in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on May , . Nottingham Coroners Court heard the dispute was about cleaning a cool box which was used to store food on a recent family holiday in Cornwall - where the the -year-old hatched plans to run away with her cousin. The youngsters mother Kelly Peat had heard the front door slam shut shortly after the dispute at around .pm. She was reported missing to police by her mum eight hours after the argument. The inquest heard a passer-by had seen somebody of Ambers description enter a hedgerow area near the address around  minutes later. Although up to  police staff were involved in the search for Amber, her body was recovered on June .   The youngster - who had a history of running away - was reported missing at .am on May . Detective Constable Tina Gilfoyle, of Nottinghamshire Police, said Mrs Peat and Ambers stepfather Danny Peat had been to Tesco and had tea while the youngster was missing. Providing background of the the teenagers disappearance, Ms Gilfoyle said the family had moved  times in Ambers letime. The Peats decided to move to Mansfield after concerns about Amber running away and that she may have been groomed by a paedophile. Ms Gilfoyle said: The reason for wanting to move was that Amber had been running away and there were concerns the she may have been groomed by a paedophile.   There were no social workers allocated in her letime but there had been an assessment of the family. Addressing statements given by the younger members on the extended family holiday, Ms Gilfoyle said: They reported Amber had been troubled quite a lot there. There had been lots of arguments - she had been prevented from going to the beach, and together with her cousin she had written a run away list.was a wig, a torch and some rope to run away and her cousin thought it was a joke. Ms Gilfoyle said Ambers stepfather had threatened to hit her after she had scowled at him on the way back from the holiday.  She said: In the car on the way home, she had taken some cherryade without asking and had been scowling at Danny Peat. She was made to sit in the very rear of the family car. Danny Peat saidshe scowled at him again he would hit her. Summarising what had happened on the day Amber disappeared, Ms Gilfoyle said: She was trying to get her mums attention but her mum shuts the door on her, leaving Amber alone in the hallway. A short while later, the door slams and Amber is gone. They went up the street and Kelly thought she saw someone in the bushes but when they went, there was no-one there. Detailing what Mr and Mrs Peat did before they called the police, Ms Gilfoyle said: They went to Tescos and did some shopping and had their tea.  The matter was reported to police by Kelly Peat at .am on May , . Ambers former teacher at John Davies Primary School in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Joanna Holt, said the teenager had always seemed unhappy. Mrs Holt said: She was quite an unhappy child, that stands out most in my head. She never really seemed happy. She felt very put upon at home. She said she had a lot of jobs to do that her siblings werent expected to do... and she wasnt treated fairly in comparison to her siblings.  She would be a little bit dramatic about things. She was quite emotional at times as well. Mrs Holt added: She told me that she felt her mum loved her sister more than she loved her and that her sibling was the favourite. The inquest heard there was no evidence of physical neglect and no sign that Amber was malnourished at the time of her death. Home Office pathologist Frances Hollingbury said there were no traces of alcohol or drugs in her body and no suggestion of a mental illness. The inquest continues.

Certainly the mineral deposits can be credited for the vivid red, green, blue and yellow deacutecor.  of As rainwater passes through the ground at Ky Head, it becomes a weak carbonic acid from the limestone deposits. This acid dissolves the calcite in the rock, forming calcium bicarbonate, which, mixed in the rainwater, drips down into the cave creating a natural spring. As some of the water evaporates and carbon dioxide is released in the cave, the spring water is left with a high concentration of calcium, which forms speleothemscreating a series of descending, milky yellow calcareous basins.  of As the sea cave floods completely, it is very important to only visit it at low tide, and to be aware of the incoming sea. It is also advisable to not visit the cave alone, and to take a bright torch to see all the magnicent colours hidden in the darkness.  of A slightly earlier book, John Cardell Olivers Guide to Newquay from  gives us a detailed description of the cave from that era: It is a somewhat curious place. After passing over a few boulders the mouth of the cave will be reached, where steps will be found leading up to the well.  of This rock-formed cistern is of a duplicate form, consisting of two wells, having a communication existing between them. The supply of water is from above and this water, being of a calcareous nature, has coated the rock with its earthy deposits, giving to the surrounding walls and to the well itself a iegated appearance of white, green and purple. Above and beyond the well will be seen a deep hole extending into the clf.  of The legend respecting the well is, that in olden times mothers on Ascension Day brought their deformed or sickly children here, and dipped them in, at the same time passing them through the aperture connecting the two cisternsand thus, it is said, they became healed of their disease or deformity. It would seem that other classes also believed virtue to reside in its water for it is said that the cripples were accustomed to leave their crutches in the hole at the head of the well.  of This well has Nature only for its architect, no mark of mans hand being seen in its constructiona pink enamelled basin, filled by drippings from the stalactitic roof, forms a picture of which it is dficult to describe the loveliness. What wonder, then, that the simple folk around should endow it with mystic virtues   of However, the popularity of St Cuthbert’s Cave is recorded much earlier than Oliver’s “Guide to Newquay”, by William Hals in his “History of Cornwall”, which he compiled from  until   of More OnCornwallCommentsShow more comments"},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle kate middleton targeted","story":"NewsMeghan Markle and Kate Middleton targeted by racist and sexist social media commentsAbuse and threats, including some of violence, aimed at the Duchess of Sussex, the Duchess of Cambridge and their fans have sparked a #HelloToKindness campaignShareCommentsByRussell Myers:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsAbuse has been aimed at the Duchess of Cambridge and the Duchess of Sussex, as well as fans arguing amongst themselves \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRoyal aides are battling “sexist and racist” social media comments aimed at Duchess of Sussex and Duchess of Cambridge, it emerged yesterday.

It was revealed today that the Duke of Sussex, , will be in Norway on official duties on the most romantic day of the year. Kensington Palace tweeted that Harry will be visiting a remote training camp  miles inside the Arctic Circle on February . He will be there to celebrate the th anniversary of Exercise Clockwork in Bardufoss - the traditional name of the annual winter exercise that trains Royal Marines and Royal Navy sailors and airmen. The Palace also tweeted: “The Duke of Sussex will meet military personnel living and training on the base, view some of the specialist outdoor severe weather equipment and training that is conducted at Clockwork and talk with expert aircrews and engineers.”   The Duchess of Sussex, who is around six months pregnant with their first child, will be unlikely to join Harry on the royal trip as the visit will include spending time in one of “the world’s most demanding environments”. Meanwhile, a body language experts has weighed in on why the pregnant duchess is constantly cradling her bump. According to Harry Witchel it is the -year-old’s attempt at reserved royal behaviour. He told the Mail on Sunday: Meghan tends to cup her bump by knitting her fingers together – a sign of holding back and being more grounded.  Thats quite a contrast to her usual behaviour, which involves dealing with the world with gusto. As a Royal she is expected to be more reserved, so is this a subconscious attempt to be so  This doesnt look like acting. This looks like a woman aware of a change in her body. Meghan will give birth in the spring, but her exact due date has not been made public. The new arrival will be seventh in line to the throne, but it is unlikely that the baby boy or girl will be given the title of Prince or Princess. Instead they will probably become a Lord or a Lady as they are too far down the line of succession.   Ahead of the birth, Meghan and Harry will leave Kensington Palace and London and move to their new home Frogmore Cottage in Windsor. They are currently renovating the home, a present from the Queen, and getting the nursery ready for Baby Sussex. Meghan has reportedly opted for vegan paint and the design will be completely gender neutral as they dont knowtheyre having a boy or a girl.

Joanne Thomas, , has shed st lbs after struggling to lt her bulky frame off the floor at a parent and toddler group left her so humiliated she knew enough was enough. The mum-of-two, who weighed st lbs and was a size  at her biggest, started to pile on the pounds during her second pregnancy with son Noah Grant. Joanne told herself she didnt need to worry about her weight while pregnant, bingeing on daily microwave meals, takeaways and six pieces of toast lathered with marmite. Determined to turn her le around for her family, Joanne joined Slimming World in April last year and has since dropped four dress sizes.   Now a svelte st lb, Joanne feels a million dollars and said her partner Stephen Grants jaw hit the floor at his th birthday party when she strutted in wearing a fitted jumpsuit. Joanne, from Thatcham, Berkshire, said: Its like Im a new woman, I feel like a million dollars. Im much more confident and better in myself. Its nice to go out and feel that people arent looking at you, or looking at you for the right reasons. People say whats your trick  but there isnt a magic wand - its about how much you want it.   You have to have amazing willpower. Stephens th was a massive aim for me. I didnt want him to think oh, I have a fat girlfriend that used to be thinner. But it wasnt really for him, it was the milestone I set for myself. He kept telling me I was doing great and was very reassuring and supportive. Hes amazed at how Ive stuck to it and been so focused. We went out for his th and I was wearing a jumpsuit. I came down to the hotel bar and his jaw nearly fit the floor. He said he was a lucky man and I looked stunning and he was really proud of me.  As of this week I can go into any shop now get a size  off the shelf and it fits perfectly. Its a huge dference. The mum-of-two admitted she used to gorge on takeaways and convenience foods during her -hour shts as a care assistant since starting their relationship in . After having son Noah Grant in March  Joanne said she soon felt embarrassed and inadequate when she struggled getting up from the floor at parent and child groups. It wasnt until after shed had Noah that the toll of her eating for two mentality was revealed as she spiralled to st lbs and spent months squeezed into maternity wear. Joanne claims one of the key turning points in her weight loss journey was when she had to ask other mums to hold Noah while she struggled to get onto the floor or stand up again because of her size.  A dficult pregnancy meant she was housebound towards the end and found herself eating out of boredom. Joanne said: When Noah was around three months old I took him to a music class. Wed have to sit on the floor and someone would have to hold him while I struggled to get up, I felt embarrassed and inadequate. I wanted to be able to get around like the other mums could and felt I needed to be thinner to give Noah the best childhood he could. Now I just tuck him under my arms and get up off the floor easily. Before Noah wed eat rubbish at home. Id be working  hours shts at the hospital and eating lots of takeaway, but I was only around a stone and a half heavier than I am now.   During pregnancy I thought oh, I dont have to worry about this for nine months, so Id eat six slices of toast with marmite for breakfast and the biggest cinnamon bun that youve ever seen. After having Noah, Joannes weight spiralled to  stone as shed suffered with pelvic pain and overeaten for months. Two months passed and trendy Joanne was still wearing her maternity clothes or struggling to fit into her size  leggings. Increasingly wary of her lack of energy and inability to play with her baby, Joanne ed to an old Slimming World class hoping to take back control. Joanne said: I wasnt always huge but I did pile on masses in that pregnancy. I remember going to my first midwe appointment and being mortied that I was already  st lbs. I had a horrendous pregnancy with swelling and a bad pelvis, and I was really inactive for the last trimester.  I was very immobile as well - obviously Id gone from working -hour shts three or four times a week, to basically being housebound. Everything spiralled, I wasnt mobile so Id sit and eat. I didnt have anything  to do, so Id sit and eat more. When Id had the baby and brought him home, I couldnt do anything. I was so fat and uncomfortable, I couldnt even get on the floor to play with him. When he was five weeks old I went back to Slimming World and I decided I wanted to lose weight more than anything. Despite previously trying Slimming World back in , her weight gain and embarrassment at being unable to move freely at the parent and baby group spurred her on to try the Thatcham group again.  Joanne said: I stuck to the plan religiously and now when I think to myself I want a cake I think I want the weight loss more. I wanted to be healthy and thinner and to be able to run around with my boys. I didnt want to be fat forever - I want to see my kids grow up. Noahs crawling now and Im running round like a lunatic half the time trying to move everything from his reach. I want to play on the park and get my fat bum down the slide - all the things I could never do.   After getting back into Slimming World, Joanne began to cook family dinners from scratch and has enjoyed watching the pounds slip off. She even enjoys fakeaways to replace her old favourite - fried chicken and chips. But the bubbly mum says she hasnt once stepped into a gym, crediting her slender shape to healthy eating and a short walk to the corner shop once a day.Joanne said: When I was pregnant I had horrendous heartburn so I lived on McDonalds milkshake.Now I fancy something like that or KFC, Id never go and buy one. Id just find a way of making a healthy one myself. I do all my cooking from fresh. Before, I couldnt stand to do that so we grabbed what we could get - takeaways and unhealthy foods. Now for breakfast I might have poached eggs with mushrooms or tomatoes, or Ill have a wholemeal bagel, bacon with no fat and cheese. Before Breakfast - Four pieces of toast with marmite and butterLunch - Cheese sandwich, salt and vinegar crisps, sausage rollDINNER - Large kebabSnacks - Slice of chocolate cake, Dairy Milk chocolate bar , McDonalds strawberry milkshakeTotal  ,  calories Now Breakfast- Poached eggs with mushrooms and tomatoesLUNCH - Smoked salmon and scrambled egg bagelDinner - Spaghetti Bolognese with rocketSnacks - None Total  ,  calories  For lunch Ill have a jacket potato because Im always out meeting other mums, or soups, omelettes. I dont avoid carbs either. At night well have anything from a chilli, spaghetti bolognese, chicken kebabs, roast dinners - proper food. I think the thing with Slimming World is that it isnt a fad diet. It teaches you to live the rest of your le eating healthy, balanced meals. Its family food as well, we all sit down and enjoy an evening meal together now. I dont do any exercise or classes, we might walk to the shop once a day to get some milk but I dont do anything . No gym classes, no aerobics - Im definitely not a runner.

The woman who had been so long kept in the shadows walked side by side with the man who would one day be king. The th anniversary of arguably one of the most signicant moments in recent royal history passed tonight . It is unlikely to have been marked with any fanfare, although one may wonderthe couple enjoyed a private moment of reflection on how far they’ve come. On that night in , when the Prince of Wales stepped out in public for the first time with his mistress Camilla Parker Bowles, it was the culmination of a sensitive project called Operation Ritz.   In front of  of the world’s press photographers, who had been invited and assembled outside the London Ritz hotel, Charles and Camilla were together. Across the Mirror’s front page the next day were emblazoned the words “At Last”, with other national newspapers declaring “It’s official, we’re a couple” and simply “Together”. For years, Camilla had been pilloried as a home wrecker after the public breakdown of Charles’s marriage to Diana. The princess had sensationally laid the blame at Camilla’s door in a  BBC interview, telling Martin Bashir: “Well, there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded.” Polls found more than a third of Brits thought Charles should give up the crown in favour of handing it straight to his son William while a third disliked Camilla.   And yet, as she left her sister Annabel Elliot’s th birthday party, the trajectory was set to bring her into the family known as “The Firm” and change the British public’s feelings against her. Editor-in-chief of Majesty Magazine Ingrid Seward said that moment had taken “many hours of careful discussion behind palace walls”. The execution of such a carefully planned PR campaign was masterminded by Charles’s spin doctor, Mark Bolland. Charles, then , and Camilla had gone to great s to avoid being seen – or shyphotographed together. Their public declaration is a feat many say in today’s world of smartphones would almost certainly be impossible. Ingrid said: “The moment will go down in history. It was something that could never be pulled off in today’s world. It was long thought pictures would be captured of the couple, perhaps at a friend’s estate in an unguarded moment, the appetite for them to confirm the shyrelationship was at fever pitch. “Public opinion had been very hostile, and when Princess Diana died in , a year after Charles’s orce was finalised, everything that had been planned for Camilla had to be put on hold. “It was a finely balanced situation and Prince Charles always said it would be a slow burner. He often told Camilla that they would have to be patient.” The moment may have had important ramications for their future public le together, but it was over in seconds.  Charles emerged first, just ahead of Camilla, and walked down the steps of the hotel into a barrage of flashlights. At the foot of the steps, a beaming prince momentarily lost sight of Camilla, glancing to either side before guiding her with his arm towards the kerbside rear-passenger door of their Vauxhall Omega. He walked casually to the opposite door, smiling briefly to the assembled media before being driven away. In the years that followed, Mr Bolland, then the prince’s deputy private shysecretary, worked to normalise their relationship in the eyes of the public – a campaign known as Operation PB behind closed doors at St James’s Palace. It was an uphill battle... Sources say the young Camilla Shand was dying for the Prince to propose when they dated in the s, but he was playing the field.  When he left for military duty, she accepted another offer and married boyfriend Andrew Parker Bowles. Over the next  years, Charles and Camilla would stray from their marriages, shocking everyone with their  “Camillagate” phone sex leak. Charles made intimate references to wishing he “lived in her knickers” and a transcript of a bedtime conversation between them was published just a month after Charles and Diana announced their official split. But in  the Queen recognised the relationship by attending a birthday lunch for King Constantine with Camilla present. In June , the prince and Camilla shared their first public kiss at a party thrown to support the National shyOsteoporosis Society. They wed in April  at the Guildhall in Windsor, with Camilla becoming the Duchess of Cornwall. It is said she finally realised she would be welcome into the public’s hearts when the Queen made a touching speech to coincide with the date of the Grand National where she had a horse running. She began by saying she had two important announcements to make – the first was that her horse Hedgehunter had won the race at Aintree. And she was delighted to be welcoming her son and his bride to the “winners” enclosure.  She added: “They have overcome Becher’s Brook and The Chair and all kinds of other terrible obstacles. They’ve come through and I’m very proud and wish them well. My son is home and dry with the woman he loves.” Ingrid added: “In this moment Camilla knew the path would surely be smoother. For the Queen to publicly give her approval in such a way really did mark the beginning of her royal le for certain. “Since then she has been magnicent in every facet of her le and is one of the darlings of the royal family.” Camilla developed her role through her charity work, including raising awareness of osteoporosis, promoting literacy, and supporting shysurvivors of sexual assaults and domestic abuse. Royal correspondents have often said she is “the most fun to work with”. She will legally become Queen Consort when Charles becomes king. State banquets, State Openings of Parliament, royal tours and joint shyengagements with the Queen have become the norm for Camilla –  years on from a brief but momentous appearance as she headed home from a party.Streets near Windsor Castle are to be protected from terror attacks involving vehicles with poundmillion barriers after temporary ones were installed in the Berkshire town in March  in response to the Westminster attacks."},{"url":null,"title":"teen barmaid almost blinded after","story":"NewsTeen barmaid almost blinded after thug stubbed out cigarette in her faceLily Loan, , was attacked by Declan Potter, , outside a club for no reason andthe injury had been any higher on her face she would have lost the sight in that eyeShareCommentsByMartin NaylorHayley Coyle:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsLily Loan, , says she was almost blinded \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA teenage barmaid was almost blinded in one eye after a thug stubbed out a cigarette on her face in a completely “unprovoked attack”.

He also tried to punch her. Miss Loan said thatthe injury had been even a fraction higher, she would have been blinded. The -year-old was at Derby Crown Court to see Declan Potter jailed for the attack, which took place outside Sinfin Moor Social Club in Derby.Potter, , was sentenced to six months behind bars, reports the Derby .  Miss Loan said: “It was completely unprovoked. “He approached me in the smoking area and asked me what my problem was. “I said what are you on about  And he came towards me and stubbed the cigarette out in my face. “Had it been a couple of millimetres higher he would have blinded me in one eye.” Luc Chignall, prosecuting, said the attack happened in the smoking area outside the club, in Arleston Lane, during the early hours of February , last year. He said Miss Loan, who was  at the time, was talking to a friend when Potter approached her. Mr Chignall said: “They did not know each other, this was completely unprovoked. “There seems to have been some kind of argument or dispute.   “During it, he jabbed her in the eye with the cigarette and then follows it up with a couple of punches which he tries to land.” Mr Chignall said the police were called and Potter, of Macauley Street, Sinfin, left. He was arrested and at first denied anything had happened. But after being shown CCTV of the attack, he later pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm. In her victim personal statement, Miss Loan, who was supported by family and friends in court, said: “The injury was right under my eye in an obvious place and I had to disguise it at first using make up and by wearing sunglasses. I also had to relive the assault as so many people kept asking me what had happened to me. “I am more self-conscious, this has affected my confidence and I am more wary where I go out. “There is still a mark which I have to cover using make-up.”  Jailing Potter Judge Jonathan Bennett said: “This was an appalling piece of conduct. “It was unprovoked and shameful and there can be absolutely no justication for your behaviour that night. “I come to the view that the appropriate punishment is immediate custody.” Kevin Jones, for Potter, said his client was self-employed, but he did not say what his profession was.

A deeply troubled man was sitting on the edge of an overpass with a rope around his neck about to take his own le. Devonte Cafferkey, , Sammy Farah, , and Shawn Young, just  at the time, didnt panic. In fact, the incredible quick-thinking, heroism and compassion of the boys, who go to St Mary’s High School in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, saved the mans le. They tried to keep him back from the edge, talk him around, and when he went to jump, they grabbed onto him and refused to let go. As Shawn then calmly rang for help, two other passers-by came to the boys aide and the man was rescued. The three children are now to be recognised nationally for their bravery at the A overpass in Waltham Cross, last September.

She said: I am extremely proud of all three of them, they are all good boys and it’s nice that they are getting recognised for doing something good in the community. Quite often in the national news there are a lot of negative reports about young people so it is nice to have something positive. They are very young and I marvel at how they are all dealing with it.

Amelia Page, , was told the tragic news last week just three months after the symptoms began, the Daily Post reported. The teaching assistant - who lived in Dubai until recently - was visiting her family in Anglsey, Wales, for Christmas when tests came back. They revealed she had oian cancer, but said they could not find the primary source. Further tests at Ysbyty Gwynedd gave Amelia the worst possible news - the primary cancer was in her stomach and had spread to her bowel, pelvis, her oies and possibly her kidneys. Her younger sister, Lucy Page, said: She went in with a really positive attitude but told me to prepare for the worst.   She hadnt been feeling good at all and I think she already had an idea it coming from her stomach. We went in and sat down and the consultant just hit us with the news that it was really serious and she only had a matter of months left. I dont remember much after that. I cant even put into words how I feel. She added: It is unbelievably hard, it doesnt feel real. I never expected it to be so bad.   She loves going to the gym, shes so healthy and shes always been into fitness. Its crazy that this can happen to someone like Amelia. I cant begin to even explain how amazing she is. Shes the most positive person you could ever meet, shes funny, kind and incredibly confident. Generous donors have now contributed pound, to a crowdfunding campaign which was launched by her sister.   She is hoping to use the money to enjoy the end of her le and fund private cancer treatment which will help prolong her le as long as possible. Lucy added: We are all totally overwhelmed by the response. Never in a million years did we expect to raise so much money. Her partner, Luke, who has moved to Anglesey from Dubai to be with her is amazing. Theyre living in a room at my mums house which needs doing up because its damp, so were hoping to use some of the money to redecorate that.

The killer whale died early on Monday morning after her health deteriorated over the weekend and she began showing signs of discomfort, according to officials from the controversial park. It is not known what Kayla died of, and a post-mortem is expected to be carried out in the next few days. A post-mortem was also carried out on the parks infamous whale, Tilikum, who died in January  - but the park has not released any details of its findings or a cause of death. In a statement on Kaylas death, SeaWorld Orlando said: While today is a dficult day for all of us at SeaWorld, Kayla inspired generations of guests and employees to care and learn more about this amazing species.  Her veterinarians immediately began treatment based on a physical examination. Unfortunately, her condition worsened on Sunday. Although animal care specialists and veterinarians devoted around the clock attention to Kayla, she did not survive. Kayla was born in captivity at SeaWorld San Antonio in , before being moved to SeaWorld Ohio in  and then later Orlando in  - where she spent the rest of her le performing for visitors. Kayla is the third orca to die at a SeaWorld park in the last two years. Katasha died of lung disease at the San Diego park in August  and Tilikum also died in the Orlando park in January .  Tilikum hit headlines after being featured as the main orca in Blackfish - a Netflix documentary which investigated SeaWorlds practices and handling of the whales.He had battled some very serious health issues - including a complicated lung infection - before his death, SeaWorld said. However, the official cause of his passing is yet to be determined. Captured in Iceland in  aged just two, the whale sired  calves in the  years he was at the park in Orlando, Florida. Before this, he had resided at Sealand of the Pacic near Victoria, Canada. Trainer Dawn died in  after being grabbed by Tilikum and pulled into the water following a post-show routine.   The -year-old was reportedly scalped and dismembered by the whale, nicknamed Tilly, during the tragedy at the park. Tilikum, who had a familiar floppy fin, was linked to two other deaths while in captivity - those of Keltie Byrne and Daniel Dukes. On February , , Sealand trainer Keltie fell into a pool with three orcas. It is reported that Tilikum pulled the marine biology student to the bottom of the enclosure, where she drowned aged just . And in July , the whale was connected to the death of Daniel, , after he evaded security and entered the orca tank at SeaWorld after hours.

And thats exactly what Noah, who claims to be from the year , says he is. His latest prediction is about what the country will look like in  years time - by which point Parliament may actually have come to an agreement about what happens next. For the  percent of Brits who voted to Leave, however, Noah’s news might not be welcome.In the video, the pixelated figure claims that, despite Brexit , the UK will re-join forces with the EU again as par of a European superstate.  I have come back to tell you guys the truth and everything there is to know about the future, claimed Noah to the paranormal investigations YouTube channel, ApexTV. There’s a lot for me to say. First thing, the United Kingdom actually comes back into the European Union. Presumably referring to his point in time, he goes on to say everyone knows [the UK] left a while ago now, before claiming the country s before . “The thing about the European Union in the future is all the countries in the EU actually converge together into one giant country, and the UK kind of acts like a district in this giant country,’ he continued.   Including the likes of Germany, Spain, France and Denmark in the plans, Noah claims other nations will supposedly follow suit in the trend of merging borders - much to the dismay of Brexiteers everywhere. A new currency will also apparently be introduced by the superstate, making both the Pound and Euro obsolete. Noah also warned of drastic changes to the UK’s temperature as global warming accelerates in the coming years, bearing with it irrevocable change.  It does signicantly change, the United Kingdom’s temperature, he says. “Global warming is a very bad thing that we have, and I don’t know what to tell you guys. “You need to change something right nowyou don’t want the temperature and everything to change.” In another audacious claim, Noah says Britons will also have a chip implanted into their heads, helping to increase brain-capacity up to six times over.

Local girls Jasmine McPhie and Carla Todd were both key players in Rangers Girls triumphant run in the Girls Under  Scottish Cup.In their run to the final, Rangers played the top four under  girls teams in Scotland beating Aberdeen - in the first round, then Hamilton - and Central Girls - in rounds two and three. A quarter-final tie against Glasgow City saw the Rangers Girls win - to set up an old firm semi-final against Celtic Girls in which the Rangers Girls emerged - winners in a close game.The final was played on Saturday November  at the Oriam Performance Centre in Edinburgh. In a competitive match, Rangers started strong but Hibernian began to come into the game and whilst both sides had chances, the score remained - at half time. In the second half, Rangers took the lead in  minutes but three minutes later Hibernian drew level.There were few chances in the remainder of the second half and at full time both teams were level at -.

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"sports club lotteries 9","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowDrawn on Monday January , Kilmory Camanachd Club#s lottery numbers were ,  and .

It was written for Count Friedrich Wilhelm, supposedly simplied for amateurs to play. However, Jamal and Jâms being master musicians showed the power of this often disregarded piece, to be immense. One of the first works to make piano and cello equal musical partners, it is full of ingenious dialogue between the instruments. The structure is unusual, but with such expert performers it delighted the audience who were moved by every turn and twist of this deeply emotional work.Jâms, from North Wales, after remarking on the three ferry crossings required to get to Ardrishaig via Bute, introduced the next piece, Ernest Bloch’s work ‘From Jewish Le’. In a style close to Jamal’s heart and heritage, having been born in Baku Azerbaijan, its three elements, ‘Prayer’, ‘Supplication’ and ‘Jewish Song’, are full of the pathos and sorrow felt by the Jewish nation and also full of the signature augmented intervals and minor key tonality of much of middle eastern musics. How beautully these pieces demonstrated the lyrical qualities of the cello. Jamal’s bow searched for all possible nuances of tone and dynamic as his instrument sang from its lowest notes to a seductive soprano register.The concert continued after the interval with a second Beethoven work. The audience may have noticed a minor kerfuffle at the piano as many pages were rapidly turned before starting. Would it be the ‘Seven Variations’ for cello and piano or the ‘Twelve’, both based on themes from Mozart’s Magic Flute  The ‘Seven Variations’ won, being on the theme from the ‘Pamina’ and ‘Papageno’ duet entitled ‘In men, who know the feeling of love’. This work exhibits Beethoven’s practised ingenuity in the iation form and brought a lighter mood to the programme.Jâms Coleman introduced the final work, Frank Bridge’s Cello Sonata. He told of the four years of torment for the composer as he struggled to express his feelings about the First World War, finally finishing the composition in . The adagio in the piece caused the composer the most dficulty as he struggled with ambivalence about his own pacist views. Jâms and Jamal dealt with the challenges of this complex work which tracks huge changes in the world of music composition that were under way at that time. Again, the lyrical powers of the cello came to the fore as did the virtuosic requirements heaped on the pianist. Despite its undoubted innovations, this piece generously reaches out to its audience. Bridge uses the new musical freedoms only when justied, being happy toto more traditional tonal stability in the lyrical sections.Fulfilled, but not overburdened by the weightiness of the final piece, the audience applauded Jamal and Jâms back to the concert room to perform the ‘Swan’ from Saint-Saens ‘Carnival of the Animals’ as encore.

Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"caravan caught alight sparks major","story":"NewsCaravan which caught alight sparks major fire operationThe derelict property on Kilmarnock Road in Monkton went up in flames last Thursday night as the caravan attached to it caught fire.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  JAN NewsThe fire spread to the adjacent property \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA caravan which caught alight sparked a large scale fire operation as it set ablaze to a neighbouring house.

I had a lot of balls left because Georgie loved them and my other dog doesnt so I put them in the box at the Gattonside end of chain bridge.\"Since then someone has attached it to the gate and people have been borrowing the balls and putting them back and even adding new ones.\"I just want the box to remind owners to enjoy every moment with their dog.\"Georgie passed away in May last year after contracting Alabama rot, also known as Cutaneous and Renal Glomerular Vasculopathy .Only appearing to affect dogs, the disease damages the lining of blood vessels in the skin and kidney, resulting in ulceration of the skin and kidney damage.The condition can affect any breed or age of dog and a proportion can go on to develop severe, acute kidney failure, which is often fatal.Lynsay and her dogs Georgie and Taffy used to walk along the river most days and it was after one of these walks that she noticed Georgie had lesions on her legs.\"It was after a walk in Gattonside one Saturday that I saw that she had sores on her legs so I took her to the vet on Monday and she was given some cream.\"But she went downhill fast and by Wednesday her poo was black, which I later learnt was a sign that her kidneys were failing.\"I took her to the vets again where she was given a cone to stop her licking the sores but by Friday the vets suspected it was Alabama rot and put her on a drip and kept her in overnight hoping that she would improve.\"But on Saturday we were told that her kidneys had stopped working and she wasnt going to get better.\"I took Taffy with me to spend some time with her and then she got put to sleep.\"Alabama rot was first recorded in the UK in  and the number of cases has risen each year. Georgies was the first confirmed case in the Borders.Lynsay said: \"The only way that you can be sure it is Alabama rot is to have a post mortem so Georgie was then taken to the Dick Vet in Edinburgh where it was confirmed that she had had Alabama rot. My other dog was tested for it but thankfully the results were clear.\"The Kennel Club is warning dog owners to be extra vigilant at this time of year as the peak season for the disease is between November and May.Caroline Kisko, Kennel Club Secretary said: ldquoAlthough the disease is very rare, affecting an extremely low percentage of dogs in the UK, the condition is very serious and potentially le-threatening. It is therefore vital that owners understand and recognise the warning signs, especially as time plays a signicant part in successfully treating the disease.ldquoWe are asking owners to look out for any signs of Alabama rot during the winter months and to remember to take action right away. Any dogs with unexplained or concerning skin lesions which typically look like sores, ulcers, or red, swollen, bruised areas, commonly with an infected appearance should be taken to their vet as soon as possible. These skin changes are usually found on their paws or lower legs, but may also appear on their head, face or lower body. Dogs who have contracted the disease may also become tired, disinterested in food, or present other signs of illness like vomiting or diarrhoea.ldquoAlthough these signs may not necessarily mean your dog has Alabama rot, acting quickly and speaking to a vet to determine what is wrong is the best course of action to protect your petrsquos health.While large amounts of research have been carried out over the last six years, the cause of the disease remains unknown. As yet, no evidence has been found to suggest that CRGV is caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, toxins, or radiation. There is speculation that it is related to mud or water, due to the higher prevalence in winter and spring, and relatively low case numbers seen in the summer.Caroline continued: ldquoTo lower any risk of your dog contracting Alabama rot, itrsquos also advisable to keep your dog away from very muddy areas, wash wet or muddy dogs straight after a walk and regularly check your dogrsquos body for anything thatrsquos dferent.,params: .pushldquoWhile a distinct seasonal pattern is suggested, we must continue to research this deadly disease and ensure all dog owners are aware of the signs and symptoms so they are able to seek veterinary advice immediately.Despite what happened, Lynsay still s to walk Taffy along the river in Gattonside.

of Brexit, with fewer than  days remaining until the UK is due to leave the EU.Amid an ongoing revolt among backbenchers and her DUP allies, the Prime Minister has swung behind a motion amendment that would allow her to go back to Brussels and seek changes to the Irish border backstop.She will whip MPs to support the amendment tabled by  Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady, which states that Parliament would be willing to support the Withdrawal Agreement reached with the EUldquoalternative arrangements were found to avoid a hard border.The dramatic move is far from guaranteed to deliver a majority for the plan after it failed to win the support of the influential European Research Groupof Conservative Eurosceptics, who have not ruled out voting against it.There is also the small matter of the amendment being called by Commons Speaker John Bercow on Tuesday morning, although his hand may be swayed by the number of MPs backing it already.Tory grandee Sir Graham said he hoped House of Commons backing would give Mrs May ldquoenormous firepower when she s to Brussels to seek concessions on her Brexit deal.But the chairman of the ERG, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said its members, thought to number at least , will not support the scheme.Meanwhile, late on Monday evening it emerged a new Brexit plan had been put forward which is reportedly backed by members of both the Remain and Leave camps of the Conservative party.The plan ndash called the The Malthouse Compromise after Kit Malthouse, the MP who brought the parties together ndash would lead to Britain leaving the EU ldquoon time and with a ing government, former Brexit minster Steve Baker said.ldquoThe Malthouse Compromise after @kitmalthouse, who brought us togetherWe need to get out of the EU on time and with a ing government.This is how. #Brexithttps:t.co mBvmdkXmdash Steve Baker MPJanuary , Said to be drawn up by Nicky Morgan and supported by others, the plan reportedly ldquoprovides for exit from the EU on time with a new backstop, which would be acceptable indefinitely, but which incentivises us all to reach a new future relationship.It would extend the transition period ndash the period where the UK would continue to follow EU rules and pay into its budget ndash from the end of  and into December  which would ldquoallow both parties to prepare properly for WTO terms, but also provide a period in which the parties could obviate this outcome by negotiating a mutually beneficial future relationship.Mrs May addressed MPs in Westminster on the eve of a day of high drama, when MPs will debate a range of rival amendments, including calls to block a no-deal departure or delay Brexit from its scheduled date of March .Conservative chairman Brandon Lewis, who confirmed the whipping after the meeting, said the Brady amendment would ldquoallow the Prime Minister to give a very clear message around what Parliament wants, where the party is.He said: ldquoI would hope the ERG, when they look at this and actually look through the detail of what this gives the PM tomorrow,it is about giving a message to Europe about what can go through Parliament in terms of dealing with the backstop issue and why that matters.Mr Lewis confirmed that the Government would whip against an amendment co-sponsored by one of its own MPs, Nick Boles, which seeks to extend the Article  period to avoid a no-deal Brexit.Despite the manoeuvring in Westminster, in Brussels the EU, officially at least, remained resolute that the Withdrawal Agreement would not be reopened.Chief EU negotiator Michel Barnierrsquos deputy Sabine Weyand warned there was a ldquohigh risk of the UK crashing out by accident, as it was ldquoquite a challenge to see how a majority could be constructed at Westminster.European Commission vice-president Jyrki Kateinen said there was ldquono reason to give any concessions to the UK and there was ldquonot much room for manoeuvre on the backstop.It would be ldquostupid for the EU to make concessions putting the remaining  members at a disadvantage simply to secure a deal, he said.Downing Street said the PM remains committed to quitting the EU on March  and will take her plan back to the Commons for a second ldquomeaningful vote as soon as possible after Tuesdayrsquos debate.The developments came as major supermarkets and fast-food chains warned that a no-deal Brexit

It was a cold day but my friend, who is skilled in bushcraft, had brought his portable fire pit with him.We searched for drtwood and sat by the fire, roasting marshmallows and warming our hands. It was a short walk but dramatic rock formations loomed above us, making it feel like a real adventure. The kids climbed them and explored the rocky beach, where once there had been an open-air bathing pool.On our , we went through a small tunnel-like arch. I stopped for a moment, suddenly taken by the view. The ruins of Dunbar Castle were beautully framed by the archway. Locals call this archway the keyhole and I reflected that the term is a perfect name.When we look through a keyhole, our vision is narrowly focussed. Such was the effect here. It cast a visual spotlight on what is left of what was once a mighty fortress.The kids trundled on before me, noticing smaller wonders: a frozen worm on the path, a sea shell and interesting-looking stones. But I stood for some moments, taking in the view beyond and thinking of what stories those old stones of the castle could tell.Many people pass this way every day, both locals and visitors. Itrsquos a section of the John Muir Way. I have often been with my family to Dunbar Leisure Pool and the harbour and town. But somehow I had missed this short but spectacular nearby walk until this day.Dunbar Castle is now but a fallen-down ruin. Indeed, itrsquos dficult to imagine what it once was. But the weathered sandstone castles on the shoreline built by nature still stand defiant, somehow reminding us of their greater permanence in the face of human transience. But as I stood looking at the ruins, the keyhole focussed my thoughts as well as my vision.History is also viewed through a keyhole, a very narrow one. The lives and events of the castle were lived in most part unrecorded by it. The spotlight of history has illuminated only brief moments, and even then the characters have been only those deemed lsquoimportantrsquo.There are moments where the view through the narrow keyhole of history has included insights to untold stories. The bravery of Black Agnes, as she defied the siege in , is one of those. With her husband away, she was in charge of this important fortress during war with England. She refused to give up the castle, even in the face of bombardment and attempts to starve her small garrison into submission. Her mocking of her besiegers by dusting down the battlements with her maids after a bombardment is an image seared in legend.But itrsquos a chink of light on a huge untold story we are led to believe by historyrsquos silence that women were insignicant players in events. For sure they were oppressed and put down by a system that centred on male power, but they are half of humanity and at least half the story.As the actions of Black Agnes reveal, even with such constraints put on them, women were there, part of events and often refusing to accept their assigned role.The le of Mary Queen of Scots has always been for me an example of this. Yes, she was privileged and powerful by birth, but because of this history took notice of her.Despite all the political and religious challenges she faced, it was her womanhood which men deemed her main failing. And so she was judged by dferent standards. Had she behaved with the morals of her father she would not have lasted five minutes in power. But no one raised an eyebrow because he was a man.But more than this, even though Mary was the monarch, her royal authority was deemed diluted and even less legitimate merely because she was a woman.So she understood she needed to find a husband to bring her royal authority to full strength in a country full of powerful and bullying misogynist men.She chose the dashing young Darnley, and the fact that he turned out to be dross was not, in my opinion, Maryrsquos fault. How easy it is to blame a woman for a manrsquos failings. She was taken in by him it was he who was the failure, not her.Thatrsquos what Irsquove always maintained, despite the protestations of my tutors at university. And her third husband Bothwell, well he was a disappointment as well.It is the stones of Dunbar,they could speak, who could tell us of the truth of his forced union with Mary. She had been taken there by him in April . The circumstances of this still remain debated. Was she abducted by him as later claimed, or did she go willingly It was also claimed she was raped and forced to marry Bothwell soon afterwards to save her honour . This idea has been disputed by some because Mary is said to have miscarried with twins while imprisoned at Lochleven Castle some months after, suggesting a relationship with Bothwell even before Darnleyrsquos murder. So a woman cannot be abused by a man she has had a relationship with  Really If they could talk, the stones of Dunbar would whisper the truths of those events in , and the despair and desperation of a strong and clever woman whose destiny was stolen mainly because of her sex.These were my thoughts as I stood looking through the keyhole towards Dunbar Castle. Suddenly, my daughter Manja broke my trance by wiggling the frozen worm in front of me. I smiled and thought to myself that thankfully times have changed since the days when the castle was a fortress.But sometimes, I fear, not as much as we think they have."},{"url":null,"title":"new-fidra-gin-hoping-for-east-lothian-base","story":"Fidra Gin is the brainchild of Emma Bouglet and Jo Brydie and is currently based at Ballencrieff and Aviemore.The duo came together to create the juniper berry-based drink and have already enjoyed immediate success, with the product already available in a number of Edinburgh restaurants.Now they are hoping to make it  per cent based in the county, with plans under way to find suitable premises.Emma said: ldquoWe pick all the botanicals in East Lothian and, at the moment, we use a still in Aviemore.ldquoA friend has lent us his still for the time being so we can get enough momentum behind us and bring the whole operation to East Lothian.ldquoWe have potentially secured a premise in East Lothian.

ongoing revolt among backbenchers and her DUP allies, the Prime Minister has swung behind a motion amendment that would allow her to go back to Brussels and seek changes to the Irish border backstop.She will whip MPs to support the amendment tabled by  Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady, which states that Parliament would be willing to support the Withdrawal Agreement reached with the EUldquoalternative arrangements were found to avoid a hard border.The dramatic move is far from guaranteed to deliver a majority for the plan after it failed to win the support of the influential European Research Groupof Conservative Eurosceptics, who have not ruled out voting against it.There is also the small matter of the amendment being called by Commons Speaker John Bercow on Tuesday morning, although his hand may be swayed by the number of MPs backing it already.Tory grandee Sir Graham said he hoped House of Commons backing would give Mrs May ldquoenormous firepower when she s to Brussels to seek concessions on her Brexit deal.But the chairman of the ERG, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said its members, thought to number at least , will not support the scheme.Meanwhile, late on Monday evening it emerged a new Brexit plan had been put forward which is reportedly backed by members of both the Remain and Leave camps of the Conservative party.The plan ndash called the The Malthouse Compromise after Kit Malthouse, the MP who brought the parties together ndash would lead to Britain leaving the EU ldquoon time and with a ing government, former Brexit minster Steve Baker said.ldquoThe Malthouse Compromise after @kitmalthouse, who brought us togetherWe need to get out of the EU on time and with a ing government.This is how. #Brexit https:t.co mBvmdkXmdash Steve Baker MPJanuary , Said to be drawn up by Nicky Morgan and supported by others, the plan reportedly ldquoprovides for exit from the EU on time with a new backstop, which would be acceptable indefinitely, but which incentivises us all to reach a new future relationship.It would extend the transition period ndash the period where the UK would continue to follow EU rules and pay into its budget ndash from the end of  and into December  which would ldquoallow both parties to prepare properly for WTO terms, but also provide a period in which the parties could obviate this outcome by negotiating a mutually beneficial future relationship.Mrs May addressed MPs in Westminster on the eve of a day of high drama, when MPs will debate a range of rival amendments, including calls to block a no-deal departure or delay Brexit from its scheduled date of March .Conservative chairman Brandon Lewis, who confirmed the whipping after the meeting, said the Brady amendment would ldquoallow the Prime Minister to give a very clear message around what Parliament wants, where the party is.He said: ldquoI would hope the ERG, when they look at this and actually look through the detail of what this gives the PM tomorrow,it is about giving a message to Europe about what can go through Parliament in terms of dealing with the backstop issue and why that matters.Mr Lewis confirmed that the Government would whip against an amendment co-sponsored by one of its own MPs, Nick Boles, which seeks to extend the Article  period to avoid a no-deal Brexit.Despite the manoeuvring in Westminster, in Brussels the EU, officially at least, remained resolute that the Withdrawal Agreement would not be reopened.Chief EU negotiator Michel Barnierrsquos deputy Sabine Weyand warned there was a ldquohigh risk of the UK crashing out by accident, as it was ldquoquite a challenge to see how a majority could be constructed at Westminster.European Commission vice-president Jyrki Kateinen said there was ldquono reason to give any concessions to the UK and there was ldquonot much room for manoeuvre on the backstop.It would be ldquostupid for the EU to make concessions putting the remaining

Zak is obviously a long way off that so he will need to find private support, as will his brother.\"When youre at university youre not really allowed sponsors - so any sponsor would get mentions,you like, for half of the year.

As a key member of the European Convention, Kerr wrote Article  of the Lisbon Treaty ndash the clause which triggered Brexit. He was permanent undersecretary at the Foreign Office ndash making him effectively the UKrsquos chief diplomat - and he was also our man in Washington and Brussels, serving as Ambassador to the United States and as the British representative to the European Union. He also negotiated the Maastricht Treaty with John Major, securing the UKrsquos opt out from the euro, and negotiated nuclear armaments for Margaret Thatcher at Nato.THE MISTAKES\"We didnrsquot know our foe very well,\" he says of the negotiations ndash not that Kerr sees the EU as an enemy, quite the opposite. \"We didnrsquot study the other side. We thought we could have our cake and eat it. We thought they needed us more than we needed them, that we could pick them off one by one, that the deal could be done in Berlin over a weekend.\"He speaks incredulously of Brexiteer ministers who \"didnrsquot understand that [the  EU member states] would stick together, would stick up for Ireland, would defend the integrity of the single market. These were basic mistakes\".A bigger mistake, though, was that \"we didnrsquot have a clear vision of where we wanted to end up. We didnrsquot decide how close or far away from the EU we wanted to be\". Theresa May, says Kerr, avoided that discussion in Cabinet as ministers would have disagreed ndashuntil at Chequers last July when she did put forward her proposals resulting in the resignations of David Davis and Boris Johnson, as Brexit Secretary and Foreign Secretary.Kerr continues with his withering assessment of May: \"She didnrsquot reach out to Parliament, shersquos never tried talking to the opposition to find a common position, shersquos never reached out to the country and explained we canrsquot have our cake and eat it, and shersquos never reached out to Edinburgh, Cardf and Belfast and tried to form a consensus of the four nations.\"It was \"muddling along\", he says. \"Getting involved in tactical battles without an overall strategy is a big mistake ndash and one that we made.\"If therersquos been worse negotiations in history, then Kerr \"canrsquot think of one at the moment\". Mayrsquos deal is \"very humiliating\" and its parliamentary defeat \"unprecedented\", he says. \"With some of my friends in Brussels, itrsquos quite awkward talking to them now as theyrsquore embarrassed by the scale of their success and our humiliation\".Kerr believes civil servants from the Foreign Office should have played a central role in negotiations. He turns his attention to Johnson, Davis and Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary. \"I donrsquot think it was a good idea to put Johnson, Fox and Davis in charge of this negotiation,\" he says. \"I think that meant the Prime Minister was slightly cut off from official advice.\"In comparison, EU officials involved in negotiations \"were professionals who knew the European institutions very well\". Kerr says the Foreign Office was cut out as it \"was not really trusted because it was seen as having been in the past rather in favour of remaining in the EU\".\"A very serious mistake was made putting Mr Johnson in charge of the Foreign Office,\" he adds, \"because the Prime Minister clearly didnrsquot trust Mr Johnson, but advice coming from the Foreign Office obviously had to come through Mr Johnson and that probably reduces the chances of that advice being listened to.\"Kerr points out that \"the unity of the  has been remarkable, and thatrsquos partly down to us making it easier for them by never coming forward with any proposals at any stage of the negotiation. We always reacted to proposals from the other side. In negotiation, the power of holding the pen is real ndashyou set the agenda by putting forward the proposals, you donrsquot necessarily get everything you put forward but yoursquore off to a good start. The inability to decide in Cabinet where we wanted to end up meant we never actually put a proposal on the table. We made speeches in London but we didnrsquot put forward any negotiating documents.\"WHAT NEXTKerr now believes that we are heading \"for extra time\" ndash which could only be done through an extension of Article  delaying Brexit ndash and then a second referendum.\"I think the muddle wersquore in now is one which canrsquot be sorted by March . I think it may well end up in a second referendum, and I think it should end up in a second referendum as itrsquos now been established that a lot of the promises made in  canrsquot be kept, and people have tumbled to the fact that leaving without a deal would be a very serious economic disruption. Therersquos also been a very clear rejection of the deal that Mrs May brought back. It follows there should either be a better deal or no Brexit. I think wersquore probably heading for a second referendum.\"Renegotiation is unlikely. \"Itrsquos possible a dferent form of Brexit will emerge from Parliament and be negotiated with the EU,\" says Kerr, \"but I donrsquot think so. I think the EU isnrsquot going to make many changes to the deal it spent two years negotiating.\"As to how a second referendum would go, Kerr says we are in the lap of the gods. \"At present, opinion polls say thattherersquos a referendum tomorrow Remainers would win - but David Cameron was ahead with his remain campaign at the start of the  referendum and he lost.\"If he was advising the Government hersquod tell them \"wersquore in a bad mess, the best thing to do is stop and think and ask the people what they want now they can see what leaving means: do they want Mrs Mayrsquos deal, no deal ndash which would be a complete disaster ndash or do they want to stick with the deal wersquove got, full membership of the EU\".If Britain chose to remain in Europe \"no-one could make us pay a price by taking off our rebate or forcing us to join the euro. These threats the leavers talk about, none of them are true. We would pay no price, political or financial,we decided to stay. So I think wersquore heading for a pause for thought, an extension of Article , and a referendum.\"SCOTTISH INDEPENDENCEKerr got involved in the independence referendum because of Europe. \"I campaigned against Alex Salmond as I didnrsquot believe him when he saidwe Scots went independent while the UK was in the EU that wersquod be allowed to just pull up another chair at the table,\" he says.Kerr argued that an independent Scotland would need to apply for EU membership. \"I thought that would be perfectly doable, but when Scotland got in it would be on new members terms,\" he said ndash that would mean no UK-style rebate. \"Scots would therefore be paying more per head that any Englishman,\" said Kerr.However, Kerr accepts that \"this argument is irrelevant\"the UK leaves the EU ndash and that means a big part of the Better Together case collapses.Nevertheless, Kerr remains a strong supporter of the union. \"Being members of the UK multiples Scottish influence. If we Scots left the UK, the economic disruption would be even greater than the economic disruptionas members of the UK we leave the EU.\" He adds: \"Economists say the effect of leaving the single market of the UK, in terms of the damage to the Scottish economy, would be five times as great as the damage to the UK of leaving the EU.\"Personally, Kerr says, he wants to be \"very Scottish, pretty British, and rather European\".NORTHERN IRELANDKerr is hoping that peace holds in Northern Ireland amid the destabilisation of Brexit. \"Wersquore in a very dangerous country when wersquove stories like the Government thinking of going for some amendment to the Good Friday Agreement as a way of getting around the need for the backstop,\" he says.\"The Good Friday Agreement is a hugely important achievement and for  years itrsquos worked and we havenrsquot had ato the Troubles. We need to tip toe around this very carefully and Irsquom not sure all the politicians in London quite understand how fragile the situation is.\"I think itrsquos also a pity that the Government is relying for its majority on the DUP. I think itrsquos quite hard to play the role that John Major and Tony Blair played of being the mediator, the honest broker,yoursquore relying for your political survival on the support of one party which is very sectarian in its support.\"THE FAR RIGHTKerr says that a second referendum would \"bring some social tensions\" with hardcore Leavers angry at another vote, but he feels \"the social tensions over time of dragging us out of the EU without giving us the chance to say what we want, now the terms are known, would be even more socially disruptive\".\"Young people,\" he says, \"would be deeply resentfulthe golden oldies refused them the chance to have another say.\"Kerr also worries about the effect of English nationalism on the rest of the country. \"Itrsquos the case that in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, that to be dragged out because of an English nationalist vote against the EU would breed resentment unless there was another fair test of what the public as a whole wants.\"\"You get social tension either way,\" he says. However, we need to face down the worst of it.\"If you look at the history of countries where right-wing populist movements gained force ndash say, the history of s Germany ndash the unwillingness to stand up to thugs, thatrsquos really very dangerous to society. The worst reason for not having a second referendum would bewe were frightened of right-wing populist gangs in the street ndash you have to take a stand against that sort of thing. We live in a liberal democratic country and people should not be blackmailed or bludgeoned into a particular political course by threats from thugs.\"WHAT THE WORLD MAKES OF IT ALLKerr knows the corridors of power the world over. Today, governments around the globe are bewildered by the UK chucking away influence and prestige.\"The world doesnrsquot quite understand whatrsquos going on,\" he says. \"It seems to be some breakdown in the UK.\" He adds: \"The fact we were one of the two most influential states in the EU meant that American presidents listened to us quite a lot as they knewthey could do a deal with us we could probably sell that deal to the EU. It was a multiplier of our influence.\"We were more powerful in Brussels as we were known to be influential in Washington, and we were more influential in Washington as were known to be powerful in Brussels. Our friends in Canberra, Delhi, and Ottawa attached considerable importance to the help we could give them in Brussels, so our friends around the world are a bit confused as to why we would want to give all that up.\"I donrsquot think the die is yet cast, though. I think we could well draw back ndash in which case this would be seen as a very odd episode, where we seem to have gone through some sort of crisis but come through it okay.\"If we go ahead and leave the EU I think wersquoll pay a price that wonrsquot just be economic ndash and itrsquoll be a serious economic price, particularly for poorer people in our society ndash it would also be political. I think our influence in the world as a whole would shrink.\"THE ROOTS OF BREXITFew,any, of the main drivers of Brexit had much to do with Europe, in Kerrrsquos opinion. First and foremost is \"the way the British political machine and successive governments tended to connive with Fleet Street in presenting Brussels as a place of endless battles and ambushes, that Britain was alone against these horrible continentals\".In fact, he says, \"we were the most influential state in Brussels. We had more influence on the commission than any other member state, the single market was ised by Margaret Thatcher ndash but ministers liked to pretend that it was a struggle between the forces of light, the British, and the forces of darkness on the continent\".Secondly, comes the toxic subject of immigration. \"Political elites underestimated the effects of immigration on particular bits of the country. Although immigration is very good for the country, it clearly puts strains on health, education and housing in particular areas, and that was ruthlessly exploited by the Leave campaign.\"Peoplersquos concern wasnrsquot with young people from Poland coming to earn some money and then go home, it was more with immigration from the subcontinent, from India and Pakistan, and there was that nasty link made between Muslim immigration and a terrorist threat ndash a  link in my view.\"EU membership doesnrsquot in any way restrain what our immigration rules are in respect of non-EU citizens, sopeople had wanted to restrict immigration from the subcontinent they could have done so at any time and the EU would have had nothing to say about it.\"Finally, therersquos the economic component. \"The huge wealth of financial Britain, particularly the City of London, contrasted with some left behind bits of the country, and that contrast was deepened by the austerity policies of George Osborne.\"Saying lsquowe are all in this togetherrsquo sounded good but it didnrsquot feel like that for people who saw tax cuts for the rich and huge cuts in support for local government, the NHS, education, and the closure of libraries. That too had nothing to do with the EU. It wasnrsquot EU rules which meant we had to go through austerity, it was the decision after the  crisis that we needed to tighten our belts, and the way we tightened our belt was seen in some parts of the country as pretty unfair.\"Itrsquos a pity then, Kerr adds wryly, that the standard bearers for the remain campaign in  ended up being David Cameron and George Osborne."},{"url":null,"title":"removing-irish-backstop-from-brexit-deal-would-not-be-acceptable-to-eu","story":"Simon Coveney said the European Parliament would not raty an agreement without it, adding: ldquoItrsquos as simple as that.It comes as Mrs May faces another crunch week in Westminster as her deal s to the Commons tomorrow, with a number of MPs tabling amendments to try to change the course of Brexit.The Prime Ministerrsquos deal was dramatically defeated by  votes earlier this month, with much of the criticism focused on the backstop ndash a measure aimed at avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.Speaking on the BBCrsquos Andrew Marr Show, Mr Coveney said: ldquoThe backstop is already a compromise.

It is the music that beams out from it, however, that provides a leline in David Greigrsquos adaptation, brought to le by Tom Morrisrsquos equally expansive production.The first half sees Simpsonrsquos former climbing comrades seemingly gather for his wake with his sister Sarah. Out of this Simon and Richard guide both Sarah and the audience through a crash course in the highs and lows of climbing and the drive that causes some to take the liberating physical leap into the void that gave Simpson his bookrsquos title. This is done by way of an ingenious use of tables, chairs and even a solitary peanut.The sheer physical eacutelan of the four actors onstage as they clamber around designer Ti Greenrsquos futuristic looking construction seemingly suspended in mid-air is thrilling enough. It is the second half, however, which jumps down the rabbit-hole of Simpsonrsquos broken and exhausted psyche as he attempts to make it back from the brink of all but certain death towards unlikely survival as it gets to the solitary delirium of his plight.Greig and Morrisrsquos decision to take such a bold non-literal approach makes for exhilarating theatre, and Sarahrsquos presence is vital here. As played with ferocious vigour by Fiona Hampton, it is she who drives the narrative.

A few weeks earlier Canadas Globe and Mail had declared: ldquoA self-destructive madness grips the UK\".And it is not just Brexiteers who stand accused. Remainers and campaigners for a Peoplersquos Vote or a second referendum have been branded deluded and dangerous enemies of the people.Butwe have all taken leave of our senses, there may be a psychological explanation. And while research carried out in Scotland and published this week gives fresh insight into this collective act of self-harm, the original theories date back to the work of a Scottish journalist, poet and songwriter born  years ago and raised in an orphanage for Scots children in London.Charles Mackay is best remembered for his  book Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, which is still cited today as one of the earliest studies of how large numbers of people can participate in very bad decisions.So what is the Madness of Crowds Mackayrsquos three-volume work highlighted examples of mass hysteria, from economic booms and subsequent busts such as the South Sea Bubble to witch hunts and the popular expectation that alchemists might one day turn base metals into gold. It looked to explain why large populations or communities sometimes embrace irrational beliefs and ideas, often in defiance of a blindingly obvious reality.ldquoWe find that whole communities suddenly fix their minds upon one object and go mad in its pursuit, Mackay wrote. ldquoMillions of people become simultaneously impressed with one delusion and run after it, till their attention is caught by some new folly more captivating than the first.The theory has been much studied, including in a more recent work part inspired by Mackay, US journalist James Surowieckirsquos  book The Wisdom of Crowds, Why the Many are Smarter than the Few. Surowiecki argued that through sharing information, groups can make better collective decisions than any inidual within them could.But they canrsquot both be right The problem is there are good examples to support both theories, but we donrsquot know how or why \"collective wisdom sometimes works and sometimes goes badly wrong.That is why new research carried out at St Andrews University is so timely. It explains not only how collective madness can grip a population, leading to bad decisions, but also why the more complex the task, the more likely humans will act like animals, resorting to mimicry and \"groupthink\".According to lead author Wataru Toyokawa, postdoctoral research fellow at St Andrews University, the natural world can help explain a puzzle which has long troubled social scientists. \"Many people have studied how iniduals become more stupid when they behave collectively, he says. ldquoSeeking the opinion of others is normally beneficial,information gathering is good. We rely on that for the democratic process,\" he says. \"But it is a double-edged sword. Copying can be healthy butall the people are copying each other the system collapses.\"Along with Professor Kevin Laland of St Andrews School of Biology and PhD student Andrew Whalen, Toyokawa used an online experiment and population dynamics to explore the point at which the benefits of sharing information and collaborating to find solutions can tip over into a phenomenon known to psychologists as \"maladaptive herding\".Participants were given a iety of tasks and researchers discovered that the larger and more complex the task, the more likely people were to copy those around them, leading to poor decisions.\"With Brexit the task is very dficult because each inidual has dferent preferences, making it hard to reach consensus. In such a political situation, the danger is bad ideas can flourish,\" Toyokawa says.Whatrsquos happening to decision-making Over the years, research into Mackays ideas has consolidated around an understanding that conformity has a big influence on decision making. Soenough people believe leaving the EU will lead to a poundm idend for the NHS, or reduce overall migration rather than just the numbers coming from EU countries, others are likely to embrace the same ideas more readily, eventhey are irrational. This applies especiallythe suspect ideas chime with their own views or prejudices.Science writer Philip Ball is author of Critical Mass, which considers whether physics and chemistry can tell us as much about crowd behaviour as psychology and social science. This applies to physical crowds and traffic which can move about in ways which are similar to those of atoms in a confined space, he suggests, but can also apply to opinion formation.\"There is a large body of work highlighting the way that crowds can collectively make a good decision but can also reach a horrendously wrong one,\" he says.A good example is a \"guess the weight of the cake\" competition at a country fair. If people know what others have guessed there will often be a conformity effect, with people clustering their guesses close to one of those made earlier. But that earlier guess may be entirely wrong, distorting the outcome. Meanwhile, studies have found thatpeople guess \"blind\" in such a contest, averaging out their guesses usually provides a remarkably accurate estimate of the true answer. That is the wisdom of crowds.\"What this tells us is that once you start introducing interaction between people you are much more likely to find herding behaviour, reducing the chance of a good guess,\" Ball says.Social media and sophisticated online manipulation feed into the problemThe rise of the internet and social media has exacerbated the dangers, and polarised debate. This was perhaps seen most markedly in October  when the Supreme Court ruled against the UK Government, saying parliament should have a say over the triggering of Article .Newspapers suggested this was a clash between the courts and the populace, with the Daily Mail picturing the three judges who made the ruling, lined up like criminals mugshots, under the headline \"Enemies of the people\".This was the birth of the now widely-discussed view that any deviation from Brexit will be a betrayal of voters in the referendum. It was ridiculed by others as an extraordinary over-reaction to an entirely legitimate ruling from the English courts ndash which is where Brexiteers apparently want legal decisions to be made in future.Ball says. \"The questions now are about how these opinion dynamics play out when an overall bias in society can tilt things so markedly in one direction or another.\"Advertising does that but with social media you see it even more strongly. The echo chamber effect is huge, with people getting feedback from like-minded people. People repost ideas that tally with their own perceptions and fake news can spread like wildfire. Little things can set in train an avalanche effect.\"This is why we have representative democracy rather than plebiscites. If you dont have a robust system referenda are vulnerable because it only takes a small nudge to send people herding in a certain way.\"But it raises questions about how long democracy can continue to , he says, especially in light of the fact that many politicians have been slow to realise the game is changing.\"It isnt just huge billboards, it is the fact that a Cambridge Analytica can understand and predict the effects of targeting certain people, but they also know how to predict and manipulate them.Are we ants  Or bees In the insect world, the models for the wisdom of the crowd are creatures like ants and bees, both generally regarded as shining examples of collective decision-making. But bees have the edge, Toyokawa explains, and ants are more vulnerable to moments of \"madness\".\"Ants normally do very well. They copy and make very accurate decisions ndash for example when finding good food and a site for a nest. But sometimes a stupid ant can find a mediocre place. He or she may start advertising this option as good, and other ants react to that and follow.\"So the ants do really well when an environment is stable, but find it dferent to switch to a new environment. The honey bee generates collective intelligence very well, even in a changing environment.\"When the task is easy, humans behave more like a honey bee. When the group size increases and the task is dficult, we behave more like ants.\"Drting to the rightThis week Neil Basu, assistant commissioner of the politan Police, warned Brexit could lead to another surge in far-right extremist groups, views and actions. The Brexit vote itself was followed by a surge in racist attacks, he pointed out, claiming that leaving the EU with no deal would be very bad for policing.\"We saw a spike in hate crime after the referendum ndash thats never really receded. So theres always a possibility people are being radicalised by the kind of febrile atmosphere weve got at the moment,\" he explained.Toyokawa says group dynamics can explain how people on both sides are draw into face-offs in the street, or the heckling and harassment of politicians and journalists, when they would not otherwise be.\"Shouting in the street may affect other peoples decision-making ndash we dont know the answer to that. But the idea of maladaptive herding could certainly apply to demonstrations,\" the researcher says. \"People who might not usually get involved can end up copying the behaviour of others, just because they have seen there is a demo going on.\"This may be more a case of people being emboldened in their original views and prejudices, Ball says, as opposed to flocking mistakenly to bad ideas. \"There are ideas in some quarters such as the far right which are being played on and manipulated.\"Just as Donald Trump has to a degree legitimised racism in America,people see their views endorsed they can be emboldened.\"If people at the top say its OK to send out vans with messages on the side, there is the opportunity for people on the far right to manipulate the same sentiments. Im not sure you need a lot of psychology to explain that.\"And he warns that we can no longer ignore the increasing prevalence of such collective irrationality.\"We need to recognise these kind of dynamics in order to figure out what a democracy means and how it can operate in this networked age. Does it still have the same meaning \"The Madness of Crowds - three lessons from historyThe South Sea Bubble: Thousands of people invested in no-hope and sometimes fraudulent companies, in many cases losing their le savings.While encouraging people to invest in firms which promised profits from overseas trade which had little prospect of taking place, traders also engaged insider trading, while isions of the South Sea Company took money from those caught up in the speculation for wild projects ranging from paving the streets of London, digging for lead in Derbyshire and \"trading in hair\".The Dot Com Bubble: In the mid-s, investor fascination with the phenomenon known as the \"internet\" reached new peaks.

We are a very special unit and we assist operational colleagues on all manner of calls from locating missing people, searching for items such as weapons, evidence and drugs and helping control volatile or aggressive situations. “Despite the many changes in policing in the North East over the last  years, it is great that the dog unit has remained and developed.

We have been calling for more parking enforcement in Wick for a while now.\"High Street and Bridge Street are far too regularly packed with cars parked where they shouldnt be. Its an issue that has been raised time and time again by both drivers and pedestrians. Some people think they are above the rules and for too long theyve got away with it.\"He added: \"Under the current proposals Bridge Street and much of High Street will essentially become double yellows, meaning no parking at any time. This should also help stop the constant issue of people selfishly parking in areas like the Market Square.\"The parking bays there are intended only for those who are disabled badge holders but these rules are often ignored by people who just canrsquot be bothered walking.\"Councillor Sinclair said the order would give council officers the power to enforce parking restrictions once they receive the required training but, initially, existing enforcement staff would carry out the work.\"We should expect a much more regular presence than under the old system,\" he said. \"The discussions Irsquove had with the officer responsible for parking have been extremely encouraging.\"Having an enforcement officer in the town for regular and random visits is a great start butthe situation doesnrsquot improve we will still be pushing to get someone in this post locally to clamp down on rogue drivers.\"He explained that in Inverness several council employees have been trained to undertake parking enforcement duties as well as their day-to-day jobs. \"There is no reason why the same couldnrsquot be done up here. If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others. If this is approved, it will make a massive dference to the town centre, although there will always be some motorists who will take a chance and park there.\"However, Councillor Mackay has misgivings about the extent of the restrictions planned for other parts of Wick.Tuesday  Jan  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04119000/04119314.jpg","title":"Trailblazers on right path","story":"MEMBERS of Wick Paths Group joined forces with Friends of the John OGroats Trail to improve a path used by walkers visiting the Castle of Old Wick.They got stuck in to the task of upgrading the narrow, muddy and uneven section from the old rle range to the field at the Grey Bools.

Work is due to start this year, be completed by spring  and create  jobs during the construction phase.Councillor Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness on Highland Council, said: \"While Im keen to see an improvement to the north brae, I still believe we cant take our focus off the south brae.

Improvements to the north brae are very welcome and I hope that it is the start of a bigger vision to improve the entire Berriedale Braes.\"We can expect the standard lead-in period of about three months and for discussions to be held with the contractor on how they propose to physically approach the works and discussions with statutory bodies like the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds among others.\"He said that archaeological investigatory works have been completed.The award of the contract was also welcomed by Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce.She said: \"We are delighted to see that after many years of dedicated campaigning by the chamber, Caithness Transport Forum and other local organisations, this project is finally moving ahead. For too long, the Berriedale Braes has acted as a pinch point for travellers on the A north of Inverness, disrupting business and jeopardising investment in the region.\"It has been good to see other work on A improvements and repairs going to local companies in recent years, and we hope the principal contractor will engage closely with our highly skilled local supply chain as these works progress.\"Ms Morris added: \"Now that the contract has been formally awarded, we hope to see clarication on exact start dates and expectedof works very soon.

OIC Leader James Stockan has notied Ministers that the council will hand over responsibility for running the service to Transport Scotland, unless sufficient funding is provided.A year ago, a similar level of support was secured, after a y campaign by OIC for fair funding. Of this, £. million was allocated to fully fund Orkney’s internal ferry service during the current financial year, with £ million awarded to Shetland Islands Council for its ferry operations.“But this time there is no specic amount allocated to Orkney or Shetland. The government recognises that it will cost £. million to operate our ageing fleet of ferries during - — and that is what we are asking the government to provide.”OIC is also looking to the government to fund the replacement of the current inter-island fleet. The council has been working with the government on this for a number of years and is currently developing a business case setting out the service levels local communities require, and the engineering options needed to achieve these.Councillor Stockan added: “We would object in the strongest possible termswe end up with a reduction in our ferries funding. This would place a wholly disproportionate and unfair burden on the smallest council in Scotland and would mean us having to make cuts to other vital services.“The ferries are a leline for remote and fragile communities across our islands. Orkney has the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — an inequality we cannot address without proper financial support from the Scottish Government.We are calling on the government to take an honourable approach to fulfilling the will of the Scottish Parliament that we should receive fair and equitable funding for our inter-island ferry service. The principle of transferring Orkney’s internal ferry service to the Scottish Government, at no net detriment to OIC, has already been approved by the council. That is a route we will have to take unless we are provided with the funds to run the service over the year ahead.”For the full story, pick up a copy of The Orcadian, this Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The success of the Dingwall BID depends upon our local businessesrsquo support.ldquoWe are working hard to gather information from all the businesses in Dingwall and we need to hear from everyone. This is your chance to have your say and add to the overall business plan. Then all you have to do is vote yes in the ballot and we can make these projects happen.ldquoWe really want to make sure that nobody is missed and that everyone gets their opportunity to vote because this could be a monumental time in our townrsquos history. This could become the year when Dingwall businesses take control over the townrsquos economic future.Mr Murray said: ldquoWe are aware that there must be a decenton their investment. I believe Highland Council currently collect a wee bit more than pound million per annum from non-domestic ratepayers and Irsquove calculated that the levy would need to be between . to three per cent.ldquoThis would allow us to invoice the council for approximately pound,. Itrsquos also possible we would be able to almost match fund this figure from other sources. This would be an amazing amount banked in Dingwall to be spent on Dingwall. This is how we would fund the five-year plan ready to start after a yes vote.He wants remaining surveys, seeking feedback from businesses to a number of questions, ed by Friday, February .Survey results will then be collated with a five-year business plan set to be drafted by the end of March. A yes no vote on BID would then be held in May.Gordon McIntosh, practice manager of Munro  Noble, is a director of BID Inverness and believes the scheme can pay idends for Dingwall too.He said ldquocoach ambassadors had brought more tourists into the city, increasing spend. It meant local businesses were stakeholders in any centre development plans and have the ability to lobby the council over issues of interest. The scheme also paved the way for successful events such as classic car shows, Easter egg hunts and bar and business awards.He said: ldquoWith representatives from a cross section of businesses on the board the strong advocacy we have provided has achieved some notable results.

We have worked with local volunteers, school groups, young offenders, dementia groups, local walking groups and adult learners.In tune with the sustainable development ethos of the group, logs for Mags Wood build have been sourced locally and dragged to the site by Tarzan, a French-bred horse trained for forestry operations ndash and something of a visitor attraction in himself, hugely popular with the school groups who visit the site from time to time.The building project has been able to call on the expertise of local log building expert Henry Fosbrooke, project co-ordinator David Smith and a local volunteer, Don Fraser, who previously worked on the new Queensferry next to the Forth Road Bridge.Mr Harry said that such expertise ldquohas meant that all the measurements done are near perfect.The project has been funded by the Forestry Commission through a community grant amongst ious other sources.Mr Harry said: ldquoThis will be something special for the area and is involving many iniduals and groups in its building ndash truly a community project and something that will last a very, very long time.He is still hoping to find a supplier willing to help with the timber roof cladding required to complete the project, hopefully by the end of March. That would involve around  m x mm larch planks. The alternative will be to process locally sourced timber from the site.Anyone interested in becoming involved or who can help out can contact Simon Harry by email at simon.harry@forest-education or by calling  .Tuesday  Jan  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

This time it is whether or not the government’s motion on its Plan B for Brexit, up for discussion tomorrow, will be successfully altered by an amendment lodged by Labour Remainer Yvette Cooper. If passed the effect will be to give Parliament the power to bring forward a proposal to extend Article  for possibly three months – even until the end of this year.Whatever the outcome, the fact is thatthe UK is to leave the EU with a transitional arrangement then something needs to give for Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement to become acceptable or it will not be passed. With Parliament having invoked Article  of the Lisbon Treaty and passed the Withdrawal Act the existing law is simple. If there is no alternative procedure made law then the United Kingdom leaves at pm on  March and immediately becomes a sovereign country again, trading under World Trade Organisation rules rather than EU regulations on a supposed temporary basis.Last week was notable for a number of statements from all sides seeking to find agreement that might deliver the referendum result – even before Her Majesty suggested the importance of establishing common ground. First Brexiteers such as Jacob Rees-Mogg, Iain Duncan Smith and Boris Johnson, who have been appealing for the Prime Minister and her Cabinet to stick to past commitments, indicated they could be willing to support her Withdrawal Agreementshe can get the EU to time-limit or even delete the ‘backstop’. Given there is a great deal more wrong with the Prime Minister’s proposal than just the backstop this was a generous concession. Their real concern is that without finding some consensus Brexit will never happen. Yet, as the Irish Deputy Prime Minister, Simon Coveney, demonstrated on the Andrew Marr Show yesterday, a compromise on the backstop will not come from the Irish Republic. To win such a prize would therefore require the EU having to hang out Ireland – either by agreeing to previously dismissed technical solutions it has insisted are unworkable or by moving the ‘border’ to the continental mainland such as the ports of Calais and Zeebrugge . Irish politicians have every right to be worried about being hung out to dry following statements from the EU’s chief spokesman Margaritis Schinas and then its chief negotiator Michel Barnier. Schinas caught the Irish by surprise and set hares running by stating at a media briefing there would indeed be a “hard border” between the Republic and the UKno transition arrangement could be agreed. This was completely at odds with what EU Commission President Jean Claude Junker had said when last visiting Dublin. Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was then reported as suggesting a risk that the EU might choose to locate border checks away from the Irish border and to the French and Dutch ports, thus treating the UK and Ireland as a single block. For those believing it could never happen the example of Ireland and the UK being outside the Schengen Area and therefore sharing joint security and passport checks provides a dose of reality.Varadkar was not finished, for when pressed on the border issue later in Davos he claimed Irish police or even the army would have to man any hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. If the comment was designed to panic the UK government into concessions it was a misjudgment for the response was, as it has consistently been, that the UK would not install or operate any physical border infrastructure or controls. It is only the EU and Irish politicians who are now talking about physical infrastructure. What they misunderstandis not that Brexit-supporting Unionists say there will be no border, they say there is indeed a border already for many thingsbut it is essentially invisible and should remain so.If the UK ends up trading under WTO rules, using the past experience and already existing technology means we shall be able to work invisibly for trade, even including animals and foodstuffs, by managing any checks before and after the border – just as already happens in other parts of Europe. That Varadkar, Coveney, Barnier – and British politicians who support remain – cannot admit to recognising solutions exist, when an endless number of papers and articles have been produced showing how an invisible trade border can work, suggests they either choose to remain ignorant or are intentionally mendacious.What is also missed is that existing EU regulations are not impervious to fraud and deceit and cannot be bettered. Such arrogance and complacency was exposed as dangerously naïve during the  Irish horsemeat scandal, when some Irish-made burgers were found to have up to  per cent horsemeat in them when labelled as pure beef.The problem with Cooper’s amendment remains that delaying the departure date for Brexit will not in itself make arriving at an agreement on the border or other obstacles any more likely. MPs shall simply be taking the pressure off both themselves and the EU and end up with nothing much happening for the next three months – ing to a flurry of brinkmanship and suggested compromises as the clock ticks down again to pm on say,  June or even the end of December. We thus have two paradoxes. The first is how the backstop insisted upon by EU and Irish politicians to avoid an imagined hard border is now proving to be the most likely cause of the UK leaving the EU without a transition agreement – so a hard border is delivered. The second is that the approach of the last few days and hours of time left for negotiation – before the UK concedes there will be no agreement and WTO trading rules must be put in place as the expected outcome – is what is resulting in a drive by all parties to find a solution. Take the imperative of the clock ticking down removes the pressure to find a solution.Yvette Cooper’s amendment needs to be rejected and the focus of politicians on all sides shouldto improving the Withdrawal Agreement so that it becomes acceptable to all parties – or acknowledging it will indeed be a very bad deal the UK cannot work with and instead move to improve the circumstances for leaving the EU without a transition agreement.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4863716.1548690223!/image/image.jpg","title":"block london tube to secure indyref2 suggests former snp mp","story":"A rush hour blockade of London Underground stations could be staged as part of a \"civil disobedience\" campaign to push for a second independence referendum, a former SNP MP has said.George Kerevan, the former East Lothian MP, even says Holyrood could be declare itself a \"sovereign assembly\"another independence majority is secured,in a blog for the Bella Caledonia website.Westminster has control over the constitution in the UK and Theresa May has already rejected calls for Nicola Sturgeons calls for a section  order to hold a fresh vote on the leaving the UK in light of Brexit.\u2028\"It is certain – in the current Brexit crisis – that the Tory government in London will refuse to agree a fresh referendum and veto a new Section  Order,\" he states.\"This refusal must be met by a phased escalation of public civil disobedience and Westminster parliamentary obstruction by SNP MPs.

which will keep the UK tied to EU regulationsa trade deal has not been agreed by the end of  - must be changed.Earlier, Downing Street said the Prime Minister was “absolutely committed” to leaving the EU with a deal on  March, but added: “Clearlywe are to obtain parliamentary support for that deal some changes are going to have to be made.”: Vote on Brexit ‘plan Bs’ could lead to deeper deadlock - Paris GourtsoyannisBut European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas told reporters in Brussels that the Withdrawal Agreement was “endorsed by leaders and is not open for renegotiation”.Commission vice-president Jyrki Kateinen said it would be “a stupid thing” for the EU to make concessions putting the remaining  members at a disadvantage simply to secure a deal.Mr Kateinen said there was “no reason to give any concessions” to the UK and there was “not much room for manoeuvre” on the backstop.Chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier’s deputy Sabine Weyand said it was “quite a challenge” to see how a majority in support of a deal could be constructed in Westminster, warning there was a high risk of the UK crashing out by accident.: EU nationals in Scotland face ‘unacceptable’ hurdles when applying for residencyMs Weyand told a Brussels conference that negotiation on the Withdrawal Agreement was “finished”.Dismissing calls for changes to the backstop as “like Groundhog Day”, she insisted the EU were unanimous in opposing any time limit.Downing Street confirmed the Prime Minister will take her plan back to the Commons for a second “meaningful vote” as soon as possible after Tuesday’s debate, whether or not she secures more concessions from Brussels.Following two more days of debate in the Commons, a second vote on the deal is likely to take place on  February - six weeks before the UK leaves the EU.Mr Brady said his amendment would give Mrs May “enormous firepower”it is passed.The DUP - which props up the government - is still to reveal how it will vote on the amendment, but yesterday backed the Prime Minister in trying to “face down the stubbornness of Dublin and Brussels”.There are also doubts over whether the Brady amendment will win the support of Tory Eurosceptic rebels in the European Research Group .Senior Brexiteer Sir Bernard Jenkin said it was “deliberately vague because it’s meant to mean dferent things to dferent people”, while former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith was reported to have called on Mrs May to table her own amendment to provide greater “clarity and purpose”.ERG chairman Jacob Rees-Mogg said the amendment was “just an expression of opinion” and warned there was “no appetite in ERG to support it as a stand-alone motion”.In Monday’s meeting, Mrs May was cheered after being questioned by Boris Johnson, who asked how the Brady amendment would bring about meaningful change to the Brexit deal.“She basically said, we won’t know unless you support us Boris,” Tory MP Simon Hart said.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4863795.1548695858!/image/image.jpg","title":"eu nationals in scotland face unacceptable hurdles when applying for residency","story":"EU nationals living in Scotland face #unacceptable# hurdles when applying for settled status in the UK post-Brexit, politicians and campaigners have warned.Under current UK Government plans some . million people who hold passports for other EU nations, and have lived continuously in the UK for five years or more, can apply for “settled status” to remain in the country beyond .But the registration scheme has faced criticism after it was reported the first step of the application process involves downloading an app to confirm an inidual’s passport details compatible only with Android smartphones.

It was quite a few weeks of tough and not very successful work, but eventually it paid off.”He added: “It is such an honour to be the first person to read Andrew Fuller’s sermons and to allow people to get an insight into this incredible man and the amazing stories he has to share.“I’m excited to continue working on the vast collection of work that he has left to us, in the hope that we can understand more about his thinking and how this developed throughout his ministry.”The breakthrough came after Dr Steve Holmes, head of the School of Divinity at the university, found a shorthand document with the heading in longhand in the archive of Bristol Baptist College, which holds hundreds of pages of Fuller’s sermons. Dr Holmes found one headed in longhand “Confessions of Faith, Oct.  ” with the rest of the document in shorthand.Knowing this was the date of Fuller’s induction into the pastorate of a church in Kettering and that he would have been required to give a confession of faith, Dr Holmes wondereda copy of the confession printed in a biography might help him.After discovering the two texts were the same, Dr Holmes recruited Mr Woods through the university’s undergraduate research assistant scheme to help.After a few weeks, the student was able to translate the shorthand using the longhand version as a kind of Rosetta stone, allowing him to read two of the most historically signicant sermons from the collection.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"minister hears plea for debts to be written off","story":"Locum costs, hospital bed closures because of staffing shortages and staff retention were among the issues discussed at NHS Shetland#s annual review meeting.The Scottish government#s mental health minister Clare Haughey was attending the meeting, which was held on Monday afternoon.It came after NHS Shetland was forced to close six beds at the Gilbert Bain Hospital because of a recruitment shortfall.Director of nursing Kathleen Carolan said she hoped to have the shortage addressed within three months.Ms Haughey#s visit came after the crippling costs of travel and accommodation connected to locum medical cover was highlighted late last year.During the meeting she was challenged by Shetland integration joint board vice-chairman Allison Duncan.He warned that Shetland had spent £ million on locum cover over  months.#We already know that other local authorities like Dundee and other NHS debts are going to be written off.

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/INDOOR-SHINTY-19-P4-7-FINAL-2.jpg","title":"skye schools indoor shinty competition all the action in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYoung shinty players fromthroughout Skye gathered to take part in two indoor tournaments for primary school teams last weekend.Portree High’s Fingal Centre hosted competitions for P-P and for P-and-under teams.On a fast and furious day of excellent shinty action teams fromBun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Phort Rìgh won both competitions.Broadford were runners up in the P- competition, with North West taking second spot in the P-under tournament following an epic final."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/visitor-web.jpg","title":"skye charities work to be showcased at skeabost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA multi-charity event will be held in Skeabost on Saturdayto highlight the work of several good causes across Skye.The event will be held at Skeabost Memorial Hall from  am until  pm and will provide information on the work carried out by a iety of charities in the area, as well as insight into the costs and challenges they face.to raise awareness of the event, which will support Skye and Lochalsh Young Carers the Skye and Lochalsh Foodbank Crossroads Care # Skye and Lochalsh Macmillan Cancer Support Skye Dance Bloodwise, and Rotjanas Hands, which Mr Williams set up with his we nearly  years ago.He said: “I have been an independent fundraiser for many years – I am a trustee of Rotjanas Hands – formally known as Hands Across the Water – which I set up alongside my we following the Indonesian Tsunami .”He added: “For me, it has always been important to share particularly when we are so fortunate and others not so.

An entrepreneur and pioneer in his field, Sir William, despite his worldwide success, has never forgotten his strong ties to Ballymena.“His vision and dedication has put our borough firmly on the map as an area of manufacturing excellence and innovation.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council agreed to bestow the Honorary Freedom of the Borough of Mid and East Antrim on the Wrightbus founder in February . It followed a motion proposed by the previous Mayor, Councillor Paul Reid, and seconded by Councillor Audrey Wales MBE.Among those who paid special tributes to Sir William was former Mayor of Ballymena, P.J.

Further tributes came from North Antrim MP, Ian Paisley who remarked on Sir William’s political activism at a time when many in the business community ‘kept their heads below the parapet’. And he recalled nights in the harsh days of the troubles when his late father would receive ‘phone calls from the man he codenamed ‘Ahoghill’. Mr. Paisley said Sir William was a rare breed in today’s society: “He is a character. If anyone wants to see what makes a real Ballymena man they need only look at Sir William Wright.” Lauren Christie, speaking on behalf of the extended Wright family, thanked all who attended for the honour conferred on her grandfather and paid special tribute to Mrs. Ruby Wright, who, she described as ‘the great woman behind the great man’.

Alderman Elizabeth Ingram and Councillor Glenn Barr represented the council at the event. Special Guest, Mrs Dorothy McCann and some members from the Breffni, Clonnalen and ‘’ clubs were also present. The chairman, Caroline McCreight, welcomed all present and gave guests a brief history of Rathfriland Bridge Club. It started out as a six week ‘course’ in Bridge, organised by the Rathfriland Women’s Institute. At the end of the six weeks, the ladies decided to invite husbands and friends to join them and form a Bridge Club.For the first year the club met in the Old Young Farmer’s Club hall, but as the number of members grew, it was decided to move to the Old George Hotel and the club has remained there ever since. Dr George McCann, formerly a well known Rathfriland resident, took a great interest in the club and donated a trophy, which is still awarded every year. The chairman said the club had always appreciated the support he had shown and enjoyed his visits, when he came each year with his we, Dorothy, to present the trophy. She thanked Mrs Dorothy McCann and presented her with a bunch of flowers.Thanks too were given to Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council for the funding Rathfriland Bridge Club had received recently from the council, for the purchase of new tables and bidding boxes. These were on display for guests to see. Patricia Devlin, from Abbey Projects, was thanked too, for her help in completing the grant application to the council and she also received a gt in appreciation. The Lord Mayor Cllr Darryn Causby hadn’t been able to attend the reception, but had sent a cheque from the council for the charity, Southern Area Hospice.After the very enjoyable finger buffet provided by The Old George Hotel, the card players moved upstairs to play Bridge. A table charge, raffle and donations from guests at the reception, together with the cheque from the Lord Mayor raised a total of £ for Southern Area Hospice.Chinook crash widows angry at PSNI ‘indference’ on files Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"The winners out of the  tables of Bridge players were as follows:North   South: st: Dorothy O’Reilly and Shiela Warde nd: Margaret McConville and Peter McConville rd: Kathy Dorgan and Jean Pollock th: Maude Harbinson and Bessie Shannon.East   West: st: Susan Scott and Tom Cromie nd: Muriel Ferguson and Agnes O’Rourke rd: Moya McKay and Anne Marie McLaughlin th: Colm Clarke and Marius McHugh."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8781919.1548265986!/image/image.jpg","title":"rathfriland yfc hold meeting","story":"Recently Rathfriland YFC held their Annual General Meeting chaired by Benjamin Allen from Collone YFC.The club would like to thank all outgoing office bearers and committee members for their dedication and effort over the year and congratulate the following club members on taking up their new roles mid April within the club committee.Rathfriland YFC held their Annual General Meeting.

But, after representations from his solicitor, it was agreed that the fine would be waived when it was learned that no tax book had been available for the vehicle.He was held for an hour and a half in Dunmurry and was released when a relative arrived and paid the fine.The RUC men – one of whom was in plain clothes – had arrived in the area in a red Vauxhall car without markings.One Twinbrook resident said later: “So much for the RUC’s concern about the peace talks. They wouldn’t have done that sort of thing before the ceasefire.”Order is expected soon for new IRA ceasefireA NEW ceasefire order is expected to be issued to all IRA units within the next  hours. But a formal announcement by the Republican Army Council is not expected until early next week.The decision to order a ceasefire came after a second round of talks between senior Stormont and republican officials at a secret venue about five miles from Belfast on Wednesday night.In a statement issued late on Wednesday Britain’s supremo here, Merlyn Rees, said: “I am sure that the people of Northern Ireland would wish to see effective arrangements made to ensure that the ceasefire did not break down. I attach very great importance to this, and practical arrangements would be necessary.”Republican leaders are now believed to regard this as a sufficient gesture to allow them to order another ceasefire.But it is believed that they will want meaningful talks on a number of issues shortly after their ceasefire is publicly announced. Another reason why a new ceasefire is possible has been the low profile approach adopted by the British Army since the shock announcement last week that the truce was off.A key factor in the decision to call off the Christmas ceasefire was the behaviour of British units in Belfast and several rural areas where they stepped up their activity to take advantage of the ceasefire.British leaders in London are known to have been surprised at the IRA decision and there has been speculation that advice from their military leaders – who had claimed that the IRA ceasefire was certain to continue because the IRA was beaten – is now being ignored by Westminster leaders.British Premier Wilson is said to have been furious that the much-vaunted military intelligence network in Ireland was totally unaware that the ceasefire was in danger.And parallels are being drawn between the military intelligence blunder of last week and similar blunders before Internment Day and Operation Motorman – when politicians were advised that both moves would “help solve the Irish question”. IN a front page article in the Sunday World this week reporter John Keane disclosed that the , political prisoners in the Long Kesh internment camp are being held in huts which would be regarded by the EEC farming officials as unsuitable for pighouses.AdvertisementsHUNTING LODGEScotch from £.Vodka from £.Gin from £.Double litre Italian wine £.Full range of winesCans Skol p  doz Packs Lager pBrandy from £.Hennessy Brandy at £.Plus an extensive range of LiquersLámh Dearg GAC Social Club Behind Watters old pub at the top of Hannahstown Hill.A great night of singing and dancing on Sunday.ROMANOSSaturday  January - – From the top of the charts KENNYSaturday  February GLITTER BAND."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"our playground was upton cottages and arizona street","story":"IN March , an ‘Arizona Street and Upton Cottages reunion party’ was held in the Glenowen. It was a great event, with fantastic music provided by the McCourt brothers, and some equally impressive socialising done by the McKays, McDonalds, Quinns, McAteers, Pattersons, Monaghans, Lintons# and plenty of others, including a couple of Deedses.The oldest party-goer was Mrs Sheila Deane, at a brave  years of age. I got speaking to MrsDeane that night and as always, she had a smile on her face and was in good spirits. Sadly, MrsDeane passed away on January this year.The street was our playground growing up in Arizona Street Upton Cottage in the ‘s and ‘s. We were never in. While our parents probably appreciated this, I’m not sure that all of the older residents enjoyed the noise and occasional nuisance as much. Some of our older neighbours when passing might have greeted us young ones with no more than a scowl, a grunt, or even worse . Mrs Deane however, was friendly and approachable every time you saw her. Uniquely as well, she always remembered my name. My brothers and I were very good friends with MrsDeane’s grandsons Neil, David and Mark, just down the street. Every night since I can remember, their dad Seamus made the short trek up the street past our house to visit his mum in the cottages. I spoke to Seamus recently and he kindly shared some of his own, earlier childhood memories of our wee street.Mr and Mrs Deane moved in to number  Upton Cottages on the Glen Road in , and at that time the street was still not too dissimilar from the way it looked when the houses were first built. Upton Cottages first appears in Belfast Street directories in , when they formed the only small terrace resembling a street anywhere in West Belfast beyond the Falls Road. At that time, and for almost another  years, the area beyond Upton Cottages marked the start of the country, and there was very little to be found after it going up the Glen Road apart from farms and fields. The single-sided Arizona Driveappears in the street directories for the first time in , with the opposite side and new name of Arizona Street listed the following year. Several other homes of ying size soon began to spring up along the Glen Road around the growing parish of St Teresa’s. Gransha and Andersonstown estates followed shortly after and the whole area became much less rural in character. One former resident of Woodland House on the Upper Springfield Road remembered walking down the Turf Loney to go to Sunday school on the Glen Road in the s, only to be chased back across the stream at Upton Cottages for being ‘country children’!Still, in  the area was unrecognisable from how it looks today. Beyond the cottages was all fields going right up from the Falls to Hannahstown Hill. Before Turf Lodge was built to meet the rapidly increasing demand for social housing in West Belfast, Seamus Deane remembers playing from dawn to dusk in the meadows there throughout his childhood. Arizona Street, Seamus recalls, was still only three quarters built in the ‘s. In fact, the house that I grew up in near the top, and any others after number , were built around a decade later. These were known as the ‘corporation houses’, having been appended to the existing houses by the council in the ‘s. In the s Sheila Deane and her family looked out at a single four bedroom house – number  Upton Cottages and the first on that side – beside which was Sherf’s timber yard . Both sites would later be taken up by McErlean’s Bakery that employed generations of the area’s youth. Before the bakery was built however, long piles of timber from Sherf’s yard lay in the field between the Deanes’ house and the bottom half of Arizona Street. The vacant ground beside it, part of which would one day become our back garden, was the site of the annual bonfire. According to one older resident, there had been an orchard there in even earlier times. Geraldine Mallonwho told me this was someone I was heart scared of as a child. She and the neighbour facing her, Jim Butler, were tortured by us kids kicking balls and hitting sliotars around their doors. And they were never too slow in coming out to tell us to take them away to hell’s gates. Ironically, both Jim and Geraldine became good neighbours of mine when I got older and moved in beside them, and we stayed friendly until they passed away in recent years.Other former residents of Upton Cottages include members of the RIC, a private in the Free State Army and two soldiers who lost their lives in the First World War, one of whom is among the Canadian Infantry buried in the City Cemetery.And the street keeps changing. Like so many other families, MrsDeane’s children and grandchildren are scattered near and far. Her sons Paul and Seamus continued to make their daily pilgrimage up our street back home to see their mum until her final days. This special lady won’t be forgotten, nor will our memories of a grand wee community – one of the last of its kind – that has spread out across our beautul former meadows from the Falls to Hannahstown, and further afield."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"toibin to host new party belfast meeting","story":"FORMER Sinn Féin TD Peadar Tóibín has said that his new party hopes to select candidates for the North’s upcoming Council elections by early February.The Meath TD left Sinn Féin in November over the party’s decision to back legislation allowing for abortion.The as yet unnamed party is set to host a meeting at the Malone Lodge in Belfast this Monday with a view to setting up local branches.Speaking to the Daily Belfast ahead of the meeting, Mr Tóibín said it was not his intention to “clip the ear off” Sinn Féin based on his past experience, but rather to build a “broader” republican party.“I believe over the last year that Sinn Féin has narrowed its ideological space, both economically and socially,” he said.“It has flipped its policy on a number of social issues. In , the party would have been openly pro-le. In , they’ve gone the opposite direction.“I also battled internally for the last two years to make sure I could be part of the Oireachtas team on an equal basis, but because I had a dference of opinion on the issue of abortion that just wasn’t allowed. I wasn’t given the chance to equally participate in the organisation.“For example, the leadership of Sinn Féin, Michelle O’Neill and Mary Lou, went to London recently and asked Westminster to legislate on three separate areas for the North of Ireland – that’s unheard of in republican terms. For  years republicans have tried to stop them legislating on Ireland.”He continued: “The party is also caught in a way in that it wants to reach middle-Ireland more, maybe looking at winning seats in leafy liberal Dublinit can, reaching out to the media too, but there is a big danger that it will lose its grassroots base. I think the Presidential campaign was an example of where the grassroots became so disempowered that they didn’t come out for the organisation.”Mr Tóibín insists that Sinn Féin, the SDLP, Fianna Fáil, and Labour have positioned themselves on the same space, and that his party hopes to attract disillusioned members. Asked about his party’s policies, beyond being pro-le, Mr Tóibín said: “We are for the unity of the Irish people North and South and we will be reaching out the hand of friendship to people from a Protestant background, people who wouldn’t have been able to vote for Sinn Féin in the past, for many reasons. “We’ll also be reaching out to people who believe that the Tories have made such balderdash of Brexit, and have had their rights to self-determination taken away with regards to remaining in the EU. For us, economic justice issues are very important. Right now we have people in the North who are in food poverty, housing poverty, health poverty and yet we have stalemate at Stormont.”He contined: “We need the governments to institute joint authority in the North. We also need to make sure that there is serious work done on the All-Ireland economy. It was sold to us as part of the Good Friday Agreement, but it had fallen off the agenda for many political parties. It will be one of the greatest tools toameliorate the effects of Brexit. “Another point, and I think, Sinn Féin have been remiss on this, we want an independence referendum, but we can start to deconstruct the border in the meantime. “The border is made up of thousands of dferent bricks, which stand for a practical experience in someone’s le. It could be a cross-border ambulance service, a cross-border health service, cross-border education, or corporation tax – a cross-border soccer team. Every time we fix those issues, we create convergence North and South, we improve the delivery of services and the quality of le for people, and the height of the border starts to reduce in height.”Mr Tóibín has said his party hopes to stand between  to  candidates across Ireland, and has already attracted nine elected councillors. Asked about the number of candidates standing in Belfast, Mr Tóibín said: “We won’t get into the micro details just yet. Hundreds of people are joining us on a weekly basis. New cumainn are being set up around the country, and we have new cumainn that will be set up in Belfast. “We want to make sure that we are an activist based grassroots organisation. If we get that infrastructure set up around the six counties then we hope to be selecting candidates by early February in places we believe we can win seats.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Screen-Shot-2019-01-24-at-16.25.07.png","title":"womens place in national debate","story":"LAST year was a year to remember for women’s rights. ‘Me Too’ was a phrase heard around the globe as artists in many spheres made sexual harassment, abuse and discrimination visible. It was a lesson that went way beyond the arts.The referendum on the th Amendment to the Irish constitution made the experience of women visible in multiple ways. It was not merely about the personal heartbreak of inidual women, it was also about systemic oppression of Irish women and children, and reached into the earth of Tuam, County Galway, where babies’ bodies had been buried in an unconsecrated septic tank by nuns and priests.It was the year that celebrated  years of some women’s franchise and paid homage to suffragettes and the first woman MP, Constance Markievitz.With the election of Clare Bailey as leader of the Green Party we now have women leaders of four of the six mainparties. In many ways it all seemed seminal. That women’s agendas could no longer be ignored. However, we are all too aware of its limitations too. The words ‘The North is Next’ regarding access to full choices in pregnancy clearly require the addition of ‘at some point’.Women’s participation in politics, while improving, remains poor. In the forthcoming council election watch how many women are standing in winnable seats and watch which parties do what. A fair enough group photo of gender balance announcing candidates is often at quite a distance from the elected officials’ photograph afterwards.Just as in , contemporary strides on women’s rights need to be carefully looked after in the years to come. While Cumann na mBan and feminism were integral to the operation of the First Dáil and the appropriation of public le during the Tan War, what we witnessed afterwards was an assault on women’s rights, from the constitution to the maternity ward afterwards. In the north the oppression of women went hand in glove with the oppression of the nationalist population in the right wing statelet.Right now, there is a conversation happening about what a new Ireland might look like. The conversation focuses on constitutional rights, economic interests and demographics. Campaigns feed into it with social and cultural rights featuring intermittently.What we have failed to do is insert the vibrant and rich debate last year on women’s rights into this national debate in the meaningful way. For instance, women who cannot be equal participants in our society because their citizenship and culture are denied to them are doubly oppressed as women are unequal participants in so many avenues of le.Just as in - when Irish suffragettes gave expression to their fight for self-determination being linked to their country’s fight for self-determination, we need to seek out space and language for a modern Irish women’s vision. Indeed, in those years Irish suffragettes’ colours were not purple white and green – they were orange, white and green. It was a bold statement of intent: that women would not be written out of the Proclamation or a new Ireland.That new Ireland was never realised with the imposition of partition. Specic attention must now be paid to women’s participation, needs and aspirations as we build our new vision for a transformed Ireland."},{"url":null,"title":"dup must see the benefits of mays brexit deal northern irish groups urge","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

As a young Provisional IRA member you bombed Derry into the ground in the s. What is your response to the recent New IRA attack on the citys courthouse  https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland exira-bomber-who-got--le-sentences-has-words-of-advice-for-young-dissidents-.htmlhttps:www.belfasttelegraph le features article.ece d AUTOCROP h --_l__I.JPGEmailQ. As a young Provisional IRA member you bombed Derry into the ground in the s. What is your response to the recent New IRA attack on the citys courthouse .pushA. It makes me incredibly sad that another generation of young men and women are going down that path. There will be older people mentoring them who are exploiting them. I believe they are cannon fodder for a leadership that will use them.It is reckless revisiting violence. The nationalist community in Derry, who have suffered so much and have gained nothing from the peace process, deserve better than starting this endless cycle all over again.Nobody was killed this time but planting bombs inevitably leads to injuries and deaths. I would say to young dissidents that you lose a universe by taking le, and dont gain a single speck of territory. If you go down this route, you end up a civil and human rights abuser.Q. Given your past history, theyll say youre a hypocrite.A. Well, Ive publicly condemned all my own past activities. Ive apologised to my victims and worked tirelessly to try to convince paramilitaries to give up violence.Q. Are todays dissident republican groups any dferent from the IRA you belonged to A. No, theyre not. Just as that IRA was no dferent to the one that fought the War of Independence and the Irish Civil War. I suppose the only dference between the dissidents and the Provos is that so far the dissidents havent chained anyone to a bomb.Q. Why do you think dissident republican groups in Derry can attract members  years after the IRA ceasefire A. One reason is anger at the corruption in the Provisional IRA which has seen some leaders get rich and run businesses not through their own graft.There has also been a failure to deliver anything to the west bank of Derry in terms of jobs, a motorway and a proper railway line. But the British presence in Northern Ireland remains the main driving force for dissidents, its certainly not Brexit.Q. Tell me about your family background.A. I was born in , the second youngest of eight children. We were a middle-class family. My father was a school teacher and my mother came from a prominent business family. We lived in a Georgian terrace in what would be regarded as a snobby street.There was some history of republicanism on my fathers side but we were definitely not a republican family.Q. So why did you join the IRA A. As a boy I devoured books on Irish history in my fathers library. I found  and Pearse and Connolly particularly spellbinding. I wrote a pledge on a sheet of paper when I was  vowing to \"fight andnecessary die for Irelands freedom\". I hid it under the floor boards. Years later when I was arrested the police brought me this yellowed strip of paper and I was deeply embarrassed.My actual joining, though, was very spur of the moment. I was walking home from school and a friend said he was doing it the next day and askedI wanted to. I said I would. A rapid decision that had horrendous consequences. I was  years old, and I think the use of child soldiers by the IRA, or any army, is immoral.Q. What did you do as a young IRA member A. I learned to make incendiaries with condoms, acid and other chemicals. I didnt even know the real purpose of condoms. I thought they actually were intended for incendiary devices.I burned down shops. Myself and others took on Army patrols with handguns. It was crazy.Q. Did you have any doubts about what you were doing A. I fell away from the IRA for a bit, but Bloody Sundayhappened a week after my th birthday and it brought me back. I was with a friend, dawdling along like at any other civil rights march, looking at the girls from Thornhill College. Then the Paras started shooting.Bodies of civilians were lying on the ground. I ran like the blazes and hid behind a wall. I went with a priest to the morgue at Altnagelvin Hospital. Senior Army and police officers were laughing and joking about the dead outside. I thought Id rather be lying on a mortuary slab for doing something than for doing nothing.Q. But the IRA wouldnt take you back A. They had so many adults they didnt need me. I was being hassled by the British Army and I moved down South. I wanted back into the IRA. I went to see Martin McGuinness who was being held in the Bridewell . I had red hair and I pretended to be his younger brother to get in. I told him: \"I want to go back to the North to rock and roll.\" He said: \"Away you go.\"Q. What was the young Martin McGuinness like A. He was very idealistic, and a straight-up character who didnt drink or smoke. He was extremely shy. People laughed when he got his first girlfriend, Bernie. On a personal level, I liked him.I find it very hard to reconcile that Martin with the one who sanctioned human bombs, the torture of informers, the murder of census collector Joanne Mathers and many other atrocities.He served only two very brief prison sentences. I think it would have been better had he done a long stretch in jail. That causes people to reflect. Guys who did time confront what they did. Theyre not in denial.Martin told lies too. He was active on Bloody Sunday. He did not leave the IRA in . Im tremendously sorry that he never managed to be reconciled to his victims. Right up until the end he had the chance to tell the truth about atrocities like Claudy and to clear his conscience. He chose not to.Q. Back in IRA ranks, what did you do A. I tried shooting but I wasnt much good at it. I was great with explosives and not a lot of people wanted to work in that area given the risks. I bombed shops, banks, and police stations.I developed the letter bomb in . Id seen an article in The Sunday Times about how the PLO used them. I actually blew myself up in a house in the Creggan - went right through the window and into the garden. I damaged my eye and a finger.I was treated in a Dublin hospital. When I was there Martin visited and introduced me to the IRA GHQ figure in charge of bombing England. They said they wanted me to go to London. Hugh Feeney, Gerry Kelly and the Price sisters had just been captured after bombing the Old Bailey.Q. Tell me about bombing England.A. I sent dozens and dozens of letter bombs. To Downing Street, the Bank of England, the Stock Exchange, judges, generals, and the Home Secretary Reginald Maudling, whom I held responsible for Bloody Sunday. He was injured opening it. This was the politics of revenge. An eye for an eye.Q. How do you view those actions now A. With horror. I was arrested and charged in  and at my trial those who were injured made statements.I had never considered that some of my targets mightnt open the letters, that secretaries would. An Irish woman in the British embassy in Washington lost a hand. Other people were blinded.I apologised in court to the \"innocent working-class victims who were accidentally injured\".I think it was the first time an IRA man had done this.But what I am most ashamed of was planting a bomb in an Oxford Street shop. I had phoned a warning to police twice but they didnt take it seriously and told me to \"f*** off\". I should have gone back to the store and cleared out the customers. I didnt. It could have been an atrocity.Q. Describe how your views on violence changed.A. It wasnt a road to Damascus conversion, it was much more gradual. I had doubts back in Derry and Id voted for the  IRA ceasefire. But it was a Jesuit priest in Wormwood Scrubs who changed my le. He was known as an anti-Irish bigot and we were always arguing. During one big row I said to him: \"Wheres the proof your God exists \" He gave me a copy of the Bible. Reading the four gospels about JCchanged my le. The holy fear of God blew me away.Eddie Dalysent me a book about a former SAS soldier who discovered Padre Pio and that affected me too. I repented.Q. What did your religious conversion lead you to do A. I wrote to my victims to apologise. Some of them gave those letters to the News of the World and I was all over the media. In  I sent a letter to Republican News saying the armed struggle was immoral. I said the war should be ended in favour of democratic politics. They refused to print it but Eddie Daly gave it to the Derry Journal, who did.It was a very big step for an IRA member to take. There was one IRA figure on the wing who wanted me killed in my cell.Q. How long were you in jail A. I received  le sentences plus  years. I spent  years in jail in England. One of the most positive experiences there was meeting some of the Birmingham Six and Guildford Four.They were very down and didnt know how to campaign to prove their innocence. I helped them write letters to the media. I put them in touch with the solicitor Gareth Peirce.In  I was repatriated to Northern Ireland where I spent four years in jail. I was sent to Long Kesh, where I refused to go onto the IRA wing. I didnt want to live under paramilitary control.I was put in with sex offenders, but I think I was an example to lots of other prisoners and soon the wing was full of both republican and loyalist conforming prisoners. We were eventually moved to Maghaberry.Q. Tell me about le after jail.A. I went to study English at Trinity College Dublin. I later did an MSc in computer science. In  I married Michelle Sweeney, a student from Chicago I had met at Trinity.I got a job in computer software. I also edited the Big Issue and worked with the homeless. Michelle got a job in the US and moved back there. I tried to join her but I couldnt get a visa because of my IRA record.Id been in and out of the US for years, but after   everything changed. Michelle sought a orce and the marriage was later annulled.Q. What did you do after that A. I worked in Stockholm in IT and earned great money, but I wanted toto Dublin. I believed I had a vocation to become a priest and entered Maynooth in , but I left two years later.I ed to working with a homeless service dealing with drug and heroin addictions.In  I married Suzie Sweeney, a Scots woman who was a medical practice manager in Co Westmeath.Two years ago I decided to give up my job in the homeless sector to work on faith issues. Suzie did the same. We lived in Roscommon for a while, but now we move around. We are currently based in Spain.I give talks about my le story and repentance to students on behalf of a Spanish charity whose patron is tennis star Rafael Nadal.Q. In a  RTE interview, while continuing to oppose \"armed struggle\", you voiced strong republican views against partition and spoke of \"the territorial integrity of Ireland\". You said you didnt vote Sinn Fein but expressed admiration for those in the party who \"risked their lives to bring peace\". You now oppose republican politics and denounce Sinn Fein. Why have your opinions changed A. Ive outgrown the territory argument of republicanism. Its a very powerful one but I think politics should be about uniting hearts and minds, not a piece of land. John Hume nailed it a long time ago.I was a strong supporter of the peace process and gave Sinn Fein the benefit of the doubt. I became very disillusioned with them when they pulled out of Stormont. They continue to stay out at a time nationalists most need a voice.Also, I made a programme for RTE which led families of people killed in IRA bombs to approach me seeking help. I was shocked to find Sinn Fein was doing nothing for them. I think Id been fooled into believing they would give victims the restitution of truth.The Volunteer: A Former IRA Mans True Story by Shane Paul ODoherty, Strategic Book Publishing  Rights Agency, £."},{"url":null,"title":"extradition hearing told of fabricated evidence against bomb suspect","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

the extradition hearing.Downey’s barrister Garnet Orange SC, said the claims emerged during disclosure proceedings at his trial for the IRA’s Hyde Park bombing which collapsed in controversy four years ago.Downey was detained on an unrelated matter in the Republic of Ireland last October under a European arrest warrant.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  John Downey arrives for an extradition hearing In , Downey was charged with murdering four Royal Household Cavalrymen in a bomb in London’s Hyde Park in .He stood trial at the Old Bailey, but the case dramatically collapsed after it was revealed he had received a written assurance from former prime minister Tony Blair’s government that he was not actively wanted by the authorities.The letter was issued under the terms of the controversial On The Runsscheme.Mr Downey has always denied any involvement in the Hyde Park attack.During Monday’s hearing, Mr Orange said there were “credible attempts” to “fabricate visual identication evidence” in relation to the  offences.The court was told that members of An Garda Siochana “unlawfully” removed pictures of Downey from his home and passed them to the authorities in the UK.These pictures, Mr Orange said, were used to create an image of Downey as a suspect in the Hyde Park bombing.Mr Orange said: “It appears from the information given to my client that the image in question was generated from a picture of my client which was taken from his house before  in the course of the raid by the gardai.”Last year, Northern Ireland’s Public Prosecution Service initiated extradition proceedings after determining it had sufficient evidence to charge him with the murders of Lance Corporal Alfred Johnston, , and Private James Eames, , in a car bomb attack in Enniskillen,

fingerprints “without legal justication” which were then sent to the UK authorities. “That is a clear breach of his rights,” he added.“Gardai took his fingerprints without his consent, retained them without his consent or any legal justication.”Downey’s barrister said his client is now subject to the extradition proceedings because of the same “catastrophic failure”.“The irony at this stage is that the very people who contributed to the failure are the very people who are bringing this application for extradition,” he added.“The UK authorities are having a second bite of the same cherry.”He also made an appeal to Ms Justice Aileen Donnelly to not proceed with the case until after March  when Brexit matters have been claried.Remy Farrell, barrister for the State, said however that Downey’s counsel did not identy how his client would be impinged by Brexit.Justice Donnelly said she will reserve judgment until March ."},{"url":null,"title":"government gives its backing to plan for

has thrown her weight behind a parliamentary move to win her more Brexit negotiating power by rallying MPs behind an alternative to the controversial backstop..pushConservative chairman Brandon Lewis announced that Tory MPs will be whipped to support an amendment tabled by senior backbencher Sir Graham Brady in a series of votes on Tuesday evening.And Tory backbenchers Andrew Murrison and John Baron withdrew their rival amendments, which would have required the scrapping or time-limiting of the backstop, which is designed to avoid the need for a hard border in Ireland following Brexit.Pulling my amendmentand supporting Brady amendmentso there’s clarity for MPs worried about so-called backstop. #Brexit— andrew murrisonJanuary , But the dramatic move was far from guaranteed to deliver a majority for the plan, after it failed to win the support of the influential European Research Group of Conservative eurosceptics.The amendment tabled by Sir Graham, the chair of the Tory backbench  Committee states that Parliament would be willing to support the Withdrawal Agreement reached with the EU last November, so long as the backstop is replaced with “alternative arrangements” to avoid a hard border.The Tory grandee said that he hoped that House of Commons backing would give Mrs May “enormous firepower” when she s to Brussels to seek concessions on her Brexit deal.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  But the chairman of the European Research Group, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said that its members, thought to number at least , will not support the scheme when it comes before the Commons on Tuesday.Mrs May addressed MPs in Westminster on the eve of a day of high drama, when MPs will debate a range of rival amendments, including calls to block a no-deal departure or delay Brexit from its scheduled date of March .\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Sir Graham Brady Emerging from a meeting of the ERG just moments before the PM’s arrival, Mr Rees-Mogg said the group would not support any amendment, but would decide on the day whether to abstain or vote against.MPs in the ERG were concerned that the Brady amendment did not spell out what would replace the backstop and did not specy that changes to the text of the Withdrawal Agreement were required, he said.Mr Lewis said that the Brady amendment  would “allow the Prime Minister to give a very clear message around what Parliament wants, where the party is”.He said: “I would hope the ERG, when they look at this and actually look through the detail of what this gives the PM tomorrow,it is about giving a message to Europe about what can go through Parliament in terms of dealing with the backstop issue and why that matters.”📄STATEMENT: It’s time to exploit 🇪🇺 chaos and press for a better deal. pic YliHnILVqg— Sammy Wilson MPJanuary , Sammy Wilson of the DUP, whose  MPs prop up the minority Conservative administration, said the PM should “exploit the cracks which are emerging in the illogical position of the EU and the Irish”.Insisting the UK must hold to the date of March  to maintain pressure on the EU and Ireland, Mr Wilson said: “Now is the time for the Government to be tough and to face down the stubbornness of Dublin and Brussels.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  There was no sign in Brussels of any appetite to reopen the Withdrawal Agreement.Chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier’s deputy Sabine Weyand warned there was now a “high risk” of the UK crashing out by accident, as it was “quite a challenge” to see how a majority can be constructed at Westminster.And European Commission vice-president Jyrki Kateinen said there was “no reason to give any concessions” to the UK and there was “not much room for manoeuvre” on the backstop.It would be “stupid” for the EU to make concessions putting the remaining  members at a disadvantage simply to secure a deal, he said.Downing Street said the PM remains committed to quitting the EU on March  and will take her plan back to the Commons for a second “meaningful vote” as soon as possible after Tuesday’s debate.“The Prime Minister is absolutely committed to leaving the EU with a deal, but clearlywe are to obtain parliamentary support for that deal some changes are going to have to be made,” the PM’s spokesman said.The developments came as major supermarkets and fast-food chains warned that a no-deal Brexit will force up prices and reduce the choice and quality of produce for shoppers.In a joint letter, bosses of firms including Sainsbury, Asda, KFC and McDonald’s said: “We anticipate signicant risks to maintaining the choice, quality and durability of food that our customers have come to expect in our stores, and there will be inevitable pressure on food prices from higher transport costs, currency devaluation and tarfs.“We are therefore asking you to work with your colleagues in Parliament urgently to find a solution that avoids the shock of a no-deal Brexit on  March and removes these risks for UK consumers.”Meanwhile, former MI chief Baroness Manningham-Buller warned that no-deal Brexit should be “avoided at all costs” because security threats, from terrorism to Russian interference, were best dealt with “in a European context”.“If we leave without a deal we are going to be less safe,” she told BBC Radio ’s World At One.A ‘managed no deal’ cannot constitute the policy of any responsible Government, says Brexit Committee https:t.co nXqrukHf— Nick Boles MPJanuary , There was no announcement from Labour over whether it will officially back a cross-party amendment put forward by the party’s Yvette Cooper and Conservative Nick Boles aimed at stopping a no-deal exit and delaying the date of Brexit until the end of the year.Mr Boles said the plan has “a great deal of support among ministers and indeed Cabinet ministers” and they were pressing for a free vote.“This is the last chance for Parliament, this is probably the only opportunity that Parliament is going to have to intervene in this process, to take control,” he said.The Federation of Small Businesses gave its backing to the Cooper amendment, which it said would “help provide the space for other ways forward to be explored”.“A stable, predictable economic and political environment is a prerequisite for small business growth and the jobs that this sustains,” said FSB chair Mike Cherry.“With small business confidence already at its lowest since , a no-deal Brexit on March  would put this at risk.”"},{"url":null,"title":"little sign of compromise over brexit backstop","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  |

There is an obligation on people to actually have pragmatic solutions rather than wishful thinking.\"He said Ireland \"will insist\" the UK keeps its word to the people of Northern Ireland and the way to overcome the obstacles was through the future relations talks during the transition period.\"The backstop is already a compromise.

It was designed around British red lines,\" he said.\"Ireland has the same position as the European Union now, I think, when we say that the backstop as part of the withdrawal agreement is part of a balanced package that isnt going to change.\"However responding, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock said delaying Brexit would not resolve the issues.

This is not just about Britains future. This is about how we work together in the future.\"He added: \"People keep talking about games of chicken and the UK position being against the Irish or the EU position. We are all trying to work together here.\"Britain and Ireland are two islands next door to each other, we have an extraordinary history at times a very tragic history. But we have to work out these things together and stop talking about games of chicken.\"Mr Coveney said he did not believe the only reason for Theresa Mays crushing defeat in the Commons earlier this month was down to the backstop alone.\"If you look at the withdrawal agreement it is actually not that controversial. It is about protecting citizens rights.. about protecting British citizens rights in the EU .. its about a financial settlement.. its about creating the time and space for a transition period.. for preparing for new realities.\"And its about protecting a peace process which I believe the Prime Minister is deeply committed to.\"He added: \"The problem with the argument is that nobody has come up with a pragmatic, sensible and legally sound way of avoiding border infrastructure reemerging between the two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland. And that is why it took two years to get the backstop agreed and that is why I believe the Prime Minister is correct when she defends it.\""},{"url":null,"title":"irish government rejects mays bid for brexit backstop concessions","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The resulting m scrum led to a succession of drives for the line and when the ball was recycled a loose pass missed its intended target, but Rory Campbell took the ball smartly on the bounce to score in the corner for an early Malone lead.After Paddy Wright missed a long-range penalty, Ballynahinch earned an excellent attacking position with a m line out following an excellent Ross Adair touch-finder. The line out was won, but Malone forced a crucial turnover and the chance went begging.Both sides continued to be careless in possession in a niggly match, which was low on quality.On  minutes a Malone breakdown penalty gave lsquoHinch a chance to drive for the line and as they progressed, Malone blatantly killed the ball and could count themselves lucky not to receive a yellow. Wright slotted the penalty to close the gap to two points.Following a Malone penalty miss, lsquoHinch botched their own line out allowing the home side to pile into the . Zack McCall was penalised for offside as Malone looked to sweep the ball wide and was given a yellow card. Malone then scored from a tap penalty to take a - half-time lead.The second half followed a similar pattern to the first with Ballynahinch going further behind to another try from the prolic Campbell after another lsquoHinch mistake on their own line out.Ross Adair reduced the arrears on  minutes with a converted try to put lsquoHinch in bonus point territory and the away side belatedly roused themselves to pile the pressure on Malone during the final ten minutes.However, the home defence held and lsquoHinch had to settle for a point, earned largely through the woes of the Malone place kicker, who failed to land any of his attempts on goal.A disappointing start to  for the locals and they will need to be more accurate this week as Ballymena come to Ballymacarn Park.Malone Ballynahinch AIL DIVISION B.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygowan’s Emma hoping to make waves at Abu Dhabi Special Olympics  ","story":"A BALLYGOWAN swimmer is hoping to make a big splash when she goes to the Middle East in March.Twenty three year-old Emma Carlisle will be going for gold when she swims for Ireland at the  Special Olympics World Summer Games in Abu Dhabi.Emma is one of seven athletes from Co Down included in the -strong Team Ireland squad for the Games which take place over March -.Newry is well represented with four athletes selected.

For health officials to suggest that a child is wrapped up like a package and sent across the water for a post mortem is cruel.ldquoI am not sure what provision would be in place for parents to accompany the child, but to send them on such a journey is heartbreaking. The entire family circle suffers when something like this happens.Mrs Trainor said the decision to hold post-mortems in England was the ldquosingle, most horrying thing she has ever heard.She continued: ldquoThe health service never ceases to amaze me and once again due to a lack of foresight, planning and finance, we find ourselves in what is an unforgivable situation, she continued, commending Newry, Mourne and Down Council for recently highlighting the post mortem issue.ldquoI am not the only person who has lost a child, quite a few people have and there are those who would join me to meet with Mr Pengelly to explain that sending babies across the water for post mortem is just not acceptable.The health campaigner believes there must be a paediatric pathologist who is prepared to provide cover in Northern Ireland, admitting she would also be in favour of an all island service.ldquoSending babies away is not an option and while an all island option is better than sending babies to Liverpool, I believe we must have this service provided here, she declared. ldquoWe need to meet with the Permanent Secretary as soon as possible on this vital issue.Committee chairman Eamonn McGrady said it was his understanding that there were strains on pathology services across the province due to workforce issues.ldquoIssues like this happen over a period of time and you sometimes wonder just how much attention is given to the planning aspect, he said.ldquoHow do officials plan for the future  It is not just enough to commission a report on the issue and put it in the bottom drawer and announce you are several thousand nurses short when you have had ample opportunity over several years to train more.South Down MLA Colin McGrath, who attended last weekrsquos meeting in Downpatrick, said holding post-mortems in England ldquowill bring untold pain and suffering to families in their darkest hour.He added: ldquoWe must do everything within our power to try and bring a resolution to this resource issue including examining a North-South approach. Local people have sought a meeting with Department of Health officials on this matter and I will be happy to pursue and facilitate this.ldquoThere is a need for such a crucially important service for parents and indeed the wider family circle to be delivered regionally.Three weeks ago, local politicians called on the Permanent Secretary to reduce the ldquoalready enormous burden from parents suffering from bereavement and come up with a better solution than sending babies to Liverpool.Politicians said they were not averse to an all island service, insisting the reinstatement of the Belfast-based paediatric pathologist who retied is also vitally important moving forward..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New £217k play park welcome boost for Meadowlands estate  ","story":"MEADOWLANDS estate in Downpatrick is at last to get a new play park costing pound,.Work on the park should start within weeks and be ready by the end of March.A proposal to proceed with the scheme was approved by Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee on Monday night.The new park is a joint project with the council and Downpatrick Neighbourhood Renewal with % funding from the Department of the Communities.The council will be responsible for managing its construction and its maintenance.The new park is to be located in front of Drumcloon Walk and adjacent to the Quoile Crescent housing development.According to the Northern Ireland Neighbourhood Information Service statistics, Meadowlands is ranked th out of  areas of high health deprivation.The need for the park has also been supported by statistics from the Northern Ireland Research and Information Agency which show that there are  children under the age of  living in the Quoile Ward area who could avail of the park.It is also hoped that the park will help with the regeneration of the area and improve its overall look.The siting of the park was moved after some local concern was expressed that it would too close to pensionersrsquo homes in Drumcloon Park.Meadowlands Community Association, which was formed with help from local councillor Cadogan Enright, last week welcomed the move and the fact that the council listened to its representations.At Mondayrsquos meeting, Cllr Billy Walker proposed that the committee agree to go ahead with the park.He said: ldquoI really welcome this play park, as will the residents, he said. ldquoBeing the last chairman of the old district council, I know that a park for Meadowlands was a legacy issue.ldquoThere is real need for this as Meadowlands is one of the most deprived areas in the Downpatrick DEA and itrsquos to good see that that hard work is at last bearing fruit.Cllr Cadogan, who seconded the proposal, added: ldquoI am delighted that this play park can go ahead as I have been working with the residents for years and itrsquos at last getting over the line..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New amenity centre set for spring opening  ","story":"DOWNPATRICKrsquoS new ultra-modern civic amenity centre could open as early as the spring, council officials have confirmed.The new facility at Flying Horse Road will replace the existing centre at nearby Cloonagh Road, which continues to struggle with the increasing demands being placed upon it.Over the Christmas and New Year holiday period, the centre was forced to close early due to the volume of waste.The early closure annoyed many ratepayers with council officials confident the new centre mdash which is signicantly larger mdash will be able to handle more recyclable material.Over recent years, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has invested signicant sums building new civic amenity sites in Ballynahinch and Castlewellan, with the Flying Horse Road facility set to be one of the most modern of its kind.Confirmation that the new Downpatrick centre could open as early as the spring will be given at this eveningrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.There was a delay in building the new facility as a suitable site could not be identied and when work did eventually get underway, progress was temporarily halted as equipment belonging to contractors was targeted by vandals.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed news then the new centre could open for business as early as the spring.The local authorityrsquos lease of the Cloonagh Road facility has been extended until the end of March but it has been recognised for some time that this facility has passed its sell-by-date.Cllr Curran said it was important Downpatrick had a recycling centre which was fit-for-purpose and could meet the needs of ratepayers across a wide area.He said the facility was not solely used by people in the town.

But, as he details in his paper, it does the opposite.This intervention is of huge signicance, just before MPs vote again on iations of the Withdrawal Agreement. Lord Bew was an advisor to David Trimble in the s and a key voice in favour of the  peace agreement, and has had a distinguished record at Westminster, helping oversee parliamentary standards, all the while aprofessor of Irish history at Queen’s University.Most signicant of all, however, is the fact that Lord Bew is a moderate unionist, yet has felt moved to speak with force about Britain’s failure to insist that Ireland stand by its treaty obligations, past and present.It is, as Lord Bew implies, intolerable that under the Withdrawal Agreement key areas of North-South co-operation entirely under the operation of a new EU-led regime.This assessment of the backstop illustrates why the DUP is right to hold fire on ulging how it will vote in tonight’s isions. Graham Brady MP is trying to find a way round the backstop, which is welcome, but there needs to be close examination of whether the mere introduction of a backstop, eventime limited, establishes a baseline for treatment of Northern Ireland from which it will be hard ever to emerge.Lord Bew’s paper is a crucial contribution to the Brexit debate, but it has highlighted a wider failure in so-called ‘civic unionism’ to speak up forcefully against the backstop until far too late in the Brexit process.

It represents instead, self-interested and self-serving social groups jockeying for position in a race whose outcome is yet to be confirmed using the cover of ‘rights’ to masquerade their narrow and selfish intentions.Nationalism, Irish and British, never blames itself, never questions its actions nor reflects on its own behaviour. In the world of nationalists and nationalism someone  is always at fault.As ‘civic nationalists’ most of them looking cautiously over their shoulders at each other, gathered in Belfast this weekend they were seeking to sht political attention away from their own failings, secure their own future positions and send a clear, unambiguous and unapologetic message to anyone who is not an Irishnationalist that a shared future does not include them.Nationalism is not only a backward political philosophy: it is a toxic one. It seeks to ide and exploit dference. It blames others and otherness. It is a political cancer that deliberately subverts progressive politics and iniably is home to the worst examples of native gombeen men and women.How long will it be before ‘civic unionism’ responds with its own gathering and demands for ‘unionist rights’ The Workers Party version of a democratic secular society in Northern Ireland is based on the rights of citizens as citizens not on their allegiance to any religious or nationalist bloc.It is for that reason that the demand for a Bill of Rights remains a fundamental part of the strategy to establish and guarantee the relationship between citizens and the state, guaranteeing the civil liberties of all citizens, regardless of communal background.The demand for equality and democratic rights is not the property or the preserve of any bloc. Its ownership should rest firmly with citizens as citizens. Only on that basis will progress be made and citizenship flourish.The pressingpriority for Northern Ireland is not a nationalist group hug but the immediate restoration of the Assembly and the Executive to progress that agenda. But that, of course, would mean no hiding place for the failed and failing politics of nationalism.Patrick Lynn, Workers Party, South BelfastJPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.5237807.1548725533!/image/image.jpg","title":"politics","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Politics   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Politics Legacy Scandal RHI News Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Politics      A crucial intervention against the backstop from Lord BewOne of the most powerful arguments to be assembled against the backstop is reproduced on the opposite page www.newsletter news opinion .

He decided to put together a calendar of his work together to help raise money for the Alzheimers Society, as his father died from the disease in .The -year-old was encouraged to put together the calendar after posting some of his pictures in a local Facebook group.He said: \"I was surprised by the positive response and all the encouraging comments my first set of photos received, said Phil, ldquoWhen I posted another set of photos people started suggesting putting them together in a book or a calendar.\"Mr Lewis said the idea stuck and he asked the group to vote for their favourite photos which would be included in the calendar, before working with local graphic designer Ceri Legg who designed the layout and Beacon Printers, who printed the calendars.Around  calendars were printed altogether which were on sale in shops throughout the town, but have now fully sold out.ldquoI was really worried at first as the number  was suggested to me by the printers, and as soon as I picked them up I start feeling anxious about how exactly I was going to sell  calendars,\" said Mr Lewis.\"I thought that  would have been a more realistic number. I was completely taken aback by the huge response.\"I had people contacting me from all over the world ndash Australia, Spain, Texas, askingI would post calendars to them. This is on top of the response from local people.\"I spent most of my evenings in that first week doing deliveries all over Penarth,\" Mr Lewis added.Through the sales, Mr Lewis has raised more than pound, for the Alzheimers Society.He said: \"It seemed like the right thing to do really, as Penarth is a very community-oriented town so doing a calendar for charity fits with the outlook of the people of Penarth.\"Now, Mr Lewis is looking at printing more calendars this year to help raise further funds for the charity.\"If the idea of this calendar had never been suggested then my photos would have ended up just sitting on my computer,\" he said.\"Irsquom just glad that this hobby that I really like has ended up being put to good use by raising this money for charity.To get in touch with Mr Lewis about purchasing a calendar, email philip.lewis@live article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

brexit","story":"Amid an ongoing revolt among backbenchers and her DUP allies, the Prime Minister has swung behind a motion amendment that would allow her to go back to Brussels and seek changes to the Irish border backstop.She will whip MPs to support the amendment tabled by  Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady, which states that Parliament would be willing to support the Withdrawal Agreement reached with the EUldquoalternative arrangements were found to avoid a hard border.The dramatic move is far from guaranteed to deliver a majority for the plan after it failed to win the support of the influential European Research Groupof Conservative Eurosceptics, who have not ruled out voting against it.There is also the small matter of the amendment being called by Commons Speaker John Bercow on Tuesday morning, although his hand may be swayed by the number of MPs backing it already.Tory grandee Sir Graham said he hoped House of Commons backing would give Mrs May ldquoenormous firepower when she s to Brussels to seek concessions on her Brexit deal.But the chairman of the ERG, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said its members, thought to number at least , will not support the scheme.Meanwhile, late on Monday evening it emerged a new Brexit plan had been put forward which is reportedly backed by members of both the Remain and Leave camps of the Conservative party.The plan ndash called the The Malthouse Compromise after Kit Malthouse, the MP who brought the parties together ndash would lead to Britain leaving the EU ldquoon time and with a ing government, former Brexit minster Steve Baker said.ldquoThe Malthouse Compromise after @kitmalthouse, who brought us togetherWe need to get out of the EU on time and with a ing government.This is how. #Brexit https:t.co mBvmdkXmdash Steve Baker MPJanuary , Said to be drawn up by Nicky Morgan and supported by others, the plan reportedly ldquoprovides for exit from the EU on time with a new backstop, which would be acceptable indefinitely, but which incentivises us all to reach a new future relationship.It would extend the transition period ndash the period where the UK would continue to follow EU rules and pay into its budget ndash from the end of  and into December  which would ldquoallow both parties to prepare properly for WTO terms, but also provide a period in which the parties could obviate this outcome by negotiating a mutually beneficial future relationship.Mrs May addressed MPs in Westminster on the eve of a day of high drama, when MPs will debate a range of rival amendments, including calls to block a no-deal departure or delay Brexit from its scheduled date of March .Conservative chairman Brandon Lewis, who confirmed the whipping after the meeting, said the Brady amendment would ldquoallow the Prime Minister to give a very clear message around what Parliament wants, where the party is.He said: ldquoI would hope the ERG, when they look at this and actually look through the detail of what this gives the PM tomorrow,it is about giving a message to Europe about what can go through Parliament in terms of dealing with the backstop issue and why that matters.Mr Lewis confirmed that the Government would whip against an amendment co-sponsored by one of its own MPs, Nick Boles, which seeks to extend the Article  period to avoid a no-deal Brexit.Despite the manoeuvring in Westminster, in Brussels the EU, officially at least, remained resolute that the Withdrawal Agreement would not be reopened.Chief EU negotiator Michel Barnierrsquos deputy Sabine Weyand warned there was a ldquohigh risk of the UK crashing out by accident, as it was ldquoquite a challenge to see how a majority could be constructed at Westminster.European Commission vice-president Jyrki Kateinen said there was ldquono reason to give any concessions to the UK and there was ldquonot much room for manoeuvre on the backstop.It would be ldquostupid for the EU to make concessions putting the remaining  members at a disadvantage simply to secure a deal, he said.Downing Street said the PM remains committed to quitting the EU on March  and will take her plan back to the Commons for a second ldquomeaningful vote as soon as possible after Tuesdayrsquos debate.The developments came as major supermarkets and fast-food chains warned that a no-deal Brexit would force up prices and reduce the choice and quality of produce for shoppers.In a joint letter, bosses of firms including Sainsbury, Asda, KFC and McDonaldrsquos said: ldquoWe anticipate signicant risks to maintaining the choice, quality and durability of food that our customers have come to expect in our stores, and there will be inevitable pressure on food prices from higher transport costs, currency devaluation and

minority ethnic backgrounds report","story":"The percentage of BME detainees was the highest recorded since HM Inspectorate of Prisons began carrying out the analysis in .The % figure increased from % in the previous year.Researchers found that the proportion of boys who identied as being from a black or minority ethnic background ied depending on the establishment, from one in fiveat the Keppel Unit, to nearly three quartersat Feltham.The figures are detailed in a study on the perceptions of those aged between  and  who were held in YOIs or secure training centresin England and Wales from April  to March .Black and minority ethnic children accounted for % of the STC population, according to the paper.The percentage identying as being from a BME background ied between centres, from % at Oakhill to % at Medway.In , a landmark review by Labour MP David Lammy raised concerns that the proportion of black, Asian and minority ethnic youth prisoners had increased despite an overall fall in under-s in custody.Commenting on the latest findings, Mr Lammy said: ldquoThis is deeply alarming and now must be viewed as an urgent national crisis.ldquoWe are not only failing to make progress to address these racial inequalities things are getting signicantly worse.ldquoFrom childhood right through to courts and adult prisons, our justice system entrenches and exacerbates the ides in our society.Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: ldquoFor the first time, more than half of boys in prison identy as being from a black or minority ethnic background.ldquoSixteen months after the Lammy Review was published, it is disturbing that disproportionality it is growing.Between ndash and ndash, the number of children, including -year-olds, held in YOIs, STCs and secure childrenrsquos homes fell by %, from , to , according to HMIPrsquos report.The assessment, to be published on Tuesday, covers the experiences of boys in five male YOIs, plus a specialist unit for boys, and children, including a small number of girls, held in three STCs.The watchdog warned that too many youngsters feel unsafe while in custody, saying signs of improvement have yet to translate into a signicant sht in childrenrsquos perceptions of their treatment and conditions.HMIPrsquos analysis, based on a survey of  children detained in -, found just over a thirdof those held in STCs reported feeling unsafe at some point since arriving at the centre, while the figure was % for YOIs.In other findings:ndash More than half of childrenin STCs and % in YOIs reported that they had been physically restrained in their establishment.ndash Three in  STC respondentshad been victimised by other children by being shouted at through windows.ndash Children in STCs were more likely to report that staff treated them with respect .Publishing the report, Chief Inspector of Prisons Peter Clarke said: ldquoI trust that the details of this report will prove useful to those whose responsibility it is to provide safe, respectful and purposeful custody for children.ldquoAs we all know, the perceptions of children in custody, will, for them, be the reality of what is happening.ldquoThat is why we should not allow the recent improvement in inspection findings to give rise to complacency.A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ldquoWe are fundamentally reforming youth custody to make it safer and more focused on rehabilitation and, as the Chief Inspector recognises, there have been encouraging signs of improvement in safety.ldquoAs part of our reforms, we are increasing frontline staff in public-sector YOIs by %, improving training for officers working with young people, and have recently announced a pound million investment in a new secure school at Medway.ldquoBut we recognise there is still more to do, including tackling disproportionality in the justice system, and a dedicated team is addressing this issue head-on..push,i[r].l*new

She said the market stall was designed to be a stopgap while she looked for premises but she ended up spending ten years there until she had her twins three years ago.“I was self-employed so I couldn’t take maternity leave from the market for more than eight weeks or I would lose the pitch,” she said.“I was already doing some midweek cookery classes at home in Moy, so I decided to expand on that and convert the garage into a state of the art facility. I really enjoy it and it allows me to work from home.”Courses cost from £ and include tea coffee and scones. Mary-Anne delivers savoury cookery classes as well but explained that baking is far and away the most popular.“I wasn’t actually trained as a pastry chef but there has been such a resurgence in the popularity of baking. That is where the demand is. I would love to do more cookery classes where people can learn to do savoury foods too, however the majority of bookings are for those sweet treats we all love. I like to combine traditional recipes and new flavours. Local, seasonal and organic ingredients are key.”Each course can accommodate - people and are booked out weeks in advance. All recipes andequipment are provided and you get to take home what you make.“My style is informal, it’s all about having fun. I do hands-on and demonstration classes and cater for all levels from complete beginners to more experienced cooks. The aim is to get stuck in. The children’s classes are really popular, and I love that. I think it’s really important to get these skills established from an early age.”Arrest after attack on ambulance, PSNI and hospital staff Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingArrest after large stash of suspected drugs found in Portadown raidDisgust at Tweet threatening Celtic superfan Jay BeattyWoman bullied by girl into buying knives at ASDA car parkLandscaper lsquoout of businessrsquo after theftP.S.N.I. issue urgent high risk missing person appeal after man walks out of N.I. hospital          ..

Ulster Business takes a further look A few years back, the options were fairly limited for NI firms when it came to venture capital funding.Now, between private funds, investors and those backed by Invest NI, the options have widened signicantly for companies – especially those which are high-growth – to seek a cash injection, and get to the next level.Jayne Brady is partner at the Bank of Ireland Kernel Capital Growth Fund NI.“We have been operating in Northern Ireland for five years, and in that period we have seen a growing momentum in the Northern Ireland ecosystem,” she told Ulster Business.“We have  companies in our portfolio, and have invested in eight companies in Northern Ireland as part of that.”And a lot has changed in the last few years, particularly with the sheer number of avenues in which businesses can find access to funding.“There wasn’t an availability of local funds, and it was dficult to get that level from GB, because you needed to reach a certain level.”And where is the investment now going in Northern Ireland  “It’s very strong sectors of expertise, and there is a big FDI element – medical technology, cyber-security. It’s not created in isolation, andan availability of skills.”“More recently, there has been more external investors. We would co-invest, and there is a level of investment from outside players – there are good opportunities.”Jayne says that Kernel Capital tracks investments, and the level and size of deals here has grown. A lot of that has been down to the growth of the Knowledge Economy – which has expanded seven or eight-fold in the last few years.For businesses looking towards funds like Kernel, a typical deal size is from around £m up to £m.One of the largest investments was secured by B-Secur, which has created a biometric technology which uses the human heartbeat to unlock everything from finance and healthcare through to cars and buildings.The company, based at Catalyst Inc, secured £.m from investors including Kernel Capital and ADV.For Jayne, Kernel is looking at companies with turnover of more than £m, which have the ability and scope to be scaled.“We see investment where there is a scaling potential. We look at companies where we are generating £m plus –– which you can scale rapidly, or those with a deep IPfocus. Some companies in services won’t have that level of scale.”Then, there’s the Growth Finance Fund, and Growth Loan Fund II, which provide a total of £m of funding for Northern Ireland’s SMEs.The two new funds are being managed by WhiteRock Capital Partners, a homegrown fund manager set up in  to manage the first Growth Loan Fund, which has committed £m of loans to more than  businesses over the last six years.There’s also the Growth Finance Fund. That will see loans from £, up to £m going to growing businesses. It’s also the first time the British Business Bank has invested in a fund aimed solely at supporting Northern Ireland businesses. The latest figures from the Irish Venture Capital Association, which covers businesses across the island, show venture capital funding has slumped, with a fall-off in major deals and seed funding.Investment was down by almost a third to €min the first nine months of the , confirming a signicant slowdown on .The drop-off in cash accelerated during the year, with the amount raised by tech firms and startups in the last three months just half what it was a year earlier.The figures suggested that the largest segment of funding to see a decline is in deals was above €m .But a Northern Ireland report by Catalyst Inc, published last year, showed companies raised over £m in equity capital in .Elsewhere, flying the flag for venture capital in Northern Ireland for more than  years is Crescent Capital.Run by Colin Walsh, former CBI chairman in Northern Ireland, it’s invested in a raft of the most successful and leading companies here.That includes Andor Technology and Belfast-based biotech firm Fusion Antibodies, which is based at Springbank Industrial Estate in the west of the city.According to Jayne, it’s not just about backing Belfast firms, or FDIs setting up shop in the heart of the city.“We look towards the strong sectoral focuses, and outside Belfast as well. We are very conscious to go to our customers.” That includes holding regular open events across areas such as Newry, Co Tyrone and Londonderry. “We are very open to meeting any companies, and our door is open,” she says.But will Brexit play a part in the future of venture capital funding in Northern Ireland  “We need to be cognisant of any particular indication of any change in regulation,” Jayne says.“From our perspective, because we invest in deep tech, they are somewhat removed from that direct impact.” Elsewhere, there are other revenue streams which firms can look towards, especially when it comes to working capital.That includes Upstream – an alternative finance company run by Judith Totten, which specialises in funding for SMEs.“As Northern Ireland’s largest independently owned and managed provider of working capital, Upstream works collaboratively with organisations’ existing lenders to provide additional capital in a more flexible way to help businesses thrive,” sales director Alan Wardlow says.“Businesses come to us for our responsiveness – our formal credit approvals are achieved in days rather than weeks or months. Upstream has long standing relationships with many local venture capitaland private equity providers as well as the ious Invest NI-backed loan funds and we work closely together to provide solutions for business owners across Northern Ireland“We recently incorporated a trade finance solution into our product range to bridge the gap for organisations who require additional growth funding, quickly, to deliver orders beyond their current capability. This funding is proving incredibly popular alongside our long-standing invoice finance option which gives organisations the ability to release funds against their debtor book thereby freeing up cash flow for businesses to seize growth opportunities as they become available.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/steve_web.jpg","title":"the catalyst to putting northern ireland on the global map","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by Ulster Business Ulster Business speaks to Catalyst Inc chief executive Steve Orr about his hugely ambitious plans for growth, expansion and moulding NI into a world-leader in tech ‘We aren’t going to follow anyone , and we need toto becoming leaders in the world.’It’s immediately clear that Steve Orr has big ambitions for Catalyst Inc. He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports.

Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry “The business communities that we represent have always had a erse range of views on what form the UK’s future relationship with the EU should take, however they do agree on the need to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit. “To achieve this we therefore need an agreement that will secure the transition period and protect jobs. As businesses wait to see what happens next in Parliament, it is crucial that those at Westminster move beyond tactical manoeuvring and look at all the options in order to avoid a ‘no deal’s scenario. “Firms are in the dark on too many aspects of le after March . This has already led to many businesses taking action – pausing on recruitment and investment, stockpiling goods, and relocating factories in other parts of the EU. In fact, a third of NI Chamber members are currently putting growth and investment plans on hold in the absence of clarity from Westminster. There is however nothing to stop government acting decisively on areas within their control, such as migration and customs procedures.”  Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “The result this evening will be a cause for concern across the Northern Ireland business community. Northern Ireland businesses desperately need certainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. A no deal Brexit means that Northern Ireland households will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves something they can ill afford. “Se need politicians  to coalesce around a workable solution that protects consumers from the costs and disruptions due to the loss of tarf-free and frictionless trade we currently enjoy with partners in the EU. We are now closer than ever to the possibility of a no-deal that will be a disaster for Northern Ireland.” “  Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director “Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately. This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UKs economy. “No deal would immediately put Northern Irish jobs and businesses at risk and jeopardise years of positive economic development and integration across the island.  It must be avoided to protect our all-island economy.”  Glyn Roberts, Retail NI chief executive “This is a disappointing but not unexpected result. While the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Bill was in no way perfect, it was definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal. “The Government now needs to work on a cross-party basis with Labour and other opposition parties to reach a broader agreement for a withdrawal deal and secure the transition period, protect jobs and a positive future relationship with the EU  Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster “Leaving the EU without a deal would damage the sustainability of the Hospitality industry and impact on the potential growth of Tourism in Northern Ireland. We appeal to our elected representatives to work together in a spirit of consensus government to ensure that a no deal scenario does not happen.”  Tina McKenzie, FSB NI policy chair “With the clock ticking down to Brexit Day in just  weeks, we are running out of time to avoid a clf-edge, no-deal outcome. “A disorderly exit from the EU would be deeply damaging for small businesses, causing disruption to supply chains, increasing costs and stling investment. “A no-deal is something which we simply cannot countenance, so it is imperative that political leaders sharpen their focus and do all they can to reach agreement in the short time available.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit could cost ni economy bn by ","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s economy could suffer a £bn drop in output by  in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, it’s been claimed. According to the CBI, its analysis of government figures published at the end of last year showsthe UK fails to secure a deal with the EU, by , GVA could be “.% lower than under the UK’s current arrangements with the EU according to government analysis”. The CBI calculates this could amount to an annual loss of output worth almost £bn by , based on today’s prices. It says “manufacturing activity is particularly important in Northern Ireland, and the agri-food sector, which employs thousands, is likely to be severely impacted as it is particularly exposed to the risk of higher tarfs and trade costs”. Angela McGowan, Northern Ireland director of the CBI, said: “CBI members across Northern Ireland are clear:the new approach to finding a Brexit deal continues to be a game of who blinks first, the Northern Irish economy will pay the price. “The deadlock will only be broken by a genuine attempt by all MPs to find consensus and compromise, not stick to rusting red lines and political conditions. Like the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is not – and cannot be – ready for no deal. “The projected impact on our economy would be devastating and while business will do all it can to reduce some of the worst aspects, a no deal scenario is unmanageable. “The message from the CBI to our politicians is clear – we must see compromise or the whole country faces the unforgivable prospect of a disorderly Brexit which will affect jobs and livelihoods in Northern Ireland for decades to come.

It’s still lovingly referred to as the Swiss watch stalwart’s sister brand.From there, following the Second World War, he decided now was the time to expand and give the brand an identity of its own.The primary dference between the brands back then, was that Rolex watches carried in-house movements, and that Tudor would offer familiar watch styles, such as the Oyster and Submariner, at a more affordable cost, while its big brother would guarantee the technical, aesthetic and al characteristics, along with distribution and after sales service.But the brand back then, and the company now, has changed radically. Just a few years ago, it tore up the rulebook on its traditional line – moving away from historically similar watches to Rolex, and a few changes from its classical lines, towards a tight range of watches, bringing in the old and the new.The core model is the Black Bay. A millimetre larger than the Rolex Submariner, it’s a slightly chunkier affair, without treading into the excessive sizes of some other brand’s modern timepieces. It also offers a new ‘’ –  a smaller mm watch, which fits right in as a cheaper alternative to the Submariner, a Black Bay Chronograph and the Pelagos – a larger, more modern affair made out of titanium.The brand also comes in at a time when Rolex prices have shot up, considerably. Many of the most desirable models in the Rolex line have a waiting list – with second-hand prices outpacing the new book price.Tudor itself has also embraced this burgeoning demand, releasing its own GMT watch – with so-called ‘Pepsi’ blue and red bezel. Currently, Rolex’s own model – aside from the sizeable price dference – will mean joining a waiting list. A WEEK ON THE WRIST Tudor Heritage Black Bay Sitting as Tudor’s poster-boy or flagship in its range, the Black Bay is a e watch which melds the styling and inspiration of, possibly the most recognisable watch in the world, the Rolex Submariner, with a larger case, while adding patina on the hands and markers.There’s no crown-guard, ala Rolex. This time, it’s a larger, screw-down, with an etched Tudor rose – formerly the brand’s logo.Overall, the Black Bay’s case is brushed, including the caseback, with the finish smoothly transitioning into a polish around the sides and crown.The sapphire crystal glass is slightly domed, sitting around a millimetre off the face off the watch. Around the edge, the bezel is a solid, thick and satisfyingly sold -click version, with red triangle and lume dot.This version is on a steel bracelet, but is also available on a leather or fabric band, along with red dial and blue – the latter without the patina on the markers and hands.The bracelet is a stand-out characteristic of the piece, certainly in terms of build quality. The three-piece links have a lug width of mm, tapering to around mm. It’s brushed, but polished and riveted along the side. On the clasp, there’s a double-locking system, with a thoughtful inclusion of the Tudor shield logo into the mechanism, along with three points of micro-adjustment.This watch, available from jeweller Lunn’s, spent several days on my wrist – from the office, to out-and-about and around the house. It’s a comfortable piece to wear – balanced between a bit more heft than its more expensive sibling, but never straying into the realm of gaudy or garish.After a few hours, it felt very much like one of my own. I did miss the date, however, but those after additional complications or ality could look to the chronograph version, or the larger Pelagos.The Black Bay is a well-balanced piece – easily sitting at the centre of a Venn diagram between casual and formal.The brand itself is firing everything at the new range, with endorsements from David Beckham and Lady Gaga, aimed at a younger generation with disposable income to spare. While that may not appeal or speak to the horological purists, with the in-house movement, attention to detail, provenance and mixture of the traditional and modern, it’s likely to build a fresh reputation as a ‘watch fan’ timepiece, and for those who have no issue explaining to those admiring the chunk of steel on their wrists, that it isn’t a Rolex.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Air-1.jpg","title":"eight part belfast made airbus passenger jets delivered","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Eight part-Belfast made Bombardier Airbus passenger jets were delivered at the end of last year – bringing the total number to  during .

I love the mutual ethos, and that we are fundamentally there to help the community,” she told Ulster Business.“We have to make a , but fundamentally we are there for the good of society. I passionately believe that home ownership is a good thing. And I passionately believe that savings are a good thing, and that’s what our business has been doing for more than  years.”According to its latest full-year figures, ending in December , Progressive posted pre-tax profit of £.m.In the last year, it helped more than , people buy their home and almost  to build a new home, with overall new mortgage lending of around £m.It’s weathered some of the most dficult years in the residential property market here, with Northern Ireland prices plummeting in the wake of the recession in .“We are battling our way through that – the housing market hasn’t fully recovered through it. The number of new developments probably aren’t servicing the needs of the demand. We still have an issue out there.“Slow, and modest growth is happening at the minute. But that’s good, and that’s sustainable. Affordability is very good in Northern Ireland and the economic factors, even with Brexit, are good.”Progressive now has  branches and more than  staff spread throughout Northern Ireland.For Darina, it’s about working hand-in-hand with the customer, and ensuring everyone in the team in the same mindset.“For me, it has to be doing right by the customer. Once your staff are fully on that journey too, they know they are doing the right thing,” Darina says. “They aren’t forced into sales targets – they want to get the right product fro the person, and making it as easy as they possibly can.“In part, to hand hold. There are some cases where deadlines don’t happen, things don’t go according to plans – for example, in a housing chain, someone can drop out. It’s about being there, and being able to help.“There is still a demand for people to buy houses – that hasn’t changed at all.”Darina took over at the helm in , while the property market in Northern Ireland, and throughout the UK, was still going through tough times. But she believes it has normalised since then.“Things are picking up,” she says. “We have the experience here to keep going in a direction that suits the demographic that we serve.“We are here for the long-term, and factor that in. Ultimately, it has to be right for the consumer.“It’s also about the whole of Northern Ireland. It’s not just Belfast-centric, and we have to extend our reach. There’s good activity in dferent parts of Northern Ireland, and that’s where our roots are.”And after more than  years with the organisation, Darina says she has no plans to jump ship to another financial business.“I am totally bought in to the mutual ethos. For me, it’s all about the customer.
