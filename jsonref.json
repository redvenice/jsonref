I wouldn\u0027t support this deal if the EU were paying us.\u0027    Boris Johnson, pictured left, stunned fellow ministers with a four-letter dismissal of Theresa May\u0027s Brexit plan during Friday\u0027s Chequers meeting after Mrs May, right, called for loyaltyToday\u0027s accounts of Friday\u0027s showdown revealed Foreign Secretary Mr Johnson stunned fellow Ministers with his four-letter dismissal of the Prime Minister\u0027s plan at Friday\u0027s special Chequers summit designed to unite the Cabinet. His comment risks making him the first victim of Mrs May\u0027s fresh crackdown on dissent.Mr Johnson – who has been accused of betrayal by Tory Brexiteers for not blocking Mrs May\u0027s \u0027soft Brexit\u0027 proposals – spoke out against the plan for the UK to remain in Bline with Brussels rules in a new free trade zone with the EU.According to a reliable source, he complained that anyone obliged to defend the proposals would be \u0027polishing a turd\u0027.He added sarcastically: \u0027Luckily we have some expert turd polishers\u0027 – shooting a glance at one of Mrs May\u0027s spin doctors.Challenging the Prime Minister\u0027s new policy to her face, he said that her decision to try to \u0027align\u0027 UK trading rules with the EU would reduce Britain to the humiliating status of a \u0027vassal state\u0027.He also took issue with her cher-ished new customs plan, the Facilitated Customs Arrangement (FCA), claiming it would be a \u0027serious inhibitor\u0027 to striking new trade deals with non-EU countries.His outburst was revealed just hours after Mrs May tried to draw a red line under weeks of open dissent from her Ministers, vowing that from now on she will enforce collective Cabinet responsibility and sack any Ministers who defy her. Some senior Tories believe she may be forced to fire Mr Johnson.    The outburst was revealed hours after Mrs May threatened to sack disloyal ministersA Mail on Sunday poll today endorses her handling of the Cabinet showdown, with 33 per cent of voters supporting her Brexit plan and 23 per cent opposing it. The Survation poll, the first survey since the Chequers summit, suggests Mrs May has twice the support of Mr Johnson – although voters do not believe her plan is \u0027faithful\u0027 to the EU referendum result.Last night, Eurosceptic Tories said there was so much anger at the PM\u0027s \u0027sell-out\u0027 that some MPs would submit no-confidence letters to force a challenge to her leadership.And Jacob Rees-Mogg\u0027s pro-Brexit European Research Group said experts believe the Chequers deal left the UK \u0027on course for a \u0027black hole\u0027 Brexit\u0027 – meaning we would be sucked into the orbit of EU rules with no hope of escape.          Boris Johnson has launched an extraordinary four-letter attack on PM Theresa May over her Brexit plansMr Johnson made clear in the run-up to Friday\u0027s session that he was vehemently against any scheme which left us shackled to EU rules, leading to fears in Downing Street that he and other pro-Brexit Ministers could resign.But Mrs May launched her own plan to kill off his revolt: signalling in advance she had already lined up \u0027talented\u0027 junior Ministers to replace any Cabinet quitters forcing all those at the summit to hand over their phones to stop them briefing against her under the table and issuing an official No 10 communique declaring victory while her critics were still stuck inside arguing.          Tory MP Andrew Bridgen has accused Boris Johnson of raising the white flag over BrexitThis so-called Brexit deal is nothing short of a betrayal of the 17.4 million people who voted to leave the EU. What on earth were the staunch Leavers in the Cabinet doing?Where was Boris Johnson? At Chequers on Friday, we needed him to emulate his hero, Winston Churchill. Instead, he gave us a modern-day version of Neville Chamberlain.Sadly, the Foreign Secretary was not alone in apparently waving the white flag of appeasement in the direction of Brussels. Other Brexiteer buccaneers and recent Brexit converts also jumped ship.The door to Mrs May\u0027s country residence was open but they chose not to walk out of it. Perhaps the threat of the withdrawal of the Government limo was just too great.This is a huge mistake on two grounds. Firstly, all those harbouring leadership hopes have done their ambitions fatal harm. Grassroots party members will have no truck with their perceived treachery. Some will try to keep their leadership hopes alive by claiming it was not the time to quit and they had a duty to stay on to ensure Brexit is not further watered down. But it leaves only one credible contender with the integrity and backbone to follow Mrs May: Jacob Rees-Mogg.Secondly, Brexiteer Cabinet Ministers are losing their nerve at the wrong time. This is not the end of the battle – it is the start of the real fight for a true Brexit. What Theresa May unveiled last week appears little short of a punishment Brexit, designed by the EU to dissuade any other country from leaving the bloc.With no incentive to offer non-EU countries free trade deals when we leave, through mutual recognition of standards, the UK will forever remain a captive market for overpriced EU goods. It means going through the pretence of leaving but becoming a non-voting associate member, a vassal state.We would still be locked into the EU\u0027s suffocating embrace via this \u0027common rule book\u0027 while the dead hand of the European Court of Justice will be lurking in the background.In contrast, we should call Brussels\u0027 bluff and, if necessary, leave without a formal deal. A so-called \u0027no deal\u0027 scenario may sound scary but \u0027no deal\u0027 does not actually mean no deal. It simply means the UK would trade on WTO terms which we use already to trade with most of the world.The fight to deliver a proper Brexit starts here and now. How Brexiteers\u0027 hopes were shattered by a single meeting"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/08/09/4E07B7C100000578-0-image-a-6_1531039254881.jpg","title":"Bulls runners endure slippery start second day Pamplona festival","story":"    Two festivalgoers try to hold off a rampaging bull as one of them struggles to get off the ground in the center of the city\u0027s bull ring          A man is carried aloft as he is smashed into by one of the rampaging animals inside the stadium complex on Sunday morning          An enraged bull smashes into a runner against the hoardings as several horrified onlookers watch on from the safety of the stands          A worried team of medical services personnel carry an injured man away on a stretcher after he was hit by the galloping bulls          A man receiving urgent medical attention in the middle of the street as medics hold up a sheet to cover the patient from the rain          A couple kiss in the street after the bull run is over and the streets empty out following the second day of the Running of the BullsPamplona bull run 2018: All you need to know about San...‘I thought I was in Pamplona’: Nine bulls ‘rampage’ through...Thousands take to the streets in Spain to protest against...Share this article    Terrified revellers flee in utter panic as the charging bovines head towards them with razor-sharp horns capable of goring          A man is sandwiched between two one-tonne beasts as the charging pack makes its way through the narrow city streets          Dozens of frightened runners scramble to get out of the way of a hulking bull as they fling themselves to the side of the cobbled streets for safety.

The stunning venue has attracted a list guests like Jack Nicholson and Michael DouglasAckergill Tower is believed to date from 1475 and over its 500-year history it was often besieged during feuds between Scottish clans.It was extended in the mid-19th century by Scottish architect David Bryce and was restored in the 1980s to its former grandeur.   Businessman Mike Clare, who founded bed retailer Dreams, bought and converted it in 2009 but he is now selling the impressive property.The property currently operates as a country house hotel but has also been an exclusive wedding, party and conference venue in the past.The five-storey tower is steeped in history but has had 21st century luxuries added and has 32 bedrooms, 31 bathrooms and ten reception rooms including the impressive wood-panelled Great Hall.There is plenty of additional accommodation in the 30 acres of grounds, including the converted stables which sleep ten people and Europe\u0027s largest treehouse, which sleeps two.The treehouse is in a 150-year-old Sycamore tree and has a 7ft round bed and a large circular bath, as well as 360-degree views of the surrounding woodland and a \u0027twilight ceiling\u0027 so guests can gaze up at the stars through the tree\u0027s branches.

The castle itself was built 600 years ago           The striking 15th century Scottish castle stands on the shoreline at Sinclair Bay on the northernmost tip of ScotlandThere is also the Smugglers Inn pub, a beautiful Victorian walled garden, a Bothy and a boathouse.It also has a lease of shooting and fishing rights over a neighbouring 3,000 acres.Michael Jones from Knight Frank said: \u0027It\u0027s a totally unique property, the tower is spectacular in itself and the location is also spectacular right on the sea.\u0027It\u0027s currently running as a hotel but for some wealthy people it would be a great place to have a private residence as well - you could certainly do a fair bit of entertaining.\u0027You could use the main castle as your home and use the other properties on the site as guest accommodation when you need it or as holiday rentals.          The tower has attracted some world famous guests including entrepreneur Richard Bransom, Jack Nicholson and Michael Douglas          A treehouse has been built around a 150 year old sycamore tree in the grounds of the luxury tower. The treehouse features a large circular bath, 7ft round bed and use of a microwave and fridge          Fine dining and events have been held at the castle for decades. Weddings and functions are also held at the £3.9m venue            The Ackergill Tower Estate has its own pub called the ‘Smugglers Inn\u0027 which features a log fire and a fully stocked bar for guests to relax in \u0027There\u0027s a whole variety of possible uses and we\u0027ve had a real mix of interest from the commercial sector and private owners.\u0027It looks a long way north, it is at the top of Scotland but there\u0027s an airport nearby and helicopters can land at the castle itself.\u0027It\u0027s got stunning views across the water and it\u0027s a spectacular position on the clifftop.\u0027This is a very rare opportunity.

Over that time, I have listened to every possible idea and every possible version of Brexit. This is the right Brexit.’Critics have voiced concerns about how under Mrs May’s plan, British goods will still follow rules from Brussels, with a continued role for the European Court of Justice.But the Prime Minister will argue that her plan respects the referendum result, saying: ‘This is the Brexit that is in our national interest. It is the Brexit that will deliver on the democratic decision of the British people.’    Environment Secretary Michael Gove, a leading figure in the Brexit campaign, urged Tory Eurosceptics to ‘get behind the Prime Minister’Asked if the plan was everything he hoped for, Mr Gove told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘No, but then I’m a realist and one of the things about politics is you mustn’t, you shouldn’t make the perfect the enemy of the good.’But backbench Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said: ‘I can’t support the offer which emerged at Chequers – I think it’s a breach of the red lines, in fact the offer is so poor that I couldn’t support it even if the EU were paying us for it.‘Obviously if the Government and the Prime Minister continue to support that very poor offer, then I won’t have any confidence in the Government or the Prime Minister.’Another Eurosceptic backbencher added: ‘We are still committed to making sure we honour the result of the referendum. That is our priority. It might not be Theresa May’s priority any more, but it certainly is our priority.’Under Conservative Party rules, 15 per cent of their MPs – a total of 48 – must write to the chairman of the 1922 Committee expressing no-confidence in the Prime Minister to trigger a leadership contest.Eurosceptic backbenchers last night claimed that several letters had been submitted. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/08/10/4E08C19300000578-0-image-m-24_1531040722962.jpg","title":"The inside story fateful Brexit summit Chequers","story":"    As Cabinet ministers gathered in the Great Hall at Chequers on Friday morning, sipping coffee or fresh orange juice, there were one or two nervous jokes about political assassinationsOne wag in the PM’s team announced loudly that there was a stash of business cards available for Aston’s, the local mini cab firm for ‘ministers who couldn’t make the right decisions for the country’ and would need to make their own way back to London.A jest or not, they were left in no doubt that the moment they resigned they would no longer have access to the chauffeur driven cars that had swept them down the long cobbled Victory drive, flanked by beech trees that were a gift from Sir Winston Churchill, to the 16th century Buckinghamshire mansion.Some 40 minutes later, the Cabinet were ushered into the wood-panelled Hawtrey Room, where Churchill recorded some of his stirring wartime broadcasts. Then the Prime Minister swept in wearing a purple dress trimmed in green. ‘The colour of the suffragettes,’ observed one minister who thought it ‘very significant’ in the 100th anniversary of the first women securing the vote. The topic for discussion was a 120-page document on the Facilitated Customs Arrangement (FCA) which most had received only the afternoon before. Questions went back and forth rapidly.Someone asked for clarification of some of the figures and Chancellor Philip Hammond answered. Ten minutes later he was still talking, at which point he was cut off by the PM who chided that it wasn’t the time for speeches.As the temperature steadily rose – there is no air conditioning at Chequers, the weekend retreat of every prime minister since the end of the First World War – most people took off their jackets.Even Britain’s bearded ambassador to the EU Sir Tim Barrow, in his trademark three piece suit, stripped down to his waistcoat.Brexiteers blast \u0027snake in the grass\u0027 Gove for backing May\u0027s...Furious Brexiteer Tory MPs demand a vote of no confidence in...Share this articleThen Mrs May asked Julian Smith, the Chief Whip, to speak.‘Oh God,’ said Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary. Quick as a flash, the PM retorted: ‘He’ll like that as an introduction.’ Smith’s assessment was crucial to May’s subsequent victory, because he bluntly warned that without the FCA compromise the Government would certainly lose a Commons vote on July 16 and be forced to stay in the Customs Union. His remarks had a sobering effect. They broke for a buffet lunch, on the sun-drenched patio, of barbecue chicken thighs with a selection of salads made using produce from the Chequers estate. For dessert there were scones and cream and sticky tea loaf.Boris Johnson, a Cabinet heavyweight in more ways than one, was seen prodding the loaf with a fork but resisted taking a bite.At 2pm, they reassembled in the Grand Parlour as the thermometer on the wall hit 27.3C. Windows were thrown open and the Chequers team ferried in chilled Diet Coke and elderflower cordial.For those who needed more of a sugar rush, a bag of Haribo sweets also went round, with Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt photographed ing in, although nothing passed his lips apparently. ‘He’s thinking about his public image all the time,’ observed one source drily.The Prime Minister then spoke for six minutes looking down only occasionally at her notes.‘There was a touch of Elizabeth I about her. Haughty, almost regal, she was confident and assured,’ one minister said admiringly.David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister and de facto deputy PM, went next. A former Europe minister, arch Remainer, and fully paid-up cheerleader for May, he banged the drum for the FCA. No surprise there.    The most telling intervention came just after 3pm from Michael Gove (pictured), who said: ‘I feel we should all back the PM and support her in her efforts to make this work’All eyes, however, were on David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, whom May then called to speak. It was a pivotal moment. Davis had little to do with the FCA, which was drawn up by civil servants who now appear to be leading the negotiations. He made clear he disagreed with the plan and warned the EU would come back for ‘even more concessions’. But it was clear that he would accept the majority view.One senior source said: ‘He is a realist who knows we are leaving the EU albeit not exactly on the terms he wanted, and he also relishes his Cabinet role.’ Boris Johnson appeared surprised to be called next. In a six-minute ‘rant’ or ‘whinge’, depending who you spoke to, he despaired that the customs plan had ‘emerged zombie-like from the coffin’.The most telling intervention came just after 3pm from Michael Gove, the Environment Secretary. Stressing that the FCA was not his preferred option and arguing they must make more plans for ‘no deal’, he said: ‘I feel we should all back the PM and support her in her efforts to make this work.’The words had the desired effect. ‘It changed everything,’ said another source. There was a rumble of supportive noises and suddenly the little bubble of rebellion had burst – although critics were determined to have their say. Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom was ‘vehemently’ against the policy but ended by saying: ‘I will support you, Prime Minister.’Another notable contribution came from Penny Mordaunt, the International Aid Secretary, who made clear her own misgivings, while Esther McVey, the Work and Pensions Secretary and close ally of backbench Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith, also trashed the plan.After all 29 ministers had spoken, with seven making clear their opposition, the PM addressed them again saying there was a majority for the policy and demanding a return to Cabinet collective responsibility.‘We have seen what happens when a team is united and gets behind their leader,’ she said – a clear reference to the England footballers’ World Cup success.With the discussions over, they toasted a rare outbreak of Cabinet unity with Pol Roger champagne, the favourite of Churchill. In a jocular speech Boris Johnson proposed a toast to the Prime Minister, who interrupted to say: ‘If only people could see how united we are now.’ But can it last? "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/08/22/4DFB7DFA00000578-0-image-m-5_1531084504345.jpg","title":"David Davis resigns Brexit Secretary","story":"      Brexit Secretary David Davis, pictured at the British Grand Prix on Sunday, has resigned after days of Cabinet tension over Theresa May\u0027s plans for the UK\u0027s departure from the European Union He said: \u0027With her Government in chaos, if she clings on, it\u0027s clear she\u0027s more interested in hanging on for her own sake than serving the people of our country.\u0027In his letter Mr Davis, describing himself as a \u0027reluctant conscript\u0027 to the PM\u0027s proposals, told Theresa May \u0027the current trend of policy and tactics\u0027 is making it \u0027look less and less likely\u0027 that the UK will leave the customs union and single market. He said: \u0027At each stage I have accepted collective responsibility because it is part of my task to find workable compromises, and because I considered it was still possible to deliver on the mandate of the referendum, and on our manifesto commitment to leave the Customs Union and the Single Market. \u0027I am afraid that I think the current trend of policy and tactic is making that look like and less likely. \u0027The Cabinet decision on Friday crystallised this problem.

It was a serious mistake.\u0027  Mrs May will say her plan will mean \u0027a complete end to freedom of movement, taking back control of our borders\u0027 as well as \u0027no more sending vast sums of money each year to the EU\u0027 and \u0027the freedom to strike new trade deals around the world\u0027.  Michael Gove was previously lashed as the \u0027snake in the grass\u0027 responsible for betraying the referendum yesterday but he insisted May\u0027s Brexit blueprint would honour the 2016 vote.Asked if the plan was everything he hoped for, Mr Gove told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘No, but then I’m a realist and one of the things about politics is you mustn’t, you shouldn’t make the perfect the enemy of the good.’In a sign of the anger and ision amongst the Eurosceptics, backbench MPs yesterday said they had sent messages to the Brexiteers in the Cabinet, asking: \u0027Where is your backbone?\u0027  Some Remain-supporting politicians said the resignation of Mr Davis was evidence of the need for a second referendum.Baron Adonis, a prominent backer of the move, tweeted: \u0027People\u0027s Vote to put Brexit out of its misery a big step closer after DD\u0027s resignation. Now the Brexiters holding Mrs May hostage are falling out, there isn\u0027t a majority for ANY withdrawal treaty in Parliament.\u0027The Liberal Democrats called on people to sign a petition for a vote on the Brexit deal, adding: \u0027The resignation of David Davis is yet more evidence of the chaos of this Tory Brexit. You deserve the final say on this shambolic Brexit with the chance to stay in the EU.\u0027 Meanwhile EU diplomats last night criticised Theresa May\u0027s new Brexit plan for taking a \u0027have cake and eat it\u0027 approach to the single market.The Prime Minister will have to water down her proposals even further to please Brussels and strike a deal, European leaders and officials believe.EU negotiators want to study the full 120-page White Paper – to be published by Downing Street on Thursday – but yesterday expressed scepticism about whether the new British plan will be acceptable to Brussels.  The main sticking point is Mrs May\u0027s proposal to keep the UK tied to the EU on goods and agricultural products only.The bloc has long warned it will not accept any \u0027cherry-picking\u0027 in relation to the single market\u0027s four freedoms on goods, services, people and capital.  Simon Coveney, Ireland\u0027s minister for foreign affairs and trade, said the EU\u0027s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, will find it \u0027difficult\u0027 to accept the proposal.He added: \u0027The EU has never been keen to facilitate a breaking up of an approach toward the single market in terms of keeping all of the elements of the single market intact and consistent, so I think Britain will find it difficult to persuade the EU to support the approach they\u0027re now proposing.\u0027Michel Barnier will be a very, very strong defender of the EU interests here, in terms of protecting the integrity of the single market and the integrity of the EU customs union.\u0027    Prime Minister Theresa May has faced a series of Cabinet members leaving their positions since the snap election last June.The first to leave was defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon, who resigned his post after being caught up in Westminster sleaze allegations.He said his behaviour had \u0027fallen below the high standards required\u0027 after he admitted putting his hand on the knee of radio presenter Julia Hartley-Brewer some years ago when he resigned on November 1.One week later, Priti Patel quit as international development secretary over undisclosed and unauthorised meetings in Israel, including with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.In her resignation letter, she echoed the words of Sir Michael, saying her actions \u0027fell below the high standards\u0027 expected.The following month, Ms May\u0027s deputy Damian Green left the Cabinet after a probe found he made \u0027inaccurate and misleading\u0027 statements about pornography on his computer.Justine Greening was sacked in the PM\u0027s reshuffle in January after refusing to move from her education post to the Department for Work and Pensions.Home secretary Amber Rudd resigned in April after admitting she had \u0027inadvertently\u0027 misled MPs over the existence of targets for removing illegal immigrants over the Windrush scandal.      Davis (left) ran against David Cameron (right) for the Tory leadership after Michael Howard resigned in 2005 but lost the electionHe was regarded by many as the likely next Tory leader after Michael Howard announced he was to resign, but after a weak campaign - in his second tilt at the leadership - he was soundly beaten in 2005.His rival, David Cameron, had caught the mood with his careful presentation and youthful optimism.In the 2001 leadership contest, Mr Davis cut his losses and quit after twice finishing way down the pack in early ballots of Tory MPs, throwing his support behind Iain Duncan Smith.The contest successfully raised his profile and Mr Duncan Smith appointed him party chairman.A libertarian who was never afraid to speak his mind, even if his opinions fell outside the party line, he worked closely with former Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti.His friendship with former Downing Street spin chief Alastair Campbell raised Conservative eyebrows.Mr Davis once revealed that he offered to buy Mr Campbell\u0027s old newspaper the Daily Mirror so the former journalist could edit it.He put their unlikely friendship down to his liking for \u0027strong mavericks\u0027 and there is something of that description in him. Despite Eurosceptic views, he acted as a whip for John Major during the bruising battle to ratify the Maastricht Treaty.Mr Davis has previously listed mountaineering, parachuting and flying light aircraft among his more athletic pursuits.                                                               Cabinet ministers gathered at Chequers on Friday (pictured) but plans have now been thrown into chaos by Mr Davis\u0027s resignation Was Davis\u0027s departure telegraphed?The Brexit Secretary was understood to have serious reservations about both the plan and whether it could be acceptable to Brussels following the Chequers summit, but was absent from the television studios in the aftermath of the talks. He has been close to the exit door on a number of occasions in recent months. Last year reports emerged that Davis said he intended to \u0027retire\u0027 in 2019 and leave the transitional period of Britain\u0027s exit from the European Union to Boris Johnson, something later dismissed as a \u0027lighthearted remark\u0027.Is Davis the first of many?There was a feeling that any departure - be it immediately after the summit or once the EU made it clear Britain\u0027s terms were unacceptable - could trigger a series of resignations from the front benches, particularly from hardliners.

A player whose patriotism (witness his vein-bulging celebration after netting that goal on Saturday) and boyish passion for the game is such that, in 2016, he travelled to France for the European Championships – not as a member of the England team, but as a supporter, with a group of mates.Another walk in the park! After cruising to victory over...Share this articleHe may have the obligatory nice house and car these days, and enjoys exotic holidays with his beautiful fiancee Fern Hawkins – a 23-year-old physiotherapy graduate to whom he proposed during a romantic break in Paris last February after a seven-year courtship.Yet in all other ways, Maguire – whose playing style combines the elegance of Bobby Moore with the brute-strength of Big Jack Charlton – is a throwback to the England heroes of 1966. There is even something old-fashioned about his self-deprecating manner of speech and his surprisingly gentle South Yorkshire brogue. Yesterday, his former youth coach, John Pemberton, described him to me as ‘a level-headed, ordinary Sheffield lad, from a really supportive background’ but also remarked on his extraordinary ‘presence’.          Here is a £4million-a-year Premier League footballer who still buys terrace tickets to watch Sheffield United, the home-city team he once played for, and has supported since boyhoodAnother generation would doubtless deem lantern-jawed Harry as just the type you would want beside you in the trenches.He was already a role model for pupils at his old school, St Mary’s Catholic High in Chesterfield, long before the World Cup. Photos of him in England attire are showcased in the corridors, and he often returns to give motivational talks, coach and help raise money for charity. (His sister Daisy, 17, is still a pupil there, but has been given time off to watch him in Russia).Now, although he has played just ten games for England, and only turned 25 in March, the Leicester City centre-back has, in his undemonstrative way, also become a talisman for England.The team’s unimagined success is based on the rock-like defensive partnership he forms with fellow Yorkshiremen Kyle Walker, also of Sheffield, and John Stones, born in Barnsley. A backbone to the team as rugged and formidable as the Pennines. Before this magical World Cup, however, Maguire was hardly a household name. Indeed, few non-football fans would have heard of him, and only a few months ago it seemed unlikely Gareth Southgate would pick him ahead of players from more glamorous clubs.          Another generation would doubtless deem lantern-jawed Harry as just the type you would want beside you in the trenchesThis, after all, a player who, at 15 was a little on the chubby side – as we can see from a recently-emerged photo of him losing a school 400m race (pictured) – and whose career meandered through Sheffield, Hull and Wigan before Leicester City bought him a year ago, for £17million. So how has he emerged as one of the tournament’s true superstars?His is a story of steel and grit. He and his brothers, Joe, 27, and Laurence, 21, were encouraged to play by their father, Alan Maguire, 51, who played semi-professionally working his way up in the Co-operative Insurance Society. He is now a financial services director.‘We were football mad in the house,’ Maguire has said, describing how he and his brothers would scrap for the ball in the garden. ‘I don’t know how mum coped at times. I’m sure there were plenty of broken windows’. His father also ‘used to go mad’ because they churned up the lawn. Joe Maguire became a part-time footballer. Laurence plays for Chesterfield, who were relegated from the Football League last season (last weekend the club amusingly explained his absence from a pre-season friendly by saying he had ‘a bout of Russian flu’). They are attending the World Cup with a large contingent of family and friends, including Fern, who wears Harry’s white number 6 shirt, and Daisy, who yesterday tweeted a picture of them with her brother after the Sweden match. Watching him score had been ‘the best feeling ever,’ she declared.Maguire was a bright lad and passed eight GCSEs, with four A*s. Had he not become a footballer, he says he would have studied A-levels, with maths his first choice. Certainly, during his early years at St Mary’s, some teachers thought he would have been wiser to follow an academic path.‘When he first joined us, at 11, you could see he was one of our good players, but did I think he’d be playing in a World Cup quarter final? Absolutely not,’ says Martin McKee, head of PE at the school, which claims some credit for the Corinthian spirit with which Maguire plays, because it places great emphasis on good sportsmanship and correct behaviour.          Maguire was a bright lad and passed eight GCSEs, with four A*s. Had he not become a footballer, he says he would have studied A-levels, with maths his first choiceAs he honed his strength and skill in those garden games, wearing England shirts bearing the names of idols such as John Terry and Rio Ferdinand (who described his performance against Sweden as ‘immense’) Maguire set his heart on emulating them.After a brief spell at Barnsley FC’s junior academy, he joined Sheffield United, where, by 18, he had broken into the first team. Travis Binnion, director of its youth academy, whose prodigies are sent on work experience in places such as asphalt works to toughen them up, believes Maguire’s time there was character-forming. ‘It’s a working-class city and doesn’t tolerate big-time Charlies. The fans demand effort and endeavour,’ he said. ‘As a kid, he was very confident on the pitch, but off it he was down-to-earth and quite reserved. He had the air that he knew best, but not in a big-headed way. He would listen, but he would back his ability to know the game, and he was very bright. You could see the cogs ticking in his head.’Ah yes, that head. It might contain plenty of grey matter, but it propels the ball with such thunderous velocity that team-mate Jamie Vardy has nicknamed him ‘Slab-head’.Maguire will doubtless take the ribbing in good part, for nothing seems to faze him. As he says: ‘I try to keep my feet on the floor, stay humble, and let my ability do the talking.’ It has certainly spoken eloquently this past fortnight. ‘Cry God for Harry, England and St George!’ is no longer a chant that belongs solely to captain Harry Kane.Maguire’s performances have been so outstanding that fans of clubs such as Manchester United are now begging their owners to buy him, whatever the price.If he does finally join some big name club when this glorious World Cup idyll is over, he’d better splash out on a new kit-bag or his mother will slaughter him."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/09/01/4DDBCB7600000578-0-image-m-5_1531094892479.jpg","title":"Ex Nato boss tells Theresa increase defence spending 3 GDP","story":"    Former Nato Secretary General Lord Robertson urged Theresa May to increase defence spendingTwo former military chiefs today warn the Government to confront \u0027lazy criticism\u0027 of Nato and increase defence spending to 3 per cent of GDP.Former Nato Secretary General Lord Robertson and ex-Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon say politicians must remind people of the organisation\u0027s achievements as it nears its 70th birthday.In a thinly-veiled attack on Donald Trump, who has repeatedly criticised the alliance, they write in a foreword to a report: \u0027Nato is arguably more important to the UK today than at any time since 1949, as we seek to preserve our security and prosperity.\u0027Our Government and our political classes have a responsibility to remind people of Nato\u0027s historical purpose and all the advantages it has brought to the West, in general, and the UK, in particular.\u0027Complacency, apathy and lazy criticism of the Alliance needs to be tackled head on.

But what I think may be what is missing is the voice of business in parking.\u0027I know in my own local authority we had a situation where you can park all day for free – you would think that is what shopkeepers want.\u0027Guess what? It\u0027s not – they want you to be able to park for an hour or two hours for free because they want you to leave and new customers with fresh money in their pocket to arrive.

And he said attractions for visitors to enjoy while they were in town centres could woo more shoppers to struggling stores.He added: \u0027If political leadership knew that shops and businesses were struggling to have their voice heard they would want to do something about it.\u0027We should be working with local authorities at finding ways bringing things like gyms, childcare maybe even day care for the elderly on to the High Street.\u0027Speaking about the High Street in Ashford, Kent, he said: \u0027There are art galleries. There is a bandstand ... I don\u0027t think bandstands are the only solution but I want more things that will bring people into the centre.\u0027Tough conditions on Britain\u0027s high streets have cost around 50,000 retail jobs since the start of the year. Bricks and mortar businesses complain part of the problem is an unfair advantage enjoyed by web giants such as Amazon, which do not have to pay expensive business rates on physical shops, relying instead on huge out-of-town warehouses.Launched last Monday, the Mail\u0027s Save our High Streets campaign calls on the Government to reform business rates and has already received the backing of a string of major stores.Mr Berry said shoppers also had a duty to support retailers. He added: \u0027It is absolutely incumbent on all of us to go out and support the High Street. There is nothing greater than the great British High Street. It is a huge community asset for our nation.\u0027Yesterday the idea was backed by the British Retail Consortium but the group said changes to business rates were also crucial.A spokesman said: \u0027With high street stores under enormous pressure it\u0027s sensible for the Government to look at every measure which could increase footfall.\u0027Free, or at least more affordable, parking could make a real difference in encouraging more consumers into town centres.\u0027However, these initiatives alone aren\u0027t enough – if the Government is serious about helping struggling shops they need to commit to a two-year freeze on business rates.\u0027Only by reducing the significant costs currently facing retailers who operate from property can Government make a real difference to help preserve as many shops as possible.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/08/23/4E0AAF2300000578-0-image-m-5_1531089672399.jpg","title":"Four 10 voters believe Theresa Mays Chequers deal betrayal Brexit","story":"    Nearly four in ten voters believe Theresa May’s Chequers deal is a betrayal of the referendum amid a hostile reaction from the Tory party faithful, it was revealed last nightBut the Prime Minister has seen a rise in support for her taking her party into the next election, due in 2022.Some 34 per cent thought she should keep hold of the reigns, 24 per cent said she should resign now, while 24 per cent said she should step down after Britain formally leaves the EU in March next year.David Davis quits and sparks a Tory Brexiteer rebellion that...Jacob Rees-Mogg cheers on David Davis\u0027 sensational...Share this article    An opinion poll found that 35 per cent believe the Brexit compromise agreed by the Cabinet is the best deal Britain will get from the EU, while 38 per cent dismissed it as a sell-outA separate online poll of Tory members by the Conservative Home website revealed widespread unhappiness with the Chequers plan amongst the party faithful.Some 61 per cent of the 1,225 respondents said that that proposal would be a bad deal for Britain, compared to 31 per cent who thought it would be good. A further eight per cent were unsure. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/07/19/4E03D36B00000578-0-image-m-36_1530986480677.jpg","title":"The Whos Roger Daltrey struggled write autobiography remember parts life","story":"    The Who’s Roger Daltrey has revealed the biggest problem to writing his autobiographyThe Who’s Roger Daltrey has revealed the biggest problem to writing his autobiography – he can’t remember parts of his life.The 74-year-old singer said: ‘The scariest thing about the memoir is that I have had four serious concussions in my life. \u0027There are huge gaps and I wonder why. \u0027But there is no wonder why.’The worst incident was in 1996, when he was knocked unconscious with a microphone stand.It was by Gary Glitter in rehearsals for a performance of the band’s rock opera Quadrophenia in Hyde Park.He said: ‘I broke my eye socket.Halsey breaks down while performing Sorry at Michigan...Demi Lovato seemingly \u0027shades\u0027 her ex life coach with...Share this article\u0027I was out for 20 minutes.\u0027 I did the show with a patch holding my eye in. \u0027That is a little bit concerning.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/08/08/06D50AA3000003E8-0-image-a-3_1531033943129.jpg","title":"Soft deal EU cost Tories power heavier defeat 1997","story":"Agreeing a soft Brexit with Brussels will cost the Tories power in a defeat which could be heavier than 1997, Brexiteer MPs have warned Theresa May (pictured today in Maidenhead with husband Philip)          Eurosceptics, many of whom are led by Jacob Rees-Mogg (file image), feel betrayed at the Brexit blueprint the Prime Minister forced her Cabinet to accept in a major showdown at Chequers on Friday.Eurosceptics told the Sunday Telegraph finalising a deal on Friday\u0027s blueprint - involving a \u0027common rulebook\u0027 with the EU - would be a \u0027seismic moment\u0027.They said it would encourage millions of voters buy into opposition party assertions that the Conservatives \u0027do not care about ordinary people\u0027.The source warned: \u0027If that narrative takes hold, 1997 will look like a vicar\u0027s tea party.\u0027Voters back Theresa May over her Brexit deal but Labour has...Boris in four-letter attack on May: Foreign Secretary stuns...Share this article    Mrs May published her 12-point Brexit blueprint following an historic showdown with her Cabinet on Friday night \u0027In detailed discussions the Cabinet has agreed our collective position for the future of our negotiations with the EU,\u0027 Mrs May said on Friday night.\u0027Now we must all move at pace to negotiate our proposal with the EU to deliver the prosperous and secure future all our people deserve.\u0027The statement came after a bitter war of words over Mrs May\u0027s plan that had threatened to spiral out of control.

They are selfish iniduals who put career before country. \u0027It is pretty bloody obvious they prefer their ministerial cars.\u0027Mr Gove\u0027s decision may backfire and destroy his rekindled leadership ambitions. \u0027His pretensions to being a credible leader have been blown to smithereens,\u0027 said one senior Brexiteer to the paper.\u0027He\u0027s a busted flush.\u0027 An ally of Mr Johnson said: \u0027There is no doubt we would be heading for an even softer Brexit had Boris not been around the table.\u0027 Anger at Mrs May\u0027s proposals was growing today.Veteran Brexiteer Sir Bill Cash said the proposals left \u0027a lot of questions\u0027 and warned the Prime Minister a confidence vote was unstoppable if 48 Tory MPs write to 1922 Committee chairman Graham Brady.Sir Bill told Sky News: \u0027There\u0027s a lot of unhappiness.. is this going to be a proper Brexit?\u0027 Tory MP Andrew Bridgen told Radio 5Live: \u0027I\u0027m very, very disappointed with the offer that we\u0027ve seen coming out of Chequers. I\u0027m disappointed that so called Brexiteers in the Cabinet didn\u0027t pick up the cudgels and fight for a better offer.\u0027Bearing in mind this is an offer it\u0027s not a deal because it will be undoubtedly from the record, further diluted by the EU during negotiations. T\u0027To be honest having looked at the three page summary, I haven\u0027t seen the 120 page detail, but I imagine that it will have been spun by No 10 as that\u0027s the best of the deal.\u0027I\u0027ve seen Martin Howe QC\u0027s legal opinion. I wouldn\u0027t support this deal if the EU were paying us.\u0027    Boris Johnson, pictured left, stunned fellow ministers with a four-letter dismissal of Theresa May\u0027s Brexit plan during Friday\u0027s Chequers meeting after Mrs May, right, called for loyaltyToday\u0027s accounts of Friday\u0027s showdown revealed Foreign Secretary Mr Johnson stunned fellow Ministers with his four-letter dismissal of the Prime Minister\u0027s plan at Friday\u0027s special Chequers summit designed to unite the Cabinet. His comment risks making him the first victim of Mrs May\u0027s fresh crackdown on dissent.Mr Johnson – who has been accused of betrayal by Tory Brexiteers for not blocking Mrs May\u0027s \u0027soft Brexit\u0027 proposals – spoke out against the plan for the UK to remain in Bline with Brussels rules in a new free trade zone with the EU.According to a reliable source, he complained that anyone obliged to defend the proposals would be \u0027polishing a turd\u0027.He added sarcastically: \u0027Luckily we have some expert turd polishers\u0027 – shooting a glance at one of Mrs May\u0027s spin doctors.Challenging the Prime Minister\u0027s new policy to her face, he said that her decision to try to \u0027align\u0027 UK trading rules with the EU would reduce Britain to the humiliating status of a \u0027vassal state\u0027.He also took issue with her cher-ished new customs plan, the Facilitated Customs Arrangement (FCA), claiming it would be a \u0027serious inhibitor\u0027 to striking new trade deals with non-EU countries.His outburst was revealed just hours after Mrs May tried to draw a red line under weeks of open dissent from her Ministers, vowing that from now on she will enforce collective Cabinet responsibility and sack any Ministers who defy her. Some senior Tories believe she may be forced to fire Mr Johnson.    The outburst was revealed hours after Mrs May threatened to sack disloyal ministersA Mail on Sunday poll today endorses her handling of the Cabinet showdown, with 33 per cent of voters supporting her Brexit plan and 23 per cent opposing it. The Survation poll, the first survey since the Chequers summit, suggests Mrs May has twice the support of Mr Johnson – although voters do not believe her plan is \u0027faithful\u0027 to the EU referendum result.Last night, Eurosceptic Tories said there was so much anger at the PM\u0027s \u0027sell-out\u0027 that some MPs would submit no-confidence letters to force a challenge to her leadership.And Jacob Rees-Mogg\u0027s pro-Brexit European Research Group said experts believe the Chequers deal left the UK \u0027on course for a \u0027black hole\u0027 Brexit\u0027 – meaning we would be sucked into the orbit of EU rules with no hope of escape.          Boris Johnson has launched an extraordinary four-letter attack on PM Theresa May over her Brexit plansMr Johnson made clear in the run-up to Friday\u0027s session that he was vehemently against any scheme which left us shackled to EU rules, leading to fears in Downing Street that he and other pro-Brexit Ministers could resign.But Mrs May launched her own plan to kill off his revolt: signalling in advance she had already lined up \u0027talented\u0027 junior Ministers to replace any Cabinet quitters forcing all those at the summit to hand over their phones to stop them briefing against her under the table and issuing an official No 10 communique declaring victory while her critics were still stuck inside arguing.          Tory MP Andrew Bridgen has accused Boris Johnson of raising the white flag over BrexitThis so-called Brexit deal is nothing short of a betrayal of the 17.4 million people who voted to leave the EU. What on earth were the staunch Leavers in the Cabinet doing?Where was Boris Johnson? At Chequers on Friday, we needed him to emulate his hero, Winston Churchill. Instead, he gave us a modern-day version of Neville Chamberlain.Sadly, the Foreign Secretary was not alone in apparently waving the white flag of appeasement in the direction of Brussels. Other Brexiteer buccaneers and recent Brexit converts also jumped ship.The door to Mrs May\u0027s country residence was open but they chose not to walk out of it. Perhaps the threat of the withdrawal of the Government limo was just too great.This is a huge mistake on two grounds. Firstly, all those harbouring leadership hopes have done their ambitions fatal harm. Grassroots party members will have no truck with their perceived treachery. Some will try to keep their leadership hopes alive by claiming it was not the time to quit and they had a duty to stay on to ensure Brexit is not further watered down. But it leaves only one credible contender with the integrity and backbone to follow Mrs May: Jacob Rees-Mogg.Secondly, Brexiteer Cabinet Ministers are losing their nerve at the wrong time. This is not the end of the battle – it is the start of the real fight for a true Brexit. What Theresa May unveiled last week appears little short of a punishment Brexit, designed by the EU to dissuade any other country from leaving the bloc.With no incentive to offer non-EU countries free trade deals when we leave, through mutual recognition of standards, the UK will forever remain a captive market for overpriced EU goods. It means going through the pretence of leaving but becoming a non-voting associate member, a vassal state.We would still be locked into the EU\u0027s suffocating embrace via this \u0027common rule book\u0027 while the dead hand of the European Court of Justice will be lurking in the background.In contrast, we should call Brussels\u0027 bluff and, if necessary, leave without a formal deal. A so-called \u0027no deal\u0027 scenario may sound scary but \u0027no deal\u0027 does not actually mean no deal. It simply means the UK would trade on WTO terms which we use already to trade with most of the world.The fight to deliver a proper Brexit starts here and now. How Brexiteers\u0027 hopes were shattered by a single meeting"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/08/10/4E08C97A00000578-0-image-a-2_1531040434881.jpg","title":"Hilarious moment politics professors cat interrupts live TV interview leaping HEAD","story":"    Lisio decided to hop on Dr Targalski\u0027s head as the professor was being interviewed on live TV          But Dr Targalski was not phased by the cat taking up his new position and carried on speaking          He remained unperturbed despite the ginger moggy wrapping its tail around his head At one point the moggy wrapped his tail around Dr Targalski\u0027s face - but the academic was still unperturbed.Dutch journalist Rudy Bouma, who was conducting the interview, shared a video of the cat\u0027s antics on Twitter and it has currently been shared almost 9000 times.Go-cats!

In any event, it could still be rejected by Brussels as being detrimental to the ‘integrity’ of its so-called ‘four single market freedoms’: goods, services, people and capital.Any agreement on a free trade deal for goods could yet see Brussels demanding further concessions from Britain.SOFT BREXIT RATING: 4‘COMMON RULEBOOK’PLEDGE: Britain to have a ‘common rulebook’ for food, farm and manufactured goods, shadowing EU regulations. It would also commit to ‘ongoing harmonisation’ with EU rules.REALITY: The common rulebook effectively means the UK would simply replicate every EU regulation as well as staying up to date with new ones (the process known as ‘ongoing harmonisation’).So if Brussels changed the rules on kettles, then Britain would be expected to follow suit. Critics claim this would hamper the UK’s ability to strike trade deals with other countries such as America, which adopts differing standards on animal welfare, for example.We would be unable to relax or tweak regulations to offer more choice to consumers.SOFT BREXIT RATING: 5THE LAWPLEDGE: Parliament to have the final say on incorporating European rules into UK law - and can reject any they do not like.REALITY: This suggests that MPs would have the power to opt out of any new EU rules they dislike, rather than the rules automatically coming into force as at present.But the Government accepts that not doing so will have ‘consequences’ for market access, security cooperation or the frictionless border – with the EU being able to punish any resistance. This would be a huge disincentive to Parliament to erge from EU rules.SOFT BREXIT RATING: 4    Prime Minister Theresa May leads a meeting with her cabinet at Chequers to discuss BrexitUK SERVICESPLEDGE: Britain will not abide by a ‘common rulebook’ for services, including banking and financing.REALITY: The UK’s world-leading services sector will enjoy ‘regulatory flexibility’. That means it will almost certainly lose its current levels of access to EU markets but companies will be unshackled to strike potentially lucrative agreements around the world.However, the City seems to be relaxed and has broadly welcomed the deal.SOFT BREXIT RATING: 1CUSTOMSPLEDGE: A new Facilitated Customs Arrangement (FCA) will remove the need for customs checks and controls between the UK and EU.REALITY: Designed to help solve the Irish border question, this means that imported goods would be charged a UK-set tariff unless they are to be sent on to the Continent. In these circumstances, the EU tariff would be charged and the money passed to Brussels.This is to maintain a frictionless Irish border but new technology will also be developed to track the movement of goods.Critics – such as Labour’s Sir Keir Starmer who want to stay in a customs union with the EU – say FCA will be an unworkable bureaucratic nightmare that restricts trade growth. Supporters say electronic systems are already used to monitor goods arriving in the UK from outside the EU.SOFT BREXIT RATING: 2Brexiteers blast \u0027snake in the grass\u0027 Gove for backing May\u0027s...A soft Brexit will see an even bigger landslide LABOUR...Share this articleWORLD TRADEPLEDGE: Britain will be able to deliver an independent trade policy, with its own seat at the World Trade Organisation, the ability to set our own tariffs and secure deals with other countries.REALITY: This is clearly intended to placate supporters of Brexit who say that one of the key benefits of quitting the EU is strengthening our links with emerging markets, such as India, South America, China and the rest of the Commonwealth.But if Britain simply aligns its regulations on goods the ability to strike trade deals with the rest of the world, including the US, will be jeopardised.SOFT BREXIT RATING: 3FARMS \u0026amp FISHPLEDGE: The UK will leave the Common Agricultural Policy and Common Fisheries Policy.REALITY: Britain will be able to strike its own path on farming and the CAP payments system, which Environment Secretary Michael Gove has dismissed as ‘unjust, inefficient and perverse’.Getting back control of our seas should guarantee a greater catch for British trawlermen. At present, around 40 per cent of England’s fishing quota is caught by foreign-owned vessels. Sceptics worry, however, that the EU will demand concessions on this in return for a free trade area in goods.SOFT BREXIT RATING: 1MIGRATIONPLEDGE: Free movement will end, giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country.REALITY: Concern about mass migration was one of the main reasons the public voted for Brexit. One of Mrs May’s red lines, she insists free movement from the EU will finish. But an as yet undefined ‘mobility framework’ mentioned in the Downing Street document appears to pave the way for EU and UK citizens to travel freely for work and study. It says this is ‘similar to what the UK may offer other close trading partners in the future’. More details on the future immigration policy are expected in the autumn and this remains unresolved.SOFT BREXIT RATING: 3          Concern about mass migration was one of the main reasons the public voted for BrexitUK COURTSPLEDGE: The supremacy of the UK’s courts will be restored and with it British sovereignty.REALITY: Ending the supremacy of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) was another of Mrs May’s red lines, but it is unclear how this will work alongside the pledge to follow EU rules on goods, the environment and social policy – meaning the UK will still be a ‘rule-taker’, not a ‘rule-maker’.The document says that UK courts would pay ‘due regard’ to the ECJ’s ruling. Disputes between the UK and EU would be decided using independent arbitration.SOFT BREXIT RATING: 4CASH TO EUPLEDGE: The UK will end ‘vast’ annual payments to EU budget.REALITY: Britain currently pays £10billion a year into Brussels coffers – 11 per cent of the bloc’s budget. This is to be slashed, says the document, ‘releasing funds for domestic priorities’ – in particular the Government’s long-term plan to give the NHS an extra £20billion a year by 2023.But it accepts there will still be ‘appropriate contributions’ to the EU for joint action in specific areas, such as science and innovation. And the UK has already agreed to pay a whopping £39million orce bill to leave the EU.SOFT BREXIT RATING: 3NO DEALPLEDGE: Step up preparedness for the ‘full range’ of outcomes that might result from negotiations – including no deal.REALITY: Triggering Article 50, Mrs May insisted that ‘no deal was better than a bad deal’. The implication was that she would ditch the negotiations if the EU sought to punish Britain for leaving. Following months of offering concession after concession, few now seriously believe she will walk away from the table – not least the EU’s negotiating team.Nevertheless, in what appears to be a sop to Brexiteers, the document says ‘no deal’ is a possibility and that preparations should be ‘stepped up’. Critics say this is too little, too late – and that more work should have been done months ago.SOFT BREXIT RATING: 3 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/08/10/4E08C19300000578-0-image-m-24_1531040722962.jpg","title":"Theresa insists chosen right Brexit Britain","story":"    Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Theresa May and her husband Philip arrive at church on Sunday.

Over that time, I have listened to every possible idea and every possible version of Brexit. This is the right Brexit.’Critics have voiced concerns about how under Mrs May’s plan, British goods will still follow rules from Brussels, with a continued role for the European Court of Justice.But the Prime Minister will argue that her plan respects the referendum result, saying: ‘This is the Brexit that is in our national interest. It is the Brexit that will deliver on the democratic decision of the British people.’    Environment Secretary Michael Gove, a leading figure in the Brexit campaign, urged Tory Eurosceptics to ‘get behind the Prime Minister’Asked if the plan was everything he hoped for, Mr Gove told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘No, but then I’m a realist and one of the things about politics is you mustn’t, you shouldn’t make the perfect the enemy of the good.’But backbench Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said: ‘I can’t support the offer which emerged at Chequers – I think it’s a breach of the red lines, in fact the offer is so poor that I couldn’t support it even if the EU were paying us for it.‘Obviously if the Government and the Prime Minister continue to support that very poor offer, then I won’t have any confidence in the Government or the Prime Minister.’Another Eurosceptic backbencher added: ‘We are still committed to making sure we honour the result of the referendum. That is our priority. It might not be Theresa May’s priority any more, but it certainly is our priority.’Under Conservative Party rules, 15 per cent of their MPs – a total of 48 – must write to the chairman of the 1922 Committee expressing no-confidence in the Prime Minister to trigger a leadership contest.Eurosceptic backbenchers last night claimed that several letters had been submitted. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/08/10/4E08C19300000578-0-image-m-24_1531040722962.jpg","title":"The inside story fateful Brexit summit Chequers","story":"    As Cabinet ministers gathered in the Great Hall at Chequers on Friday morning, sipping coffee or fresh orange juice, there were one or two nervous jokes about political assassinationsOne wag in the PM’s team announced loudly that there was a stash of business cards available for Aston’s, the local mini cab firm for ‘ministers who couldn’t make the right decisions for the country’ and would need to make their own way back to London.A jest or not, they were left in no doubt that the moment they resigned they would no longer have access to the chauffeur driven cars that had swept them down the long cobbled Victory drive, flanked by beech trees that were a gift from Sir Winston Churchill, to the 16th century Buckinghamshire mansion.Some 40 minutes later, the Cabinet were ushered into the wood-panelled Hawtrey Room, where Churchill recorded some of his stirring wartime broadcasts. Then the Prime Minister swept in wearing a purple dress trimmed in green. ‘The colour of the suffragettes,’ observed one minister who thought it ‘very significant’ in the 100th anniversary of the first women securing the vote. The topic for discussion was a 120-page document on the Facilitated Customs Arrangement (FCA) which most had received only the afternoon before. Questions went back and forth rapidly.Someone asked for clarification of some of the figures and Chancellor Philip Hammond answered. Ten minutes later he was still talking, at which point he was cut off by the PM who chided that it wasn’t the time for speeches.As the temperature steadily rose – there is no air conditioning at Chequers, the weekend retreat of every prime minister since the end of the First World War – most people took off their jackets.Even Britain’s bearded ambassador to the EU Sir Tim Barrow, in his trademark three piece suit, stripped down to his waistcoat.Brexiteers blast \u0027snake in the grass\u0027 Gove for backing May\u0027s...Furious Brexiteer Tory MPs demand a vote of no confidence in...Share this articleThen Mrs May asked Julian Smith, the Chief Whip, to speak.‘Oh God,’ said Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary. Quick as a flash, the PM retorted: ‘He’ll like that as an introduction.’ Smith’s assessment was crucial to May’s subsequent victory, because he bluntly warned that without the FCA compromise the Government would certainly lose a Commons vote on July 16 and be forced to stay in the Customs Union. His remarks had a sobering effect. They broke for a buffet lunch, on the sun-drenched patio, of barbecue chicken thighs with a selection of salads made using produce from the Chequers estate. For dessert there were scones and cream and sticky tea loaf.Boris Johnson, a Cabinet heavyweight in more ways than one, was seen prodding the loaf with a fork but resisted taking a bite.At 2pm, they reassembled in the Grand Parlour as the thermometer on the wall hit 27.3C. Windows were thrown open and the Chequers team ferried in chilled Diet Coke and elderflower cordial.For those who needed more of a sugar rush, a bag of Haribo sweets also went round, with Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt photographed ing in, although nothing passed his lips apparently. ‘He’s thinking about his public image all the time,’ observed one source drily.The Prime Minister then spoke for six minutes looking down only occasionally at her notes.‘There was a touch of Elizabeth I about her. Haughty, almost regal, she was confident and assured,’ one minister said admiringly.David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister and de facto deputy PM, went next. A former Europe minister, arch Remainer, and fully paid-up cheerleader for May, he banged the drum for the FCA. No surprise there.    The most telling intervention came just after 3pm from Michael Gove (pictured), who said: ‘I feel we should all back the PM and support her in her efforts to make this work’All eyes, however, were on David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, whom May then called to speak. It was a pivotal moment. Davis had little to do with the FCA, which was drawn up by civil servants who now appear to be leading the negotiations. He made clear he disagreed with the plan and warned the EU would come back for ‘even more concessions’. But it was clear that he would accept the majority view.One senior source said: ‘He is a realist who knows we are leaving the EU albeit not exactly on the terms he wanted, and he also relishes his Cabinet role.’ Boris Johnson appeared surprised to be called next. In a six-minute ‘rant’ or ‘whinge’, depending who you spoke to, he despaired that the customs plan had ‘emerged zombie-like from the coffin’.The most telling intervention came just after 3pm from Michael Gove, the Environment Secretary. Stressing that the FCA was not his preferred option and arguing they must make more plans for ‘no deal’, he said: ‘I feel we should all back the PM and support her in her efforts to make this work.’The words had the desired effect. ‘It changed everything,’ said another source. There was a rumble of supportive noises and suddenly the little bubble of rebellion had burst – although critics were determined to have their say. Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom was ‘vehemently’ against the policy but ended by saying: ‘I will support you, Prime Minister.’Another notable contribution came from Penny Mordaunt, the International Aid Secretary, who made clear her own misgivings, while Esther McVey, the Work and Pensions Secretary and close ally of backbench Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith, also trashed the plan.After all 29 ministers had spoken, with seven making clear their opposition, the PM addressed them again saying there was a majority for the policy and demanding a return to Cabinet collective responsibility.‘We have seen what happens when a team is united and gets behind their leader,’ she said – a clear reference to the England footballers’ World Cup success.With the discussions over, they toasted a rare outbreak of Cabinet unity with Pol Roger champagne, the favourite of Churchill. In a jocular speech Boris Johnson proposed a toast to the Prime Minister, who interrupted to say: ‘If only people could see how united we are now.’ But can it last? "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/08/22/4DFB7DFA00000578-0-image-m-5_1531084504345.jpg","title":"David Davis resigns Brexit Secretary","story":"      Brexit Secretary David Davis, pictured at the British Grand Prix on Sunday, has resigned after days of Cabinet tension over Theresa May\u0027s plans for the UK\u0027s departure from the European Union He said: \u0027With her Government in chaos, if she clings on, it\u0027s clear she\u0027s more interested in hanging on for her own sake than serving the people of our country.\u0027In his letter Mr Davis, describing himself as a \u0027reluctant conscript\u0027 to the PM\u0027s proposals, told Theresa May \u0027the current trend of policy and tactics\u0027 is making it \u0027look less and less likely\u0027 that the UK will leave the customs union and single market. He said: \u0027At each stage I have accepted collective responsibility because it is part of my task to find workable compromises, and because I considered it was still possible to deliver on the mandate of the referendum, and on our manifesto commitment to leave the Customs Union and the Single Market. \u0027I am afraid that I think the current trend of policy and tactic is making that look like and less likely. \u0027The Cabinet decision on Friday crystallised this problem. In my view the inevitable consequence of the proposed policies will be to make the supposed control by Parliament illusory rather than real.Suffocating heat, dark threats and moment rebels blinked:...What WAS agreed at Chequers... and how the three-page...Brussels blasts Theresa May\u0027s Brexit plan for taking ‘have...Share this article    Jacob Rees-Mogg has revealed he will oppose Theresa May\u0027s \u0027misfounded\u0027 Cabinet agreement\u0027We seek a new and equal partnership. not partial membership of the European Union, or anything that leaves us half in, half out. We do not seek to hold on to bits of membership as we leave. \u0027Tying the UK to transcribing the EU rule book to the letter rather than agreeing shared results will leave large barriers to trade with the rest of the world.  \u0027There is unhelpful ambiguity in the text which could lead to results that are the opposite of those implied by the briefings that have been given. \u0027For example, the conclusion boasts that free movement will end, whereas in fact the agreement could be used to open it up again. \u0027It proposes \u0027a mobility framework so that UK and EU citizens can continue to travel to each other\u0027s territories and apply for study and work\u0027. \u0027The same unclear construction applies to the ending of \u0027vast annual payments to the EU budget\u0027. \u0027As Norway and Switzerland pay for preferential access, does this mean simply \u0027large\u0027 payments but not vast ones?  \u0027If the Brexit Secretary cannot support them they cannot be very good proposals. It was an attempt to bounce the cabinet. It was a serious mistake.\u0027  Mrs May will say her plan will mean \u0027a complete end to freedom of movement, taking back control of our borders\u0027 as well as \u0027no more sending vast sums of money each year to the EU\u0027 and \u0027the freedom to strike new trade deals around the world\u0027.  Michael Gove was previously lashed as the \u0027snake in the grass\u0027 responsible for betraying the referendum yesterday but he insisted May\u0027s Brexit blueprint would honour the 2016 vote.Asked if the plan was everything he hoped for, Mr Gove told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘No, but then I’m a realist and one of the things about politics is you mustn’t, you shouldn’t make the perfect the enemy of the good.’In a sign of the anger and ision amongst the Eurosceptics, backbench MPs yesterday said they had sent messages to the Brexiteers in the Cabinet, asking: \u0027Where is your backbone?\u0027  Some Remain-supporting politicians said the resignation of Mr Davis was evidence of the need for a second referendum.Baron Adonis, a prominent backer of the move, tweeted: \u0027People\u0027s Vote to put Brexit out of its misery a big step closer after DD\u0027s resignation. Now the Brexiters holding Mrs May hostage are falling out, there isn\u0027t a majority for ANY withdrawal treaty in Parliament.\u0027The Liberal Democrats called on people to sign a petition for a vote on the Brexit deal, adding: \u0027The resignation of David Davis is yet more evidence of the chaos of this Tory Brexit. You deserve the final say on this shambolic Brexit with the chance to stay in the EU.\u0027 Meanwhile EU diplomats last night criticised Theresa May\u0027s new Brexit plan for taking a \u0027have cake and eat it\u0027 approach to the single market.The Prime Minister will have to water down her proposals even further to please Brussels and strike a deal, European leaders and officials believe.EU negotiators want to study the full 120-page White Paper – to be published by Downing Street on Thursday – but yesterday expressed scepticism about whether the new British plan will be acceptable to Brussels.  The main sticking point is Mrs May\u0027s proposal to keep the UK tied to the EU on goods and agricultural products only.The bloc has long warned it will not accept any \u0027cherry-picking\u0027 in relation to the single market\u0027s four freedoms on goods, services, people and capital.  Simon Coveney, Ireland\u0027s minister for foreign affairs and trade, said the EU\u0027s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, will find it \u0027difficult\u0027 to accept the proposal.He added: \u0027The EU has never been keen to facilitate a breaking up of an approach toward the single market in terms of keeping all of the elements of the single market intact and consistent, so I think Britain will find it difficult to persuade the EU to support the approach they\u0027re now proposing.\u0027Michel Barnier will be a very, very strong defender of the EU interests here, in terms of protecting the integrity of the single market and the integrity of the EU customs union.\u0027    Prime Minister Theresa May has faced a series of Cabinet members leaving their positions since the snap election last June.The first to leave was defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon, who resigned his post after being caught up in Westminster sleaze allegations.He said his behaviour had \u0027fallen below the high standards required\u0027 after he admitted putting his hand on the knee of radio presenter Julia Hartley-Brewer some years ago when he resigned on November 1.One week later, Priti Patel quit as international development secretary over undisclosed and unauthorised meetings in Israel, including with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.In her resignation letter, she echoed the words of Sir Michael, saying her actions \u0027fell below the high standards\u0027 expected.The following month, Ms May\u0027s deputy Damian Green left the Cabinet after a probe found he made \u0027inaccurate and misleading\u0027 statements about pornography on his computer.Justine Greening was sacked in the PM\u0027s reshuffle in January after refusing to move from her education post to the Department for Work and Pensions.Home secretary Amber Rudd resigned in April after admitting she had \u0027inadvertently\u0027 misled MPs over the existence of targets for removing illegal immigrants over the Windrush scandal.      Davis (left) ran against David Cameron (right) for the Tory leadership after Michael Howard resigned in 2005 but lost the electionHe was regarded by many as the likely next Tory leader after Michael Howard announced he was to resign, but after a weak campaign - in his second tilt at the leadership - he was soundly beaten in 2005.His rival, David Cameron, had caught the mood with his careful presentation and youthful optimism.In the 2001 leadership contest, Mr Davis cut his losses and quit after twice finishing way down the pack in early ballots of Tory MPs, throwing his support behind Iain Duncan Smith.The contest successfully raised his profile and Mr Duncan Smith appointed him party chairman.A libertarian who was never afraid to speak his mind, even if his opinions fell outside the party line, he worked closely with former Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti.His friendship with former Downing Street spin chief Alastair Campbell raised Conservative eyebrows.Mr Davis once revealed that he offered to buy Mr Campbell\u0027s old newspaper the Daily Mirror so the former journalist could edit it.He put their unlikely friendship down to his liking for \u0027strong mavericks\u0027 and there is something of that description in him. Despite Eurosceptic views, he acted as a whip for John Major during the bruising battle to ratify the Maastricht Treaty.Mr Davis has previously listed mountaineering, parachuting and flying light aircraft among his more athletic pursuits.                                                               Cabinet ministers gathered at Chequers on Friday (pictured) but plans have now been thrown into chaos by Mr Davis\u0027s resignation Was Davis\u0027s departure telegraphed?The Brexit Secretary was understood to have serious reservations about both the plan and whether it could be acceptable to Brussels following the Chequers summit, but was absent from the television studios in the aftermath of the talks. He has been close to the exit door on a number of occasions in recent months. Last year reports emerged that Davis said he intended to \u0027retire\u0027 in 2019 and leave the transitional period of Britain\u0027s exit from the European Union to Boris Johnson, something later dismissed as a \u0027lighthearted remark\u0027.Is Davis the first of many?There was a feeling that any departure - be it immediately after the summit or once the EU made it clear Britain\u0027s terms were unacceptable - could trigger a series of resignations from the front benches, particularly from hardliners. Mrs May must be expecting others to go with Davis, and will be particularly keen to know what the likes of Mr Johnson and fellow Brexiteer Andrea Leadsom intend to do now.Could it get any worse for the PM?Yes. An avalanche of departures would surely trigger a leadership contest in the Tory party. Simply, if the Prime Minister cannot unite her Cabinet and convince them over the Brexit negotiations, she has no chance of getting the EU to agree to the terms.                                                     "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/09/02/4E07BB3D00000578-5931883-Dr_Harris_has_30_years_of_diving_experience_and_will_work_with_t-m-13_1531101236979.jpg","title":"Weakest Thai soccer players extracted caves Adelaide doctor said ready move","story":"    Dr Richard Harris is an anesthetist from Adelaide who went into the cave at the request of Thai authoritiesAn Australian doctor convinced Thai officials to change their rescue plans and first get some of the weakest boys out of the cave where they were trapped, it can be revealed. Cave er and anaesthetist Dr Richard Harris, from Adelaide, ed with the rescue team on Sunday afternoon to check on the 12 boys and their coach.The initial strategy was to extract the strongest boys first because they would have more chance of making it to safety while the others could stay back and build up strength.But that was revised after Dr Harris\u0027 health assessment found some of the weaker boys may not survive if they were left behind, according to Thai media.Four of the 12 trapped boys were brought to safety on Sunday evening. Operations to bring out the other eight and their coach will start this afternoon as ers place fresh oxygen tanks along the exit route. Dr Harris, who was requested by British ers leading the operation, is working alongside the Thai Navy and 18 other Australians in the rescue efforts.The 53-year-old has 30 years of ing experience and has worked on retrieving bodies from caves.He famously found the body of stunt er Agnes Milowka who ran out of air in the Tank Cave near Tantanoola in the south east of South Australia in 2011, The Advertiser reported.David Strike, a e event organiser who has known Dr Harris for more than a decade told Fairfax: \u0027He\u0027s been ing for over 30 years, and readily embraced advances in ing technology to better help him explore and photograph caves in Australia and overseas.\u0027\u0027In the past few years, he\u0027s been involved in cave-ing explorations in Australia, China, Christmas Island and New Zealand.

(His sister Daisy, 17, is still a pupil there, but has been given time off to watch him in Russia).Now, although he has played just ten games for England, and only turned 25 in March, the Leicester City centre-back has, in his undemonstrative way, also become a talisman for England.The team’s unimagined success is based on the rock-like defensive partnership he forms with fellow Yorkshiremen Kyle Walker, also of Sheffield, and John Stones, born in Barnsley. A backbone to the team as rugged and formidable as the Pennines. Before this magical World Cup, however, Maguire was hardly a household name. Indeed, few non-football fans would have heard of him, and only a few months ago it seemed unlikely Gareth Southgate would pick him ahead of players from more glamorous clubs.          Another generation would doubtless deem lantern-jawed Harry as just the type you would want beside you in the trenchesThis, after all, a player who, at 15 was a little on the chubby side – as we can see from a recently-emerged photo of him losing a school 400m race (pictured) – and whose career meandered through Sheffield, Hull and Wigan before Leicester City bought him a year ago, for £17million. So how has he emerged as one of the tournament’s true superstars?His is a story of steel and grit. He and his brothers, Joe, 27, and Laurence, 21, were encouraged to play by their father, Alan Maguire, 51, who played semi-professionally working his way up in the Co-operative Insurance Society. He is now a financial services director.‘We were football mad in the house,’ Maguire has said, describing how he and his brothers would scrap for the ball in the garden. ‘I don’t know how mum coped at times. I’m sure there were plenty of broken windows’. His father also ‘used to go mad’ because they churned up the lawn. Joe Maguire became a part-time footballer. Laurence plays for Chesterfield, who were relegated from the Football League last season (last weekend the club amusingly explained his absence from a pre-season friendly by saying he had ‘a bout of Russian flu’). They are attending the World Cup with a large contingent of family and friends, including Fern, who wears Harry’s white number 6 shirt, and Daisy, who yesterday tweeted a picture of them with her brother after the Sweden match. Watching him score had been ‘the best feeling ever,’ she declared.Maguire was a bright lad and passed eight GCSEs, with four A*s. Had he not become a footballer, he says he would have studied A-levels, with maths his first choice. Certainly, during his early years at St Mary’s, some teachers thought he would have been wiser to follow an academic path.‘When he first joined us, at 11, you could see he was one of our good players, but did I think he’d be playing in a World Cup quarter final? Absolutely not,’ says Martin McKee, head of PE at the school, which claims some credit for the Corinthian spirit with which Maguire plays, because it places great emphasis on good sportsmanship and correct behaviour.          Maguire was a bright lad and passed eight GCSEs, with four A*s. Had he not become a footballer, he says he would have studied A-levels, with maths his first choiceAs he honed his strength and skill in those garden games, wearing England shirts bearing the names of idols such as John Terry and Rio Ferdinand (who described his performance against Sweden as ‘immense’) Maguire set his heart on emulating them.After a brief spell at Barnsley FC’s junior academy, he joined Sheffield United, where, by 18, he had broken into the first team. Travis Binnion, director of its youth academy, whose prodigies are sent on work experience in places such as asphalt works to toughen them up, believes Maguire’s time there was character-forming. ‘It’s a working-class city and doesn’t tolerate big-time Charlies. The fans demand effort and endeavour,’ he said. ‘As a kid, he was very confident on the pitch, but off it he was down-to-earth and quite reserved. He had the air that he knew best, but not in a big-headed way. He would listen, but he would back his ability to know the game, and he was very bright. You could see the cogs ticking in his head.’Ah yes, that head. It might contain plenty of grey matter, but it propels the ball with such thunderous velocity that team-mate Jamie Vardy has nicknamed him ‘Slab-head’.Maguire will doubtless take the ribbing in good part, for nothing seems to faze him. As he says: ‘I try to keep my feet on the floor, stay humble, and let my ability do the talking.’ It has certainly spoken eloquently this past fortnight. ‘Cry God for Harry, England and St George!’ is no longer a chant that belongs solely to captain Harry Kane.Maguire’s performances have been so outstanding that fans of clubs such as Manchester United are now begging their owners to buy him, whatever the price.If he does finally join some big name club when this glorious World Cup idyll is over, he’d better splash out on a new kit-bag or his mother will slaughter him."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/06/21/3653139500000578-0-image-m-17_1530910061753.jpg","title":"Bring bandstands free parking save struggling High Street stores demands minister","story":"    Bandstands have been suggested as an aid to boost struggling high street retailers (stock image)Mr Berry, a junior minister for the Department for Communities and Local Government, said short periods of free parking of an hour could be offered to tempt more people into town centres.His comments came after the Mail launched a campaign last week to save Britain\u0027s High Street. It calls for an overhaul of crippling business rates and town centre rules, including parking restrictions, to help struggling traditional retailers compete with online giants.Mr Berry said business rates were a matter for Chancellor Philip Hammond but called on councils to do their part by allowing shoppers to park for free.Car buyers are borrowing more than £100million per day to...Philip Hammond\u0027s snub to the high street: Chancellor refuses...Share this articleMany businesses did not want all-day free parking but would welcome shorter-periods that encouraged a steady flow of shoppers, he added.\u0027Having short periods of free parking is something that can bring people back into high streets,\u0027 the minister told The Daily Telegraph. \u0027Parking should be locally determined. But what I think may be what is missing is the voice of business in parking.\u0027I know in my own local authority we had a situation where you can park all day for free – you would think that is what shopkeepers want.\u0027Guess what? It\u0027s not – they want you to be able to park for an hour or two hours for free because they want you to leave and new customers with fresh money in their pocket to arrive. Having shorter periods of free parking is something that all local authorities, in consultation with their businesses, should consider.\u0027          The suggestion came after the Mail launched a campaign last week to save Britain\u0027s High Street (stock image)Mr Berry also suggested councils should appoint \u0027sheriffs\u0027 whose jobs would be to help make sure the high streets thrived. And he said attractions for visitors to enjoy while they were in town centres could woo more shoppers to struggling stores.He added: \u0027If political leadership knew that shops and businesses were struggling to have their voice heard they would want to do something about it.\u0027We should be working with local authorities at finding ways bringing things like gyms, childcare maybe even day care for the elderly on to the High Street.\u0027Speaking about the High Street in Ashford, Kent, he said: \u0027There are art galleries. There is a bandstand ... I don\u0027t think bandstands are the only solution but I want more things that will bring people into the centre.\u0027Tough conditions on Britain\u0027s high streets have cost around 50,000 retail jobs since the start of the year. Bricks and mortar businesses complain part of the problem is an unfair advantage enjoyed by web giants such as Amazon, which do not have to pay expensive business rates on physical shops, relying instead on huge out-of-town warehouses.Launched last Monday, the Mail\u0027s Save our High Streets campaign calls on the Government to reform business rates and has already received the backing of a string of major stores.Mr Berry said shoppers also had a duty to support retailers. He added: \u0027It is absolutely incumbent on all of us to go out and support the High Street. There is nothing greater than the great British High Street. It is a huge community asset for our nation.\u0027Yesterday the idea was backed by the British Retail Consortium but the group said changes to business rates were also crucial.A spokesman said: \u0027With high street stores under enormous pressure it\u0027s sensible for the Government to look at every measure which could increase footfall.\u0027Free, or at least more affordable, parking could make a real difference in encouraging more consumers into town centres.\u0027However, these initiatives alone aren\u0027t enough – if the Government is serious about helping struggling shops they need to commit to a two-year freeze on business rates.\u0027Only by reducing the significant costs currently facing retailers who operate from property can Government make a real difference to help preserve as many shops as possible.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/08/23/4E0AAF2300000578-0-image-m-5_1531089672399.jpg","title":"Four 10 voters believe Theresa Mays Chequers deal betrayal Brexit","story":"    Nearly four in ten voters believe Theresa May’s Chequers deal is a betrayal of the referendum amid a hostile reaction from the Tory party faithful, it was revealed last nightBut the Prime Minister has seen a rise in support for her taking her party into the next election, due in 2022.Some 34 per cent thought she should keep hold of the reigns, 24 per cent said she should resign now, while 24 per cent said she should step down after Britain formally leaves the EU in March next year.David Davis quits and sparks a Tory Brexiteer rebellion that...Jacob Rees-Mogg cheers on David Davis\u0027 sensational...Share this article    An opinion poll found that 35 per cent believe the Brexit compromise agreed by the Cabinet is the best deal Britain will get from the EU, while 38 per cent dismissed it as a sell-outA separate online poll of Tory members by the Conservative Home website revealed widespread unhappiness with the Chequers plan amongst the party faithful.Some 61 per cent of the 1,225 respondents said that that proposal would be a bad deal for Britain, compared to 31 per cent who thought it would be good. A further eight per cent were unsure. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b02531ffb73d00cbcab406d2fd46941ce563ebea/0_0_4519_5648/master/4519.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=bca43a86b10c6ed96e96967469fe4bbe 1400w","title":"best summer holiday reads 2018 philip pullman maggie ofarrell nina stibbe part two","story":"From Pulitzer prize-winners to Penguin classics, poetry anthologies to the latest page-turners, here are the books to take to the beach this summerIllustrations by Leon EdlerI loved Andrew Sean Greer’s Pulitzer prize-winning Less (Little, Brown) and I can’t think of a better book to stash in your suitcase. It follows Arthur Less – who keeps emphatically reiterating that he is absolutely not heartbroken by his boyfriend marrying someone else – from San Francisco to Japan, to Italy and back again. Like a rare diamond, Greer’s prose sparkles, illuminates and cuts. I’ve also just been sent an advance proof of some new Lucia Berlin short stories, Evening in Paradise (Picador). Any publication of hers is a major cause for celebration, as far as I’m concerned. I might have to feign illness to devote myself to them. I’m hoping to pick up a copy of Lauren Groff’s new novel, Florida (William Heinemann), before I head off to the Highlands next week her last book, Fates and Furies, was a fascinating and febrile read. This one promises snakes, sinkholes and sisters, so I’m in.Rupert Thomson is an astonishing writer, who should be far more celebrated than he is. His latest novel, Never Anyone But You (Little, Brown), is immensely surprising, fully imagined and totally original. We live in an age of wonderful science writing, and Carlo Rovelli’s new book, The Order of Time (Allen Lane), is an example of the very best. Time is something we think we know about instinctively here he shows how profoundly strange it really is. Also, The Accident on the A35 by Graeme Macrae Burnet (Saraband): it’s a long time since I read a police procedural (more or less) that was so gripping and intelligent.For literary refreshment, try the playful, artful Convenience Store Woman by Sayaka Murata (Portobello). For a properly sweltering read, you need One Star Awake by Andrew Meehan (New Island), all gorgeous longing and hunger in Paris. Those who can’t sleep in the heat might find the ingeniously disquieting stories in Things We Lost in the Fire by Mariana Enríquez (Portobello) apt. If I manage a couple of days off, I’ll head for Kerry on the Atlantic coast of Ireland and take Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now by Jaron Lanier (Bodley Head) and a recently delivered proof I can’t wait to get stuck into: Crimson by Greenlandic sensation Niviaq Korneliussen (Virago).If you like your holiday beach reads to include a measure of deep existential terror – and who doesn’t? – I am happy to point you toward Mariana Enríquez’s utterly brilliant short story collection Things We Lost in the Fire (Portobello). Instead of returning home with a tan, you will be likely to return home looking pale and haunted, and with your eyes sunken in your skull, but you will thank me for the tip. (Either that or you’ll curse me for it, it’s pretty much 5050.) Perhaps even less appropriate a beach read is James Bridle’s book New Dark Age (Verso), an extraordinary, perceptive analysis of the various ways in which the rise of information technology has obscured, rather than illuminated, the operations of power in the world, and diminished our capacity to improve it. It’s brilliant and bracing. The two books I’m most excited to read this summer – almost certainly not on a beach, though you never know – are Olivia Laing’s Crudo (Picador), and Jacqueline Rose’s Mothers: an Essay on Love and Cruelty (Faber), which I’ve just started reading and am very much enjoying.Two recent favourites are memoirs that use other books to tell their story. Sally Bayley’s Girl With Dove: A Life Built By Books(Harper Collins) borrows voices and themes from literary classics (eg Jane Eyre, David Copperfield, Miss Marple, Milly-Molly-Mandy) to make sense of the strange goings-on in her own family. I highly recommend the author’s exuberant reading of the audiobook for the full effect of this beguiling, eccentric, funny memoir. In her joyful memoir Bookworm: A Memoir of Childhood Reading (Vintage), Lucy Mangan revisits our most beloved childhood books (Milly-Molly-Mandy crops up again), brings the characters of our collective childhood back to life and uses them – with great wit and wisdom – to tell her own story. Wonderful. Another book on the transformative power of books is Educated (Hutchinson), Tara Westover’s fascinating, jaw-dropping memoir of being raised by a survivalist scrap-merchant who doesn’t trust medicine, schools or dairy products, and tells the story of her determination to find knowledge. My summer will be spent at home, on the beaches of Cornwall, and a holiday read I’m looking forward to is Human Relations and Other Difficulties – the collected essays (1972-2015) of Mary-Kay Wilmers (Profile), editor of the London Review of Books and my old boss.I spend my life in the third person watching characters shouting from the stage, so I’m most drawn to writers who show me something different or unusually personal with a whispering voice from the page. Julian Barnes’s completely devastating The Only Story (Jonathan Cape) is as quiet and aching and intimate as a James Blake ballad. Rachel Cusk’s Kudos (Faber), the third in a breathtaking trilogy, is its polar opposite, voiceless, disconcerting, secretive and utterly modern. Finally, I’ll take John Fowles’s adolescent, deeply theatrical, classic The Magus (Vintage), which reminds me of being a teenager hoping to find holiday romance and instead seeking consolation in a book.I’m enjoying books that present as memoir but with a beauty of prose that elevates them, so I adored Jean Hannah Edelstein’s phenomenal This Really Isn’t About You (Picador), a warm and witty account of finding your feet in the face of great loss. Andrew Hankinson’s You Could Do Something Amazing With Your Life (You Are Raoul Moat) (Scribe) is another gripper, a powerful literary experiment written in the voice of the killer. On a lighter note, for my trip to Los Angeles, I’m packing Cesare Pavese’s The Beautiful Summer (Penguin), with an introduction by Elizabeth Strout, a slender account of love in 1930s Italy, and 300 Arguments and Ongoingness: The End of a Diary (Picador) by Sarah Manguso, brimming with invaluable wisdom and elegance.Holidays are for distraction-free immersion in books with heft. Artist Hito Steyerl’s Duty Free Art (Verso) is a dizzying and dystopian riff on the liquid capital that flows through the art world, the factoids manufactured by bots and our accumulation of digital debris. Counter that with Practice: Documents of Contemporary Art (Whitechapel Gallery), an anthology of essays on and by artists ranging from Marina Abramović to Gerhard Richter and their strategies for making, doing and resisting the virtual. A book that reads like magic realism but is entirely factual is Naples ’44 by Norman Lewis (Eland), a riveting and cinematic account of how Neapolitans dealt with siege and starvation – countesses transformed ballrooms into vegetable gardens or simply took to prostitution, and the cat population declined dramatically – while keeping up appearances. I will be in the Tuscan hills this summer and I am taking with me Shape of Light: 100 Years of Photography and Abstract Art (Tate) to inspire my own photographic experiments.Melissa Harrison’s forthcoming All Among the Barley (Bloomsbury) gets you in the first sentence and does not let go I cannot recommend it enough. The Secret Barrister: Stories of the Law and How It’s Broken (Macmillan) is an eye-opening, funny and horrifying look at the criminal justice system, perfect for reading sections out and disrupting the lives of those around you who are “just trying to have a nice time”. I also will take These Bones Will Rise Again by Panashe Chigumadzi (Indigo), This Really Isn’t About You by Jean Hannah Edelstein (Picador), and Run, Riot by Nikesh Shukla (Hodder) with me for a week in a tent on the Isle of Wight.I heartily recommend Who Is Rich? by Matthew Klam (Fourth Estate). It’s the funniest novel I’ve read in ages and one of the saddest. The narrator, Rich Fischer, a once somewhat famous cartoonist, will please anyone who likes their protagonists clever and deluded, hopeful and doomed. I also loved Kayo Chingonyi’s debut poetry collection, Kumukanda (Chatto \u0026amp Windus). His poems are intelligent and moving and find the perfect balance between intricacy and directness. I’ve got lots of books I’m looking forward to reading on a beach in Gower: Flights by Olga Tokarczuk (Publishers Group), Hold by Michael Donkor (Fourth Estate) and Astroturf by Matthew Sperling (Quercus).Anyone who endured their teens in the 1970s as I did will devour Nina Stibbe’s sequel to the equally delicious Man at the Helm. Funny, subversive and unexpectedly touching, Paradise Lodge (Penguin), just out in paperback, follows her heroine’s adventures when she bunks off school to work in an old people’s home ripe for Thatcherite reforms. I’m always banging on about the need to read more dead authors – they have nobody marketing their work and they’re cheap and usually brilliant. Please discover Sylvia Townsend Warner this summer. Her The Flint Anchor and The Corner That Held Them (Virago) are neglected comic masterpieces whose evocations of chilly East Anglian landscapes are the perfect balm for sunburn. I’ll get no holiday as I’ve a new novel out, but on my train journeys I’ll be reading Anne Enright in preparation for interviewing her at the North Cornwall book festival.I’ll be in Berlin for most of July, heading there via – or at least in the company of – Antony Beevor’s Arnhem: The Battle for the Bridges, 1944 (Viking). Always worried that I have a book too few, I’ll also be lugging Lisa Halliday’s Asymmetry (Granta), Pond by Claire-Louise Bennett (Fitzcarraldo) and Iris Origo’s Tuscan diaries, War in Val D’Orcia (Pushkin). In the second world war, the Germans used 2.7m horses, of which 1.8m died. This is just one of many moving statistics in Ulrich Raulff’s unusual and stimulating history of – and elegy for – the last 100 years of our relationship with the equine world, Farewell to the Horse (Penguin).Who Is Rich? (Fourth Estate) by Matthew Klam is a terrific summer read – a cartoonist at an ocean-side artists’ conference ponders creativity, infidelity and his own existential purpose, and the results are hilarious and bracingly intelligent. A similarly artsy but more sober read is the essay collection How to Write an Autobiographical Novel (Mariner) by Alexander Chee. Chee’s insights about writing, love and activism are hard-won, honest and incredibly wise. I can’t wait to get my hands on the new novel When Katie Met Cassidy (Piatkus) by Camille Perri. I’ve heard it’s sexy, entertaining and subversive, and doesn’t that sound like a magnificent combination? I plan to read it while visiting my sister in Providence, Rhode Island.This summer I’m fulfilling a long-held ambition to explore the mountains and cities of the Republic of Georgia by their marshrutka countrywide minibus network. On a trip that is mainly travel, I want books that will inspire me, that are humane and thought-provoking. After reading the first outstanding story, I’ve been impatiently hoarding Glen James Brown’s debut, Ironopolis (Parthian), a series of interconnected tales set on a dilapidated Middlesbrough council estate. Likewise, Mary O’Hara’s Austerity Bites (Policy Press), which reports on the frontline of austerity cuts, a book sadly as relevant today as when it was first published four years ago. The Wilderness (WW Norton) by Sandra Lim is a knife blade fashioned into a magnifying glass. Oscillating between bold declarations and restrained, seething fury, the poems slowly build to a storm in the psyche. The book is a masterclass in line-making and metaphor. It lifts me, like the best books, higher into myself. “When I come to the right place, I believe I’ll paint a door on it and  walk right through.” I’ve also been struck by Scott McClanahan’s The Sarah Book (Tyrant). It is the epitome of autofiction – and advances the tradition to include images and photographs. But more than that, it is the first book I’ve read in a while that faithfully enacts Kafka’s truism that a book must be an axe that shatters the frozen seas inside us. Brutal and unforgiving, it explores a crumbling marriage and its ensuing existential crisis through the lens of the West Virginian working class. A classic of urgent, American storytelling.Sally Rooney’s award-winning novel, Conversations With Friends (Faber), is one of the best debuts I’ve encountered. It’s a witty and entrancing read, perfect for a summer’s day spent doing nothing else. I’m hoping to visit friends in the Hudson Valley this summer I first need to finish editing my film Mary Queen of Scots – which is based on John Guy’s biography of Mary Stuart, My Heart Is My Own (Harper). For my summer reading I will e into Stephen Greenblatt’s new book, Tyrant: Shakespeare on Politics (WW Norton). I love his mission to invigorate settled ideas, and it’s good preparation for the next play I’m directing, Measure for Measure at the Donmar, London.I have enjoyed The Incurable Romantic (Little, Brown), in which psychotherapist Frank Tallis opens his casebook. There have been quite a few such books recently, most of them overpraised and not as well written as their admirers claim. But Tallis writes with clarity and wit about the morbid condition of love, which emerges here as a kind of mental disorder. I have some misgivings about patient confidentiality and exaggeration andor light fictionalisation in places (Tallis has form as a horror novelist), but this is undoubtedly riveting stuff.I’ve just put down The Kiss Quotient (Atlantic) by Helen Hoang and I loved it so much I want to hand it out to strangers on the street. It’s a beautiful love story and a peek inside the life and heart of a woman who has Asperger’s or high-functioning autism. I was mesmerised by this book, which manages to be steamy hot and sweet at the same time. An American Marriage (Algonquin) by Tayari Jones is another incredible love story, though fraught with greater challenges for the couple at the centre, which makes the story all the more moving. Jones’s prose is chock-full of lyricism, grace and wisdom. You will never forget the story of Celestial and Roy. Unfortunately, there are no grand travel plans for me this season. My summer “holiday” will be stolen moments in my favourite reading chair.I read The One Who Wrote Destiny (Atlantic) by Nikesh Shukla, a beautiful, brilliant modern classic, cover to cover on one long-haul flight – take tissues! And Mr Loverman (Hamish Hamilton) by Bernadine Evaristo is the funniest book I’ve read this year, but also one of the saddest. Every character makes a perfect holiday companion. My summer travels are all work-related this year – Wales, Suffolk, Edinburgh and Cairo – so to see me through the trains, planes and buses, I’ll be packing When I Hit You (Atlantic) by Meena Kandasamy, Grime Kids (Orion) by DJ Target, Elsewhere, Home (Telegram) by Leila Aboulela and Things Bright and Beautiful (Penguin) by Anbara Salam.Sara Baume’s A Line Made By Walking (Windmill), about Frankie, who retreats from urban life and connects with nature, really made an impression on me this year. A fun and breezy read was Charlotte Bingham’s memoir MI5 and Me: A Coronet Among the Spooks (Bloomsbury), an account of her discovery that her father was a spy and of her own “inactive” service. Go Went Gone (Granta) by Jenny Erpenbeck, looking at the plight of asylum seekers as told through a retired university professor, I found very moving. My dream holiday reads include The Overstory (William Heinemann) by Richard Powers, an eco epic, with trees at the heart of the storytelling, and Ling Ma’s Severance (Macmillan), a brilliant-sounding post-apocalyptic novel, centring on the end times of late capitalism. I’ve been learning to swim this year, and while I’m in Paxos practising my strokes, I’ve accumulated some books with swimmers on the covers, and top of the pile to read is Turning: Lessons from Swimming Berlin’s Lakes (Virago) by Jessica J Lee. I recommend Territory of Light (Penguin), Yuko Tsushima’s stories of marital disappointment, parenthood and loneliness following a separation in 70s Tokyo. It’s unflinching and brings to mind Elena Ferrante’s early work. Caryl Phillips’ novel A View of the Empire at Sunset (Vintage), about the becoming of Jean Rhys, fully inhabits the despair of damp prewar London and stifling colonial society abroad. Edouard Louis’s History of Violence (Harvill Secker), detailing a sexual attack and its aftermath, is shocking, but also tender in its examination of class difference and queer desire. Books I’m packing for Arles include Annie Ernaux’s The Years (Publishers Group), Will Ashon’s forthcoming Wu-Tang epic, Chamber Music (Granta) and Nikesh Shukla’s The One Who Wrote Destiny (Atlantic).I’ve been travelling over the last month and I’ve been bouncing back and forth between books during my travels. The first is called Iron Ambition: My Life With Cus D’Amato (Sphere) by Mike Tyson and Larry Sloman. I’m a fan of Cus D’Amato, who also trained world champions Floyd Patterson and José Torres. I’m also reading Nietzsche for the first time, partly because Cus had Mike reading Nietzsche at 15 years old. I’m halfway through Thus Spake Zarathustra (Wordsworth) and will admit I can’t make head or tail of some of it. I think the book is telling me to believe in myself, to think at a higher-than-average level, and to not get bogged down with petty things. Ideal holiday reading.Anybody who wants a real treat must read Martina Evans’s Now We Can Talk Openly About Men (Carcanet). Full of insight and humour, it tells the story of two women’s lives in Ireland during the civil war. As a poet, Evans’s ability to choose just the right word is unerring. I also highly recommend Maggie O’Farrell’s I Am, I Am, I Am (Tinder), a memoir that rivals the beauty of her novels. My own summer holiday will be spent in Sweden doing research for a book. While there, I plan to reread some old favourites – starting with Tom Wolfe’s The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test (Vintage).Rachel Cusk’s Kudos (Faber) is one of the most astoundingly original and necessary books I’ve ever read. It made me laugh, think and cry. She’s my friend, but I recommend it without apology: I envy anyone who hasn’t read it yet. I was startled, but also very moved, by the almost abrasive directness of Rose Tremain’s memoir Rosie (Chatto \u0026amp Windus). It did exactly what memoirs ought to do: made me want to rush straight back to her fiction. My ideal holiday (a bit of a fantasy at the moment) would therefore be a fortnight in Rome with all of Tremain on a Kindle, along with John Updike’s Rabbit (Penguin) quartet – which people have been ordering me to read for years – as well as Motherhood (Harvill Secker) by Sheila Heti, which I’ve been hoarding, and Never Anyone But You (Corsair) by the unfailingly brilliant Rupert Thomson.I know it sounds a little sad, but I tend to get really excited when I receive the Polity Press’s new catalogue. They publish so much clever, challenging and fascinating stuff. Over the summer I plan to read Alain Corbin’s A History of Silence (Polity). Corbin writes sparely, beautifully and with an exquisite fastidiousness about, well… something and nothing: quiet. In the first chapter he recommends George Rodenbach’s The Bells of Bruges (Dedalus) and Max Picard’s The Flight from God (St Augustine’s Press). I intend to consume all three of the above, at home or on trains, in an atmosphere of gentle reverence.Luis Alberto Urrea’s The House of Broken Angels (Little, Brown) is a great American novel, if we understand “America” to be all of the Americas, including Mexico. It’s profane, funny and moving. Sayaka Murata’s Convenience Store Woman (Portobello) takes a universal space, the convenience store, and turns it into the setting for a darkly comic (and very short) novel about alienation and identity in an urban, capitalist society. Alexander Chee’s How to Write an Autobiographical Novel (Mariner) is a collection of essays about race, writing, politics, queerness and sexuality that is urgent and insightful. I’ll be in Paris for much of the summer, and I’ll be taking Édouard Louis’ The End of Eddy (Vintage), Leila Slimani’s Lullaby (Faber), Han Kang’s The Vegetarian (Portobello), Min Jin Lee’s Pachinko (Head of Zeus), Lisa Ko’s The Leavers (Dialogue) and Jenny Zhang’s Sour Heart (Bloomsbury).This year, I’m packing José Saramago’s novels - I’ve only just got round to him, and I’m knocked out by the worldly precision and the combination of substance and grandeur. The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis (Vintage) was a revelation, and I’m looking forward to the half dozen more now in a pile. The two new novels I really want to take away are both by favourite Australian authors: Michelle de Kretser’s The Life to Come (Allen \u0026amp Unwin) and Tim Winton’s The Shepherd’s Hut (Picador). They’re both writers of wonderful freshness and energy. Just right for two weeks’ retreat at an Austrian health farm, to fit in between forest walks, massages, advanced treatments and 650 exquisitely tantalising calories a day.One of my favourite books this year was Nine Island (Catapult) by Jane Alison, which is funny and wise and such a closely observed account of a single woman’s life during her time living in Florida. It’s so vividly described that I didn’t read it as fiction, which shows how good a writer Alison is. Her protagonist J’s reflections on sex, love and other people are so unapologetic and honest, I felt less alone and freakish while reading the book. Another that had me in its grip, due to her insightful and direct voice, was Kudos (Faber) by Rachel Cusk. Cusk has a piercing intellect but demonstrates it through perspicacity, not by showing off on the page. I came to the graphic memoir Persepolis (Pantheon) by Marjane Satrapi via my 19-year-old daughter. It is set in Iran around the Islamic revolution when the author is 10. We accompany her through her gradual awakening to politics, love, oppression and the complexity of families – and her drawings are enchanting. I am going to Hastings, East Sussex, for a week’s course at the art school. The books I’ll take with me are Motherhood (Harvill Secker) by Sheila Heti, and Zadie Smith’s new collection of essays, Feel Free (Hamish Hamilton).Ponti (Picador) by Sharlene Teo is a sultry, hilarious dissection of mother-daughter relationships, and the effect of time and teenagehood on friendships, against the backdrop of Singapore B-movies. It oozes confidence. On Michael Jackson (Granta) is Margo Jefferson’s excellent, empathic take on the singer, encapsulating the pressures of being a child star, the most famous person on the planet and having a complicated legacy that can sometimes make people forget about the music. Meanwhile, Crudo (Picador) by Olivia Laing is a hot and heavy look at post-Brexit Britain through the eyes of newlywed Kathy as she summers in Italy. It’s Olivia Laing’s fiction debut and is very much a self-assured interrogation of the times we live in. James Smythe’s I Still Dream (Borough) is his most accomplished work – a past, present and future of AI, which is as human as it is otherworldly, and utterly engrossing. I am going to east Devon and will be taking the short story collection Heads of the Colored People (Chatto \u0026amp Windus) by Nafissa Thompson-Spires, the memoir This Really Isn’t About You (Picador) by Jean Hannah Edelstein and Londoners (Granta) by Craig Taylor.Don Paterson’s wonderfully learned The Poem: Lyric, Sign, Metre (Faber) is pure joy for footnote freaks and those who like to get high thinking about thinking. Not so much about how to be a poet as how to be in a poem, or even be a poem, it also works as a great book about music. DG Compton’s The Continuous Katherine Mortenhoe (Gateway), written in 1974, coolly anticipated society being occupied with reality TV, and continues its journey from depicting an imaginary world to approaching nonfiction. I’ll be in Lisbon, switching between Shirley Collins’s All in the Downs (Strange Attractor) and Lamont Hawkins’s Raw: My Journey Into the Wu-Tang Clan (Faber), to see what they have in common. I’ll also be taking a handful of those nourishing one-pound Penguin Modern classics so I can go on holiday with George Orwell’s Notes on Nationalism, Albert Camus’s Create Dangerously, James Baldwin’s Dark Days, Kathy Acker’s New York City in 1979 and Samuel Beckett’s The End.This summer I’m going to Krakow for a residency and I’m taking The Idiot (Vintage) by Elif Batuman, a brain-meltingly funny Bildungsroman about communication breakdowns in the dawn of the internet era. I’ve already read it twice, but can’t bear to be without it. I’ll also be taking See What Can Be Done (Faber) by Lorrie Moore, my favourite short-story writer’s collected nonfiction, and The New Animals (Victoria University Press) by Pip Adam, the breakthrough New Zealand novel of 2017, which is about the generational ide, the fashion industry – and I can’t say more or I’ll ruin the ending. It’s ambitious, compulsive and strange as all hell.I’m going to New York and Lisbon this summer and I’m going to reread Maya Angelou’s The Heart of a Woman (Virago). I like these simple stories of people’s lives and experiences. The book gives you an insight into the intelligent, passionate woman that Angelou undoubtedly is. I will also take Edith Jackson (Puffin) by Rosa Guy. I have a really old library copy. It’s a story documenting the life of one girl in America with more than her share of life’s challenges. Nicole Dennis-Benn’s Here Comes the Sun (Oneworld) was the first Jamaica-set book I read. As a Jamaican woman, that was really exciting. It follows three women: two sisters and their mum. The older sister is navigating sexuality and being a queer woman, the younger is battling identity, being a darker-skinned girl, bleaching. It’s really addictive.I’m heading to Savoie in the French Alps. I’m taking South Atlantic Requiem (Arcadia) by Edward Wilson, one of my favourite spy novelists, and I Hid My Voice (Abacus) by Parinoush Saniee, an Iranian novelist, which is about a patriarchal family that is symbolic of the Iranian regime. I’m rereading George F Kennan’s Realities of American Foreign Policy (WW Norton). Written in 1954, it feels relevant again, given what’s happening now between the US and Russia. I’d also recommend Princess Bari (Periscope) by South Korean author Hwang Sok-yong and Thinner Than Skin (Jacaranda) by Uzma Aslam Khan, a Pakistani-American novelist. Both are wonderful in so many ways.I’m just back from the inspirational Worlds festival at the National Centre for Writing, Norwich. I came away laden with books and have already finished three of them. The Swan Book (Constable) by Alexis Wright is a devastating dystopian vision of a future Australia. I thought Behold, America (Bloomsbury) by Sarah Churchwell both brilliant and painfully timely, while Panashe Chigumadzi’s These Bones Will Rise Again (Indigo) is an extraordinary and thrilling history of Zimbabwe, culminating in the overthrow of Robert Mugabe. If you holiday anywhere near water, do take along the newly reissued edition of Charles Sprawson’s classic Haunts of the Black Masseur (Vintage). I’ll be rereading it between swims in Hydra in Greece.Peter Carey’s A Long Way from Home (Faber), Ian Brown’s The Boy in the Moon and Zadie Smith’s essays Feel Free (Hamish Hamilton) would all make perfect holiday reading. Meanwhile, my own stack of summer books include The Unaccompanied (Faber) by Simon Armitage, Untitled (Mainstream) by Carol Ann Duffy, The Bonniest Companie (Picador) by Kathleen Jamie, Jackself (Picador) by Jacob Polley and Don’t Call Us Dead (Chatto \u0026amp Windus) by Danez Smith. I’ll be carrying these gorgeous volumes back and forth between my New York City apartment and my old farmhouse upstate.Anyone who has the slightest interest in politics has to read Tim Shipman’s Fallout (William Collins), the follow-up to his thrilling referendum account, All Out War. Holidays may be about escapism, but this fly-on-the-wall unravelling of the 2017 election is car-crash exhilarating. For a made-up thriller, though, I enjoyed returning to the world of George Smiley in John Le Carré’s A Legacy of Spies (Penguin) in an age when the global distrust of the cold war feels unnervingly prescient. I’ve also been deeply moved and inspired by Didier Eribon’s Returning to Reims (Allen Lane), having missed the stage adaptation at the Manchester international festival last year. It’s an autobiographical account of the young gay author’s journey back to his working-class, industrial French town.The stories in Neel Patel’s If You See Me, Don’t Say Hi (Flatiron) are perfect bitesize morsels for the beach, travel legs or quiet moments. Mackenzi Lee’s Gentleman’s Guide to Vice and Virtue (Harper Collins)is a giddy whirlwind romp of a love story I can’t wait for the forthcoming sequel. Rebecca Solnit’s Hope in the Dark (Canongate) is an argument for continuing to take action, even when everything feels uncertain, and will send you back home from holiday ready to carry on. I’m going to London with my family, and bringing Ta-Nehisi Coates’s Between the World and Me (Text), Justina Ireland’s Dread Nation (Balzer \u0026amp Bray) – zombies plus the American civil war plus a fierce female fighter – and an advance copy of Edward Carey’s forthcoming Little (Aardvark Bureau), about the girl who grows up to become Madame Tussaud.I’d recommend the recently republished Faces in the Water (Virago) by Janet Frame. She’s a true original, her work is a joy to return to, and it never ages. Kintu by Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi (Oneworld) is a great, big, roaring Ugandan epic that follows the trials and tribulations of the Kintu clan from the 1750s to today. I’m taking poetry, too: it travels light and packs a punch. I’ll include Us (Faber) by Zaffar Kunial, a poet whose work thrills me, who makes you return to the origins of things, places, language and people again and again. He’s a poet who takes traditions seriously but makes of them something entirely new – a must. I’m taking Gerda Stevenson’s fabulous Quines (Luath) – the old Aberdonian word for women – which takes us through a vivid, moving history of outstanding Scottish women in poetry. It’s a groundbreaker of a book, rich and resonant, strong of voice. I’m going to go back to Eigg, an inspiring island run by its own people, and I’ll daytrip to Muck and Canna just cos I canny not.My first recommendation is The Wood: The Life and Times of Cockshutt Wood (Doubleday) by John Lewis Stempel. It is a glorious evocation of the rhythm and dynamism of an English woodland, connecting us to a much longer timeframe: a needed balance to the working, urban lives most of us have. My second is Audre Lorde’s Your Silence Will Not Protect You (Silver), the collected essays of this important poet, writer and intersectional feminist. It is a book of our times, not least because it reminds us that current issues of gender, race and power have been being contested, here in incandescent and penetrating prose and poetry, since the 1960s.I will be spending my summer break being very quiet indeed in the Kent countryside. I shall take a pile of books including Stuart Hall’s Familiar Stranger: A Life Between Two Islands (Penguin), the posthumous memoir by this vital cultural theorist Colm Tóibín’s The House of Names (Viking) Nan Shepherd’s The Living Mountain (Canongate) and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s Purple Hibiscus (Fourth Estate). I’ll also be remembering Manchester, my home until last year, with Dave Haslam’s wonderful biography, Sonic Youth Slept on My Floor (Constable), and rereading Ursula Le Guin’s The Left Hand of Darkness (Gollancz) and Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale (Vintage), to feel again their potent, timely power.The Stopping Places: A Journey Through Gypsy Britain (Chatto \u0026amp Windus) by Damian Le Bas is the perfect accompaniment to any holiday in the British Isles. It maps a secret world, and made me want to live outdoors, at least for a summer. I’m going to Folegandros in August, and I plan to take Lara Pawson’s jagged, stunning meditation on war, violence and love, This Is the Place to Be (CB Editions). I’ve read it once and it was like drinking lightning I can’t wait to rip through it again. This summer I’m staying home so I’ll be reading around current erratic obsessions, mostly translated fiction and Trump. The recently published Call Me Zebra by Azareen Van der Vliet Oloomi sounds mad and tricksy. Moroccan writer and film-maker Ahmed Bouanani’s The Hospital, a short hallucinatory novel is appearing for the first time in English translation by Lara Vergnaud. Also, Mistaken Identity by Asad Haider, which deals with class and race post-Trump, and I’ve been eagerly awaiting new translations of Brazilian writer Machado de Assis. A new complete collection will be published later this month translated by Margaret Jull Costa and Robin Patterson.What books are you reading this summer?

It has been described by Flynn as both a western and an examination of matriarchal power.Its main influence, however, is a book that was feverishly passed from classroom to classroom several decades ago by a generation of excited girls: Flowers in the Attic by Virginia Andrews (published in the US as V C Andrews). Like that tale, which follows the four Dollanganger siblings as they hide in the attic of their grandparents’ mansion while their untrustworthy mother fights for her inheritance, Sharp Objects has decidedly gothic undertones. Its influence can be seen clearly in the tense relationship between the furious, damaged Camille and her mother, Adora (played in the TV series by Patricia Clarkson), a fading southern belle with a strong narcissistic streak.“Anyone who reads Sharp Objects will certainly see a little of the Flowers influence in there,” Flynn told New York magazine in 2014. “I had a dime-store copy that had been passed around my friends. I still read it once a year or something, if I’m between books.”She is not the only author to feel that way. In the early 80s, long before the current boom in young adult fiction, teenage girls learned about life, love and everything in between from two books: Judy Blume’s Forever, and Flowers in the Attic. Where Blume was every girl’s cool aunt – her realistic, smartly written stories allowing us to feel less worried about everything from first periods to first sex – Andrews was memorably described as “the Emily Brontë of the MTV generation”, and her floridly written books, with their illicit subject matter – murder, incest, amputation, rape – were treated like contraband, passed down by older girls with covert whispers about the secrets within.And what secrets they were: a key plot point in Flowers in the Attic sees the older siblings, Cathy and Chris, fall in love during their captivity, a plot twist that seemed bizarrely OK to us at 13. Later books would tackle fathers selling their children, what to do when the man you love turns out to be your uncle, and how to cope with your family’s decision to name you after your dead sister and lock you away from the world.“I was told about the books by a friend’s babysitter, who was in high school,” says novelist Sara Gran. “She said: ‘But they’re too old for you’ – so then we were really interested.” Gran describes Andrews as “a genius… her work was unique, no one else could have written it”.Fellow crime writer Megan Abbott agrees, adding that the covers had an almost magnetic pull. “I’ll never forget coming across Flowers in the Attic and its original keyhole cover at my best friend’s house,” she says. “I was entranced by the very look of it – the spectral family that you could peer into through the cover cutout. They are such crazy, crazy books and I mean that as the highest compliment. They are books willing to go to all the dark places.”While teenage girls devoured Andrews, critics were not so kind. The Washington Post declared Flowers in the Attic to be “deranged swill” and “the worst writer I have ever read” and the New York Times asked of My Sweet Audrina, Andrews’s lurid 1982 standalone novel: “Does a sensible reader really want to know more?”Andrews’s sales suggested yes. Flowers in the Attic sold more than 3m copies in paperback, My Sweet Audrina topped the New York Times bestseller lists within three days of release, and by the time of her death from breast cancer in 1986 she had sold more than 24m books.“I think a big part of the appeal of her work, especially Flowers in the Attic and My Sweet Audrina, is that she takes the universal emotional realities of adolescence and projects them on to an operatic stage,” says novelist Robin Wasserman, whose bestselling Girls on Fire taps into a similar intensity of feeling. “The feeling of captivity, the sense that your life is being decided for you by remote adults who have opaque and probably nefarious purposes the temptation of forbidden love…”Cassandra Clare, the author of the Mortal Instruments series, agrees. “Her books have the power that fairytales have and the same horrific elements,” she says. “Flowers in the Attic has a Hansel and Gretel quality that the book itself references with asides about witches and candy houses.”It’s tempting to argue that the reason Andrews could tap so directly into that teenage angst was because of her own situation. By the time Flowers in the Attic was published she was in her mid-50s (although like any good southern belle she was vague about her age, giving a different number in each of her rare interviews) and had had reduced mobility since her teens. Her accounts of what caused this differ and include suggestions of a fall, progressive arthritis and a bungled operation. Interviews suggest an adulthood lived in near-isolation with only the company of her mother, who reportedly never read her books.The truth about her state of health was similarly vague. An early interview with People magazine suggested that Andrews, who was pictured in a wheelchair, was largely immobile, and although the author would furiously deny this, she did acknowledge: “All of Cathy’s feelings about being in prison were my feelings. So that, when I read them now, I cry.”“The key to Virginia is that she was like a very romantic southern schoolgirl with Bette Davis in her soul,” says Ann Patty, who edited Andrews’s original novels – (the VC Andrews brand continued after her death under a ghost writer) and describes the author as “tiny, almost like a doll, always impeccably turned out and dressed in pastels”.“Part of that came from her own situation – she knew what it felt like to be confined, she knew what it felt like to be lonely. But she could be very funny as well. I would stand on her wheelchair when we went out and we’d whizz down the hill laughing. She’d say about her characters: ‘What new torture shall I throw their way?’”Perhaps the real key to Andrews’s success – and certainly the thing that Flynn taps into with Sharp Objects – lies in her novels’ dissection of female anger. Cathy, the heroine of Flowers in the Attic, might look perfect but inside she is furious. Indeed, the book and its sequels can be read as one long howl of almost incoherent rage.“Her books made – and make – people profoundly uncomfortable,” says Abbott. “They’re ‘hysterical’ books in that way, out of control and female and thus dangerous. I think we don’t like to ponder what they tell us about young women, about ourselves. So they’re dismissed because it’s easier that way.”Sharp Objects starts on Sky Atlantic on Monday at 9pm"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c108f0cf7e4776569dd51b33b7d2dfe9cf1f21c0/0_250_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a548c29c901096bb03c5fce7a2e5020","title":"england world cup glory patriotism gareth southgate","story":"Thanks to the heroics of Gareth Southgate’s young side, we’re bonding as a nation. But don’t read too much into the momentThe first World Cup I was old enough to enjoy was Italia 90. My father managed to find a barely functioning printer in his office, printed out a faded copy of the fixtures on flimsy paper and sat at the dining table, highlighting all the matches that he wanted to see. He quickly lost track of what was happening when and asked me to take over. Once I had worked out the time difference between Italy and Sudan, I was hooked, and my World Cup admin job grew and grew. Each day I updated the sheet, faithfully writing down which teams had qualified and who they would play in the next round. I counted the number of goals per striker, and even the yellow and red cards for each team and player.The faded fixture list became a sacred text, though one that was falling apart and smeared with food and thumbprints. The World Cup became a bonding ritual of our relationship every four years. We supported teams on completely arbitrary and random grounds, as we had no national or rational connection to them. When people asked my father why he cared so much, even though he was not particularly interested in football, he would say: “This isn’t football. This is the World Cup.”That was the way I was taught to watch the footballing carnival that is gripping our nation – by a man who had no skin in the game, just a passion for the competition and what it represented. But when you do have a team and a country to support, it can feel like a supreme moment of collective bonding.I’ve watched England matches with strangers on the street through the windows of a closed betting shop where staff had left a television screen on before going home. I have stood on chairs in pubs so packed it was impossible to get a good view. This glorious World Cup in a baking hot summer has been a festival of togetherness. For the quarter-final against Sweden, my local pub was packed with faces from the neighbourhood. People with whom I had only exchanged the occasional hello became, in the World Cup calculus, family for the day.And England won! The team is, amazingly, in the semi-finals and we get to extend our group hug moment for a little while longer. Just one note of caution, though: let’s not try to draw from this moment of sporting pride a lesson about Where We Stand As a Nation.In England we tend to overindulge in another national obsession alongside football – the neurotic attempt to get to the bottom of what it means to be English. Any major national event – and especially a World Cup – is vulnerable to scrutiny through this lens. Nigel Farage’s patriotic posturing has been justly hammered on social media. Others have argued that the team, including as it does a significant number of black or mixed-race players, is acting as a showcase for a erse Britain. But they aren’t really reading the room either. It’s great that this should be so, and it’s a point, but it’s not the point. Events such as the World Cup create an energy that cannot be replicated, created or destroyed, no matter how hard one tries. Healthy patriotism cannot be confected. In its spontaneous forms it is to be welcomed, but the moment always passes.When our politicians are fresh out of ideas at best, or behaving like mendacious cynics at worst, and Brexit has instilled a nervous insecurity about nationalism, it’s tempting to try to read something into how the country is being galvanised by this team. It’s tempting to look at Gareth Southgate and remember for a fleeting, painful moment what it feels like to admire someone in a leadership position to look at the young (so young!), eager faces of the England players and hope that their skill and swagger signifies some sort of renewal of a confident vision of the country.But we have been here before. The London 2012 Olympics felt like a turning point, one during which the country had finally managed to come up with a vibrant, modern and tolerant version of itself. Remember how the opening ceremony celebrated the first wave of Commonwealth immigrants from the Caribbean as they marched behind a huge model of their ship, the Empire Windrush? Remember Mo Farah, athletics hero of a erse nation? But the 2012 glow faded and some of those Windrush immigrants became victims of the Home Office’s “hostile environment” policy.Let’s just enjoy the football and England’s progress for its own sake. We should just be grateful for this glorious summer hiatus and enjoy the gifts of an event that allows us momentarily to talk to strangers. To paraphrase my father, it’s not politics, it’s the World Cup, and it’s become an amazing ride."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7265a6e818023be27a9d644a0769f0296ed0aa8d/0_67_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6850fdc12761e0c36f010a3834fcb77","title":"the guardian view of mays brexit reality dawns but is it too late","story":"Theresa May’s plan for leaving the European Union is a rare moment of victory for common sense in the madness of Brexit. We now know what Mrs May’s Brexit\u0026nbspmeans. The good news is that it is softer than she\u0026nbsphas previously claimed it would be. The bad news is that it is still Brexit. The prime minister has sensibly realised that her red lines, drawn up to please the hardliners in her party, would have been a disaster for British business and jobs. She has made a decisive, and\u0026nbspcorrect, move to junk them.Instead of being completely out of the single market and erging from the EU’s regulations, Mrs May proposes to “maintain a common rulebook for all goods”, including agricultural products, after Brexit. Rather than ending the jurisdiction of the European court of justice, Mrs May’s plans would see that continue, with UK judges paying “due regard” to EU case law. Magical thinking is still being indulged: Brussels won’t allow Britain to reject future EU goods regulation and restrict freedom of movement even if Westminster accepts “consequences” for trade. Neither will it accept the bureaucratic wheeze of a facilitated customs arrangement, which asks the EU to outsource the collection of customs duties to a third country. This has no chance of being agreed with Brussels, which will no doubt ask instead for a permanent\u0026nbspbackstop in the withdrawal agreement that will see Britain in a customs union with the EU until it can\u0026nbspcome up with a workable alternative.It is undoubtedly a good thing that reality has dawned\u0026nbspin Downing Street and that cabinet ministers have been forced to sign up to the plan. There are signs that Mrs May’s Brexit has a “landing zone” but she is a long way off from it, especially as the EU will want further concessions and clarity from the UK. Brexit is much more about the crisis in the Conservative party than the reality of what the 27 other nations of the European Union can ever agree. Conservatism, like social democracy, is struggling in an age of disruptive globalisation where habits of life, work and family are in flux. A party designed to protect business heralds its intellectual collapse when a controlling faction opts to wreck capitalism.There is a glimmer of hope for Britain. Different member states are moving at different speeds in the EU. In such a Europe, being in a form of single market\u0026nbspand within a customs union would put Britain\u0026nbspin an outer lane. But it would not have been forced off the road altogether. Later, the UK could move closer – or, if it wanted to, farther away. Hardliners might cast this flexibility as a form of bondage. Yet in uncertain times, this option looks like realism. The UK needs a workable model for being out of Europe’s political project but firmly linked to its economy. Brexit, whatever its flavour, is an act of self-harm. Mrs May appears to offer cosmetic changes on free movement while limiting the damage to business. Britain ends up as a rule-taker not a rule-maker. This is demonstrably worse for Britain’s sovereignty than the status quo.Yet Brexit’s true believers are ideologically opposed to the European Union, which they wrongly blame for all this country’s ills. For this group of MPs, Mrs May’s breach of faith goes beyond the death of an empty slogan. They want to accelerate away from Europe at such a pace that Britain attains a geopolitical escape velocity, a speed fast enough to free itself from what they see as the constraining gravitational influence of the EU. Europe has weakened the right of the party by iding it. There are those for whom Brexit is desirable but second to the unity of the party. They will live with Mrs May’s fudges. Those who will not are the irreconcilables, who view the EU as an existential threat to this nation. It is this group that Mrs May must confront on Monday when she addresses her MPs at\u0026nbspthe Conservative 1922 committee. It is of little solace that in two years Mrs May has managed to produce some form of programme that takes into account the realities that face Britain in leaving the EU. But without seeing off the hard Brexit parliamentary rump, she will not be able to come up\u0026nbspwith a plan for the UK to leave the EU that might\u0026nbspever prove practical."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb7502de66f2189e64f83bb86884b3e9be47d880/0_138_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=859aebc3151d7ce03d6e3558f2595469","title":"the guardian view on forcible integration in denmark this cannot end well","story":"The government sees the problem of ghettos as one\u0026nbspof “parallel societies” – 56 named and defined areas where both the written and unwritten rules that\u0026nbspbind the rest of the country do not hold.

In Malmö, a short train ride across the sea from Copenhagen, five murders and six further shootings over 17 days this summer have been blamed on a feud\u0026nbspbetween Balkan gangs.The new measures are an effort to enforce both the written and unwritten laws of Danish society. The children of immigrants are to be brought up with “Danish values”. But these values now include a clear and consistent pattern of discrimination against their parents. That cannot end well. The effect of these laws will be clearly racist, and discriminatory on grounds of religion. It is one thing to promise increased policing of high-crime areas. But to make such crimes as vandalism, burglary, threatening behaviour, arson and offences against the drug laws punishable by twice the sentences when committed within the designated ghettos is just grotesque.It is easy to see that this will in practice work as an incentive to criminals from those areas to pursue their criminal employment elsewhere.

It was winter 2011 at Colorado’s Snowball, and with flurries falling lightly against the Rocky Mountain sunset, Big Gigantic playing onstage and a crowd of fans playing tag in the field, Gumber knew festival culture, in all its heady whimsy, was for him. At the same time, he was confounded by the lack of direction provided to the tens of thousands of attendees.“They were basically telling 50,000 people like: ‘Show up. You’ll be fine. Here are some drugs. What could go wrong?’” Gumber says. Gumber, 34, has since dedicated his life to music festivals, having christened himself “The Festival Guy” and hit more than 135 festivals in the last seven years. If you’re a festivalgoer in the US, it’s not unusual to see Gumber from across the field at Coachella, Bonnaroo, Electric Forest, Electric Daisy Carnival, SXSW, Okeechobee, Burning Man and many more, typically wearing his signature top hat and surrounded by a gaggle of friends. As of June 2018, Gumber has logged more than 460 festival days of dancing, camping, listening, eating and generally having the time of his life at shows across the country. And in the process, he’s grown quite savvy. While his lifestyle may be non-traditional – Gumber doesn’t have a house and spends most of the year on the road going to shows – as The Festival Guy he’s continuing his family’s legacy of turning hobbies into jobs. His grandfather was an avid golfer and his dad worked for the ision of wildlife in Colorado, where Gumber grew up passionate about live music and the outdoors. “My dad’s entire job was to enforce the correct way to be an outdoorsman,” Gumber says. “I was taught from a young age that there’s a right way to do things.”Which is why what Gumber was seeing at festivals – litter, shoddy campsites, rude attendees, sleep deprivation, lost cars, keys, tents and friends – was so disconcerting. He Googled “guide to festival-going” and found there wasn’t a comprehensive manual on par with those written for more traditional hobbyists like golfers, fishermen, hunters, snowboarders and hikers. There was no one he could pay to give him a lesson. So, he sought out festival veterans, the people with the comfortable chairs, organized campsites and good shoes, and soaked up all their knowledge. He then led by example, finding efficient ways to instill order, and thus greater levels of enjoyment, into the often disorganized and sometimes sloppy festival culture. His goal is to establish festival-going as a legitimate hobby. He’s even trademarked the word “FestivalGoer”.His first taste of success came at Coachella 2011, when he brought a portable phone charger he’d bought online. These chargers weren’t common at the time, and fellow attendees were impressed that Gumber’s phone didn’t die all weekend. “It was just game on from there,” he says. “It was like: ‘There’s a right way to do this and I’m going to learn it.’” For a time Gumber made money by renting the house he had bought in Los Angeles – where he moved after college – when he was 24. (“I was really good at sales,” he says of the purchase.) He eventually sold the house and invested the money into FestEvo, an app he developed that helps fans discover new music, connect with friends and gather festival tips. Everything Gumber owns now fits into a suitcase and carry-on bag. His only major expenses are his cellphone and the cash required to keep the FestEvo servers running, and he typically gets into festivals for free with media or artist passes. At shows he subsists largely on 99-cent tuna packets and protein shakes and says he’s still navigating how to make his lifestyle financially viable. Certainly Gumber’s greatest asset – and most employable skill – is the knowledge he’s accumulated in his hundreds of days of festival-going. Just as a fishing guide can lead you to the best spot on the river or a snowboarding instructor can show you how to carve, Gumber knows what you should wear, how to pack your car and how to avoid post-fest depression. All this information is in The FestivalGoers Guide, his comprehensive book that should be required reading for any car full of 18-year-olds driving off to their first event. “I’ve been able to cover every angle of festivals because I’ve been bitch slapped from every angle,” Gumber says. “In my first year of festivals, there wasn’t one that I didn’t have a moment where I didn’t kind of feel like crying because my phone was dead or I’d lost my friends or I couldn’t find my tent.”Sweet, funny and blessed with a huge and seemingly permanent smile, Gumber’s love for festival culture – and the music, community, nature and travel within it – is obvious. While others might feel a level of burnout after seven years on the road, he remains enthusiastic and dedicated. A few years ago he left Coachella on a Saturday morning at dawn, flew to Oregon to be a groomsman at a friend’s wedding and flew back to the festival the next morning. He even had the wedding DJ play music by all the artists he was missing. Like his father before him, Gumber is a hardcore conservationist. (“I was a four-year-old and picking up trash on hikes with my dad, so it hurt my heart to see the litter at festivals.”) He posts a selfie of his clean campsite after every show, organizes two-minute festival clean-ups on Facebook and travels with his own reusable utensils to cut down on waste. He nearly got into a fight this year at Coachella after approaching a man who had tossed a tomato on the ground. In his book, Gumber also takes a hard stance against sneaking into shows and scalping. “If you’re selling tickets above face value, that’s enough for me to know I don’t need you in my life.”Last weekend, Gumber shared his expertise with hundreds of attendees at Michigan’s Electric Forest. He’ll give the talk again this weekend at the second iteration of the fest, having become the sage veteran with the comfortable shoes he sought out in his early days. He says the best part of the festival was running into people who had benefited from his advice. One guy ran up and gave him a hug, saying he was able to get some sleep by following Gumber’s recommendation of removing the rain fly from his tent to create airflow. Telling this story with the same enthusiasm one might use to recap a great day of fishing or particularly epic day on the slopes, it’s clear this hobbyist turned FestivalGoer has found his calling.

Aaron Millar lists his favourite watering holesDenver is known as the “Napa Valley of Beer” for good reason: more hoppy delights are brewed here than anywhere else in the country. Add to that five gold medals at this year’s World Beer Cup Awards (or the Olympics of brewing, as it’s known), more than 100 artisan tap rooms, and the simple fact that beer tastes better looking at the mountains, having climbed mountains or talking about going to the mountains tomorrow. Like a brew with a view? Here are some of Denver’s top hop spots: Tivoli Brewing Company Denver’s oldest brewery has been serving up frothy refreshments since the first settlers arrived in 1859. Check out their historic taproom for a glass of Tivoli Helles Lager, a favourite of the early pioneers, which is still poured to this day.Wynkoop Brewing Company Established in 1988, this is Colorado’s first craft brewpub, and still one of its best and most notorious. Try their Rocky Mountain Oyster Stout, brewed with its namesake (bull’s testicles to you and me the region has no oysters).Ratio Beerworks Set up by a trio of former 90s punk rock touring musicians, this industrial-style taproom in the hip RiNo (River North) Arts District has taken the Denver craft beer scene by storm. Expect slick brews, a sweet patio and one of the coolest live music, arts and event line-ups in the city. Their Dear You French saison is already a classic beer.Denver Beer Trail With four walking routes – each through a different downtown neighbourhood – covering 14 miles and 35 taprooms in total, this is the ultimate craft-brew pub crawl, a half-marathon of beer. Great American Beer Festival Held in Denver each October, this is the largest beer party in the country, with more than 3,500 artisan, classic and rare brews on show. Want a sip of each? Well, good luck: a 1oz sample of every brew on display adds up to 220 pints, or about three bathtubs’ of beer.Telluride Blues \u0026amp Brews The best blues musicians on the planet alongside the best craft beer in the state, all served up in one of the Rockies’ most beautiful towns. It’s every Coloradan’s favourite end-of-summer brews event, and with good reason.If you prefer your glass with a stem, then here’s something to celebrate: with 300 days of sunshine a year, low humidity, and crisp mountain nights, Colorado is overflowing with wine as well as beer. From rieslings and cabernets to wines made from peach, cherries, honey and plums, its high-altitude vineyards – the loftiest in the US – produce a unique regional style.For the best wineries and tours, head over to the Western Slope. Two Rivers Winery – found near the spectacular red rock canyons of the Colorado National Monument – and the award-winning vintages of Carlson Vineyards are two of the best.United Airlines offers a seasonal, non-stop service from London Heathrow to Denver on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner – complete with high-tech cabin lighting and smoother ride technology, plus flat-bed seats in Polaris business class.

These road to vision zero proposals are a step in the right direction, but there is still much to do to wean drivers off petrol and diesel cars.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab45772f3194adbe129cce2e1e6eada86cb70473/1345_1008_3060_1836/master/3060.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19a2220b2cca703b7051b0adc5dfe475","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"A rare shark sighting, flying ants and a saltwater crocodile are among this week’s pick of images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad693b76d13b7b699f424a0533bc757b5734b338/0_500_3831_2299/master/3831.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02961db752681c85e80846ca03be512d","title":"manolo blahnik mens shoes","story":"His shoes are so coveted by women that Madonna once famously said they were better than sex. So what will men make of his footwear now that he is turning his attention to them?It’s the end of our hour together, and Manolo Blahnik is walking me out, through the grand hallway of his offices in a Georgian townhouse, when a rare silence falls over him. He is watching a courier deliver a parcel. The man has braids that are tightly bound into a green bandana that matches his uniform, and he hands over the little signy machine to an assistant with a jaunty half-bow. Blahnik is transfixed. As the door closes behind him, Blahnik allows himself a small gasp of delight, his eyes wide behind tiny tortoiseshell glasses. “Style!” he squeaks. “Everywhere!”Admiring men’s style is a new hobby for Mr Blahnik, now 75 and so established as a women’s designer that, like Madonna (who once said, “His shoes are as good as sex and they last longer”), his heels are famous enough to go by a single name: “Manolos”. “If God had wanted women to wear flat shoes,” wrote Alexandra Shulman in 1994, “he wouldn’t have invented Manolo Blahnik.” After 45 years of making women’s shoes he is opening his first men’s shop, where he will attempt to do for them what he has done for women – create fancy, fun, luxury footwear that is also remarkably comfortable. “His men’s shoes, well…” said his friend Rupert Everett, “they’re like slightly more feminine versions of the women’s shoes.”While other designers have followed fashion through vertiginous platforms and clompy soles, Manolo Blahnik’s have remained staunchly trendless – typically a modest stiletto, a patent leather Mary Jane, a bright colour, reminiscent of sweeties. And yet, fashion has come to him, whether radical design collective Vetements or young British designer Grace Wales Bonner, who has, he says, “An incredible uniqueness – immediately we got on well.” He smiles, his accent a chocolatey combination of the six languages he speaks fluently. “When I worked at the Royal College I used to end up with the freakiest of them all, the most twisted of them all.” Which, I offer, is slightly surprising considering, and I’m going to say, “you are such a part of the establishment”, or “considering your shoes cost £800”, but he finishes my sentence: “Because I’m such an old old boy, yes!”Some of his favourite customers, he adds, are those who travel for miles, leaving home at dawn to stand in line for his legendary annual sample sale. “We have queues and queues of young women who could be my great granddaughters. Four o’clock on the first train from, I don’t know where, from Wales or something. I love those women.”And they love him, too – they stop him in the street, desperate for selfies with this eccentric OAP who designs 600 shoes a year. “Werk, werk, werk,” he exclaims, then checks, “Like Rihanna?” with whom he collaborated on three collections of sandals and thigh-high boots. He always says yes to photos and autographs, slightly bemused, despite having become a household name through Sex and the City. “You can take my Fendi Baguette,” Carrie Bradshaw told a Manhattan mugger. “You can take my ring and my watch. But please don’t take my Manolo Blahniks.”He does not sleep well. There is an infectious energy that rises from him like heat. He gets migraines that make him, he whispers, dramatically, “vomit”. Night is when he works best. “In fact, by the bed I have a little box with papers and a huge wire with a pen and when I can’t sleep I write. But my dreams are not very funny, they really are not. For instance I went to see Snow White – for weeks I couldn’t sleep.” He has recurring nightmares about she-wolves from Mexican novels, strangling him with sharp fingernails. It takes him some time, upon waking, to recover. “They’re reality for me, which is horrible. And you know, I have this incredible thing about death.” His friend Anna Piaggi, the Italian style icon, used to call him every morning as they got dressed, and the other day, when the phone rang he picked it up and began to chat to her, forgetting she died in 2012. “Señor Blahnik?” said the stranger on the other end of the line. He had to sit down for a moment.There are many Annas in his life, including Wintour, who only wears Manolos, and who remembers bouncing her child on her knee in his Chelsea store in the 1970s. He had moved to the UK from the Canary Islands – that was the period he was working with Ossie Clark, and became the first man on the cover of Vogue. “I love Mrs Wintour,” he says today. “She seems cold and aloof and distant, but she’s not. She’s so ine. And Grace Coddington, though all those girls are just getting a little bit… tired.” Elsewhere, in the recent film of his life, Manolo: The Boy Who Made Shoes for Lizards, Iman, John Galliano, Naomi Campbell and his great friend Mary Beard describe his artistry, the way he weaves his vast historical knowledge into his work.As well as Dickens and Flaubert, he is “obsessed” with films – the only benefit of the internet, he says, is the way it allows him to track down lost movies. Last weekend, a rare free day at home in Bath, he treated himself to an Angela Lansbury marathon, from Gaslight to Sweeney Todd. Gaslight, I mention, is being revisited today, as its story – a husband convincing his wife she is mad – has inspired a term that’s used regularly in political commentary. “Agh, everything’s political now which I find is very, very infuriating. I don’t care about politics. I don’t give a damn about those people, they’re so ugly, all of them. If they were ravishing, it would perhaps be different for me. I like physical beauty that you cannot reach, you know?”So he does think about politics? “No I don’t. I have likes and dislikes. Beauty is what’s important to me. I like statues also, that have nothing to say. Like the statues of Canova. Divine. I like things like that, that you cannot touch. The real thing is not exactly my…” He stops. He’s not interested in relationships. “I love living by myself. The idea of having to share something with anyone fills me with…” he shudders. “I mean… I don’t do well. Contact. I can’t stand – oh no – the normal functions of people. I’m very strange, actually, in that respect. Maybe I need help.” And he laughs.Has he ever had therapy? “No. I know exactly who I am and it doesn’t help you at all. Sometimes when I’m really desperate or crazy, because I have too much to do, I do my ‘mental cleaning’.” Which means returning to the authors he loves, Benito Pérez Galdós, Gore Vidal, Germaine Greer. “How wonderful she was in the 1970s, a woman with guts, saying: ‘This is what it is.’ And she’s incredible now. But now I think she’s not very healthy?” I start to reply and he talks over me. “But she is wonderful. Maybe you don’t like her. I like her. At the time it was shocking. It was too much, but it was true. Nowadays with all these stupid movements and this and that, it gets lost, her original thoughts about the freedom of a woman.”He finds peace in work. He is happiest in the factory. Elsewhere – meetings, especially – less so. “I’m not very pleasant sometimes,” he smiles, cheekily. “But I never think about me too much. When I do, I say: ‘Oh, what is going on? What is wrong? I should not do this.’ That’s why I say to you: ‘Doctors? No, thank you.’ I go to doctors a lot, but for the two crushed vertebra in my back. I have so many moods. I’m somebody who dreams a lot. I try to run away from this thing – what’s going on in the world has never been so bad as now.”His favourite people today are taxi drivers, because they talk to him. “I feel, not nostalgic, but melancholic about certain things that are gone. For instance, Bell \u0026amp Croyden used to be the most extraordinary Edwardian apothecary in London. Then I passed by the other day, and it’s like a huge empty supermarket in Dallas. This is what I really get sad and furious about. Why? Why that need to change something which was perfect? Same with Bond Street. It could be Rome, could be Rio, could be anywhere. Now it’s all Dolce \u0026amp Gabbana, all that global nonsense.” And yet, he still adores England. “London is still beyond exotic to me. But I have never felt foreign here. I should, perhaps, because my language is not perfect, and my things are not what you’d call English. But I never felt strange here.”The most arresting shoes from his menswear collection are made from palm trees and raffia and come in a selection of rainbow shades. His favourite is the yellow. Suddenly, he picks up a green one, and folds it into his hand. It bounces back, perfect. The ideal, he says, is that the shoe feels “nonexistent”.We walk slowly out towards the door, past photographs of the men he was inspired by for this new reboot – travel writer Patrick Leigh Fermor, Gary Cooper – and that’s when he sees the courier, with his stylish bandana, and, for the first time since I arrived, stops talking.Manolo Blahnik’s first menswear store is now open in Burlington Arcade, London, manoloblahnik "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43f132b77ac0fd808aed7222b959f9341dfb0252/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd7a53f9644ffae0097b4962ada4e559","title":"summers 50 best swimsuits for her and him in pictures","story":"Grab a one-piece, bikini, rash vest or trunks and make a splash, or keep cool lounging by the pool, in stripes, polka dots or tropical prints"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9d6247446ab818f60b988b8476331c89e47430f/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b2ea0a05afa8da67e3f167777b8d48c","title":"the 10 best mens polo shirts in pictures","story":"The perfect stylish solution to rising temperatures, polo shirts were a catwalk hit at Balenciaga, Ralph Lauren and Dior for summer 2018"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f87b8dc29fd444501bbe04ff594f9e877d796cbd/0_189_3503_2102/master/3503.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb6ea8d38a5dc0e2accc7cdea73e360a","title":"croatia scouting report luka modric england","story":"Whether that was because they were marking zonally, concerned about being penalised for holding or simply too exhausted to think straight at the end of a long evening is unclear. But it was ridiculously easy for the unmarked Mário Fernandes to head home. And that is not an isolated case. A long throw against Denmark, in the previous round, led to Mathias Jørgensen’s goal. Iceland also had some joy against Croatia via set-pieces – Sverrir Ingason headed against the bar when he should have scored and long throws caused consternation again. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that Dejan Lovren and Domagoj Vida, the two central defenders, are not commanding enough when attacking balls in their own area.That said, Vida did manage to score at the other end against Russia, so there is a cautionary footnote here for England. Nonetheless, with\u0026nbspfive of England’s 11 World Cup goals having come from corners or free-kicks, Gareth Southgate’s players should be\u0026nbspencouraged.Ivan Strinic, Croatia’s left‑back, has long been the national team’s scapegoat. “I’ve learned how to deal with it,” the Sampdoria defender said recently, fully aware the finger of blame is generally pointed in his direction whenever things go wrong. Whether that is fair or not, it was clear that Russia targeted Strinic. Russia had plenty of joy on their right flank, where Fernandes, galloping forward from full-back, and Alexander Samedov, the wide man in front of him, caused\u0026nbspno end of problems during the first half.Zlatko Dalic, Croatia’s coach, acknowledged that was the case afterwards and talked about there being “quite a lot of pressure” from Fernandes, who breaks from deep in a similar way to Kieran Trippier.Strinic picked up a yellow card for a cynical tug on Samedov and was later withdrawn, perhaps with that caution in mind, yet he will almost certainly start against England. In fairness to the 30-year-old, who has won 47 caps, there were some mitigating circumstances against Russia. Ivan Perisic, who started wide on the left and was also substituted, provides little defensive protection and often left the left-back outnumbered. Trippier, working in tandem with one of Jesse Lingard, Dele Alli and Raheem Sterling, must look to create overloads on England’s right.One plays for Real Madrid, the other for Barcelona, which is not a bad starting point. Aged 30 and 32, Ivan Rakitic and Modric are in now‑or-never territory for Croatia. They are playing like they realise that, too.The one dilemma for Dalic is how to configure his midfield to maximise Modric’s talent. When he took over last year, Dalic thrust Modric further forward, into the No\u0026nbsp10 role, to try to give the team more penetration, and it worked. Against Russia, however, Dalic reverted to tactics more often deployed by his predecessors – and not always with success – as Modric initially sat deeper, alongside Rakitic, in order to accommodate an extra attacker. Croatia were overrun for 45 minutes. “We lacked a body in midfield,” Dalic admitted. The Croatia coach introduced Marcelo Brozovic as a screening midfielder, to liberate Modric and Rakitic, and his team controlled the game thereafter. That 4-3-3 or 4-1-4-1 formation, depending on how you interpret it, is likely to be how Croatia will set up against England, giving Southgate a conundrum of his own, because Jordan Henderson will, without question, need help in midfield to prevent Modric and Rakitic from running the show.With Belgium playing their reserves against England, Colombia missing James Rodríguez and Sweden’s attack led by a striker who failed to score at this World Cup, there is an argument that Southgate’s threefive-man defence has yet to be really tested in Russia. That is not to take any credit away from the way that Harry Maguire et\u0026nbspal have performed so far, just a reminder the bar will be raised in Moscow on Wednesday. Although Croatia are not blessed with the attacking prowess of Belgium or France, Dalic still has talented iniduals at his disposal, and each brings something\u0026nbspdifferent to the team. Andrej Kramaric, who can play anywhere across the front, is a far better player than he showed at Leicester City. The selfless Mario Mandzukic will run himself into the ground. Perisic, who was close to joining Manchester United last summer, provides craft and guile on the left, and Ante Rebic is pacy and direct. All four started against Russia. Dalic will not go down that path again because of the\u0026nbspspace they conceded in midfield,\u0026nbspbut England will be stretched regardless,\u0026nbspespecially in the wide areas behind Trippier and Ashley Young."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77e8a4d42e44f633e4a0c9c33dd1852833d49dd3/0_50_1899_1139/master/1899.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f366acbcd5bbf9f2be7dede15f78f85","title":"england celebrates gareth southgate as hero of world cup waistcoast","story":"Waistcoated and understated, tournament’s paragon of civility is having his momentTights, capes and masks are so last season. Heroes in 2018 wear Marks \u0026amp Spencer waistcoats.Gareth Southgate, now inseparable from his signature navy waistcoat, light-blue shirt and striped tie combination, has emerged as an understated paragon of civility at the 2018 World Cup.From social media devotion to thinkpieces about positive masculinity, the England manager is enjoying a swell of support and adoration as he leads his squad closer to the trophy. Geoff Hurst, whose hat-trick against West Germany helped England win the 1966 World Cup, has likened Southgate to Sir Alf Ramsey, saying his leadership has “engendered a good team spirit”. As England’s campaign in Russia got underway, Southgate showed himself to be a reflective soul in an interview with ITV that encapsulated his world view.Asked about whether supporters were “connecting” with the team, rather than offering platitudes, the manager started musing on modern English identity.“We’re a team with our ersity and youth that represents modern England and in England we’ve spent a bit of time being lost as to what our modern identity is, and I think as a team we represent that modern identity and hopefully people can connect with us.”He added: “We have a chance to affect something bigger than ourselves.”The tournament has served as a platform for reminding football fans and non-fans of the kindness and generosity Southgate has shown. Social media is awash with memes, tweets and posts praising the 47-year-old, including a hashtag #GarethSouthgateWould. Examples included Southgate writing personally to fans and devoting his time to young players.Others suggested the support for Southgate reflected a desire for genuine role models.Of course Southgate’s backstory gives his refreshed celebrity an edge. His saved penalty in the Euro 96 semi-final against Germany became one of English football’s most infamous moments. After last week’s game against Colombia, Southgate offered a hug to Mateus Uribe, who missed his spot-kick against England. The tributes continued to come on Sunday, with Andrew Marr presenting his eponymous current affairs programme on BBC One in a Southgate waistcoat and tie.Neil Rowe, from Surrey, England, is enjoying a boom in popularity off the back of the England manager’s run of glory. Rowe’s a Southgate lookalike. Rowe, who is in Russia, told the BBC: “Some fans here in Russia believe I am the real one. Some Colombians were having a go at me yesterday, saying well done to your team for beating us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/020c794a06fbd7cdc1f3e9b59e8e739beee75a58/0_2_2176_1306/master/2176.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3037da9ba0260b6e5df2d6a9ce46b07","title":"england gareth southgate semi final","story":"Manager stands on verge of history and talk at his training base has turned to the heroes of 1966 as Croatia semi-final looms“I want to be back home as I hear they are having street parties.” Bobby Robson, 1 July 1990 – Cameroon 2 England 3So far there is only one player who can vouch that England is experiencing the same kind of football frenzy the country last encountered when World in Motion was in the charts, when there was Bobby Robson and Gary Lineker and Nessun Dorma and let’s-all-have-a-disco and Paul Gascoigne, with that big, chip‑pan grin, until everything went so horribly wrong.Fabian Delph has been trying to explain it to his teammates after his visit home for the birth of his daughter. Delph kept sharp by training at Manchester City. He flew back in a private jet with the family of Vincent Kompany, his club colleague, and he is being perfectly serious when he says England’s penalties against Colombia brought his wife, Natalie, into labour. Delph was home for four days and, now he is back in Repino, he has let the others know the madness of it all.“We are out here in our bubble, our circle, and we don’t have outside distractions so we are not aware of what is going on. But going back was incredible. The support was absolutely amazing. Even people who are not into football, stopping me, shouting and telling me: ‘Make sure you bring it home.’ It was crazy, overwhelming. I have told the lads and they could not believe it.”How, after all, can you do it justice when none of these players is old enough to remember that night in Turin 28 years ago? Are they aware of the survey that estimates one in 10 people is contemplating pulling a sickie for England’s semi-final against Croatia? Or the story from Nottingham’s Theatre Royal about the final scenes from Titanic: The Musical being interrupted by the cries of “yes” from two women in the front row? England’s players have been following through Twitter. But it is difficult, as Delph says, to comprehend unless you have seen it close up. “We are in for a shock when we are finished and go home.”Back in Repino, meanwhile, the train to St Petersburg trundled through and most of the tweeting came from the birds in the pine forests. The FA deliberately chose this venue for England’s World Cup base because it was so quiet and out of the way. One supermarket, a pharmacy next door and a few miles along the coast, in Zelenogorsk, is the training ground and, for reasons unexplained, a statue of a dachshund in the centre of the village.Did Southgate get that pint of bitter he said he was craving after the quarter-final victory against Sweden? England’s manager once had a reputation as the kind of man who would paint the town beige, not red. But it was never correct. Above all Southgate wants his players to enjoy these moments and drink it all in. Families were invited into the team hotel on Sunday. The players watched the game together and, behind the smoked windows of the team bus, Southgate had asked every member of his backroom staff to help create a playlist, two songs each. At Euro 96 the players used to sing Three Lions on the way to Wembley. Here they had another sing-along. “The players were actually quite happy,” Southgate reported. “They got us to turn it up.”It was a happy camp and there was a lovely moment, before leaving the Samara Arena, when a few of us let Southgate know the video of his celebrations with the fans, conducting the England orchestra, was already online. Before that there was the screaming, fist‑pumping “come on” that went viral after the Colombia match. We showed him the footage. “There’s the emotion,” he said. “The fans have paid a lot. They have come a long way and to be able to connect with them … I’d love to be able to do it with the however many millions who are watching at home but the supporters who are here, they’re singing, and I know what they’ve been through.“I met lots of them before we came. They told me their stories, how many years they have been travelling to watch England and what it meant to them. I played for three clubs and I have a real affinity with all three but England has been the biggest part of my life.” For the first time there was a brief moment when it sounded as if his voice was cracking.Southgate was a 19-year-old on the books of Crystal Palace, still living with his parents in Crawley, when Italia 90 was alive. He watched the semi-final against West Germany at a mate’s house with a curry and some beers but even then the teenager was learning for the future. Southgate taped all the matches of that tournament. “I videoed it to look at the players, the matches and, as a young player, I guess I wanted to see the best players, the level they were playing and what I could learn from it.”England’s beaten semi‑finalists came back to an open-top bus parade – the lingering memory being Gazza wearing a pair of fake breasts – and maybe that was part of the problem. Germany, Argentina, Brazil, Spain, France and all the elite football nations would never celebrate losing a semi-final. Southgate was part of the England team that reached the same stage of Euro 96. “It doesn’t mean a lot now,” he volunteered.The point here is that, for all the nostalgia surrounding 1990, that penalty shootout defeat in Turin was a bad experience for England and the only glory, in the truest sense of the word, went to the winners. Will Southgate tell his players the same holds true now? “I don’t think I’ll need to,” he replied. “They know what they want to do. They know they stand on a moment of history and they are desperate to do as well as they possibly can. They don’t need any motivation for this now. It’s all there, it’s all apparent.”Southgate gave the impression he would rather have faced Russia in the semi-final on Wednesday, acknowledging that England would encounter a “really top team” in Croatia, but it would come as a surprise now if they were suddenly afflicted by stage-fright or the kind of inferiority complex he detected, as a player, before the 2002 quarter‑final against Brazil.“We are enjoying the journey. Everything we’ve done has been based on enjoyment. How far can we go? Let’s push the boundaries, let’s create our own history. We know where we are, we know we’re not the finished article and I don’t think we have loads of world-class players. There are other teams in the tournament who have a better collection of iniduals but we’ve been a real team. We have some excellent players, no doubt about that, but the collective strength has been massive.”A small thing, perhaps, but this was the first time Southgate has felt comfortable enough to talk about the possibility of going all the way, of heading back to Moscow next Sunday and testing his poorly shoulder in the Luzhniki Stadium by lifting a trophy that, for so many years, always seemed out of reach. If you were English, it was reassuring to hear. And just a touch surreal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ef5a266c59dc1d218000313123da8b2423fcfcd/0_210_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0e6987487fb73a927c52bd38c4377ae","title":"its coming home the meaning behind the three lions lyrics","story":"An old football refrain echoes through the streets of England as the 1996 song roars againAs many of us laid our heads to rest on Saturday night with windows wide open to offset the effects of the relentless summer heatwave, the distant call of England football fans howling “it’s coming home” may have echoed in the street outside.Many will recognise the slurred refrain as the choral lyric to the 1996 No 1 single Three Lions, penned by Scouse Britpop band the Lightning Seeds and the then-relatively baby-faced comedians Frank Skinner and David Baddiel.Others may more readily know the line from a run of optimistic internet memes.But the verse of Three Lions, which was released 22 years ago, has left even football-savvy younger fans a little confused.The refrain “it’s coming home”was actually a reference to the fact that when the song was released, England was hosting its first major football tournament since the 1966 World Cup. But the snippet has evolved to refer to both England’s hopes of bringing home the World Cup trophy but also the disputed spiritual home of football. The international governing body, Fifa, says football in its current form was invented in England in 1863. But earlier versions of the sport can be traced much further back to widespread countries including China.The three lions have a history going back to the 12th century, when a standard with three gold lions on a red field was carried into battle to inspire the troops. Monarchs in the middle ages were sometimes referred to as lions due to the big cat’s associated characteristics of bravery, aggression and having great hair.Then there is a reference to “Jules Rimet still gleaming” – not as some have misheard “jewels remain still gleaming”.Rimet was the longest-serving president of Fifa, who held the post for 33 years and who started the World Cup competition in 1929. The original World Cup trophy was named after him – the trophy England won in 1966.And when Skinner, Baddiel and the Lightning Seeds’ frontman, Ian Broudie, describe “that tackle by Moore and when Lineker scored” and “Bobby belting the ball, and Nobby dancing” they are making reference to the England football heroes Bobby Moore, Bobby Charlton and Nobby Stiles of the 1966 World Cup-winning team and the England footballer-turned-Match of the Day presenter-turned-crisps promoter, Gary Lineker.And when they sing “but all those oh, so nears wear you down through the years”, they are referring to defeats in the past including the penalty shoot-out loss at the World Cup in 1990. Since then there have been many more, including penalty shootout defeats in the 1998 and 2006 World Cups as well as in the 1996, 2004 and 2012 European Championships, which is why you would be forgiven for presuming, going by the response from some fans and some in the media, that England had won the actual World Cup and not a match in the round of 16 against Colombia.England will play their first World Cup semi-final in 28 years on Wednesday, the last time being against West Germany in 1990 – six years before Three Lions was released. Back then it was all about New Order’s World in Motion and the John Barnes rap. But we’ll save that for another article."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0284145d4a5bd51cd23d7b0e1bdae711a44b9cba/0_36_1739_1043/master/1739.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4753a281d43ddd505d549922cf633a8e","title":"thierry henry belgium stay in shadows france world cup semi final","story":"The former France striker is an inspiration to the Belgium players but will not put himself in the spotlight as they prepare to face France in the World Cup semi-finalAs Belgium began their World Cup preparations there was one coach who looked as if he was competing for a place in the starting XI. In the sprints he was up there with the best. During the warm-up exercises he barely lost the ball. You could see that he takes care of himself and his diet.His name? Thierry Henry, of course. Such details enhance the former Arsenal forward’s status as an idol in the Belgium set-up and help to make him a perfect link between the players and staff.But suddenly there are other links to consider, too. This week Henry has been thrust into the position of trying to help those players defeat the country of his birth, for whom he won 123 caps, not to mention a World Cup and European Championship.Henry’s presence on Belgium’s bench for their semi-final against France on Tuesday has prompted no shortage of comment from Les Bleus. “It’s bizarre,” Didier Deschamps, the coach, told Téléfoot. Olivier Giroud was more forthright. “I would be proud to show Titi that he chose the wrong camp,” he said. The striker believes it will be a “peculiar match” for Henry.What Henry makes of it remains a mystery. Interview requests and demands to get him to a press conference were brushed aside. He prefers to leave the talking to the others. The 40-year-old does not want his massive shadow to take limelight away from those who have a bigger influence on performances.No one in the Belgium camp carries a reputation as substantial as the former Arsenal striker’s. He is the most decorated staff member, with a Champions League and five league titles to add to those honours with France. He was – and still is – worshipped by millions of fans. He presents an image of charm, wit, intelligence and flair.Even in Russia, 20 years after he won the World Cup, you can feel his aura. Journalists covering Belgium are starting to get slightly annoyed by it. At every press conference comes the same question. A Belgian, Dutchman, Frenchman, Spaniard or Englishman begs for the microphone and asks the player about … Belgium’s second assistant‑manager: “How does it feel to be on the pitch with him?” “What does he add to your game?” “Does his experience help you in the race to the final?”Last week there were plenty of sighs among the reporters but now it is even worse. The Thierry Henry game is on. In the buildup to France‑Belgium the Belgium assistant will have most of the spotlights on him: the temporary enemy of France. His reputation, nationality and past drawn as a shadow over him, at a moment when he was enjoying a role in the shade.Henry joined the Belgium squad in 2016, a few weeks after Roberto Martínez had been appointed as manager, and since has given one interview: to Belgium’s public broadcaster, in which he emphasised that he wanted to stay out of the limelight. “I am not the national manager, neither am I the assistant manager,” he said. “I’m the T3, the third coach. From the beginning I have said that everybody had to keep calm. It’s not the Thierry Henry show I’m here to help the manager and the squad. The manager is the one who will do the talking, I will try to make the team better. As a coach you don’t have to mention what you have done as player in the past. And as a coach I haven’t proven anything.”That was something he made clear to the Belgian football federation (KBVB) too, when an agreement was concluded in August 2016 in Monaco. In support of Martínez and his first assistant, the Englishman Graeme Jones, the governing body wanted a coach who had copious experience as a player, had won trophies and could transfer his know-how and winning mentality to this generation of players.It was early in the process of searching out a successor for Marc Wilmots that Ralf Rangnick, now the director of football of RB Leipzig but then one of the three main candidates, mentioned that Henry was interested in joining Belgium.Rangnick said that, if he got the job, Henry should join him as an assistant. Rangnick was not appointed but Martínez welcomed with open arms the suggestion of taking Henry on to his staff. KBVB directors have never hidden that Henry was getting work experience for his coaching badges. He was allowed to keep his well-paid job as a pundit with Sky and his demands were modest – he earns about €2,500 (£2,200) a week and apparently donates his wages to charity. Unlike Martínez, who signed a new two‑year deal before the World Cup, Henry has not accepted an offer to continue. The Belgian FA hopes he will extend, too.When Henry was introduced to the players in their hotel in Zaventem in September 2016, some were amazed to meet him. He was one of their childhood idols. Some, such as Christian Benteke and Michy Batshuayi, had posters of him on the wall. A source in the KBVB said: “You should have seen their faces. Priceless reactions.” Batshuayi, master of social media, immediately posted a picture of Henry and him: “Learning from the best.”Henry acts like a teacher, too. He regularly pulls the attackers aside to talk about their movement and positioning. At one of the first meetings he asked Eden Hazard, Romelu Lukaku and co to show clips and would give his observations. Henry, a perfectionist, does not mince his words. He can be very hard and forthright with the players. His little tricks help them. The younger squad members, in particular, listen to everything he says.Lukaku was one of the first to knock on his door. They are similar characters and have a very natural relationship. “I have already told Thierry Henry that I have found out his technique to score goals,” Lukaku has said. “I’m not yet there, but I’m slowly getting there.”Even in England they sometimes meet. “We discuss what I have to do better. I also talk him sometimes through some old games. One with Arsenal in the 2005-2006 season, for instance. I can tell you all about it, and then he brings out details from one of my matches, and together we look for ways in which I can do even better. I learn from him every day. The way of moving, how to find the spaces, control the ball as well as possible. He could do it all. I have learned so much from him.”As a coach Henry is in the first place an observer. He takes care of the attacking set pieces but during the open group sessions he stays in the background. Others do the talking. Before each session he puts out the cones and at the end he removes them. Usually, while waiting for the players to leave the pitch, he does tricks with the ball. “I think that this is mainly school for him – these are his first years as a coach,” Dries Mertens has said.Among the players Henry still likes to behave like one of the boys. He was seen playing basketball with Hazard and Benteke he watches games with Vincent Kompany, who lifted him in the air after the Brazil game he jokes around. “He is an idol for everyone within the group,” Youri Tielemans has said. “Someone who laughs very often and still has a boys’ mentality.”But will he be laughing if he helps Belgium to slay France?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dba6e87bad7269df3ab3338da2928f19063019cc/0_118_3488_2092/master/3488.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca1c5d258458e948e6e4fa5d01436f32","title":"england into semi finals croatia end russias run world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss England’s quarter-final win, Croatia’s punishing victory over hosts Russia, Cristiano Ronaldo transfer machinations, Croydon bus stops and baby choices"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c9ebd0c9c5818098e1724d0c442d145a8fb3a36/0_10_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aad45b7e7bd5c6144ef3175dd8921f08","title":"kylian mbappe boldness france belgium world cup semi final","story":"Belgium’s progression through two big games could give them an edge in World Cup semi-final, so young French forward must prove a threat with his close control and accelerationSo, here we are in the semi-finals. This was the target set for Didier Deschamps by the French Federation, so he can take a bow and say the job’s done but now we’re in the last four the tournament really begins. We’re two more wins from a second star on the France shirt and we have the quality to go all the way, especially if Kylian Mbappé carries on playing the way he has been in the past couple of games. Like just about everybody, I have been really impressed by him.The Argentinians were not very fast and left great spaces that allowed Mbappé to express his pace and show how dangerous he can be if you let him run at you. The way Argentina played, with a high back‑line and slow defenders, was almost too good to be true from a French point of view. I was really looking forward to how he would cope with the challenge of playing Uruguay, who we knew would defend deeper, leave him less space and look to throw him off his stride.But even with less room in which to manoeuvre we saw just how useful Mbappé can be. Right from the off he took defenders on, looking to create danger with his close control, acceleration and dribbling skills. I was impressed by the way he went at them right from the start. Deschamps has clearly told him to express himself, to enjoy himself even, and that is the way he has to play. Some criticised him for what they thought was a touch of the Neymars in the second half but you have to just go along with his exuberance – he’s at the World Cup, playing huge games that the whole world is watching and he’s having fun – it’s great. (That said, I may have taken a different point of view back in my days as a defender.)I liked the way Mbappé was strong physically, stood up to the opposition and was able to resist in a physical battle. He has no fear, and that’s where I am reminded of Thierry Henry and David Trezeguet from 1998. They also possessed this insouciance and ambition that allowed them to perform on the biggest stage in the world. I remember the shootout against Italy in the quarter-finals when they stepped up to take a penalty when some of their more experienced teammates really didn’t want to – me included. And they both scored.It is early to be comparing Mbappé with Pelé or Thierry Henry, however much I understand the need to find parallels. At the same age, I would say Thierry did not have the same ability as Mbappé but he had intelligence, brain and the desire to become the best.Mbappé is with a club where he will be looked after and his talent will be nurtured. What he does next is vital. Who knows what might happen if Cristiano Ronaldo decides to leave for Juventus and Real Madrid want to recruit Mbappé? I remember Henry left Monaco for Juventus and that it didn’t really work out for him. He made the right choice to join Arsenal and find a manager who would help bring out the best in him. That’s why choices are so important.Mbappé needs time and we mustn’t rush him. But I have great faith in his ability to succeed because I can see the work he puts in for the collective. He offers solutions with his runs, his willingness to make himself available and even take knocks for the team.In France, some fans railed against Antoine Griezmann because he didn’t celebrate his goal against Uruguay. He explained that he has many really close friends who are Uruguayan, guys who have helped shape his career and guys who are really close in his personal life, like Diego Godín, who is the godfather to Griezmann’s daughter, so I’m not too worried by that.Marouane Fellaini proved too hot for France to handle a year out from their hosting of Euro 2016, with two goals before half-time at the Stade de France, before Radja Nainggolan and Eden Hazard added two more after the break. It was France’s second defeat since the 2014 World Cup, and proved a portentous sign before their loss to Portugal in the final at Saint‑Denis a little over 12 months later.The last time the sides met competitively was in the King Hassan II Cup in Casablanca as preparation for the World Cup later that year. A single second‑half goal from Zinedine Zidane was enough to separate them, with France going on to \u0027win’ a mini-league also including Morocco and Glenn Hoddle’s England, who drew 0-0 with Belgium before losing on penalties.France won the battle for pride in Puebla at the Mexico World Cup, claiming third place with two goals in extra time after the 90 minutes ended 2-2. Jan Ceulemans had given Belgium the lead, before Jean-Marc Ferreri and Jean-Pierre Papin hit back, with Nico Claesen levelling things. Goals from Bernard Genghini and Manuel Amoros condemned Belgium to fourth place after both sides had lost their respective semi-finals 2-0.\u0026nbspWith eight teams competing in France at the 1984 European Championship, the hosts were in impressive form on their way to a first major international title. Both sides had won their opening games – Belgium 2-0 against Yugoslavia, the hosts 1-0 against Denmark – but a hat-trick from Michel Platini and one each from Alain Giresse and Luis Fernández made for a miserable night for the Belgians in Nantes.The first major tournament match, indeed the first non-friendly, between the sides came in France at the last World Cup held before the second world war – and the final one without a group stage. The host nation’s win in their opening game, courtesy of a first-minute goal from Émile Veinante and a double from Jean Nicolas, set up a quarter-final meeting with eventual champions, Italy, who won 3-1 in Paris.He had an uneven performance in that match and still hasn’t finished a game at this World Cup, but seven goals in his past six knockout games, at Euro 2016 and here at this World Cup, show us he’s a big-game player. Although he may have been a bit lucky with his goal against Uruguay because of the goalkeeper’s fumble, it’s a timely reminder of the importance of shooting on target.One of Didier’s great qualities is the way he controls his squad. He’s the boss. He has been obliged to change a lot of players since Euro 2016 and yet he has found a compatibility among those he has picked. Didier also has the intelligence to give his players space – you won’t find him lecturing the youngsters about how it was in his day. He’s too smart for that. And he’s reaping the rewards for his approach. You can see the players believe in him and what he’s doing.What impressed me most against Uruguay was how we controlled the game. Some of the younger players are showing great maturity and I was really struck at how well this France team managed things once they had hit the second goal. Physically, too, the players look dominating. Our full‑backs were tough in the tackle, our central defenders commanding – I saw that Luis Suárez never touched the ball in the France penalty area and you have to give our guys great credit for that. I got the impression that, physically, our team still has a bit under the pedal and that is what encourages me for the game to come against Belgium, because we will need that extra energy. Nobody has really pushed us yet. And with N’Golo Kanté protecting the defence like nobody else at this World Cup – what a player – we are looking solid at the back.Belgium, though, have had two big games that might give them an edge against France. Whereas we still haven’t been fully tested, they have been through examinations of their talent and their character that can give them a certain confidence.Coming from behind to beat Japan, having to change their gameplan, find solutions and then winning in dramatic style like they did gives a team a huge boost. It gives you belief, too. And they just eliminated the tournament favourites, a good Brazil team, which is another big plus for the Belgians. Their confidence will be sky high and rightly so. They have been tested and found the resources, found the answers. That is why I make them slight favourites for the semi-final."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63f881564c68b7b03b69fa1c4e5a2ae5d0800315/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b93359cec606cd2f104aa50658f390d8 1320w","title":"world cup 2018 buildup to the semi finals begins live","story":"And if you’re into the 28 club curse...

It will be officially announced, by bigwig Luis Rubiales no doubt, later today. But it looks a done deal. The former Barcelona coach will be appointed permanently now that Fernando Hierro’s rather unsuccessful caretaker stint is over. Enrique, who won the 2015 Champions League with that fearsome trident of Messi, Neymar and Suarez, has been on sabbatical since he left the Nou Camp in May last year.In the eighth episode of the Simpsons’s fourth season (New Kid on the Block), Bart falls in love. Stay with me here. He’s so happy when Laura Powers, the object of his affection, touches his hand that he doesn’t wash it for days, trying to prolong that moment for as long as he can.Well this is my attempt – in vain of course – to do the same for this World Cup. I’ll say it. I don’t want it to end. If it would give us another week, another round, I’d never wash these liveblogging fingers again.But it doesn’t work like that. We are rocketing towards the end, everything converging inwards. The absolute tragedy of competition is this horrible exponential sense of footballing decay. Four matches left. How? After Saturday, one. So I’m grateful, more than you can believe, for today. This blog is another day to discuss, theorise, to imagine all those classic clashes-in-waiting before the reality hits – of a grim 0-0 in one, a match-ending Mario Mandžukić deflection in the other, and the end.This might only be a rest day, but that’s another day when this isn’t over yet. England are already in dreamland. Croatia and Belgium? They are too. Let’s try and stay there, at least a little while longer. Email me at naaman.zhou@the, and tweet me at @naamanzhou.

In an effort to encourage them, many state governments now offer money to couples when one partner is from a low caste or is a Dalit (formerly known as untouchable). On 3 July, the Orissa government increased the cash “incentive” from 100,000 rupees (£1,095) to 250,000 rupees. Hitesh Dhingra, co-founder of dating app TrulyMadly, believes there are two reasons for the enlightened views expressed in the survey. One is that young Indians, as users of the internet and social media, are exposed to new ideas that challenge traditional social mores.The other is that, as more millennials choose their partners using dating apps and websites, they are more likely to focus on personality and compatibility than caste and religion. “In an arranged marriage, the parents are going to stick to tradition and to caste considerations,” said Dhingra. “But when young people are out there looking for a partner themselves, then the criteria change. Caste, religion, and income are not uppermost. It’s the person’s personality and behaviour that are important. The whole approach becomes more open-minded.”“What we are seeing are the markers of a new generation that has been shaped by the internet and influenced by attitudes and behaviour they see in developed countries,” said Iqbal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/add0ff6aadd4708133906efc89cae7caae7dad00/0_1562_10328_6198/master/10328.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02066ebea686ccb312cd6f547d75352c","title":"stairway to heaven jimmy page castle is his home led zeppelin","story":"The founder of Led Zeppelin shows off Tower House, his beloved Victorian castle in LondonGrowing up in London, there was a house I was fascinated by. It looked like a mini castle with a tower red-bricked and handsome, a portal to another time with its stained-glass windows. Back then, I had no idea who lived there. Later, I discovered it belonged to the guitarist and music producer Jimmy Page, erstwhile of Led Zeppelin. I knew I had no hope of ever stepping inside. But life can throw some crazy stuff at you and three decades later, I am invited to visit. I tell Page all of this before he has even fully flexed the door on its hinges, “Well I’m so glad you came then,” he smiles, giving me a hearty handshake.The Tower House actually has two front doors: the half bevelled-glass street door which leads into a mosaic lobby and the actual house door, adorned with brass sculptures showing the Ages of Man. Then, the only way I can describe what happens next is: imagine going to a party and all your best friends are there wearing the most opulent clothes of their lives, and they come and say hello all at once, and for a moment, you are so giddy you can’t compute. This is what entering the Tower House is like.It was designed by the self-styled “art architect” William Burges between 1875 and 1881, in the 13th-century French Gothic style. Burges was well travelled, meticulous about research and detail, uncompromising in his use of materials, obsessed with the Middle Ages and was a skilled metalworker, jeweller and designer before he became an architect. He ran with an arty set: Leighton, Rossetti, Burne-Jones et al was sociable, chronically myopic and even his best friends described him as ugly. He had quite a sense of humour and was absolutely not a cheap architect. Everything he’d ever learned and loved went into Tower House because it was to be his home.Sadly, he was only to live at the house for three years. He died aged 53 in his red bed in the Mermaid Room on the first floor, under painted friezes of waves and swimming fish, and a ceiling of gilt stars studded with convex mirrors. He was next to his painted wardrobe which Page managed to buy back and return to the spot Burges intended it for. (Much of the house’s contents were sold off in 1933.)And here I am now, standing with Page (dressed entirely monochromatically) in the double-height entrance hall, on a mosaic floor depicting the combat between Theseus and the Minotaur, trying to take it all in.The principal rooms in the Tower House all have themes (Time, Love, Literature) and tell a story every room has stained-glass windows, elaborate carvings, frescoes, friezes and if there is a surface that can be embellished or adorned, in the utmost complexity, using the finest of materials, it will be. The chimney pieces are imposing and carved with 3D figures the one in the library depicts the Principles of Speech in Caen stone.The hall’s theme is Time, with giant, almost life-size frescoes depicting the sun and moon, and stained-glass windows symbolising the seasons. The ceiling shows the constellations at the exact time Burges moved in. A stone gallery above links the upstairs bedrooms and overlooks the entrance hall. Page says he first viewed the house, back in 1972, in a dim evening light, and it “captured my heart”.The drawing room and library, where Burges entertained his pre-Raphaelite friends, are off the entrance hall. Page bought the house from the actor Richard Harris (John Betjeman had it before him) and when first viewing it, Harris’s Camelot throne was still in the library.The library walls are lined with richly painted Burges bookcases which now house Page’s books. On the ceiling are the founders of law and philosophy. The windows depict the arts and sciences. The drawing room’s theme is Love, and a medieval Cupid is painted on the ceiling. “Is your house always this tidy?” I ask. “I always try to keep it really tidy,” he says, “but at the moment I think it’s pretty untidy.” (It isn’t.) Page has a cleaner twice a week (“I’m guessing it’s not about spraying wood Pledge around?” I ask. “No,” he replies) and a regime of maintaining the house. It was Grade I-listed in 1949 and its interiors are important and fragile. Page describes how, periodically, things such as the walls in the hall need scaffolding and sugar-soaping by specialists. Everything is meticulously well looked after. I think the National Trust has nothing on Jimmy Page.I am particularly interested to see how the kitchen works in a house like this, but Page won’t let me see because “It’s out of bounds, it’s untidy.” I beg until it’s unseemly he doesn’t budge. (I visit one of the “toilet facilities” later which is all dark blue tiles and William de Morgan fish borders.)The spiral stairs are in the tower. On the first floor, next to Burges’s old room, is the guest room: the Butterfly Room, a blaze of golds and reds, with a heavily decorated ceiling of butterflies and a deep frieze of plants and flowers.The second floor, less elaborate, houses two nurseries (although Burges never had children). The day nursery – with a theme of Jack and the Beanstalk – has the terrifying giant coming out of the chimney. The night nursery is slightly more benign with grotesque monkeys. We descend the stairs to the dining room which is dominated by a giant circular zodiac table, originally commissioned by Harris. Page is excited to point out that the table is a reflection of the design in the enamelled iron ceiling. Page loves the table, his last book was done on it.Page had to sell the boathouse to buy this house. “It’s like guitars – in those days you had to trade in to go to the next one.” He was 28 when he bought the Tower House (he’s now 74) and he’s been looking after it ever since. It seems very young to take on a Grade I-listed house. Did he understand what was involved? “I knew what a Grade I-listed building was and what a privilege it was to live in something like this, yes.”Tower House is sandwiched between two houses undergoing extensive building work (when we go into the garden later, the noise is deafening). Perhaps the most contentious of the two relates to the house belonging to the singer Robbie Williams. Williams wants to put in a basement complex which will come perilously close to Tower House. Page has appealed and the council has currently deferred a decision pending a tightening up of monitoring and supervision of works. At the moment, no one seems able to guarantee the building work next door won’t damage Tower House’s unique and irreplaceable interiors, which is of serious concern to Page.That there is any debate that Tower House should be protected, is perplexing. The only other residential town house Burges built is Park House in Cardiff. It is also listed and has been described by CADW (Wales’s historic environment protector) as “perhaps the most important 19th-century house in Wales.” When a piece of Burges furniture recently came up for sale (there are very few) it was considered so imperative it didn’t go out of the country that the government placed a temporary export ban on it. The Bedford museum bought it. And yet, Tower House is full of Burges. In 2014, three English Heritage engineers, an EH inspector and a conservation officer visited Tower House and described its interiors as of “high heritage value… and highly vulnerable” and that there was no demonstration that the proposed works would “have no adverse impact”.So protective is Page of the interiors and their sensitivity to vibrations, he only ever plays acoustic guitar in the house, doesn’t have parties there and has no television. Just before I go, Page says, a little sotto voce: “I’m sorry I couldn’t show you the kitchen. But…” he continues, leaning forward, “it’s got a La Cornue in it.” I am thinking which artist that is, and then I realise it’s a French range cooker. I see it as a small concession."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d87a449d4b2537bcc243dd917f8606bbf0f3d4fc/42_16_3145_1888/master/3145.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=721c27be1c1a566d27b5bf89ceef1d31","title":"russia 2018 world cup england guardian support","story":"Our senior sports writer Barney Ronay explains how you can help keep the ’s football coverage in playHere we are then.

From minute-by-minute commentary sent directly to you from the vast pulsing brain of some insomniac footballing obsessive powered only by nicotine, chocolate and a haystack of empty energy drink cans. To on-the-scene reports and news from a band of reporters who write and travel and file and follow stories every day, returning to their families five weeks later hunched, unrecognisable figures unable to communicate on any subject beyond wifi quality, mixed zone ticket allocations and how to get to Salvador protea at 3am with a fair-to-decent chance of not being abducted.

It is a visual representation of the sampled sonic landscape of forest animals and snarling wild cats that underpins her most recent album, Utopia, and includes inflatable blooms, a wall of greenery and a golden orchid with a flautist hidden inside. The Eden Project, with its sci-fi biomes full of real plants from around the world, is probably the only venue on her tour that dwarfs her ambition to make a theatrical presentation out of the natural world. Björk may be dressed like a DayGlo insect, but Eden Project has a massive wasp. It’s a meeting of minds.That includes her audience. This singular creature has attracted a gathering of peacocks in floral headdresses, some barefoot, faces ablaze with paint and glitter. One man wears a tricorn hat, although perhaps this is inspired by Poldark. On the same day as Pride events, a rainbow coalition stands very still before a stageful of shrubs, as if something unearthly is happening.Björk arrives on stage on a rotating plinth decked out in long grass. She has described the utopia that inspired Utopia as an island full of fantastical, freakish mutations, and so here she wears a DayGlo solid mesh dress that distorts her figure and a mask with antennae. She is flanked by the flute septet Viibra, who are dressed in fairy pink. They dance as they play, swaying in unison to the ecstatic reverie of Arisen My Senses, giving the lie to the idea that this abstract music is impossible to dance to.Not that anyone else tries. As Björk sings, Eden’s tribes stand still, spellbound on their feet. She is tender and bashful in Blissing Me, then fragile and devotional in The Gate. Her voice is full of charm and hurt, an elemental howl that appears to affect the fabric of time. On a huge screen behind her, orchids bloom and rot, seabirds preen themselves and Björk herself appears as a mythical animated creature in some timeless fable. The air of a classical recital is further undercut by rude blasts of bass, which detonate under these stuttering torch songs.Conventional pop bangers are few and far between, but this is more of a workout for the heart than the feet. That said, moments of old-fashioned four-to-the-floor – old favourites Isobel and Human Behaviour – come as a relief. The emotional intensity and unorthodox structure of the Utopia songs take a back seat to familiarity, breaking the spell long enough to allow outbreaks of dancing and air-punching. Then the bedazzlement resumes as Viibra pick up long, illuminated tubes and whirl them around their heads, creating ghostly tones and spinning discs of light around their singer for a stark and bass-less Features Creatures.Here in dreamy Eden on a midsummer’s night, surrounded by enchanted creatures, Björk is Titania. She plays romantic tragedy as an act of personal defiance, in a voice of total solemnity. With the silly costumes, inflatable plants and cuteness – she says little beyond a polite and adorable “thank you” after every song – she is a bewitching mix of Proms and Panto.

But this could: Justin Bieber is reportedly engaged.TMZ reported that the Canadian superstar asked his on-off partner, the model Hailey Baldwin, to marry him in the Bahamas on Saturday. And she accepted.In Bieberland it was as though North Korea had finally gone and pressed the nuclear button. Pandemonium. Disbelief. Despair. “I’ve only had our wedding and future planned since I was like 9. You did my dirty @justinbieber,” vented Brooklyn Sciford from Omaha, Nebraska.“Engaged?? Really???” tweeted Ky. “Did she know ever word to every song? Did she buy purple clothes because he said it was his favorite color?? I did.”“I’ll be going into hibernation to cry for the rest of my life,” said Brianna Smith from Rushville, Indiana.Confirmation of the engagement was yet to come from the couple themselves, though CNN said it had also verified it. The pair was introduced by Hailey Baldwin’s father, the actor Stephen Baldwin, at the New York premier of Bieber’s film Never Say Never in 2011 when she was 14 and Bieber 17.They had a short-lived relationship in 2016, after which Bieber reunited, it now seems temporarily, with the singer-actor Selena Gomez. The couple’s families sent the internet into overdrive over the weekend with nudge-nudge references on social media. “Proud is an understatement! Excited for the next chapter!,” posted Bieber’s father Jeremy on Instagram along with a photograph of his son at the beach bathed in a golden sunset.On Saturday, Bieber’s mother just tweeted “Love Love Love Love Love Love Love”.Stephen Baldwin, a Trump supporting born-again Christian who has appeared in movies that include Born on the Fourth of July and The Usual Suspects, posted and then deleted a tweet in which he said “Always pray 4 Gods will !!

It forces May to reshuffle her government, at the same time as trying to convince backbenchers to support her plan.Davis sent a bluntly worded resignation letter to Theresa May, saying he would not be a “reluctant conscript” to the plan agreed at Chequers, which he said was “certainly not returning control of our laws in any real sense”. Davis has told friends he cannot live with the soft Brexit stance agreed between ministers on Friday, which proposes a “UK-EU free trade area”, governed by a “common rule book”.Davis is said to have been “livid” about hostile briefing from senior figures in Downing Street about how Brexiters would be treated at Chequers – including suggestions they would be given the number of a local taxi firm if they chose to resign.Theresa May will now have to confront furious pro-Brexit MPs in parliament on Monday, knowing she has lost the backing of one of the leavers’ champions in government.The prime minister is facing a growing backlash from the pro-Brexit wing of her party, with MPs warning they are prepared to trigger a leadership contest.If at least 48 MPs send letters to Sir Graham Brady, chair of the powerful backbench 1922 committee, he would have to call a vote of no confidence – though many of May’s supporters in the parliamentary party believe she could win it.Dozens of Tory MPs have attended emergency briefings in Downing Street since the Chequers summit on Friday, at which Boris Johnson said that colleagues would be “polishing a turd” if they tried to defend the plans to the party and public.Davis had clashed with May on several occasions in recent weeks, including over when the long-awaited white paper setting out the government’s Brexit position should be published.He would prefer a much looser, Canada-style relationship with the EU27 after Brexit — a proposal rejected by the cabinet on Friday.In her reply to Davis’s resignation letter, the prime minister emphasised he had quit “when we are only eight months from the date set in law” for the UK to leave the EU. She rejected his characterisation that the policy agreed at Chequers on Friday would not bring powers back from Brussels to Britain.He told Reuters the resignation was “crucially important” because it showed the extent of concerns about the Chequers agreement. “If the Brexit secretary could not support them they cannot genuinely be delivering Brexit,” he said.The pro-Brexit MP earlier wrote in the Daily , that: “If the proposals are as they currently appear, I will vote against them, and others may well do the same.”Labour capitalised on the turmoil in Tory ranks. Jeremy Corbyn questioned whether May can still “cling on” to power, with shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry released a tally of Tory resignations since autumn.Before Sunday night’s ructions, May was set to tell the Commons: “In the two years since the referendum result we have had a spirited national debate, with robust views echoing round the cabinet table as they have on breakfast tables up and down our country. Over that time, I have listened to every possible idea and every possible version of Brexit. This is the right Brexit.”The prime minister also plans a fresh round of high-level diplomacy this week, in a bid to persuade the EU27 not to reject her plan outright.She is expected to talk directly to European leaders including the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron“Our message now is to the other side, to Europe, that it’s time to get serious and sit down and talk about it,” she said on Sunday. “It’s now for Europe to be prepared to sit down and move the pace of negotiations on and talk about it seriously and address what we’ve put forward.”Some pro-Brexit MPs fear the prime minister’s plan will be regarded as an opening salvo by Brussels and she will be forced to make further concessions, possibly on free movement, before the next crunch summit in October.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, has said the EU is ready to adapt its offer should the UK’s red lines change. However, May has agreed to ramp up preparations for a “no deal” Brexit in case Brussels – which described her previous customs proposals as “magical thinking” – rejects them.One senior Tory said that the government would have to take “a couple more steps” towards the EU’s position before a final deal is struck, even if it meant Brexiters swallowing more bitter pills. “Behind the scenes there’s a recognition that there needs to be a bit more movement on both sides,” he said.However, a No 10 source said: “Yes it’s a negotiation, but this isn’t about making concessions, this is about challenging the EU. It’s a good, pragmatic, workable solution that benefits all our economies and also our citizens. It’s time for Europe to get serious.”However, May will need to get her proposals past the party first. She will make a statement to the Commons on Monday before facing a fractious meeting of the backbench 1922 committee in the evening.Michael Gove, who is understood to have been instrumental in getting the leave-supporting cabinet on board with the proposals, urged pro-Brexit MPs to rally behind May on Sunday.The leading Brexiter said the deal the prime minister achieved at Chequers was not everything he had hoped for, but it honoured the result of the referendum and the cabinet was behind it, meaning that collective responsibility would prevail.“Those of us who believe that we want to execute a proper Brexit and one that is the best deal for Britain, have an opportunity now to get behind the prime minister in order to negotiate that deal,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show.“I’m a realist and one of the things about politics is you mustn’t make perfect the enemy of the good. One of the things about this compromise is that it unites the cabinet.“We achieved all of the things that we campaigned for in order to ensure we could leave the EU, but we also do so in a way which respects some of the wishes and some of the concerns of some of my colleagues that voted remain.”One senior pro-Brexit source told the : “It’s terminal. We think this is going to lead to a bigger split than Maastricht, on a more serious issue, with a smaller majority, and it’s not Tony Blair that lies on the other side of all of this, it’s Jeremy Corbyn. We think it’s an absolute disaster.”Most remain-supporting MPs welcomed the proposals as a sensible starting point, adding that the “devil was in the detail” of the Brexit white paper, although former minister Phillip Lee, who quit over Brexit, said it represented an attempt to find the “least worst” option that was not in the best interests of the country."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca1b545aaae1dc560dae38e8f58951883ddd15a4/126_303_2363_1417/master/2363.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2881b9bba4fec9cc9ebe85930ae9192d","title":"david davis resignation what we know so far","story":"Brexit secretary quits, saying Chequers blueprint would leave the UK in a ‘weak’ position at best"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c93767e473f850b68ac8645678dfacde0ed3d634/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a30f187b3c22e13a503bbe36beb4c7a","title":"david davis resigns as brexit secretary live updates","story":"Follow live updates of political developments as Davis resigns from governmentThe Remain side is starting to make its voice heard now.

There is no good evidence these drugs improve pregnancy rates, and side effects can include chronic infections, septicaemia and severe allergic reactions. “When you are injecting immunosuppressant drugs into your body, it’s not a good thing,” she said.Another add-on offered by some fertility clinics is assisted hatching. It involves using acid, a laser, or other tool to thin the protein coating from which an embryo must break out before it can implant in the womb. The procedure, which costs £400-£500, has not been shown to improve pregnancy rates, according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.Other treatments that have been questioned cost more. For £750, time-lapse imaging will track the day-to-day development of IVF embryos under a microscope to help doctors select the ones most likely to lead to a baby. But again, there is no good evidence it increases live birth rates. Jane Stewart, the chairwoman of the British Fertility Society and a consultant in reproductive medicine and gynaecology at Newcastle fertility centre, said: “Over and over again we see new ideas being brought in without the evidence it needs.“A lot of the time, patients are shopping around for what they think they need and that’s wrong, medicine is not like that.”According to a traffic light designation by the HFEA’s scientific committee, none of the 10 most commonly offered add-ons is backed by robust evidence to show an improvement in the success rates of treatment. Earlier this week, a large study concluded an add-on called an endometrial scratch does not improve the chances of a live birth. “The difficulty I have is that it becomes a commercial thing,” said Stewart. “In the clinic, a patient might be told about other treatments and say ‘OK, I’ll have that too’. It becomes a discussion not about the medical problem, but rather if you can afford this or that, then it might be what makes the difference.”The situation can be made worse when people do not get a proper consultation before they embark on fertility treatment. Many couples who are referred for fertility tests will not need IVF, but at private clinics the conversation may move quickly to when IVF will be given and with what extras.Prof Geeta Nargund, a senior consultant at St George’s Hospital in London and the medical director of Create Fertility, said she had previously raised concerns with health commissioners about clinics that were promoting add-ons to NHS patients.She welcomed the introduction of tighter rules, but said the HFEA should also require clinics to provide data on which procedures were being offered to each patient and make it clear what the sanctions would be for clinics that failed to comply with the guidelines. Prof Nick Macklon, the medical director at London Women’s Clinic, said many patients requested extra tests and procedures they have read about.“I spend quite a lot of my time putting patients off this and that, and my colleagues do too,” he said. “I think just to say it’s all nonsense and they’re all cowboys is not the case. Doctors are also looking for therapies that can help people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f82bf3f02ce478c0a5112bfec1d01abd6aac8db/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a047c88e2c7bdc398be75531ad756fe2","title":"castleford leeds super league match report","story":"• Castleford 42-10 Leeds• Jake Trueman inspired for CastlefordIf Kevin Sinfield was not already aware of the size of the challenge in transforming the fortunes of the stuttering Super League champions, he was handed a ruthless indication here.The final scoreline was miserable for Leeds, this comprehensive defeat a record-extending eighth in succession in the league. While there were visible improvements on the final days of Brian McDermott’s reign, the nature of how Leeds collapsed to concede 36 points without reply after half‑time underlined the task for Sinfield.The greater challenges for Leeds in their battle to avoid the Qualifiers are still to come but, with the club two points adrift of the eight, they may now need to win all three of their remaining games to stand a chance. The nature of this collapse does not suggest that is at all likely. “I’ve got the full picture now,” Sinfield said.Perhaps the greatest compliment that can be paid to this Castleford side is they find a way to capture the headlines. Pre-match this was all about Sinfield’s return but Castleford are now all but guaranteed a top‑four finish ahead of the Super 8s. That means an extra home game as opposed to finishing fifth – and for a side such as Castleford, who are notoriously tough to beat at home, that cannot be underestimated on the run to the play-offs, and indeed, the Grand Final.On Sinfield’s first day as a coach, how envious he must have been watching the prowess of Castleford’s Jake Trueman. Daryl Powell, the Tigers coach, said of half-back: “He’s an outstanding player.”With Castleford ahead by only six at half-time it was the teenager’s inidual brilliance which took this game away from Leeds – namely two stunning tries of his own before two assists for Jesse Sene-Lefao’s brace.Leeds earlier led on two separate occasions, both times via tries for Tom Briscoe, before Castleford eventually forged a half-time lead courtesy of tries from Greg Eden, Quentin Laulu‑Togaga’e and Matt Cook.

Speaking to the  on Saturday the Frenchman reiterated that view saying: “It’s not just in cycling, that’s global justice. That’s democracy, you can’t prevent somebody from spending money on legal defence by capping it.”But Brailsford dismissed Lappartient’s position as a “cop-out”. Brailsford added: “Justice is justice and whether you are in the smallest team in the professional peloton or the biggest one, the justice and the rules that apply to you should be the same and fair. There should be no issue whatsoever there.“If you want to be the president of an international federation then protect everybody in that international community,” Brailsford said. “Don’t take a French angle or a nationalistic view on the international community. Protect the international community with no bias.“And I think he is still learning that really. The quicker he can get there, and learn what a president of an international federation’s responsibilities are, the better it will be for everybody. But he has got some work to do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdfe0edb22308379a5ba4b91c4988f21d95bcfb0/85_29_3226_1935/master/3226.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3df88cf8c39eaa1b15500814f0f56519","title":"sebastian vettel wins british grand prix lewis hamilton","story":"A day at the British Grand Prix that had begun with such great expectation and a celebratory air ended with an unlikely podium place for Lewis Hamilton but it was far from the champagne moment the four-times world champion had imagined.Indeed Hamilton’s disappointment at his second place to Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel was writ large and left the British driver questioning Ferrari’s race tactics after any chance of a win disappeared when he was hit by Kimi Räikkönen on the opening lap.Hamilton had opened the competitive part of the meeting at Silverstone with a superb pole position and was further buoyed by England’s subsequent World Cup win against Sweden. A record crowd of 140,500 had duly arrived at the old airfield in fine spirits, anticipating their weekend would continue in a winning vein. But they and Hamilton were facing heartbreak by the end of lap one. That he managed to contain Vettel’s extension of his championship lead to eight points will have been of cold comfort.Hamilton made a poor start, being too aggressive as the lights went out and suffering from wheelspin, allowing Vettel and his Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas, who finished in fourth, to get past.Worse was to come. Räikkönen charged after him and, attempting to go up the inside into Village, the Finn locked up and his left front clipped the right rear of Hamilton’s Mercedes, sending the British driver into a spin and to the back of the field.Hamilton’s recovery drive was as good a comeback as any he has managed but it was not the record-breaking sixth win he had been hoping for and, with a Ferrari hitting a Mercedes for the second time in three races, he was far from happy.In France Vettel had clipped Bottas in turn one, damaging the Finn’s car for which the German received a five-second penalty. Here Räikkönen was given a 10-second penalty for “causing a collision” at turn three and Hamilton referred to the incidents collectively as “interesting tactics”, noting there had now been two races where Ferraris had “taken out” a Mercedes.His comments were given short shrift by Vettel and Räikkönen but Hamilton is within his rights to feel aggrieved that the penalties were not commensurate with how costly the incidents proved. But he also admitted the best way to avoid clashes was to ensure a clean getaway from the front of the grid and it was when the lights went out that he suffered the setback that left him battling Räikkönen.The fans, who had been chanting for their hero through the drivers’ parade, were left silenced and deflated as the scale of the task facing Hamilton became clear. But they were treated to what became a gripping encounter as Ferrari and Mercedes traded attack and defence to a thrilling climax.Bottas had clung as close as possible to Vettel out front but Hamilton was charging in their wake. The home crowd roared their approval every time Hamilton claimed a place back and they were kept in good voice – he had caught the top six by lap 10 although by then he was a full 27 seconds down on Vettel.Having passed the midfield, the real task was ahead. Hamilton pumped in a sequence of quick laps, staying out long on the soft rubber, and he was the last of the frontrunners to pit on lap 25 taking the medium tyres, emerging behind Räikkönen in sixth, 10 seconds back from the Finn.On lap 32 Marcus Ericsson crashed his Sauber at Abbey, bringing out the safety car, which allowed Hamilton to close up on the leaders. Ferrari, struggling with tyre wear, immediately pitted both their drivers for fresh rubber but Mercedes kept Hamilton and Bottas out, gaining track position.When racing resumed after six laps, Bottas led Vettel from Hamilton. It was finely poised but more drama was to follow. The race had barely restarted when Carlos Sainz and Romain Grosjean came together at Copse and the safety car was deployed again. Racing restarted on lap 42 and Vettel immediately charged at Bottas and they went wheel to wheel, the Finn defending brilliantly, as did Hamilton with Räikkönen snapping at his heels.With the two Mercedes on older rubber, the Ferraris had the edge and the sight of the four of them sweeping line-astern in a mighty battle through Silverstone’s glorious high-speed corners was breathtaking.It was Vettel, however, who ended on top and deservedly so. He finally retook the lead with a brilliant move up the inside of Bottas at Brooklands on lap 47. With the Finn struggling with a lack of grip on older rubber, Hamilton passed him for second a lap later, with Räikkönen then able to squeeze past for third.It was a denouement few could have expected and will be long-remembered even if it was not quite the conclusion the home crowd had really wanted.For Vettel it had been a major result for the Scuderia at a meeting Hamilton and Mercedes have won on the last four occasions. “We have struggled a lot here in the past,” Vettel said. “It was important for us to do well and to make the difference was great.”For Hamilton, despite the disappointment and his displeasure with Ferrari, he was able to take some satisfaction at minimising the damage. “To get back to second was huge for us,” he said. “I will take it, for us I’m happy with the drive and what the team were able to do.” He went to greet the fans as always but for the first time in five years it was a relatively muted, conciliatory affair after a race the world champion would doubtless sooner forget."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2057ebaf6b28e4c535dfc7158fe1ffc2fac17a5/190_313_2522_1513/master/2522.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e445b72e2e5845c8472eecb0f786239","title":"meet the makers behind some of londons top market stalls","story":"From pork loins to concrete planters – traders at the capital’s fourth Urban Village Fete in Greenwich share their passions and productsThe Greenwich peninsula is undergoing a transformation from concrete jungle to a buzzing design and creative space. To celebrate this, each year the peninsula springs to life with music, colour and dancing, as creators from all over London come together for the Urban Village Fete. Curated by Wayne Hemingway, co-founder of Hemingway Design, the event delivers his vision of recreating the type of free festival that once attracted some of the brightest creative minds to Camden and Kensington markets.“Free festivals were the way we communicated,” he says. “There were loads of young designers who went on to become pretty famous. We want to recreate that in Greenwich: getting young creatives in front of tens of thousands of people at a price they can afford.”The fete is now in its fourth year and stretches through an area that is becoming a hub for design. Hemingway hopes that with 15,000 new homes, plus spaces designated for work and play, a sense of creativity and community will blossom on the peninsula, with creatives sharing the area with families. “The event feels generous, and generosity should be a part of urban life,” he says.Hemingway’s company produces dozens of festivals around the UK each year – from Liverpool’s Fine Tuned event to the National Festival of Making in Blackburn. One challenge facing market traders and craftspeople across these events is that shoppers are carrying less cash than ever. Hemingway Design and payments platform Square partnered to equip cash-only traders with Square Readers so they could take cards, many of them for the first time. Here, we meet some of the dozens of makers and creators who brought the Greenwich fete to life. Emily Griffin lives and breathes east London’s creative scene. A Hackney local for 20 years, during the past three she’s built her homewares and accessories business Mahala from the ground up. But while she makes and designs most of what can be found inside her store, the brand is also a family affair. “My husband joined Mahala a year ago and designs the clothes, which we have made in Bow,” says Griffin. “His aunt has a small orchard, so she makes all the lovely oils for us.” Mahala’s clothes and accessories are made to endure, reflecting the family’s thrifty past. Griffin uses military canvas and saddlery to create her bags, and her designs are centred around slow fashion. “I want people to have them for a really long time. I always repair stuff – I’d rather repair than replace,” she says.Building relationships with her customers at events such as the Urban Village Fete is key. “It means we’re not relying on footfall on our street, which is really quiet. Plus, we get to meet people from all over London and farther afield,” she says. The concrete planters found at From the Land (formerly Conpot) are far from the rigid grey slabs the material usually brings to mind. Architect Alastair Mitchell and textile designer Kezia Regan began experimenting in their home with planters made from concrete, before expanding to homewares and surfaces. “Each one uses a different stone source from around the country – Shropshire, Lancashire, Derbyshire – so we’re trying to show that concrete can have all these regional dialects,” says Mitchell.As the business grows, he says the aim is to move away from third-party retailers and sell more through his online store and specialist ceramic fairs, and at events like the Urban Village Fete. To do this, and to make the most of footfall, he has started using cashless payment platform Square. “If you only take cash, most people go away and never come back,” he says. “Just the other day we had someone come to our house who wanted to buy a planter. We were able to take a card payment in our living room.”Sarah Harvey, UK lead for Square, says: “None of us want to have to walk away from a unique item on a market stall just because that trader won’t accept cards, and with our partnership we wanted to make it as easy as possible for shoppers to support independent and creative businesses.” Ayse Özden loves creating with paper. She is one of the founders of WeAct, a London-based stationery store and brand agency with its roots in Turkey. “Greeting cards are a very big thing in Europe, whereas in Istanbul they’re not,” she says. Her family made the move to bring their collections to London two years ago. Her stall at the Urban Village Fete was filled with quirky designs from dictionary clippings underlying colourful illustrations designed by her husband to comical faces splashed across greeting cards and notebook covers. “There’s been a really nice response to the face collection,” she says. “Lots of people are laughing and that was our aim – to help people have fun.” Before making bespoke, one-of-a-kind bags to sell exclusively at markets, Anna P was designing 250-piece collections twice a year for high-street stores. Now she works for herself, and has spent three years collecting vintage textiles that she uses to design and make leather and cloth bags by hand. The designer prefers to sell to people direct, and doesn’t have an online store. Because of the nomadic nature of her stall, she makes sure she has a cashless payment system whenever she’s selling at markets. “I use Square and it’s so quick to take payments – if you have a lot of people and they all want to buy at the same time, just tap it on there and it’s done,” she says.  The bright pops of colour coming from the Keeler \u0026amp Sidaway stall captured the Urban Village Fete’s sunny, holiday vibes. Joe Keeler began his print and stationery company two years ago, as a way of combining his loves of illustration, photography and travelling – the latter of which inspires his art, which often features Californian poolsides and graphic beaches.“I’m an avid photographer, so I’ll take loads of photos and come back and draw from them, or sketch scenes while I’m on location and then work it all together from there,” he says.With a studio based in Bermondsey, Keeler sells his prints through his online store, but makes an exception when it comes to the urban village fete. “This one is the best summery festival things to do in London,” he says. “There are lots of people here.” Visitors to Imogen Johnson-Gilbert’s stall could try on her first collection, made at a Fairtrade factory in Bangalore, a new milestone for her business. Previously, Johnson-Gilbert made all of the Gillian June clothes herself, but the business’s popularity has made that tricky. “We’ve grown to a point where I’ve stopped being able to make it all,” she says.  Isabelle Laight really loves hip-hop, and at the Urban Village Fete she found she was in good company. “You can see everyone being really surprised when they walk past. It’s one of those things you don’t see that often,” she says of her illustrated designs of hip-hop and R\u0026ampB greats on the sides of mugs, plates, and stationery. “Kanye is the most popular. I don’t want him to be, but he is,” says Laight. “My favourite at the moment is Tupac – I’m going through a bit of a phase.” Using Square for payments at the fete, Laight says: “It’s really easy, I just keep it in my pocket, and there’s been no need to troubleshoot because I haven’t had any problems.” Sheffield native Alastair Mason knows a thing or two about pork. “It’s always been a family tradition that we have our pork brined or dipped by the butcher,” he says of his favourite snack. Mason started the Salty Loins food truck in 2015 through sheer frustration: he was unable to get a “decent” pork sandwich in London. “After raving to my friends about not being able to find this kind of pork, I decided to take it upon myself to experiment and came up with my own brine recipe.”Since then, the trained graphic designer has been a staple at London markets such as Maltby Street and Borough, as well as on the Bermondsey “beer mile”. Mason’s menu has expanded to incorporate one of his hometown’s favourite dishes – chips and gravy – plus baby back salt ribs, which he cooks up in front of hungry punters. “It’s good theatre when you’ve got a street food stall, obviously. That and the smell is key to people coming in and trying something new,” he says.Cathryn Quail’s stall on the peninsula looked straight out of the pages of a trendy interiors magazine – but she wants plants to be a part of a sustainable lifestyle rather than feeding an expensive trend. She opened The Botanical Workshop last September to sell plants and teach people how to arrange and take care of them. “It should be something that is affordable, that brings you joy and helps with mindfulness,” she says. “When you buy plants and they stay alive, it’s way more sustainable.”To curb the frustration generated by his bureaucratic job, where he was stuck at a desk each day, Ross Mitchell started curing food. Over three years, his hobby grew to become a business, now called Smoke and Cure. This was his first gig at the Urban Village Fete. “It is always good to meet a new bunch of customers. We were sitting right next to the music stage and among other peer businesses, so we were in good company,” he says.Mitchell has also learned that catering for card payments is now a necessity. “A year ago I wasn’t too fussed about using them, but what I found is it absolutely opens up a whole new line of business,” he says. “With Square you’re allowed to take payment over the phone, which is becoming increasingly important for our particular business.”Learn more about Square"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea4f1dc1d4e63cc78e4ee6b5ea817859b12c22f0/513_134_4669_2802/master/4669.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f77fecaccbe095be17594bb040eb7660","title":"fray bentos uruguay not just a meat pie","story":"The sleepy town was once home to the food brand that began in 1863 and the industrial landscape is now a world heritage siteIf you are lucky enough to reach the tiny Uruguayan town of Carmelo on a summer evening, you can cycle through tranquil vineyards, past lavender bushes and a yellow chapel glowing in the fading sunset to the Italian social club for dinner. Founded in the 1930s, very little has changed since then. Lo Korrea still serves the cheap, hearty food Italian farmers devoured after a day harvesting grapes on Saturday nights and sometimes Sunday lunch. The food is unrepentantly old-fashioned, heavy in cream and sugar, and the prices are, too – just under £12 for wine and three courses. On the evening we went there was a 60th wedding anniversary, with music seeping through a wall into the annex where we ate, and the odd child in a suit or frilly dress, eyes wide with sugar and excitement, wandering through the door.We ended up in Carmelo on our way to somewhere else even more improbable. Fray Bentos. Many people who recognise the name are astonished to find out that it is really a town, as opposed to the British brand of canned meat products, originally corned beef and then ready-made pies. It’s actually both. The sleepy, charming riverside town in Uruguay, was also home to the Fray Bentos brand which began in 1863 in a sprawling factory. In its heyday this cathedral of the industrial age, built along the town’s lush riverbank, fed half the world, churning out corned and frozen beef to fuel wars and the rise of empires. It played such a role in the transformation of how we eat worldwide, bringing meals into the industrial era, that three years ago Unesco declared the abandoned and ruined complex a world heritage site.When my Uruguayan godmother told me Fray Bentos was a place, not just a pie brand, we decided we had to visit this forgotten icon. The production lines have long since closed, the docks are decaying and it has fallen back into sleepy silence, disturbed only by tourists drawn to its strange and striking heritage. It is an unlikely holiday spot but a rewarding one, the quirky colonial charm of the town a perfect counterpoint to the stark remains of the factory, and if you tire of history there are beaches, ranches and one of Uruguay’s most unusual and relaxing wine areas just a short drive away.According to local legend, Fray Bentos was named after a shepherd who pointed travellers on their way. His legacy has been picked up by the locals who guide visitors through the sprawling factory complex, paved with iron to withstand the weight of thousands of cattle. There is a strange beauty in parts, particularly the turbine hall. A checkerboard marble floor (the stone was chosen in the 1920s for insulation), vast wheels arching towards the vaulted ceiling, frozen by time and rust, and sunbeams picking out the dust motes in the silent air give it something of the feel of an abandoned temple.There is even an inner sanctum, a control room of practical luxury, panels adorned with intricate metal-work and more marble, where engineers tended to the mysteries that kept the wheels turning. The plant was founded by a German inventor whose “meat extract” a liquid precursor to Oxo, needed vast quantities of beef, so he came to Uruguay where cows were plentiful and cheap. In the 1920s a British company bought the firm, giving it its local nickname, El Anglo. The town’s name became a byword for corned beef. Meat from Fray Bentos fed troops in both world wars, and British troops even nicknamed one tank Fray Bentos, a dark joke about a crew that were little more than minced meat in a can.A small museum tells the plant’s history and features curiosities such as a two-headed calf and Uruguay’s first lightbulb. When the tour finishes you can mull over the cycles of wealth and decline that played out here, the dawn of globalisation before the word was even coined, over lunch at La Chimenea, on a riverside terrace built over the plant’s former water pumping station, with a view clear across to Argentina. Inside, wood burns to charcoal in a hearth several metres wide, to grill the parrillada (barbecue) of perfectly seared meats (and a few vegetables if you insist) – a Uruguayan national passion. The owners are so friendly that when we found out they didn’t take cards, and we didn’t have enough cash, they told us just to put an envelope under the door later. It only serves lunch though, so save dinner for the town, a separate world from the factory complex with its villas, Anglo-Germanic sense of order, and probably the world’s only town-square monument to corned beef.Wealth seeped over into Fray Bentos, so the streets are adorned with strange and charming curiosities, such as the bandstand in the central square which is a copy of the one in Crystal Palace, a lavishly decorated theatre and rows of grand colonial homes, with high barred windows hiding inner courtyards from curious passersby. One has been turned into a hotel, the Posada del Frayle Bentos, whose sense of history has more or less survived a slightly brutal modernisation, with the addition of a plunge pool which offers a welcome chance to cool off on summer days. Locals stroll around to relax, or drive excruciatingly slowly up and down the riverfront. “It’s a small town – if we drove fast we’d be at the other end too quickly,” one explained.You can get a simple dinner and a drink with a view at Cervecería Hoffman. Save dessert for ice-creams at Heladeria Deleite, where they have five or six variations on dulce de leche – the creamy caramel that is a national obsession. If you fancy some exercise after that, there is a nine-hole golf course designed for El Anglo executives by the famous course architect Alister MacKenzie and recently refurbished for the top brass of a new factory complex upriver.

The streets were as empty as a town in a Gabriel García Márquez novel, during siesta, or after a cataclysm. The old wine district of Colonia Estrella is just 15 minutes by bike from Carmelo, across pancake-flat fields and empty roads, where we stayed at a lodge and boutique winery, Campo Tinto. The star grape in the region is an unusual variety called tannat, which grows well in Uruguayan soil and has become the country’s calling card, like Malbec for neighbouring Argentina. Campo Tinto also has a viognier and a special Uruguayan blend – medio y medio – a kind of sparkling semi-sweet rosé, a tribute to a cocktail popular with port workers in Montevideo and perfect for summer afternoons.• Most of the hotels in Carmelo offer bicycles with the room, or rent them out for a nominal fee, and it is a wonderful place to cycle, almost pancake flat, with wide, largely empty roads.• Cars can be rented from Marino Sport, who are very flexible on pick up and drop-off locations, and will come to you for a small fee.• Or there are buses from Carmelo to Fray Bentos twice daily.

He’d seen clips here and there, read about the conversation about Brexit between the competitors – which he found “embarrassing, so embarrassing” – and vaguely heard about a couple called Jack and Dani.“I thought I could never watch anything like that,” he says. “I walked in on my wife watching it with the kids and actually said to her, ‘Oh my god. I never thought you would stoop this low’.” He laughs, embarrassed. Four weeks in – as Love Island has become Britain’s most talked-about TV show this summer, picked up a Broadcast award for best entertainment programme and been the most-watched in its slot for six consecutive nights – Goddard, a 49-year-old father of two in Kent, is hooked.“It’s addictive. People shouldn’t put it down without giving it a try,” he says now. “Some will think it’s garbage but I don’t want to be the guy moaning about how different everything is to when I was young.”It took nine months for producers to find the perfect Love Islanders. Through streetcasting, scouring Instagram and sifting through 85,000 applications, the fourth season began just over a month ago. Eleven candidates, including an A\u0026ampE doctor (Alex), dancer (Samira) and model (Eyal), entered a Mallorcan villa to be filmed 24 hours a day by 70 cameras zooming in on their every move and smooch. Four million viewers tuned in. Five of the original cast remain, with another 30 having been added and booted out week by week, each couple hoping to be the last standing to scoop £50,000 at the end of the month.Maaria Jabeen, a 19-year-old history undergraduate at SOAS University of London, tuned in for the first time this year – she now sets an alarm to ensure she doesn’t miss it. “People my age aren’t really naive enough to think Love Island is the epitome of a relationship, so I don’t think it’s influential in that sense, but it is fascinating watching them interact. I feel like David Attenborough – ha! – analysing the racial dynamics or the tension between the girls versus how the guys behave with each other.”While the sanctioned voyeurism of reality TV may seem old hat – it is 18 years to the week since Big Brother debuted on Channel 4 – Love Island’s success has apparently come in revealing resonant truths about human emotion in love, lust, passion, rejection. It’s true the cast are there to peacock in swimsuits, looking buff and beautiful with one eye on post-show careers as social media influencers and ribbon-cutters, but they’re also expected to romantically partner up. And so, relationship behaviours – gaslighting, being “mugged off” – become national talking points.“As humans, we are inherently wired to be fascinated by the making and breaking of bonds,” says Honey Langcaster-James, a psychologist who worked on the first series, “and there are pros and cons to young people watching it. On the one hand, there are legitimate concerns about the insecurity of watching people selected for above-average attractiveness. On the other, we are seeing great lessons in what is and isn’t acceptable in romantic relationships. The public criticise behaviour that falls short, and strong female characters have stood up and said, ‘No, I don’t have to put up with that’ to some of the men – and that is great role-modelling.”Langcaster-James watches the show with her son and daughter, who are 20 and 22, as “they love it – it’s a great platform for young people to talk about relationships”.Angela Jain, managing director for entertainment at ITV, who has been involved since series one, says she doesn’t let her 14-year-old son watch it – “that’s a parental choice”. However, she has plenty of parents and teachers telling her they use Love Island to have awkward conversations with adolescents. Primarily, she feels it works because of the way it’s engineered. “It’s got men talking about their feelings in a way that feels honest and refreshing when most people don’t think men talk to each other. In the environment we’ve created, you can’t run away from decisions that you make, and people are having to deal daily with situations they have made. You can’t swipe left or hide behind texts.”As the genre dictates, there is no concept of time – there are no clocks, no books, TV or music. There is simply chat. Lots of chat where lusty triangles – Megan and Wes and Alex, say – and the compelling love story of the aforementioned Jack and Dani are filtered through the constant discussion of feelings: who fancies whom, who is loyal to whom, who might be grafting or cracking on or getting dumped.For Bolu Babalola, a 27-year-old romcom writer, it can feel “like watching a zoo or being on safari”. She laughs. “But it’s a microcosm of dating in the real world. For instance, with Samira you get to see the racialised politics and it’s very reflective of an experience of many black women. I empathise with her, and things like Jack’s ex coming in, and his panic, and Dani’s indignation – it’s a blown-up experience of something everyone goes through.”The critique of Love Island being vacuous, trash telly holds little traction for her – “because there is a place for that in this political climate” – and, in any case, the consensus is that, either by accident or design, the show has elevated the format. It benefits from a savvy audience that has grown up on the tropes of reality television. Made in a pre-social-media era, it might have had a different response.“It would be bad and weird to enforce that body culture and bizarre romantic ideals of what is normal and acceptable,” says Babalola. “But because it is critiqued in real time on social media, everyone gets a platform to call it out, and so there is constant debate.” It’s that interaction, she believes, that stops the show from simply being considered “ridiculous and pretending it’s something to aspire to”.If the ratings success of this year’s Love Island seemed assured with ITV2’s targeted demographic, few could have predicted that the crossover would include a Westminster WhatsApp group set up by MPs to discuss the show, or that a women’s charity would make headlines for commenting on the manipulative behaviour seen.For many viewers, the hope rests on the relationship between Jack Fincham, a stationery salesman, and Dani Dyer, daughter of the actor Danny Dyer. “They’re a great romantic couple,” says Goddard. “My wife was in tears watching them express they’d fallen in love. You’ve got some couples in there that will do anything, and they’ve had no shenanigans but they’re the most solid.”Langcaster-James is surprised by how the couple have captured public attention. “One of the perceptions about reality TV is that we all just want to see people falling out and hating each other, but the reality is that we love positive interactions,” she says. In other words, we’re rooting for a happy ending."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f70af0439996c0e569ca1df6166f66f92a5c8ca8/76_47_1753_1052/master/1753.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a26631815c3f7c1235be094aceb5d185","title":"eldorado bbc one soap opera","story":"It was made in a rush in the stifling Spanish heat, the cast included a passing teenage beach bum – and it costa packet. Eldorado was meant to be the new EastEnders – but 25 years since it was axed, it’s still a byword for disasterKai Maurer didn’t know that bleaching his hair would change his life. It was 1992 and the 18-year-old German was bumming around in southern Spain, searching for sun and all the other Ss. He dyed his long brown hair blond for a bet.Next thing he knew, a British TV production was looking to cast a young, blond German for some filming they were doing in the area. Kai went along. He hadn’t really done any acting before, but he’d played the trumpet as a kid, he’d been on a stage. And the audition went well, he got the part. In Eldorado. “I had no idea what anyone was talking about,” Maurer tells me today, over a quarter of a century on. “They were all going, ‘This is for the BBC, it’s going to be big like EastEnders, do you have any inkling how big?’ And I said, ‘No idea. I don’t even know what the BBC is.’”Eldorado’s final episode was broadcast 25 years ago this week. Today the soap opera, said to have cost the BBC £10m, is synonymous with extravagant fiasco. As in, be careful, it could all go Eldorado or we might have an Eldorado on our hands. The BBC hasn’t commissioned an open-ended soap since.It started so hopefully. The early 90s saw peak ratings cold war between the superpowers. ITV had Coronation Street and Emmerdale, the BBC just EastEnders. With the government breathing down its neck, the Beeb needed to add a cruise missile to its arsenal, in order to increase its market share, justify the licence fee, and perhaps its very existence. There was a competition, and a winner: EastEnders creator Tony Holland’s idea about expat Brits living in Spain. It had the key ingredients of a good soap: a sense of real community, of claustrophobia and isolation. There would be Germans and Scandinavians around the place, but it would centre on the Brits who brought their country with them. Little England was the original name. Tony Jordan, then a rookie writer on EastEnders, was brought in by Holland: he wrote Eldorado’s very first episode. Jordan remembers the hype growing until “at some point the commercial people started thinking, ‘Hang on, we’re part of Europe now, this could be the first Eurosoap, that could play not just in the UK but all over Europe.’ It became bastardised, those other nationalities were not on the periphery, they were in the centre. You had all these people tying themselves in knots in this kind of Europudding.”Jordan also talks about the terrible rush. Transmission was dragged forward to throw a curveball at ITV. The entire village they were building in Spain at a cost of £2m was hardly ready casting was rushed. As well as established actors, unknowns were hired – people like Kai Maurer. It couldn’t be called Little England any more, so it became Eldorado. The first episode aired on 6 July 1992 – and it was awful.The critics hated it. ’s Nancy Banks-Smith said it had “the look of a situation comedy whose laughter track has been lost” and wished for a tidal wave to wash the whole thing away. The punters hated it, too. The first episode had an audience appreciation index of 37, among the worst in memory. They’d hoped for 10 million viewers, but by the end of the first month the Friday episode (Eldorado originally went out three times a week) got just 2.8 million – fewer than Panorama. A year later the show that was supposed to save the Beeb’s ass was axed. Brake thinks the show was too ambitious, that it should have started more gently. But soon it was going out five times a week. “We were told we would have siestas in the afternoon, because we were terribly hot, and I remember one cameraman falling over because they were working so hard in the great heat.”She wasn’t convinced by the policy of hiring unknowns. “Some of the casting was unbelievably bad, considering how much talent we have in this country,” she says. Brake, who had worked with the RSC alongside Judi Dench and Ian Richardson, was now starring with Kai the German beach bum. Hey, he had been on stage, too, remember, even if it was only to blow his trumpet. Actually, if you look back at Eldorado now Kai is by no means the worst.Kai’s lines were in English. Some of the other actors spoke their own languages – Spanish, Swedish, Danish – which might have been authentic but also meant that most viewers didn’t know what the hell they were saying. Subtitles were added later, though a primetime popular audience wasn’t ready for them in the early 90s. “I think it may well have been ahead of its time,” says Kai. “Multiculturalism, there you have it, God knows how many different European nationalities under one roof.”Even the English bits weren’t always easy to understand – the sound quality was terrible. It turned out that a very expensive, purpose-built Spanish village had very echoey acoustics. The set still stands on the Costa Del Sol it’s used for paintballing. In spite of the stick it was getting, everyone I speak to who worked on it has fond memories of Eldorado. It might have been hard work, and not very good, but it was a lot of fun. Derek Martin, who played a gangster with a yacht, says the drive to work from his villa in the village of Mijas to the set, was the best he’s ever done. “We were all sad that it packed in,” he says. “The reason was because Mr Alan Yentob went to BBC One. If it had failed, it would’ve been his baby. But at the time it was shut down, it was getting eight million viewers. That should’ve been a licence to go again.”Eight million in 1993, when most viewers had a choice of four channels, wasn’t as many as eight million is today, but it’s a lot more than 2.8 million. A new producer had been brought in, new actors hired, some of the worst non-actors fired Eldorado had, to some extent, been turned around. Now it wasn’t really really bad, just not very good. And not very good wasn’t good enough for the new head of BBC One.So what does Yentob, who inherited Eldorado from his predecessor Jonathan Powell, have to say for himself? “There had been chaos up there, problems on the set, a change of producer, lots of things weren’t working. We saw costs not coming down, and I had other things in mind that would have been difficult to achieve given the investment in Eldorado.” Plus it was awful? “It was, and there you are. But when people are losing their jobs, it’s difficult to be that negative. I gave it a bit of a chance for a few weeks, looked at whether it was potentially going to get better. But, despite the fact it had a good producer, she couldn’t rehabilitate it, so, yes, I cancelled it.” Nancy’s tidal wave had finally arrived, in the form of Alan Yentob. Protests ensued from angry fans. “The stick has not stopped,” Yentob says. “People have been campaigning for it to be revived for such a long time. I’m sure people are sticking pins into pictures of me day and night. Which they are anyway.”Martin, who went on to play Charlie Slater in EastEnders, has heard rumours of an Eldorado reprisal. Now 85, would he go back? “Right now, this minute.”For Brake, just 76, it might not have been the long-term, mortgage-busting job she’d hoped it was going to be. “I think it was the end of my career really. Everything I’m proud of I did before.” But she’s not bitter it worked out well for her personally. If she’d stayed in Spain, she wouldn’t have met her husband. As for Maurer, it was something of a beginning. “I did it the wrong way round didn’t I?” he laughs. “I then went to the UK and I studied acting. I thought, ‘Right, I’m going to see what this is all about, see if I can improve anything.’ What has improved is I don’t sound German any more.”Not as German anyway. The acting lasted a while, but he found the only parts he was getting were comedy Germans or Nazis. He got tired of trying to impress casting directors: it was never as easy as it was that first time in Spain. He stayed in Britain, but changed career. Twenty-five years after the sun went down on Eldorado, Kai’s a flying instructor at Rochester airport, overlooking the River Medway in Kent.Oh and Jordan, who went on to become one of the biggest names in television writing, thinks it would be a good idea to bring it back. “Drama is a very crowded space,” he says. “We’re constantly looking for things that will make a noise, bring in an audience. If there was a broadcaster brave enough and smart enough to do a version of Eldorado, they’d get an immediate audience, though to keep them they’d have to give them a good show.” Over to you, broadcasters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/735b6baab21ebebb46514e92cb299d2f6e4348d0/0_37_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88944b2729ea80508fafac144ce4cb7d","title":"easy does it the slow travel guide to the peloponnese greece","story":"The majestic peninsula is home to local tavernas, picturesque villages, ancient sites and stunning stretches of coast. Best of all, it’s delightfully unhurried and free of overhyped hotspotsThe Peloponnese, southern Greece’s much-mythologised peninsula, has something of a reputation for philoxenia – the tradition of giving a warm welcome and showing generous hospitality to visitors. It’s also a region that embodies the very ideal of slow travel: local food and drink, plenty of walking, zero stress, tapping ancient rhythms and community spirit.Of course, this comes from the people. But it may also have to do with vital statistics. The peninsula is about the size of Wales, yet receives only a small percentage of tourists in comparison to the big beasts of Corfu, Crete, Rhodes, Halkidiki and others. This means there’s no need to jostle among crowds.A topography of indented coasts, river valleys, steep mountain ranges and small coastal peninsulas encourages rural integrity over road-building. In hundreds of small villages, local ties are strong, there are festivals aplenty, and life revolves around farming and fishing, family and friends – and, naturally, local tavernas.Even the staples are sybaritic, from the famous Kalamata olives and green-gold oil to purple-hued tsakoniki aubergines to barrel-aged feta cheese. Wine grapes have been grown across the sun-baked slopes for centuries.For all its old-world charm, the Peloponnese is also a land of almost unlimited scope for exploration. It’s home to some of the most famous archaeological sites in the world, including Olympia and Ancient Messini, as well as many others lesser-known but no less enthralling. Much of Greece’s mythology originated here, including the main players of the Trojan wars.If you want relaxation, this unique part of Greece delivers in spades. Get the inside track on the must-visit villages, beaches and beauty spots, for the ultimate go-slow break in the Peloponnese ...Mani, the second finger at the southern tip of the Peloponnese and, by extension, mainland Greece itself, is one of the most beautiful regions in the country, with a mountainous spine running down to what were – until relatively recently – some very remote spots. The sun rises late on the coast because of the high Taygetos mountain range. Mornings tend to be lazy affairs where locals and visitors mingle to enjoy leisurely coffees and late breakfasts.It is also home to the pretty town of Kardamili. This laid-back little place is wonderful for walkers planning to hike the Viros gorge ditto for birdwatchers, artists and writers – little wonder that Patrick Leigh Fermor chose this village to be his home. The small beach resort of Stoupa is just a few miles to the south.Eat and drinkAll the local eateries are traditional family-run tavernas – as authentic a Greek culinary experience as you’ll find anywhere.  Kiki’s Taverna, up a side street from the town square, does dishes of the day rather than a set menu – favourites include sea bream and goat’s meat – ensuring produce is fresh and seasonal. It’s really traditional and popular with locals. If you want a stunning view with your meal, try Dioskouri Taverna, which overlooks the little harbour of Kardamili, for a fresh fish and sunset combination. It also sells local sea salt, olive soap and honey.StayThe Liakoto and Anniska hotels are on the sea front with the Taygetos range behind – Kardamili is blessed by both sea and mountain scenery. Anniska has a more traditional look and feel, with a stunning terrace where breakfast is served and drinks flow all day. Liakoto has sea-view rooms with private balconies overlooking the magnificent Messinian Bay. Both hotels have a very high number of repeat guests.This away-from-it-all haven is at the start of a string of fine, sandy beaches, culminating in the fantastic lagoon-like curve of Voidokilia in the heart of the nature reserve here – with wetlands excellent for birding. Close by is the historic town of Pylos, where the naval battle of Navarino was fought in 1827, during the Greek war of independence.Eat and drinkThere is an extensive choice of tavernas and cafes, which are really only busy at weekends and in peak season, when the locals from Pylos come for a swim and a fish lunch. Elia does superb salads, aromatic grilled sardines, and octopus with capers.StayZoe Resort’s 20 attractive studios and apartments have a large swimming pool and gardens leading down to the beach. Or you could opt to stay in the older – but no less charming – 24-room Zoe hotel.This historic town is known for the imposing walls of its Venetian fortress, which stretch out towards the sea. It’s very sleepy spot, with a wide sandy beach shelving very gently into shallow waters.Eat and drinkThe Klimataria restaurant is very well regarded, and eating out in the garden courtyard is a reason to visit in itself. Chicken in mustard sauce is delicious, as are the grilled veggies.StayThe Ulysses hotel, a small and friendly lodging with just nine rooms, is great for the beach. Breakfast is excellent and the hotel makes its own fresh lemonade – perfect for kicking off the morning. The Markopouloses, who own the Ulysses, are a mine of information and treat their guests as one of the family.The stunning, rugged hamlet of Gerolimenas, at the head of a fjord-like inlet, was once a busy trading post now it’s a nostalgic post-boom village, and comprises a mere handful of stone houses, a couple of tavernas and a beach.Eat and drinkThe fish – guaranteed fresh – is excellent here. Head for the harbour and you won’t go wrong.StayIf you want remote coupled with contemporary boutique-style comfort, a stay at the Kyrimai hotel should suit. Converted from a 19th-century warehouse, with sea to three sides, the hotel has a standout restaurant, and you can plunge directly from its jetty into the clearest of seas.

Nurses say they are overworked and underpaid, and hospitals are chronically understaffed.Nurses have not gone on strike in New Zealand for 30 years. Minister for health David Clark said the nurses’ discontent had been brewing after nine years of neglect under the previous, National government. “Their frustration is understandable ... I think everyone agrees nurses should be paid more than they are now, but it takes more than one pay round to address nine years of neglect.“We have a fiscal limit, and we’ve put out there the best offer we could put out there.”Primary school teachers have also voted overwhelmingly to strike for half a day on 15 August, their first strike action in more than 24 years. Other groups to strike since the Labour-led government took over in October last year include cinema workers, fast-food workers, and bus drivers. Unite union senior organiser Joe Carolan said the wave of strikes are “unprecedented”, and that workers felt emboldened under the new government and the “swing to the left”. Carolan said concerns the strikes could destabilise the government were not justified.“In the public sector ... some voices are saying this is not the right time to strike as we have a friendly government. So you wonder - when is the right time?” he said.The opposition National party has criticised the government for failing to listen to nurses’ concerns, and say they have a duty to meet the “hugely raised expectations” of workers under their government. There is a fear in some quarters that the wave of strikes was affecting business confidence, which hit a seven-year low in June.In the last significant win for unions, the New Zealand government banned zero-hour contracts in 2016, a bill supported by political parties across the spectrum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/809417b64e8b2fcb902cbcace17efdca643d59c2/7_510_3913_2349/master/3913.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71f38f1c665d5ccc86af82144824a2ad","title":"pride in london in pictures","story":"Huge crowds enjoy the sun and the parade at the city’s annual LGBT Pride celebration."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3558192.1531082735!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"archaeologists seek appropriate pay after site walk off","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            The Institute of Archaeologists of Ireland has called for recognition of the qualifications and professional work done by archaeologists.

File photograph: Google Street ViewThe Institute of Archaeologists of Ireland (IAI) says it is willing to to act as a mediator between parties involved in recent industrial disputes in the sector.In a statement the IAI said “appropriate remuneration and working conditions are a necessity”, and it called for recognition of the qualifications and professional work done by archaeologists.The institute said it hoped the ongoing dialogue between commercial sector employers and the Unite trade union“will be fruitful and bring archaeology to equivalence with other areas of the construction sector”.The statement comes after a protest last week in Macroom, Co Cork, where members of Unite’s archaeology branch voiced concerns about pay rates on the bypass at the town. They said it was the first time archaeologists in Ireland had left a site to protest about pay since the 1970s.The Unite union say that Irish Archaeological Consultancy (IAC), which has been contracted to carry out archaeological works on the Macroom bypass, has refused to engage with them on their pay claim. The union says the IAC also refuses to engage with the Workplace Relations Commission.Unite’s Muiris Wade said there was a huge amount of frustration about pay in the industry, with archaeologists earning close to the minimum wage.“This whole event is a build up of years of running into walls. It is one of those professions where 100 per cent of people who are doing it love the job.” But “you can find yourself working in an environment where you don’t feel valued.

Stuart Elder, who works on the Macroom bypass as a site director, said the situation was insulting to the profession.Mr Elder, who moved to Ireland from Lancashire over 20 years ago, said they had tried and failed to get companies to agree to minimum pay levels.Labour’s employment spokesman Senator Ged Nash said “IAC must show respect to their workers, many of whom hold postgraduate qualifications and have considerable experience yet are expected to live on just €12.50 an hour.”The former minister of state added: “The firm must engage with the union, and Minister Ross and his Government colleagues must make it clear that companies in receipt of State contracts must be expected to engage with our industrial relations institutions.” In a statement IAC said it deals directly with staff on contractual matters.“Earlier this spring the trade union Unite circulated a letter throughout the commercial archaeology sector seeking additional increases in payrates.“IAC have been offering salary packages on projects at or up to 4 per cent above those rates.

The setting is spectacular, at the eastern end of Lake Geneva, on the edge of the Swiss Alps. Palm trees line the promenade, there are snowcapped peaks above. You can sit and look at it all day, but when the sun goes down the town shuts down. The vistas here are heavenly, but there’s not a lot to do.Yet for a fortnight each summer, this torpid paradise is transformed. Lighting rigs and big amp stacks spring up along the lakeside. Grizzled musos replace prosperous OAPs. A tax haven for wealthy pensioners becomes the centre of the world music scene, as the Montreux Jazz Festival comes to town.The Montreux Jazz Festival has always been a bit of a misnomer. It started as a jazz festival in 1967, the brainchild of Swiss impresario Claude Nobs. Keith Jarrett played the first festival, Nina Simone played the second, but it’s always doubled as a rock fest, ever since Ten Years After played here in 1969.Since then, Montreux Jazz Festival has become increasingly eclectic. During the 1970s, there were shows by Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin and Roberta Flack. James Brown came here in the 1980s. Miles Davis played here 11 times between 1973 and 1991. In the Noughties, Montreux hosted Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Run-DMC and Radiohead.This year’s line-up is similarly erse: Rag ‘n’ Bone Man, Nine Inch Nails, Jamiroquai, Massive Attack, Jamie Cullum, John Cale, Iggy Pop, Nick Cave, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison… and the band that put Montreux on the hard-rock roadmap, heavy metal veterans Deep Purple.Even at their headbanging peak, Deep Purple were never really fashionable. They lacked the mystique of other hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin or The Doors. However, in Ritchie Blackmore they had a lead guitarist to rival Led Zep’s Jimmy Page, and in Jon Lord they boasted a keyboard virtuoso the equal of The Doors’ Ray Manzarek.Montreux started as a jazz festival in 1967, but has doubled as a rock event since 1969 (Claude Nobs Archives)Blackmore left the band long ago, and Lord died in 2012, but the three other core members are still going strong: vocalist Ian Gillan, bassist Roger Glover and drummer Ian Paice (the only ever-present since the band started out, 50 years ago). Along with Lord and Blackmore, this trio recorded Deep Purple’s most famous track, in Montreux in 1971, with one of the most familiar riffs in rock history – “Smoke on the Water”.Blackmore’s immortal riff would have been enough to ensure the song’s longevity, but like all the best rock songs it also tells a story. Thankfully, unlike a lot of heavy metal anthems, there’s nothing mystical about it. Instead, it’s a straightforward account, almost journalistic in its brevity, of how Deep Purple recorded their finest album, Machine Head, in Montreux.Formed in 1968 in Hertford, Deep Purple enjoyed some success with their first two albums, but it was when founder members Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice brought in Ian Gillan and Roger Glover that the band took off. Their Concerto for Group and Orchestra (recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall) attracted heaps of publicity, and their fourth LP, Deep Purple in Rock (with its iconic Mount Rushmore cover, featuring the anthemic “Child in Time”) made their name.Cale and Nick Cave (Emilien Itim)Yet for Deep Purple, like so many bands before and since, this breakthrough album brought a different set of problems. Recording sessions for their fifth album, Fireball, had to be fitted in around a busy schedule of live dates, from the autumn of 1970 until the summer of 1971. The album wasn’t as successful as its predecessor, and was widely regarded as a sideways step.Consequently, the band resolved to record their sixth album without any interruptions or distractions. Montreux Casino would be empty for three weeks that winter, and Nobs had offered them the use of it. All the recording equipment they needed they could take with them, in a mobile recording studio (borrowed from The Rolling Stones).With Swiss punctuality, Deep Purple arrived in Montreux, ready to start recording. Frank Zappa and his band, The Mothers of Invention, were playing the Casino that afternoon, and then the venue would be theirs. It couldn’t have been any simpler. What could possibly go wrong?Great music documentaries to watch nowGlastonbury is taking a fallow year but if you’re still craving your Pilton fix, look no further.

Part two takes a closer look at the Seventies - from Zandra Rhodes’ Queen costumes to the DIY punk explosion.Ian Gillan went to see the show with his girlfriend. He saw a man in the crowd behind him wielding a couple of roman candles. Gillan wasn’t too perturbed – compared to most fireworks, roman candles are usually fairly harmless – but then the bloke chucked them into the air, and they lodged in the rafters. In no time at all, the building was ablaze. “There’s a fire, please stay calm and make your way out,”\u0026nbspannounced Zappa from the stage.The band retreated to their hotel, and watched the fire from the bar. At first, it looked like the blaze might spread to the surrounding buildings, and set the entire town alight, but thankfully the wind blew the flames towards the lake, sending smoke billowing out across the water. It was like a special effects scene from a movie. They sat up late, watching the Casino burn to the ground.The title came to Glover the next morning, as he woke up in his hotel bedroom, but the other band members laughed it down – they said it sounded too druggy. But then Blackmore came up with a riff, that riff, on the spur of the moment, and they had the beginnings of a song.However, right now, their most pressing problem was finding somewhere – anywhere – to record. Mercifully, no one had been hurt, but the Casino was a smoking ruin. Nobs found a vacant theatre called The Pavillon, which seemed fine, but the sound-proofing was useless. They’d just started playing “Smoke on the Water” when the police arrived to shut them down. Luckily, the roadies kept them out, as the policemen hammered on the doors.There was only one thing wrong. There wasn’t quite enough material. They’d recorded six classic tracks, including “Lazy”, “Highway Star”, “Pictures of Home” and “Space Truckin’”, but it still came up a bit short for a full LP. Then they remembered the demo they’d recorded at The Pavillon, just before the Swiss police threw them out. And so belatedly, “Smoke on the Water” ended up on the LP, almost by accident. Today, it’s not only the most celebrated song on the album, but the most celebrated song they’ve ever played.Léon Francioli played Montreux in 1971 (Claude Nobs Archives)Yet even after it scraped onto the LP, “Smoke on the Water” still took a while to become a classic. The main single from the album was “Never Before”, which only reached number 35 in the UK singles chart and never became a live staple. Only in 1973, when “Smoke on the Water” was released as a single in the US and started getting airplay on American radio stations, did it finally begin to break through.But although “Smoke on the Water” has now acquired legendary stand-alone status, it still sits best amid the album for which it was intended, as track five (if you’re listening to it on a CD or some other rubbish modern format) or – far better – as the first track on side two, if you’re listening to the proper vinyl LP. It tells the story of the album, and that’s where it ought to stay.Deep purple: There are hellebores- and then there are Rodney Davey’sDeep Purple looks ready to rock old star DenmanDeep Purple made some fine LPs before and some fine LPs thereafter, but they never made anything quite as good as Machine Head. So what made it click? The tight timeframe was one factor – adversity was another. Far from home in the dead of winter, in a quiet resort in low season, there was an element of “all hands to the pump”\u0026nbspas everyone mucked in together.This no-nonsense attitude was reflected in the production. Sound engineer Martin Birch did a brilliant job. The sound he created was clean and sparse, never overly ornate or fussy. He gave each instrument room to breathe. There was very little overdubbing. It was such a palaver getting out of the hotel and into the mobile studio that they often didn’t bother listening to the playback. By modern standards, this was virtually a live album.Nobs died in 2013, after a skiing accident, aged 76. The Jazz Festival is his enduring testament (he also gets a shout-out as “Funky Claude”\u0026nbspin “Smoke on the Water”). The Casino was rebuilt on the same spot, but sadly they didn’t recreate the Belle Époque splendour of the original structure. The modern replacement is a Seventies eyesore. Just think: if it hadn’t been for that idiot with the roman candles, that beautiful building would still be there. But, then again, we’d have never heard “Smoke on the Water”.Montreux Jazz Festival runs\u0026nbspuntil 14 July and Deep Purple play on 4 July (mjf.ch)Smoke on the waterEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in rapturesThree hours of Public Enemy: that’s what I got when I let my son have his choice of music in the car recently. Amid his vast collection of Pokemon trading cards is a set featuring the members of Queens of the Stone Age. And one of my favourite moments as a dad was his overjoyed reaction when I told him I’d got us tickets for Metallica. He’s a music-loving father’s dream.\u0026nbspBut what’s good for the goose has to be good for the gander. Or the other way around. So when Taylor Swift announced that her reputation stadium tour was coming to Wembley, it was a case of fair’s fair. It was my daughter’s turn, even if it meant this Metallica Dad agreeing to a descent into musical purgatory on a Friday night instead of catching up with Game of Thrones.\u0026nbsp“On no, you’ll love it, you’ll have such a good time. I’m so jealous!”That was the response of a shockingly large number of female friends and acquaintances, many of whom volunteered to accompany my seven-year-old daughter Rheya\u0026nbspwhen I expressed trepidation at the prospect of an evening in the company of 100,000 screaming Swifties.\u0026nbspThe ersity of those it came from took me aback: people I just couldn’t imagine would be fans were saying it.\u0026nbspThere were culture vultures and rock fans. Twenty-somethings, thirty-somethings, and forty-somethings. Some with no children, others with a hatful, whose daughters, like mine, they were taking. I sometimes found myself saying, “what, you too?”Taylor Swift seems to hold a good chunk of the female population in her thrall. And not a few men too. Quite an achievement for a onetime country singer.\u0026nbspIt seems to be Swift’s particular way with words that has drawn them in. Nashville is renowned for its story tellers. But Swift’s stories have resonated with a far wider constituency than is usual for singers coming from out of that milieu. \u0026nbspRheyaAt her Wembley show, she likened what she does to the opening up her diary. The chronicling of the ups and downs of her love life, her biting back at bad boyfriends, her reflection on experiences many of those who count themselves her fans will have had, speaks to them.\u0026nbspSelina Mills, a writer friend of mine, and one of those who had me saying “what you too?”, says she serves up “emotional truths” with that diary.\u0026nbspAnother friend, Karen Attwood, who runs Nine Media Training, says: “She’s as good with an acoustic guitar as she is with a big pop anthem and I just love her lyrics. She is having a conversation they’re gorgeous, often very funny and sarcastic.”\u0026nbspIt never hurts if you can make ’em smile. Swift does it for her fans in the same way that a cutting rhyme from rapper Chuck D does it for me.

Right now, it’s them against us. This shit is ugly to the core. When it comes to the poor, no lives matter!” Now that’s the sort of the conversation I want to have.\u0026nbspFeeling suitably purged and, yes, a little self-righteous, I felt able to spend an afternoon in the company of Taylor. But after the first half hour I almost felt like saying “look what you made me do”\u0026nbspto Rheya. And my editors, because I didn’t find listening to her latest missive any easier than her fans might find sampling Slayer.\u0026nbspIt’s not that I can’t recognise a good pop song. Everyone has their guilty pleasures. But reputation’s hooks seemed swamped in a sea of expensive production. Here a backing singer trills, there a rapper rhymes, as the vocals tail off into electronic distortion. Meanwhile\u0026nbspSwift reflects on the trials and tribulations not so much of being a teenager, but of being an uber-famous member of the 1 per cent, a bona fide mega star, with the requisite stable of hip hop style feuds.\u0026nbsp1989, her first “official”\u0026nbsppop record, I found more approachable, and memorable. I confess, I already had some familiarity with that album on account of indie troubadour Ryan Adams covering the whole thing. He somehow managed to put a wistful and melancholy sheen on an upbeat and feisty pop record, widely recognised as the highpoint of her career to date. Moving further back, Nashville becomes progressively more noticeable, and Swift’s stories more innocent and easier to hear.\u0026nbspBut what about the show designed to showcase it all? If not the hottest ticket in town, it was certainly the priciest, part of an effort, it has been argued, to neutralise the scalpers who would have profited handsomely through gouging fans had Swift left money on the table.\u0026nbspI have to admit: a part of me was intrigued. I’ve been going to gigs for more than 30 years now (it makes me shudder to have to say that) and I’ve seen almost everything. Metal, indie, jazz, rap, soul, punk and more besides. I’ve been to decaying fleapit clubs, massive arenas, festivals and, yes, even great big stadia.\u0026nbspBut what I’d never experienced before my evening with Swift was one those bona fide pop mega tours the sort of thing featuring a cast of thousands, that takes several planes, and a fleet of trucks to move the thing from to venue to venue, and turns over the GDP of a small country.It was a world apart from the stadium shows I’ve previously been to. The Stone Roses, for example, needed only their songs, together with the odd inflatable ball bouncing up and down in the crowd, to make for a thoroughly memorable occasion last summer, one worth the price of tickets that weren’t exactly cheap themselves.\u0026nbspA Swift show, by contrast, majors as much on spectacle as it does on music. There were, at Wembley, enough huge snakes to send an ophidiophobic fan running for a\u0026nbsptherapist. Apparently their presence stems from an insult the Kardashian married to Kanye West lobbed at her, and they’ve since become something of a trademark. One’s probably pending.\u0026nbspThere was fire, and fireworks, and films. There was the obligatory army of dancers. Everyone was given a light bracelet on their way in, which seemed to change colours at the command of someone armed with an iPad backstage. The effect was actually rather pretty, if not exactly environmentally friendly.\u0026nbspThere was even a sort of floating cage of lights to ferry Swift between the three (count ’em) stages and, at the end, a bloke whom I’m reliably informed was once in One Direction, came on to perform a duet. Neither me nor my daughter were quite sure who he was, although his presence seemed to delight the crowd. \u0026nbspAs for Swift herself? Well, I’ll give her this. She is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in raptures.\u0026nbsp“Thank you for joining us on the reputation stadium tour,” she said. It was a line she repeated several times. I could almost hear the business manager whispering in her ear: “Don’t say anything that could be considered controversial, but make sure you reference the brand at least once every 15 minutes or so. It’s good for T-shirt sales.”In the middle of this assault on the senses I was again left wondering whether Swift isn’t in danger of losing that connection she has forged. But then, about halfway through, with her occupying stage number two, she produced an acoustic guitar and just sang. She did the same with a piano later on. It worked too. Whatever Swift is, she is no manufactured talent, incapable of surviving without studio trickery, and solely reliant on others to play the instruments. It made me wonder if all the extra stuff was really necessary.\u0026nbspThe reputation\u0026nbspalbum may not have done the business 1989 did, and Swift may have strained her connection with some, but her still loyal fans lapped up everything she did.\u0026nbspCrucially, so did my daughter. All my criticisms started to pale before her sheer unabashed joy. It would have made any parent melt, and the zone of protection I thought I’d established by wearing my Metallica tour T-shirt, with a suitably gruesome design, was breached. In a world that seems to grow grimmer by the day, I couldn’t help but be uplifted at my child’s innocent delight. I even found myself enjoying myself, if vicariously.\u0026nbspAttwood says part of Swift’s appeal, as a parent, is that “among all the hyper sexualised pop stars she is a fantastic role model for my daughter”.\u0026nbspTaylor Swift brings Robbie Williams on stage to sing ‘Angels’ Taylor Swift launches UK ‘reputation’ tour in ManchesterTaylor Swift marks Pride Month with heartfelt speech in ChicagoIs Taylor Swift off-loading her Beverly Hills property portfolio?And I get that. Even though with all that branding it sometimes seems as if she’s as much CEO as she is musician, she is, to quote Janet Jackson, in control.I don’t think Taylor will be troubling my speakers in future, but this Metallica Dad was able to make an accommodation with her.There is a postscript that may amuse you. Since getting one of those Amazon Echo Dots, my chip-off-the-old-block son has been constantly playing what he tells me are Geometry Dash composers. They play electronic video game music that leaves me cold.My daughter, meanwhile, has developed an obsession with Metallica’s Master of Puppets, to the extent that sometimes she’s even had me saying “can’t we have something else on?”.\u0026nbspIt means I might have to enjoy our next live experience vicariously. Next time they tour she’s made it clear she doesn’t want to be left out.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It would do the exact opposite it would take the pressure off them. Now is not the moment to do that.10 photographs to show to anyone who doesn\u0027t believe in climate changeA group of emperor penguins face a crack in the sea ice, near McMurdo Station, AntarcticaAmid a flood in Islampur, Jamalpur, Bangladesh, a woman on a raft searches for somewhere dry to take shelter.

One senior EU official tears into Britain’s ‘fantasy’ negotiating strategy and accuses Theresa May of not even having a position on a variety of important issue.Britain releases a new customs plan to solve the Northern Ireland border but Michel Barnier says it leaves ‘unanswered’ questions and would not prevent a hard border“I am afraid that I think the current trend of policy and tactics is making that look less and less likely.”\u0026nbspHe went on to argue that the “general direction” of Ms May’s policies would leave the UK “in at best a weak negotiating position, and possibly an inescapable one”.Mr Davis said\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspcabinet decision on Friday had\u0026nbsp”crystallised this problem” and would\u0026nbsphand\u0026nbspcontrol of “large swathes of our economy to the EU” and is “certainly not returning control of our laws” .\u0026nbspMs May responded saying she disagreed with his “characterisation” of the agreement reached at Chequers last week.She said: ”I am sorry that you have chosen to leave government when we have already made so much progress towards delivering a smooth and successful Brexit, and when we are only eight months from the date set in law when the United Kingdom will leave the European Union.”Mr Davis had also written to the prime minister ahead of the crunch cabinet meeting last Friday, warning that her proposals would not be accepted in Europe.It raises the most serious questions about the PM’s ideas. If the Brexit Secretary cannot support them they cannot be very good proposalsHe is also said to have been annoyed after being sidelined in negotiations by Ms May’s civil servant Europe advisor\u0026nbspOlly\u0026nbspRobbins.But  correspondent Sarah O’Grady, the wife of Mr Davis’ special adviser Stewart Jackson, said “DD decided he couldn’t sell out his own country”.Jacob Rees-Mogg, who chairs the Brexit-backing European Research Group of Tory backbenchers, said:\u0026nbsp“This is very important.“It raises the most serious questions about the PM’s ideas. If the Brexit secretary cannot support them they cannot be very good proposals.Turning his fire on the meeting at Chequers on Friday, he said: “It was an attempt to bounce the cabinet. It was a serious\u0026nbspmistake.”\u0026nbspBackbencher\u0026nbspPeter Bone also\u0026nbspsupported Mr Davis’ decision to quit, saying he had “done the right thing” and that it was a “principled and brave decision”.He added: “The PM’s proposals for a Brexit in name only are not acceptable.”Mr Baker, a key Tory figure in the Leave campaign, was Mr Davis’s\u0026nbspmain lieutenant\u0026nbspat Dexeu,\u0026nbspand was hailed as\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp”courageous and principled” by other Brexiteer Tories as he also left.\u0026nbspMs May is expected to tell MPs\u0026nbspat what may now become a critical meeting on Monday,\u0026nbspthat the strategy agreed on at Chequers is the “right Brexit” for Britain.Her plans would commit the UK to maintain a “common rule book” with the EU, meaning it would effectively seek to stay in a single market for goods, for the foreseeable future at least.The proposed facilitated customs arrangement, would see all imported goods charged the UK tariff at the border, with goods then tracked\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspif they were sent on to the continent, exporters would be charged the EU tariff with money passed on to Brussels.The plan means that the UK can theoretically sign trade deals with other countries in which it promises to lower tariffs on goods, in return for preferable access for its services. But the promise not to deviate from EU standards on goods, means a change to regulations could not form a part of any trade deal – something which has angered Brexiteers.Some Conservatives\u0026nbsptold The Independent they believed there could be enough disgruntled MPs willing to trigger a leadership contest in a bid to remove Ms May.But even if the 48 needed to oust Ms May materialised, a poll for The Independent showed a majority of the public would expect a general election to be called if Ms May goes.Labour’s shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said: “David Davis resignation now shows the Tory party is in complete disarray and not governing in the national interest.“This nonsense cannot continue, even the Tory spin doctors cannot surely spin a positive message out of this debacle.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspMr Afwerki then travelled across the capital in a large motorcade as people wearing T-shirts with photos of the two leaders cheered. The leaders later met one-on-one, with a smiling Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspleaning towards\u0026nbspMr Afwerki under a wall hung with their portraits.The visit comes a month after Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspsurprised people by fully accepting a peace deal that ended a two-year border war between the two countries. Ethiopia and Eritrea have not had diplomatic ties since the war began in 1998, with Mr Ahmed\u0026nbsphimself fighting in a town that remains contested today, and the countries have skirmished since then in one of Africa’s longest-running conflicts.Mr Ahmed’s chief of staff, Fitsum Arega, said on Twitter that the visit aims to “further deepen efforts to bring about lasting peace.” He shared photos of the leaders’ meeting and said Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspwas “very warmly received” by Mr Afwerki.“Our two nations share a history and bond like no other,” he said. “We can now overcome two decades of mistrust and move in a new direction.”Ethiopia’s foreign ministry called the visit “part of efforts to normalise relations with Eritrea” and said Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspwas expected to talk with Eritrea’s leadership about “how to mend fences”.One Eritrean diplomat, its ambassador to Japan Estifanos Afeworki, said on Twitter that “no leader has received such a warm welcome like today in Asmara in the history of Eritrea”.Ethiopians expressed welcome shock at the meeting, which was shown live by Ethiopia’s state TV.“Historic ... the beginning of the end. The glass ceiling has been broken,” one resident, Shewit Wudassie, wrote on Facebook. Another Facebook user, Djphat Su, wrote: “Am I dreaming or what?”The decision to fully accept the peace deal was the biggest and most surprising reform yet announced by Ethiopia’s 42-year-old prime minister, who took office in April and quickly set off a wave of reforms, freeing journalists and opposition figures from prison, opening up the state-run economy and unblocking hundreds of websites after years of anti-government protests demanding more freedoms.World news in picturesResidents look over the flooded town by heavy rain in Kurashiki, Okayama Prefecture, western Japan.

The demand is likely to cause friction with Italy’s European partners where migration is a source of internal political tension.Last week, Germany, Austria and Italy said they would hold talks in Innsbruck about how to shut down the Mediterranean route.Germany wants to process refugees in police facilities within 48 hours on its southern border with Austria, and in turn Austria has said it may be forced to protect its own southern border with Italy and Slovenia to stop migrants transiting from the south.Italy’s transport ministry last month said it wanted the EU border agency, Frontex, to stop working in the Mediterranean. Frontex runs an operation off the coast of Italy that works closely with the local coast guard.The EU missions have helped rescue thousands of refugees\u0026nbspat sea, all of whom were disembarked in Italy. Spokespeople at Frontex and Sophia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Italy has so far refused to take back any migrants stopped at the German border.“Before receiving even one asylum seeker from another European country, we want to see a precise commitment – giving the timetable, costs, means, men and resources –\u0026nbspon how the EU plans to help us defend our external borders,” Mr Salvini said last week.Aid groups and United Nations’ agencies on Friday asked Italy open its ports to rescue ships because the policy could have a high human cost. More migrants could die at sea, or they could be trapped indefinitely in inhumane detention centres, they said.On Sunday, Mr Salvini said the previous government had agreed to welcome migrants rescued by ships participating in the EU sea missions.Mr Salvini said: “With our government, the music has changed and will change”.This comes after a rescue boat carrying 60 refugees arrived in Barcelona last week after being turned away by Italy and Malta.The mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, came to the ship’s rescue when she, with permission from the Spanish government, told the crew of the vessel that it could dock.\u0026nbspThe boat, which was said to have had five women, a nine-year-old and four teenagers on board, was turned away by Mr Salvini.He said the rescue boat “can forget about arriving in an Italian port” and then suggested the boat should dock in Malta which he claimed was the nearest port.Additional reporting by ReutersEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It\u0027s unworkable, it\u0027s a bureaucratic nightmare.Mr Gove admitted the compromise was not all he hoped forHe added that Labour would not take the option of backing a referendum on the final deal off the table if Parliament voted down the agreement or the UK failed to reach agreement with Brussels.Labour peer and former EU Commissioner Lord Mandelson said the party should explicitly commit to a second vote and put the economy first.Tory chairman Brandon Lewis said: We\u0027re moving forward, and Labour want to turn the clock back two years.Mrs May told the Sunday Times it was time for the EU to get serious and address what we\u0027ve put forward.She said the EU Commission which is leading talks with Britain had so far been very much holding fast to a rigid approach but other leaders like Angela Merkel were beginning to ask about what mattered for their own people.Dismissing talk of a looming leadership challenge from angry Tories, she declared: The only challenge that needs to be made now is to the EU to get serious about this, to come round the table and discuss it with us.Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who chaired the Vote Leave referendum campaign and is a focus of Tory anger for supporting the Chequers deal, backed her call, saying Brussels will make a no-deal Brexit more likely if it does not show more willing.The Prime Minister gathered her cabinet together ahead of a crunch Brexit showdown at her country retreat at Chequers in Buckinghamshire                    PA1 of 14Members of the cabinet and government officials gather at ChequersAgreement on Friday that the Government should do more to prepare for a no-deal outcome was one concession secured by Brexiteers - and Mr Gove was said to have emphasised the point in his own decisive presentation to colleagues making clear he would back Mrs May\u0027s approach.He told BBC One\u0027s Andrew Marr show yesterday: We\u0027re being generous towards the EU, we\u0027re showing flexibility.If the EU is ungenerous and inflexible then we may have to contemplate walking away without a deal.One of the things that we agreed at Chequers is that we would step up the preparations for precisely that outcome to ensure that ... we will be in a position in March 2019 that if we don\u0027t get the deal that we want, to be able to walk away.Noone wants to walk away now because we\u0027re in the middle of a negotiation. What we need to do is to be able to walk away in March 2019 (but) not because we want that outcome. I want a deal.He advised EU negotiator Michel Barnier to regard the interests of your citizens with the same care and the same attention as our Prime Minister has for the interests of our citizens and work for a good trade agreement.One source stressed last night: The free trade agreement we\u0027re proposing isn\u0027t about compromise with the EU, it\u0027s about challenging them.

Signalling that the UK might stay in a Customs Union was another enormous error.Downing Street has consistently left unchallenged the scare tactics of professional Remainers — big businesses seeking ongoing EU protection, Brussels-funded think tanks and member states wanting UK cash.The Irish land border, for instance, already copes with different currencies, duties and other tax rates.Outside the Customs Union there is no need for physical hard border posts that might inflame sectarian sensitivities — as confirmed by the head of HMRC, his Irish equivalent and a study published by the European Parliament.Instead of explaining these realities, and arguing Britain’s corner, Mrs May has allowed Irish border falsehoods to warp her entire Brexit strategy.Roberto Azevedo insisted trading with the EU under World Trade Organisation rules was “perfectly manageable”.She has similarly failed to counter claims it would be disastrous to leave the EU with no free trade agreement, using World Trade Organisation rules instead.Again, this is nonsense. Britain already conducts most of its trade outside the EU, largely under WTO rules.“It is not the end of the world if UK-EU trade is on the basis of WTO rules”, WTO director general Roberto Azevedo told me. “It’s ­perfectly manageable.”That’s a vital insight because, unless no deal is seen as a viable option, the UK’s negotiating hand is seriously undermined — with Britain then forced to accept whatever trade deal the EU offers as March 2019 nears.The Government should have been making determined and very visible preparations for no deal.The irony is that, behind the scenes, there has been considerable work.Last week the National Audit Office concluded that an HMRC upgrade that was happening anyway means ­Britain’s customs service should be ready to cope with no deal from January 2019.Instead of pursuing such rational strategies, Mrs May now wants the UK, in effect, to stay in the Single Market for goods, while facing greater restrictions on trade in services.This is totally lopsided — Britain is far better at exporting services (we run a £14billion annual surplus with the EU) than goods (which show a £96billion EU deficit).And proposals to solve the Irish border by tracking goods and collecting the EU’s tariff revenues have already been rejected by Brussels.Mrs May should just leave the Single Market and the Customs Union, with no deal if necessary.By presenting absurd ideas, our Mad Hatter Prime Minister appears to hope her people will conclude Brexit is too hard and should be abandoned.If so, she doesn’t understand the country she purports to govern.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A total, humiliating capitulation.”But Europhile business groups hailed the PMs plans as a genuine confidence boost.The pro-Brussels Confederation of British Industry said it was proof the Government was listening to warnings from big firms.Vote Leave chief and Environment Secretary Michael Gove played a key role in winning the peace for the PM by siding with her in order to isolate the hardline Brexiteers.A plan may have been cooked up but it still needs to get past the EU — and the continent’s leaders are showing no sign of compromise.Angela Merkel is already rubbishing our proposal.The Napoleonic Emmanuel Macron thinks he’s a political messiah, and he’d rather see us punished than give up on his federalist promised land.And Michel Barnier’s dangled “concessions” amount to a demand for total UK capitulation.With that level of zeal and stubbornness, it’s no wonder we voted in our millions to leave.We must now go to Brussels with an offer that guarantees control of our borders and sign our own trade deals.But we mustn’t for a second think that they’ll just say yes to it, nor can the PM let them fatally weaken it.It is galling that ministers have spent more time fighting between themselves than preparing for a “no deal” exit.But it isn’t too late.New technology can ensure that Whitehall and our borders are ready for a clean break, which considering the strength of our economy and our companies is nothing to be scared of.The PM has dumped many of her earlier Brexit slogans. But she should remember one in particular now.No deal really is better than a bad deal, and we must still prepare for it.Mrs May will now publish a White Paper and address MPs on Monday - setting up a long summer of negotiations with Brussels on the offer.The PM said she was hopeful of the details being well received by EU leaders, adding: “Now we want to get on at pace, negotiate this with the EU and bring prosperity and security to people.”Despite bitter divisions within her top team, Mrs May was able to convince a majority of her 29 ministers around to the climbdown plan during four hours of debate in the her sweltering 16th county mansion in Buckinghamshire.Sources claimed that Environment Secretary Michael Gove, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and Home Secretary Sajid Javid were instrumental in backing the PM’s plan to tip the balance in favour of the PM and leaving the Brexiteers like Boris Johnson and David Davis isolated.Another source said the talks went on for “four hours” with lunch and dinner served in the grand house, insisting: “There was plenty of good humour and it was low on tension”.But another insider added there were “obviously fraught moments”.As news of the deal filtered across Whitehall insiders expressed their shock at “the scale of the climbdown”, expressing surprise that no Brexit minister had quit over the deal.SALADSWheat, beetroot, squash

details of the terms of the deal hours before critical ministers at the summit were given back their mobile phones.And MPs cautioned that the fact Brussels Brexit boss Michel Barnier was “welcoming this White Paper as just a start” meant they were already publicly expecting the UK to slide further towards the EU.Earlier in the day Mr Barnier had opened the EU’s door to compromises by repeatedly refusing to criticise the PM.He said: “I have real respect for Theresa May and I know that her duty, her daily work is not so easy.”But a document setting out Britain’s plan for a future relationship with Brussels set out plans for a “mobility framework” that would allow UK and EU citizens “to travel to each other’s territories and apply for study and work”.The document added this would be “similar to what the UK may offer other close trading partners in the future.”Home Secrertary Sajid Javid is only expected to set out Britain’s post Brexit immigration plans AFTER a provision deal with the EU is agreed this October.During a conciliatory speech at the Irish embassy in Brussels, the Frenchman also called on both sides to “de-dramatise” the Northern Irish border issue.And he hinted that the EU is waiting to kickstart the negotiations on renewed terms if Mrs May softens her red lines.But one MP said: “I need to see the detail but I’m extremely wary.“It sounds to me like we’re going to be rule taker rather than the a rule maker.“It’s feels we are danger of total capitulation to Brussels.”And Brexiteer critics were giving an unlikely boost from arch-remainer Sir Nick Clegg who said they were right to reject Mrs May’s third way custom fudge that would lead to “vast red tape” while “smugglers would boom” and “Parliament left humiliated” as a simple rubber stamper.Tempers had already reached boiling point in the run up to the summit after Downing Street publicly warned one in Government who quit could watch her soft-Brexit march continue from the sidelines.No10 insiders revealed emergency reshuffle plans were already in place incase of Ministerial walkouts from her crunch Brexit summit.The day was broken into three sections with the first seeing Brexit guru Olly Robbins brief ministers on the “Available Outcomes in Light of the EU’s Current Position”.But the testy exchanges were seen in the afternoon’s session titled The UK’s Proposed Approach”.Before the ministers had even sat down around the table Downing Street infuriated them by warning that they would have to get a taxi home as they would be stripped of their limos immediately if they walked out in protest.A senior Government source said: “Taxi cards for Aston’s taxis the local cab firm are in the foyer for those who decide they can’t face making the right decision for the country but it will still be a long walk as it is a mile long driveway.The official raged: “A select number of narcissistic, leadership dominated cabinet ministers need to support the PM in the best interests of the UK or their spots will be taken by a talented new generation of MPs who will sweep them away.”And The Sun revealed that the whips had summoned dozens of junior ministers for a series of meetings to sound them out over the PM’s plans as possible future cabinet replacements in the case of a mass walkout.Housing minister Dominic Raab, Crime minister Victoria Atkins and Local Government minister Kit Malthouse were touted as possible replacements.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mass deportations of illegal immigrants? Jawohl!And don’t mention the #RefugeesWelcome hashtag.What a change of heart. Merkel’s solution to the refugee crisis of 2015 was to dismantle Germany’s borders.No elected politician in modern history has ever acted with such monumental, breath-taking arrogance.Merkel’s grandiose virtue signalling unleashed mass, mostly economic migration that continues to this day.More than a million refugees poured into Germany in 2015 alone. They were almost exclusively young men because the old, the sick and children — the most vulnerable refugees and those most deserving of a helping hand — can’t walk the length of the Balkans.Anyone who had doubts about promoting limitless uncontrolled migration was silenced by Merkel’s smug catchphrase, “Wir schaffen das!” — We can do this!But Germany, and Europe, will pay the price for Angela Merkel’s apocalyptic arrogance long after she is pushing up edelweiss.Merkel’s career is on its knees because she permanently changed Germany without ever consulting the German people to see if her policy of the unmanaged migration of one million-plus young males from a totally different culture was actually WHAT THEY WANTED.Merkel never even thought about the wishes of the German people. We hear a lot about the rise of “populism” everywhere from Trump’s America to the new, vehemently anti-EU coalition government in Italy.But there is no great mystery about the rise of anti- establishment sentiment. For decades haughty politicians have viewed their own people with unbridled, undisguised, unapologetic contempt.Now, all over the Western world, they are paying the price.Theresa May should carefully study the fall of Angela Merkel. Whatever the polls might say, few would weep to see May departing Downing Street.It seems increasingly likely, from what we’re hearing out of Chequers, that this prime minister would far prefer to cuddle up to the crumbling EU empire rather than break free and strike trade deals with the US, Australia, Canada, India and China.But if we can’t trade with the world then it is not a soft Brexit. It is no bloody Brexit at all.Her job is not to soften our departure from the EU to such a degree that it becomes meaningless.Whatever her personal preferences, Theresa May’s job, and the historic role that falls to her now, is to honour the referendum of 2016, the vote we were solemnly promised was final by our former prime minister, David Cameron.It is not complicated. Don’t do a Merkel.Theresa May has to respect democracy and the will of the British people.And if she doesn’t or she can’t, if May betrays the British people, if she castrates or buggers up Brexit, if she tells 17.4million that they are ignorant racist bigots who should never have had a vote in the first place, then we are going to need a new prime minister.In Merkel’s spectacular fall from power there is a lesson for every leader in the Western world, especially Theresa May.You are not our master. You are our servant. You do not know best. And you ignore the will of your people at your peril.THIS World Cup has been a revelation. Who knew we would still be working up a sweat long after Germany, Argentina, Brazil and Spain had flown home?Who knew that England could win a penalty shoot-out in a World Cup? Then cruise through a quarter-final?And who knew England could only ever really succeed again – and true success means having a team that we love and take pride in – if we returned to having English managers? All jaw-dropping stuff.Now Alicia Aylies – former Miss France and the girlfriend of France’s fleet-footed Kylian Mbappe – proudly poses in a zippy bralet.Seriously, who had ever heard of the zippy bralet until Russia 2018? The shocks just keep on coming.FOR two weeks every year, the British go crazy about tennis.The Australian Open, Roland-Garros in France and the US Open hardly merit a second glance from the British public but Wimbledon is an essential part of our calendar.Yet this year our attention has been distracted by another sporting event in a distant land. The men’s singles final will overlap with the World Cup Final.But quite frankly, who cares?This year we are lukewarm on Wimbledon.So you had to feel for British wildcard Katie Boulter, knocked out in the second round.There is still plenty of time for Henman Hill or Murray Mound to become Boulter’s Bulge or Katie’s Cusp.LONDON Mayor Sadiq Khan is allowing a Donald Trump blimp to float above London during the President’s visit to the UK.No news yet on if Khan has plans to do anything about the gun, knife and acid epidemic on the streets of London.With well over 1,000 stabbings this year, more than fifty of them fatal, crime in London is out of control.But at least we have that Trump balloon, Sadiq.DIEGO MARADONA was pictured grinning happily in an XXL Colombia shirt before their match with England but was apoplectic in defeat.“You have to denounce this,” fumed Maradona.“As the captain of legends, I have to tell Infantino (Fifa President) this cannot be left like this.“This is a fatal mistake for the whole country.”I’m sure it all sounds much better in translation.But you get the gist – “Our headbutting boys were robbed”.Fifa hands Maradona a reported £7,000 to turn up at every match and the fat man issued a grovelling apology for criticising the ref when he reflected that seven grand might possibly slip through his cheating hands.But you can hardly blame Diego Maradona for sticking up for those grappling, nasty, spiteful, penalty-spot-scuffing Colombians.After all, Diego has done his best to single-handedly prop up one of Colombia’s major exports. And that’s nothing to sniff at.YOUNG mum Claire Morrison, 28, was mortified when her six-year-old daughter Eve took her vibrator to school for show-and-tell because Eve thought it was a particularly interesting looking pen.Some parents might prefer to keep quiet about this mishap, but Claire has gone on Facebook to tell the “hilarious” story.“She just said it was her funny pink pen,” chuckles Claire, a hairdresser from Dundee. “Then she said, ‘It must talk because it needs batteries’. So her stepdad and I laughed that off and we have safely stored it away.”It has now been shared 6,000 times.The story. Not the vibrator. Obviously. That wouldn’t be very hygienic.WE can all understand why David and Victoria Beckham would want to put on a public display of loving solidarity on their wedding anniversary.But I can’t help wondering, does Victoria really need to tell David “I love you so much” via her Instagram account and its 21.3million followers?

Of course, our security interests don’t begin and end at our borders, or even at the edge of Europe.Whether it’s Russia, Syria, Afghanistan or beyond, threats continue to emerge and develop around the world.After we leave the EU we will be free to pursue a truly independent foreign policy but that does not mean we will isolate ourselves from our neighbours.Under our proposals, we will continue to consult and co-operate with our EU partners on global issues.We will work with the EU on sanctions like those recently imposed on Russia, including co-ordinating them where it’s in our interests to do so.Our joint work on defence capability and space will continue. And we will decide where our armed forces and foreign aid could be used alongside the EU.Brexit has never been about turning our backs on Europe, pulling down the shutters and keeping ourselves to ourselves.Since well before the EU existed we have traded with and fought alongside allies around the world, and that won’t end when we leave next March.There’s still a lot of negotiating to be done.

And we’re only at the start of what will be no doubt stormy negotiations for months to come.There remain serious questions about not just the compromise that Theresa May has forced on her Cabinet but on the final deal she plans to sign with Brussels.One, does it genuinely give us the ability to sign free trade deals across the rest of the world, strengthening our links with emerging markets and with the Commonwealth?Two, does it genuinely end freedom of movement, or does the woolly language in Downing Street’s statement still give people the chance to come here on the off-chance they might find a job?Three, can a future Government genuinely seek to diverge further away from the EU in certain areas without Brussels blowing the whole deal up, or charging us a king’s ransom to do so?If the answer to any of those is no, then the Prime Minister will never be forgiven.Not by her party and, as we report today, not by the public either.IT is astonishing that £13,000 of taxpayers’ cash has been dished out to allow a man serving life for murder to indulge his musical passions by staging a rock opera in jail.That’s money taken from the pockets of working families who have to scrimp and save because the taxman milks them at the petrol pump, the checkout till and in their paycheque.Why did the Arts Council think it appropriate to give the fruits of their labour to a monster like Graham Coutts?The law-abiding public deserve so much better.ENGLAND in a World Cup semi-final.

The Sun sees no further red lines she can cross without self-destruction.So EU negotiator Michel Barnier and his puppet-masters Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron need to be very careful how far they push back.Impossible demands will destabilise and bring down the Government.Let’s be blunt. This fudge is the result of the PM’s dithering and failure to plan for “no deal” — that essential weapon of any negotiator’s armoury.Had she won the 100-plus majority predicted before last year’s election things would be different. But her disastrous campaign put paid to that.Michael Gove claims her Chequers offer would secure Brexit and free us to move further away in time. We are highly doubtful but we hope he’s right.To us, a proper Brexit, which would have made us a freer, richer country and was backed by a 17.4 million majority, has been given up without a fight.Remainer Tories MUST study the polls showing their party could now face an election wipeout as their core voters desert them.Their sliding ratings will go into freefall if they vote alongside Labour this month to keep us in an EU customs union ­— a total negation of Brexit.If Brexit is further watered down to meaninglessness, the Tories are finished.And Mrs May’s legacy will be to usher in our first Marxist Government, bringing economic destruction on a scale beyond anyone’s experience.And Mrs May will rubbish fears that proposals for a common rulebook with the EU for goods will restrict Britain’s ability to strike new trade deals.But her plea for unity is unlikely to stop furious Tory MPs from accusing her of betraying voters who backed Brexit.A string of influential Eurosceptics have vowed to submit letters of no confidence as early as tonight if Mrs May fails to convince them that her new blueprint delivers on the referendum result.The PM’s carefully-constructed Chequers peace deal was at risk of unravelling on Sunday.There is growing uncertainty over the future of Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson as Brexit Secretary David Davis resigned on Sunday night.The pair refused to back Mrs May more than 48 hours after she unveiled the deal.Mrs May has repeatedly preferred the counsel and ideas of her civil servant, EU advisor Olly Robbins, over his — a humiliation no senior elected politician should have to take.David Davis’s fervent Brexiteer deputy at the Department for Exiting the EU, Steve Baker, following him out of the door is also very significant, as it now resembles the beginning of a leadership coup. In the past eight months Theresa May has seen her FirstMinister, Defence Secretary, Home Secretary, Development Secretary and now Brexit Secretary all resign.Normally, Prime Ministers don’t survive that kind of severe and damaging blow to their political authorityCan this one? We will know by the end of this week.Allies of Mr Johnson defended his decision not to quit, saying it was “best to stay inside the tent fighting as there’s always the risk Brexit will get softer”.BoJo initially branded the soft Brexit plans “a big turd”. He joked that anyone defending them would be “polishing a turd” but later ditched his opposition and agreed to the proposals.Mr Davis rang the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier on Saturday night to talk him through the details of the deal before breaking his silence and resigning.Furious MPs have promised “robust exchanges” with Mrs May when they come face-to-face with her at a meeting of the Tory backbench 1922 committee tonight.Eurosceptic Andrea Jenkyns said she was “100 per cent” ready to sign a letter to party chiefs demanding a leadership contest if the PM’s proposals breach her previous Brexit red lines.Fellow Brexiteer Andrew Bridgen said he would also submit a letter of no confidence.He told The Sun: “I wouldn’t support this deal if the EU were paying us.”Ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said: “This is not what the British voted for.”And scores of MPs said they would vote down the final agreement if it mirrored the current Brexit package.One senior Tory reckoned that a no deal Brexit was now more likely, adding: “The Government has a serious question mark over getting this kind of deal through the Commons.”Michael Gove said Brexiteers had won a key concession from Cabinet Remainers to “step up” the Government’s no deal preparations that would allow Mrs May to “contemplate walking away” from negotiations with Brussels.The Environment Secretary, who led the Leave campaign but was the key power broker on Friday, escalated the Tory civil war by accusing hardline Brexiteers of “fake and mock outrage”.No10 also angered MPs by gagging them from speaking to the media until they’d been briefed by whips.Chief whip Julian Smith and the PM’s chief of staff Gavin Barwell held a frantic briefing session on Sunday and have scheduled a series of similar meetings throughout Monday to win over sceptical voices.A rival briefing paper put out by the leading pro-Brexit QC Martin Howe was circulated around Brexiteer MPs.On Sunday, before Mr Davis resignation, Mr Gove admitted that Mrs May’s Brexit plan wasn’t “everything you hope for”.But he told the Andrew Marr Show on BBC One: “I’m a realist and one of the things about politics is you mustn’t, you shouldn’t make the perfect the enemy of the good. One of the things about this compromise is that it unites the Cabinet.”He added: “What we have done is to make a balanced decision. For 80 per cent of the economy we’ll be outside the EU’s regulatory orbit . . . and that provides a perfect balance.”Eight per cent were left undecided.A separate poll for the Mail on Sunday found 38 per cent of the public viewed Mrs May’s new proposals as a “sell-out”.It found the Tories have lost their lead over Labour. Jeremy Corbyn’s party leapfrogged the Tories and now lead by 40-38 per cent.Last night a member of the Cabinet said the PM planned to offer a major concession on immigration  to win a deal with Brussels.The unamed minister told The Times: “They are clearly going to compromise further.”In another blow for the PM, leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg announced he would join Jeremy Corbyns Labour party in voting against Mrs Mays Brexit deal if it mirrored her current proposals.And in a ominous warning to Mrs May, he suggested other Tory Eurosceptics would follow suit, which would threaten to defeat the Governments slender majority.Writing in todays Daily  Mr Rees-Mogg branded Mrs Mays claims that her Brexit deal complies with her red lines misfounded.He wrote: If the proposals are as they currently appear I will vote against them and others may well do the same”.In a statement to MPs on Monday, Mrs May will try to sell her Brexit proposals by saying: “In the two years since the referendum result we have had a spirited national debate, with robust views echoing round the Cabinet table as they have on breakfast tables up and down our country.“Over that time, I have listened to every possible idea and every possible version of Brexit.

It is a White Flag.We will have a “Common Rule Book” — written by the EU and imposed by the European Court of Justice.These rules will torpedo any trade deal outside the EU. Immigration continues under a scheme which by any other name means free movement.This is not even Brexit In Name Only. It is zombie EU membership — and the UK is the zombie with no say in rule-making and paying through the nose for rule-taking.Of course, we need to be realistic.

They failed to force Mrs May when they had a chance to prepare for a No Deal Brexit.

It raises the most serious questions about the PMs ideas.Peter Bone welcomed Mr Daviss resignation, saying it was a principled and brave decision.The PMs proposals for a Brexit in name only are not acceptable, he said.Andrea Jenkyns said Mr Daviss departure was fantastic news and hailed Mr Baker as another courageous and principled MP.Letters calling for a leadership contest have reportedly been submitted to the backbench 1922 Committee by some Conservatives over the weekend.Mrs May is expected to use a Commons statemen ttoday to tell MPs that the strategy agreed on at Chequers is the right Brexit for Britain.She repeated her defence of her plans - insisting her blueprint would undoubtedly mean the returning of powers from Brussels.Labour called for the PM to quit herself following Mr Davis resignation.Leader Jeremy Corbyn said: David Davis resigning at such a crucial time shows Theresa May has no authority left and is incapable of delivering Brexit.With her Government in chaos, if she clings on, its clear shes more interested in hanging on for her own sake than serving the people of our country.Party chairman Ian Lavery Added: This is absolute chaos and Theresa May has no authority left.“The Prime Minister is in office but not in power. She cannot deliver Brexit and our country is at a complete standstill, while the Tories indulge in their leadership tussling.The New Customs Partnership which would see Britain collect tariffs on behalf of the EU was rejected outright by Brexiteers in the Cabinet.And trade experts warned that the technology needed to make Max Fac - a solution which replaces border controls with electronic monitoring - work wont be ready in time for Brexit.The third way is designed to bring a compromise on customs between the two systems.Britain would scrap the blanket tariffs applied by the EU on most goods coming in from outside Europe, and instead set its own import duties.That is essential in letting the UK strike new trade deals with the rest of the world, with goods coming in tariff-free from countries such as the US.But to enable big companies to continue using supply chains which span the whole of Europe, Britain will continue to apply EU tariffs on around 4 per cent of products - classified as unfinished goods.And European tariffs will also be put on goods which pass through Britains ports on their way to the EU, but never enter the domestic economy.Another measure which would tie the UK closely to the EU is Mrs Mays proposal for full regulatory alignment for goods.That means Britain would copy European regulations on what products can be sold in shops.Its intended to ensure goods can still be imported and exported freely, while avoiding curbs on the services sector which makes up most of our economy.But it could prove controversial because it may hinder trade deals with countries who have different standards for their goods.“We can’t go on like this. Britain needs a functioning Government.”Allies of Mr Davis said he decided to quit because he felt the PM’s proposals for a common rulebook with the EU and plans to keep Britain tied to 40 years of EU laws broke the Tory manifesto and Mrs May’s own red lines on leaving.Sarah O’Grady, wife of Mr Daviss chief of staff Stewart Jackson, said Mr Davis wanted to “honour manifesto promises to Britons”.She added: “DD decided he couldn’t sellout his own country.”Mr Daviss department - technically in charge of Brexit negotiations - had been kept in the dark over the PMs final Brexit blueprint that was presented to the Cabinet on Friday.He was understood only to have seen the plans at the same time as other Cabinet ministers on Thursday afternoon.He and Mr Johnson were furious at the PM for showing the proposals to German Chancellor Angela Merkel before them.Eight per cent were left undecided.A separate poll for the Mail on Sunday found 38 per cent of the public viewed Mrs May’s new proposals as a “sell-out”.It found the Tories have lost their lead over Labour. Jeremy Corbyn’s party leapfrogged the Tories and now lead by 40-38 per cent.In another blow for the PM, leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg announced he would join Jeremy Corbyns Labour party in voting against Mrs Mays Brexit deal if it mirrored her current proposals.And in a ominous warning to Mrs May, he suggested other Tory Eurosceptics would follow suit, which would threaten to defeat the Governments slender majority.Writing in todays Daily , Mr Rees-Mogg branded Mrs Mays claims that her Brexit deal complies with her red lines misfounded.He wrote: If the proposals are as they currently appear I will vote against them and others may well do the same”.Davis’s fervent Brexiteer deputy at the Department for Exiting the EU, Steve Baker, following him out of the door is also very significant, as it now resembles the beginning of a leadership coup.In the past eight months Theresa May  has seen her First Minister, Defence Secretary, Home Secretary, Development Secretary and now Brexit Secretary all resign.Normally, Prime Ministers don’t survive that kind of severe and damaging  blow to their political authority.Can this one? We will know by the end of this week.Mr Daviss resignation left Mays premiership seriously under threat - and sparked speculation over the future of Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.Boris initially branded the soft Brexit plans “a big turd” - but later ditched his opposition.One Tory MP said: “Boris has zero credibility if he stays now.”Up to a dozen backbenchers are reportedly prepared to put in letters to the 1922 Committee calling for a fresh leadership election.If the committees chairman Graham Brady receives 48 such letters, he will be forced to hold a vote of confidence in Mrs May.Mrs May is facing a crunch Commons showdown today with angry Tory MPs. She will say that the deal, agreed unanimously by the Cabinet, is the best for Britain.Mrs May will dismiss claims it breaches her Brexit red lines, telling MPs that the agreement will end freedom of movement, the jurisdiction of European Courts and vast sums of money going to Brussels.And she will rubbish fears that proposals for a common rulebook with the EU for goods will restrict Britain’s ability to strike new trade deals.A string of influential Eurosceptics have vowed to submit letters of no confidence if Mrs May fails to convince them.Furious MPs have promised “robust exchanges” with Mrs May when they come face-to-face with her at a meeting of the Tory backbench 1922 committee tonight.Eurosceptic Andrea Jenkyns said she was “100 per cent” ready to sign a letter to party chiefs demanding a leadership contest if the PM’s proposals breach her previous Brexit red lines.Fellow Brexiteer Andrew Bridgen said he would also submit a letter of no confidence. He told The Sun: “I wouldn’t support this deal if the EU were paying us.”And scores of MPs said they would vote down the agreement. One senior Tory reckoned a no deal Brexit was now more likely, adding: “The Government has a serious question mark over getting this kind of deal through the Commons.”Environment Secretary Michael Gove said Brexiteers had won a key concession to “step up” the Government’s no deal preparations that would allow Mrs May to “contemplate walking away”.Yesterday Mr Gove admitted the Brexit plan wasn’t “everything you hope for”.But he told the Andrew Marr Show on BBC One: “I’m a realist.”In a statement, Mrs May will say: “It is the Brexit that will deliver on the democratic decision of the British people.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT0004183985983.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sun says theresa may brexit marxism","story":"The Chequers compromise is bad enough — though we understand the necessity of this minority Government buying off the Remainers who dominate Parliament and who would kill Brexit entirely given the chance.But many Tory MPs and Leave voters already consider it a complete betrayal.

Brexiteer minister Michael Gove urged fellow Tory Eurosceptics to “get behind the Prime Minister” over the Chequers deal.  Foreign Secretary Mr Johnson backed the plan, despite saying that it was “like polishing a t**d”. But there was open warfare last night with dozens of Tory MPs plotting to oust Mrs May. A letter is circulating which accuses her of “capitulating” over the Brexit talks. And the resignation of Mr Davis will only pile the pressure on the PM on Monday. A briefing by QC Martin Howe said Mrs May\u0027s Brexit plan would lead to a “worst-of-all worlds ‘Black Hole’ Brexit where the UK is stuck permanently as a vassal state”.  Brexit Chequers summit explained - your guide to the Cabinet showdown that will make or break Theresa May  It takes just 48 MPs’ votes to trigger a vote of no-confidence in Mrs May. Former Labour minister Lord Mandelson said on BBC’s The Sunday Politics: “The Government has, simply, got itself up sh** creek. Without a paddle.” However, Conservative MP Andrea Jenkyns, who quit a junior government role earlier this year to fight for Brexit and has threatened to vote against Theresa May\u0027s plans for exiting the European Union, tweeted her approval of Mr Davis\u0027 resignation. Fantastic news. Well done David Davis for having the principal and guts to resign. I take my hat off to you. We need to make sure this is now a game changer for \u0026poundBrexit. Careless May loses so many ministers since snap election   Prime Minister Theresa May has faced a series of Cabinet members leaving their positions since the snap election last June. The first to leave was defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon, who resigned his post after being caught up in Westminster sleaze allegations. He said his behaviour had fallen below the high standards required after he admitted putting his hand on the knee of radio presenter Julia Hartley-Brewer some years ago when he resigned on November 1. One week later, Priti Patel quit as international development secretary over undisclosed and unauthorised meetings in Israel, including with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  In her resignation letter, she echoed the words of Sir Michael, saying her actions fell below the high standards expected. The following month, Ms May\u0027s deputy Damian Green left the Cabinet after a probe found he made inaccurate and misleading statements about pornography on his computer. Justine Greening was sacked in the PM\u0027s reshuffle in January after refusing to move from her education post to the Department for Work and Pensions.

His resignation is a major blow to Prime Minister Theresa May and comes after he signed up to the Brexit plan agreed by the Cabinet at Chequers on Friday.  He was understood to have serious reservations about both the plan and whether it could be acceptable to Brussels. Here is a look at the career of the long-standing Eurosceptic, 69, who readily admitted to having been branded a charming bastard. Mr Davis was elected for Haltemprice and Howden in 1997, having originally sat for Boothferry since 1987. He read molecular science at Warwick University and studied management at Harvard after shining at grammar school.  The married father-of-three first honed his negotiating skills in the cut-throat world of big business. He enjoyed corporate success in his thirties as a director of Tate and Lyle and President of Zymaize, a loss-making Canadian sweetener manufacturer which he turned into a gold mine. Mr Davis became politically active as a student, cutting an imposing figure even then as chairman of the Federation of Conservative Students. A man with brawn as well as brains, he served as an SAS reservist to help fund himself through college, before entering Parliament in 1987. He had a tough upbringing by a single mother in a Labour working-class household in south London, and still bears the scar on his upper lip from a crowbar attack in Brixton. The two-time unsuccessful Conservative leadership contender gained a fearsome reputation after taking a series of ministerial scalps in a previous role of shadow home secretary. Among those he claims as his victims are former home secretaries David Blunkett and Charles Clarke and ex-home office minister Beverley Hughes.  In June 2008, as shadow home secretary, he shocked Westminster by announcing that he was resigning as an MP to take a stand against the terror detention plan, sparking a by-election that saw him hold his Haltemprice and Howden seat. He was regarded by many as the likely next Tory leader after Michael Howard announced he was to resign, but after a weak campaign - in his second tilt at the leadership - he was soundly beaten in 2005.  His rival, David Cameron , had caught the mood with his careful presentation and youthful optimism.  In the 2001 leadership contest, Mr Davis cut his losses and quit after twice finishing way down the pack in early ballots of Tory MPs, throwing his support behind Iain Duncan Smith. The contest successfully raised his profile and Mr Duncan Smith appointed him party chairman.

Maureen Horton started out as a mental health nurse in 1969 and still cares for people in the community. She retired in 1997 but only lasted a week before she was begging to return to the job she loves. Maureen still works 20 hours a week and in a typical shift treats around eight to 10 patients. She does blood pressure checks, ear syringing, wound dressings and catheter care, and supports patients and families with palliative care. Maureen, from Sheffield, South Yorks, said: “I retired from full-time nursing at 60, had a nice week off and then I thought ‘What will I do now?’.  “So I took up a community bank nursing opportunity and I have been doing it ever since.” The NHS was launched on July 5, 1948 and Maureen, born in 1937, started her career as a nurse 21 years later. She has been in the job she loves for nearly 50 years and is currently doing community shifts for Sheffield Teaching Hospitals. And there are no plans for a second stab at retirement. Maureen said: “I just like being out in the community and visiting people and helping them in their recovery. “I am given a list of patients to visit and I go and get the job done. “Patients know me but I don’t usually tell them my age. Sometimes my colleagues will ask them ‘Do you know how old she is?’ and they can’t believe it. “When I see patients the same age as me who are quite frail or poorly, I just try to encourage them. Not everyone is as lucky as I have been with my health.” Maureen applied to become a state-enrolled nurse after spotting an advert in her local paper. She trained at Nether Edge Hospital and the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield, qualifying in 1972.  Maureen still has mandatory training and study days to keep her skills and knowledge up to date. She added: “I don’t like sitting about, I have to get out and do something. “Sometimes I say to my family, ‘I will probably finish this year’ but they say, ‘We know you won’t be able to sit still’. “My husband, Edward, encourages me. I think he likes having the house to himself so he can watch the cricket. “I take it each month at a time as I keep going. At the moment I feel good.” One of the main changes Maureen has had to get used to during her long career is the introduction of new technology. When she started out, she made written notes on patients. She had never used a computer until they were \u0026shyintroduced by community services. She said: “Doing this job was the first time I had ever used a computer and it was a bit overwhelming at first.

Otterhounds were originally bred, as their name suggests, to hunt otters, but they have been dying out since the practice was banned in 1978. Britain’s Otterhound Club is now appealing for prospective dog owners to choose an Otterhound and protect the breed’s future. They’re rarer than giant pandas or white rhino, with fewer than 1,000 worldwide and 300 in Britain. Will Lazenby is a vet from Coylton in Ayrshire and member of the Otterhound members club.  He says the hunting dogs, which were popular in the Borders for hundreds of years, are the perfect pet. “French bulldogs, pugs and Labradors are usually at the top of the lists of the most popular dogs,” he said. “These are good breeds but people don’t consider these wonderful dogs. “It’s sad as they were considered useful dogs for many, but they’re also excellent pets.” King John of England used the animals to hunt otters in the 12th Century, with Elizabeth I becoming the first Lady Master of Otterhounds. They’re known as the Amiable Hound, or the Clown of Hounds, for their gentle and playful nature. The breed that we recognise today dates back to the 18th Century, and their popularity peaked in the middle of the 19th Century.  “They’re not a rich or a posh person’s dog, though,” said Will. “Otterhounds were seen as a working class dog. They were said to help rid the village ponds of otters feeding on fish. “Dog owners would take Otterhounds to hunt otters, and lots of family and friends would go along too. “It became an event, people would take picnics and make a day of it. “To me it would be very sad if an historic breed like the Otterhound was to die out.” The breed was blamed, though, for a shortage in otter numbers, and laws banning otter hunts were passed in Scotland in 1979 - although the dogs were unlikely to have been to blame. Judith Ashworth is a co-ordinator of the Otterhound Club and has kept them for 35 years.  “They were popular dogs among the hunting community, because otters were considered vermin,” she said. “The decline of otter populations was blamed on Otterhounds and hunting of them was banned — but it turned out to be nitrates and poisons used on the land which was seeping into rivers. “Otterhounds got the blame and they became greatly reduced after that.” Will has urged dog lovers to consider the breed in future, saying they’re the perfect family pet. “You read a lot of rubbish on the internet about Otterhounds being boisterous and needing a lot of exercise, and that they need to live in the country,” Will explained.

The campaigners - reportedly from a group called \u0027Get The L Out!\u0027 - carried banners which said \u0027transactivism erases lesbians\u0027 ahead of the 30,000 strong parade on Saturday. PinkNews filmed the group of \u0027radical feminist campaigners\u0027 forcing their way into the front. Today, Pride in London admitted it had allowed the anti-trans group to lead the march due to safety and hot weather, but has since been forced to apologise. Now a transgender woman has launched a petition - signed by more than 1,200 people - calling on the organisers to stand down. The open letter from Aimee Challenor, 20, from Coventry, said permitting the protesters to lead the march was horrific exclusionary behaviour.  Speaking today, she said: I started the open letter because I wanted to help make a difference so that it wouldn\u0027t happen again, but I knew I was just one voice out a very large community, and so rather than just trying to be one small voice, I put together this open letter so that we could have a big collective voice as our community, and it\u0027s taken off with so many supporters. I was at Pride yesterday, I know transphobia goes against everything that Pride is about, so it\u0027s important to call it out. It’s great to see so much support for this letter condemning transphobia. Pride in London were wrong to allow transphobia to be at the lead of the parade on Saturday, and clearly many members and friends of the LGBTQ+ community agree. I hope now Pride in London will make a full apology, and will allow new people to take the reins, so that we do not see a repeat of the horrific transphobia.  The organisers initially said the parade start had gone as planned before later admitting it had allowed the anti-trans group to lead the march due to hot weather and in the interest of the safety. Aimee launched her petition today and at 4pm it had attracted 1,200 signatures, including Andrew Jones, festival director of Pride in London in 2013. Pride in London has now been forced to apologise and said members reject what this group stands for but said it could not forcibly remove the group as it wasn\u0027t a criminal offence. A spokesperson claimed the group demanded to march behind the rainbow flag, but organisers moved them to an area far in front of the official parade start to separate them. They added: We are distraught by the messages and the hurt that has been caused and we held an urgent meeting with the Community Advisory Board this morning.  The protest group showed a level of bigotry, ignorance and hate that is unacceptable. We reject what this group stands for. They do not share our values, which are about inclusion and respect and support for the most marginalised parts of our community. We are proud of our trans volunteers, proud of the trans groups that are in our parade, proud of our trans speakers at events and proud of the trans people who take part in our campaigns and proud of those who cheered even louder for them yesterday. As volunteers, we are shocked and appalled by this behaviour, not least because some felt threatened by the protesters. London Pride is also going to be reviewing what happened with the Greater London Authority, the politan Police, Westminster City Council and TfL.

Luke Gillman, 25, severely injured a female driver in Trafford when he shot out of a side road and ploughed into her car in September last year. Police said the victim, who is in her 40s, was extremely lucky to survive after she suffered broken ribs, fluid around the heart, whiplash, and severe bruising in the smash in Talbot Road, Stretford. She was in hospital for several days, has also been left with post traumatic stress disorder and has been unable to return to work.  Gillman, who is originally from Leigh, was only on a provisional license and had no insurance at the time of the crash. He was almost twice the legal drink drive limit - with 144 milligrammes of alcohol in 100 millllitres of blood - and had traces of cocaine and cannabis in his system. The Citroen Xsara he was driving did not belong to him.  He failed to appear in court after being charged with a string of driving offences and fled to an address in Shropshire, the Manchester Evening News reported .  The victim spotted him going into his mother\u0027s house in Stretford a few months later and alerted the police, who arrested him.  Gillman has now been jailed for a year and banned from driving for 42 months, after he pleaded guilty to dangerous driving, drink driving, having no insurance and no full license, and admitting failing to stop in relation to another incident earlier in the evening. The victim had been driving home at 2.15am on September 16 after giving a lift to a reliative. In a statement to police she said: “As I drew level with the junction with Milton Road on my left I saw headlights of a vehicle very close to the side of my car. Before I had time to react the vehicle collided with my passenger side and sent my car spinning across the road. I was trapped upside down. “I was taken to hospital where I was treated for four days and had a precardial effusion which corrected itself, and severe whiplash injuires to my back, neck, and shoulders.” She was in discomfort and pain for ten weeks due to severe bruising from her seatbelt. In an impact statement submitted to court she said: “Since the collision I am now a very nervous driver and even when I am walking I am jumpy. I have had several panic attacks and have been taking anti-depressants.”  She is still having physiotherapy to realign her spine, which was twisted in the crash. “This has had a massive impact on my home life as well as having to find extra money for treatment.”, she added. “I think the hardest thing was the impact this had on my children.  My 10-year-old son has been very upset in school prompting teachers to contact me as he had told the teachers he thought I might die. “My husband had to take time off work to help with the family, I could not even dress myself or bathe myself never mind look after the children as well. “I have been off work since the collision and have been told that I might not be able to return to the same job as result of my injuries, as the job I do is quite physical and I will not be able to do the lifting which is required.” "},{"url":null,"title":"first pictures 14 year old","story":"NewsFirst pictures of 14-year-old schoolgirl Shakira Pellow who died after taking \u0027unknown substance\u0027Three other teenagers are still in hospital after Shakira collapsed and died in Cornwall\u0026nbspShareByPippa Allen-Kinross15:41, 8 JUL 2018Updated16:02, 8 JUL 2018NewsShakira collapsed in a park on Friday (Image: Facebook)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA 14-year-old girl who died after taking an \u0027unknown substance\u0027 has been named as Shakira Pellow.

Already faced with prices soaring by more than \u0026pound1,000 during the school holiday peak, lone parents say the \u0026shyadditional hike can make it impossible to take their children away. And operators such as Jet 2, Tui and First Choice can make the problem worse – as offers of free child places only apply if two paying adults travel with them. Single parent groups say the policy is “unfair” and “out of touch”. We found a one week all-inclusive stay at Bulgaria’s SuneoClub Odessos, \u0026shyflying from Manchester on July 27, costs \u0026pound1,572 for two adults with a free child’s place via First Choice.  But for just one adult and one child, the price is exactly the same. When selecting one adult, the ad for free child places disappears from the site. Airtours offers “child prices” for some hotels – but only when sharing a room with at least two adults paying full price. Thomas Cook Holidays has the same pricing policy. And because the firms do not count children in the room rate, a single parent can be charged an under-occupancy supplement. But it is not just accommodation – other firms also hit single parents with increased fares. A First Choice holiday to the Holiday Village Rhodes for seven nights cost an extra \u0026pound515 per person for a single adult with one child.

Ellie Chessell, 29, has told how she thought she was about to die as she stood screaming in the street, with her body burning “like a bonfire”. Her ex-lover Claudio Gouveia, 35, was jailed last month for 12 years for her attempted murder in 2017. Accomplice Edmundo Fonseca, 44, was jailed for nine years last Friday. He was paid just a few grammes of cocaine to throw acid over Ellie near the hotel she worked in on the Algarve in Portugal. He lured her out of the hotel after arranging a dinner date over Tinder and posing as a businessman.  Ellie had no idea it was a fake date set up by her deranged ex. They had split up two months earlier. He still had her laptop and old phone and had hacked into them to access all her emails and social media accounts to trace her every step. She said: “I saw this man dressed in black and I thought, ‘Bloody hell, he’s odd’. “He was sat down on a bench and his leg was shaking up and down. “The next second I hear ‘desculpe!’ [Portuguese for sorry] and he threw liquid all over me.  “In a split second I realised it was acid and I knew straight away it was him [Gouveia]. “I started screaming and told my friend to help, telling her: \u0027It’s acid. He’s set me up!’ “I felt like I was on fire. The burning was unbearable. “I whipped off my blazer because I could see my dress was melting, it was sticking to me so I threw it to the floor. “And then I just started spitting because I could taste it. I could just see my skin dripping to the floor, dripping on to the pavement.”  She believes Gouveia drove by slowly after the attack – “real blas\u0026eacute” – but did not stop. Ellie was finally helped by a taxi driver with a female British passenger. “The woman wound down her window and was speaking to me trying to calm me down as the driver rang the police and ambulance. “The driver’s window was only open slightly and he said he could feel the heat coming off me on his face. “He said it was like ‘a full-blown bonfire’.” Two police officers who attended were sick nearby after inhaling the fumes and later taken to hospital. The pavement where Ellie was struck was bleached white and even a hedge where he flung the bottle burned. “I’ve never felt pain like it. I thought I was going to die. It was unbearable. I could taste it on my tongue and that was worrying me,” she said.  Ellie ended up in the intensive care burns unit in Lisbon in a glass room to protect her from infection. She had second and third degree burns to her face, chest, both arms, stomach and legs. The next morning she was given a mobile in a sealed plastic bag to phone her mum in the Isle of Wight. “I said ‘Mum, now don’t worry because I’m all right. But that b***ard’s got me!’” Her mum Diana Newman, 60, who flew out to be by Ellie’s side, said: “I wasn’t able to hug her or kiss her or even touch her. It was heartbreaking. “She was covered in bandages like a mummy. We touched hands through the glass and we were both crying.” It was the start of a month’s intensive treatment in hospital for Ellie who was too scared to look under her bandages. “It was yucky, my skin was still being eaten and they put my arms in a bleach solution,” Ellie recalled. Ellie finally broke down when they shaved her head to get a skin graft. “I was in tears and the nurse was in tears, it is what finally broke me. He’d finally taken away my identity.”  Gouveia had been trying to break her for much of their relationship. They met a week after Ellie started as a tour rep on his home island of Madeira in 2015. Within months she was banned from going out alone or contacting her parents in the UK. He started messaging her up to 100 times a day. “I started feeling a bit panicky if I didn’t reply. I felt I was on my knees apologising for everything.” The first time he turned violent was after they visited his relatives and he stormed off after drinking for hours. “When he got home he was spitting and effing and jeffing. It was like he was a monster, smashing things, screaming and spitting, it was grim. “He pinned me up against the bathroom wall around the throat. I had a full-on hand print across my neck.” A month later, Gouveia erupted in violence again, splitting her head open after a night out. Ellie had three stitches in hospital. The police were called but said it was her word against his. She never saw him again and relocated to mainland Portugal. But what Ellie did not know was he had kept her laptop and knew all her passwords and tracked her movements for the next two months.  Ellie, now back home with her mum in the Isle of Wight, told how her terror continued in hospital. “When I opened the message in hospital I felt sick,” said Ellie, who is in counselling for post-traumatic stress. “I thought to myself, ‘He’s not going to stop’. He’s a little terrorist.” Fellow acid attack victim Katie Piper helped her get counselling and laser treatment after the tour rep’s brother, Ryan Chessell got in touch.  Ellie said: “I had been struggling to get help from the NHS. When Katie got involved things started moving.” Now the long journey to get back to normal begins. Ellie said: “I’d love to work as a tour rep but at the moment I lack concentration. I sleep too much, I eat too much...but I want to go back and do something I enjoy.” Evil ex sent naked pic to Ellie\u0027s teen brother Deranged ex Claudio Gouveia sent hundreds of menacing messages and naked photos of Ellie to relatives – including her little brother and his teenage friends. He spent two months spying on Ellie after they’d split by hacking into her social media accounts. Just 24 hours after the acid attack, he sneered: “I am looking forward to our next encounter...” Ellie said about the message: “I felt sick, but we all decided as a family not to respond. “He had dozens of different email addresses and sent hundreds of emails to me. He sent Instagrams. He created fake accounts on Facebook.” "},{"url":null,"title":"how keep your kids cool","story":"AdvertorialHow to keep your kids cool during the heatwave: 9 products which can help protect your little onesIce, ice baby.

Here are our tips for keeping comfortable and safe in this glorious weather. Now get out there and enjoy! Hydrate early, hydrate often    Your body is two-thirds water and you need to keep it topped up. If you don\u0027t you\u0027ll get headaches and may also be more tired than usual. Hydration is, as most things are, even more important for little ones. According to the British Nutrition Foundation children are less heat tolerant than adults and have a higher percentage of water in their bodies. They\u0027re also tricky little monkeys who rarely remember to drink unless reminded. The key then, is going to be making it fun to grab a drink. If you have an outdoor power socket in your garden then connect up the Halfords 40 Litre Coolbox, \u0026pound85 (was \u0026pound110, save \u0026pound25) and fill it with drinks. That way your kids can get their own chilled drink - they\u0027ll love this. You can just as easily put the coolbox inside if you don\u0027t have an outdoor power outlet. Alternatively, if you If you are planning to be out and about, you can also charge the cooler from your car\u0027s 12v power outlet. Make staying hydrated even more fun for the kids with a set of plastic Rainbow Tumblers, \u0026pound3 (half price).  Be skin-savvy Being outside in the sunshine is enjoyable, but its UV rays can do lasting damage to your skin. Applying a high SPF sun cream is vital - but it\u0027s also best to avoid exposing your skin to direct sun for prolonged periods, especially between midday and 3pm, when the sun is strongest. This is especially important for kids. So with a cloudless, beautiful summer sky you\u0027re going to need to create some shade. If you\u0027re at the beach, then a dedicated shelter will help. Halfords\u0027 Beach Shelter offers a 30+ UV protection. If you\u0027re spending most of the day out in the garden and the kids are in and out of the paddling pool, you may need more protection. The Halfords 300 Gazebo costs just \u0026pound69 ( was \u0026pound90, save \u0026pound21) and has a UV 50+ rating.  When choosing a gazebo or shelter for the sunny weather it\u0027s worth understanding those UV protection numbers. With a 50+ rating the gazebo should stop around 97 to 98 per cent of the UV radiation from the sun. This, combined with sun cream will help keep you all much safer. With any gazebo you might also want to consider some weights to go along with it. Just because it\u0027s sunny, doesn\u0027t mean it can\u0027t also be a bit blowy out! Baby, it\u0027s hot outside The hot weather can feel uncomfortable for adults, but it\u0027s particularly important to keep babies in the shade - as they are less able to sweat to cool down and their skin is very sensitive. So it\u0027s worth investing in a stroller or pram with a decent sun visor if you are taking your little one out and about in the sun.  The Joie Mirus Scenic Stroller, \u0026pound120, is an affordable modern stroller which comes with a SPF 50+ sun canopy. (It can also be paired with either the Joie Gemm or Joie Juva Infant Car Seat, to create a travel system, with no adapter needed.)  For playing in the garden or trips to the beach, grab the Halfords Infant Playshade, \u0026pound25. It pops up and down in less than 10 seconds and is made from specially tested material that provides a 50+ UV protection factor. Stay cool in the car  It\u0027s fair to say we love most things about summer, but getting into a hot car on a sweltering day isn\u0027t one of them. Did you know your air conditioning loses charge every year, making it less efficient and making your car warmer? Halfords now offers a FREE Air Con Check, to check your refrigerant levels and see if they need to be topped up for optimal performance. If they do need topping up, you can purchase air con essentials from store to recharge at home or, you can book in for an air con recharge service and Halfords can take care of it for you. You can also keep out the worst of the heat by investing in a windscreen shield to reflect the sun\u0027s glare. The Halfords All Weather Windscreen Shield is just \u0026pound7.99 - and when winter eventually does roll around, you can also use it to protect against the build up of snow and frost.

A colossal \u0026pound10 billion worth of badly performing SIPPs - Self Invested Personal Pensions - are believed to have been mis-sold to hundreds of thousands of Brits by unscrupulous financial advisors. Now potential victims are being urged to check if they can reclaim huge portions of their lost cash and the government has set up a special \u0026pound120 million fund to compensate losers so far. A maximum \u0026pound50,000 compensation sum is currently available from the large fund managed by The Financial Service Compensation Scheme and the figure is set to rise by 75 per cent to a \u0026pound85,000 maximum in the next nine months as claims grow. However industry figures such as pension expert Zoe Pearson warn that the true cost of mis-sold pensions is closer to \u0026pound10 billion and will sweep the country like the current phenomenon of PPI claims that has gripped the nation over the past few years.  Read more: Taxed to death: The astonishing amount of income tax people pay decades after leaving work for the last time Miss Pearson, who heads the country’s all female team of claim specialists Pension Claim Consulting Ltd , told : “Thousands upon thousands of people are unaware they’ve been mis-sold SIPPS. Unless you know what to look for it’s difficult to know what a mis-sale is although quite often when people realise they’ve been mis-sold to, they’re too embarrassed to take action. “However, the financial services industry has firm rules, so any mis-sale should be pursued. “Even basic calculations give you an idea of the true scale of this scandal. Average compensation for mis-sales sit at around \u0026pound25,000 for private pensions and \u0026pound50,000 for final salary pensions so the total figure for the mis-sales of SIPPs is going to be around the \u0026pound10bn mark. “In fact if this was brought to the forefront and the government advised people to check the status of their pensions that might even be an underestimation. The government needs to launch an investigation to unearth the true amount.” Labour MP Frank Field has hit out at the SIPP conmen and vowed to bring the industry into line whilst industry experts reveal the true figure of mis-selling is growing at an unprecedented rate and the true loss of mis-selling will run into billions as the number of victims rocket.  Shocking 30.4million Brits face disappointment when they finally get to stop working - the plan to fix it The Financial Ombudsman however are allowed to raise their compensation ceiling and can award up to a further maximum of \u0026pound150,000 for many cases. The SIPP scams involved unscrupulous Financial Advisors preying on savers who were promised massive returns of up to 20 per cent a year only for their savings to be squandered on get rich quick schemes including investing in airport parking, holiday properties and green energy projects. The Financial Conduct Authority revealed one in eight savers think an advisor has mis-sold them a financial product such as a pension. The FCA advise people who think they have been mis-sold a pension to raise a complaint as soon as possible as there are time-limits in place which could affect the outcome of your claim. Their report called the Financial Lives Survey was widely praised by industry experts who believe that the government have underestimated the scale of mis-sold pensions such as SIPPs however the Commons Work and Pensions Committee have demanded tighter safeguards to protect savers. Committee Chairman Frank Field MP said: “I am concerned about the role of SIPPs as platforms that help funnel unwitting clients’ pension savings into dodgy and inappropriate investments. SIPPs are happy to skim off their fee on the way but there are serious questions about their commitment to due diligence and consumer protection. “When an unscrupulous financial advisor channels a victim’s money through a SIPP into an investment that then collapses, it is not enough for the SIPP provider to shrug their shoulders and say ‘caveat emptor’. “I will be writing to the FCA to ask what they are doing to ensure SIPPS are not acting as handmaidens to the pension-snatchers.” "},{"url":null,"title":"primary school bans floss dance","story":"NewsPrimary school bans Floss Dance after pupils use it to \"intimidate\" classmatesHeadmistress in Devon takes firm action on viral dance craze that became a kill celebration in popular video game Fortnite\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAmy-Clare Martin17:57, 8 JUL 2018NewsThe viral Floss Dance craze has been weeded out of one primary school due to its link to video game violence (Image: Internet Unknown)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA primary school has banned the floss dance featured in popular video game Fortnite - after teachers said pupils are using it to intimidate classmates.

Thousands of products – including pasta, biscuits, crisps and cake bars – past their “best before” dates are being snapped up at bargain prices. The new service is operated by Fultons Foods, which hopes it will reduce the amount of perfectly usable produce that gets binned. An astonishing seven million tonnes of food is thrown away in the UK every year, of which three-\u0026shyquarters, or five million tonnes, could still have been safely eaten. Family-run Fultons, which is based in Barnsley, South Yorks, operates 100 stores in the Midlands and North. It sells surplus stock direct from manufacturers at “significantly” lower prices than supermarkets.  The firm’s Karen Gunter said: “An increasing number of UK householders are saving hundreds of pounds by taking advantage of the reality of best before dates. These products are perfectly fine to eat.” “Best before” is a manufacturer’s indication that an item may not be as good quality, but it is not unsafe. Bargains include roast chicken and pasta Mug Shot down from 84p to 29p, Galaxy cake bars down from \u0026pound1 to 79p, bottles of 7 Up lemonade down from \u0026pound1.10 to 59p, and Golden Wonder salt and vinegar crisps from 79p to 50p.  Deliveries, which are made by couriers, are free for groceries costing \u0026pound30 or over. Online retailer Approved Food runs a similar scheme offering 2,000 items near or past “best before” dates.

But the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the rest of the gang are now getting ready for the next big occasion - Prince Louis\u0027 christening . The latest royal baby has been kept out of the spotlight since he was born on April 23. We got a quick look at the fifth in line to the throne as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge took him home from the Lindo Wing at St Mary\u0027s Hospital in central London. But his christening will be the first time we\u0027ve seen him in public since. Here\u0027s everything you need to know about the christening.... When is Prince Louis\u0027 christening taking place? The date to pop in your diary is Monday, July 9. Kensington Palace has confirmed the service will begin at 4pm and last approximately 40 minutes. Where is Prince Louis being christened? The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, will lead service, which will be held at The Chapel Royal in St James’s Palace. Louis\u0027 brother George was christened at the Chapel Royal in 2013, while sister Charlotte was christened at the Church of St Mary Magdalene in Norfolk in 2015.  Why is July 9 important to the Queen? Go back 71 years and July 9 is the date her majesty, who was then Princess Elizabeth, announced she was engaged to Philip Mountbatten. Even though they were privately engaged for a year before, they didn\u0027t make it public until July 9, 1947. They made the announcement at Buckingham Palace. As is traditional in the royal family, they also released an official photo to mark the occassion. It shows Elizabeth sitting on a chair with Philip sitting on the arm, and they are staring into each others eyes looking very much in love.  The couple married later that year at Westminster Abbey and became the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh. As we all remember from Prince William and Harry\u0027s engagement announcements, it\u0027s a big day for any royal so it\u0027s probably still a special day for the Queen. Her majesty is due to attended to attend Louis\u0027s christening, and it\u0027s expected that Prince Philip will be by her side despite retiring from royal duties last year.  What will Louis wear for the christening? Louis will wear a replica of the silk and lace christening gown worn by royal babies since 1841. The original was commissioned by Queen Victoria for her daughter Victoria, and was made of delicate silk and Honiton lace. But after the christening of Prince Edward\u0027s daughter Louise in 2004 it was decided that the original gown was too delicate to be worn. The Queen\u0027s dressmaker Angela Kelly made a replica which was debuted on Louise\u0027s younger brother James in 2008. The same gown was worn by Prince George and Princess Charlotte at their christenings.  Who are the godparents likely to be? Royals typically choose loads of godparents, and it is usually made up of other royals and members of the aristocracy. Louis\u0027 dad Prince William had six godparent - including former King of Greece Constantine II and Princess Alexandra, the Queen’s cousin. Prince George has seven godparents, including Earl Grosvenor, who is one of the wealthiest men on the country and another member of the Royal family, Zara Tindall. As for Louis, nothing has been announced yet, but the bookies have a few favourites for his godparents.  Tiggy Pettifer, Prince William and Prince Harry\u0027s former nanny, leads the pack - with Ladbrokes offering odds of 2/1. William\u0027s outgoing private secretary Miguel Head is another favourite, with odds of 5/4.  Why Meghan Markle won\u0027t be godmother The Royals follow a pattern of choosing close friends and even former members of staff rather than family. Meghan, obviously falls in the latter. When will Prince Louis\u0027 official photos be released? Princess Charlotte\u0027s official photos were released the Thursday after her christening, so expect to wait a few days.  How was the christening announced? Just as they did with George and Charlotte, the royal family announced the details of the christening on Twitter. The statement said: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are pleased to announce that the christening of Prince Louis will take place on Monday 9th July at The Chapel Royal, St James’s Palace, London. Prince Louis will be christened by The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby.   Little Louis was born in the private Lindo Wing of St Mary\u0027s Hospital in Paddington on April 23. Just seven hours after he arrived Kate and Wills showed off their new arrival to the world on the hospital steps. Why Princess Charlotte\u0027s christening was in a different place Instead of Chapel Royal, Charlotte was baptised at the Church of St Mary Magdalene at Sandringham in July 2015. The change wasn\u0027t due to her gender, or her ranking, it was thought to be due to the church\u0027s proximity to the family\u0027s new home in Norfolk.

Dundee paid the price for that gamble by failing to get out of a group they had been expected to win comfortably and, ultimately, it was a factor in Hartley losing his job.Under McCann, the policy has been that the Betfred is an important event and it’s first game, not the league kick-off next month, marks the start of the season proper. That’s fine by his vice-captain.“I personally came back feeling really fit and I think as you’ve seen the rest of the boys look really fit as well,” he said.“You can kind of gauge first day back when we do a lot of testing. Everyone is a bit anxious because eyes are on you but this has been the fittest group of boys I’ve seen.“Everyone has a sharpness about them. I don’t know if it’s the modern game and the demands there are on you but everyone has been bang at it.“For me the Betfred two years ago gave me a shock. I remember speaking about it. That season we were straight into the competitive games and you are expected to win them but it doesn’t go that way because that’s football and you have to be ready.“That’s why to get the couple of games we’ve had has been massive and to get away (to Portugal), do some training and have another couple of games is massive as well.”Dundee are now in the Algarve where they’ll do more work and face SC Farense on Tuesday. Kerr’s sure that’ll have them ready for the Betfred tie at Stirling Albion Saturday week.“I enjoy being away. I’ve been to Hungary twice and Austria during pre-season and it’s good for the team.“You get to know the new boys who’ve come because you are together all the time and that’s important. We’re doing two sessions a day, eating meals together and spending time together at night as well.“That’s important because when you have new team-mates you can’t just go out on a pitch and gel right away. It takes work and time.”With the cup games looming large, Kerr feels the time away is also a chance to prepare properly.“We’re back in the middle of next week and then right into the first tie on the Saturday, so we can do a bit of work for that as well as the general stuff we’ve been doing.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b335b8da880a.jpg ","title":"donkey joins in celebrations as dundee woman sandra turns 50","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBirthday girl Sandra McIntosh had an unusual visitor on her special day in the shape of Donkey Bond, a miniature donkey.Sandra, from Downfield, turned 50 and was delighted by the visit from the cute donkey who lives with owner Alison Wiseman at Balnuith Farm, Tealing.The surprise was arranged by Sandra’s fiance Scott Findlay and their friend Nicky Millen.Shocked Sandra said: \u0026#8220You don’t expect to open your door and a donkey to be there, do you?“Maybe flowers or chocolates but I would never have imagined Donkey Bond would be there.“He was so cute.

made Dundee a must-visit destination.“It also demonstrates what can be achieved when our countries work together, with renowned award-winning Japanese architects Kengo Kuma and Associates designing the stunning building in one of Scotland’s vibrant cities.”The V\u0026ampA is expected to attract 350,000 visitors each year.It is the first V\u0026ampA museum to be created outside London.The museum design was inspired by Mr Kuma’s travels around Scotland and follows strong historical links between Japan and Scotland.It has been hailed as a “perfect illustration” of the cultural links between the two countries.Visit Scotland senior marketing manager Christina Burns said: “V\u0026ampA Dundee will create an unmissable cultural highlight and will build on the strong links between Scotland and Japan, encouraging more visits to and from one another’s countries.“Our aim is to extend our famous warm welcome to even more Japanese visitors now and in the years to come.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/fleming-collage-940x564.jpg ","title":"dundee icons reimagined among a number of cool scots by city designer","story":"\t\t\t\t\tTwo of Dundee’s most influential exports have been immortalised in a new book of art work.Renowned astronomer Williamina Fleming and ex-Associates lead singer Billy Mackenzie feature prominently in Cool Scots – a new book by city designer Greg Moodie.From Robert Burns and Kenny Dalglish to Flora MacDonald and Muriel Spark, the book showcases some of Scotland’s most important figures in colourful digital portraits.And Dundonians will be able to see the work up close and personal at a special launch event at The Butterfly Cafe in Commercial Street on Saturday July 28.Greg, originally from Maryfield, said he wanted to give a new focus to some of the country’s unsung heroes.The 55-year-old said he was particularly fascinated to research Fleming’s story and bring new life to her image.He added: “The whole project started off after I did a mural of Robert Burns for a bar.“I think the landlord almost passed out at how psychadelic he was looking so I thought there would be something in it for a series of portraits.“Essentially, my aim is to make these figures look timeless.“It was fairly tricky trying to find a gender balance at first but I managed to discover 22 women whose achievements many people might not be aware of.“One of them was the Dundonian Williamina Fleming and my folks, who have lived in Dundee all their days, had no idea who she was.“I remember when I was asking for suggestions that a lot of Americans were telling me I should definitely feature her.“She spent most of her time in America and did some amazing astronomical work so this project has been a big learning experience for me.”Earlier this year, Stobswell singer-songwriter Mackenzie was honoured with a stunning portrait in his home area by artist Garry Milne as part of OpenClose Dundee.Other figures featured in the book include telephone inventor Alexander Graham Bell using a mobile with a selfie stick featuring in the background, as well as Robert Louis Stevenson – who is portrayed on the front cover.Former Duncan of Jordanstone student Greg added: “Singer-songwriter Billy Mackenzie was a big part of the city.“I think people who come and see the work will be surprised by some of the achievements. I was taken aback by some of them myself.“It’s stuff like the first woman doctor and the first woman to be allowed to attend university that people aren’t entirely aware of, which is pretty amazing for Scots.“My inspiration was just to make them look colourful. I didn’t really set out to make them psychadelic but they ended up that way.“The portraits aren’t in any chronological order – it’s not about time. The whole purpose was to make them look cool and timeless while highlighting what they did.“It was really just about giving them a fun background and I’m looking forward to bringing it to the Butterfly.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b3de12a36b0a-750x564.jpg ","title":"dundee kid kerr waddell could move again as english premier league side keep tabs on him","story":"\t\t\t\t\tKerr Waddell has been farmed out on loan to Morton but there’s a chance the Dundee kid could be on the move again.The 20-year-old, who made 22 appearances for the Dark Blues last term, has been sent to Cappielow until January to gain even more first-team experience.But the Tele understands the move could be shortened because of interest from England. Before heading west, the young centre-half turned out for his parent club in the friendly draw at Brechin last Friday.And watching on was a scout from an English Premier League outfit who had headed north to specifically have a look at him.While that’s unlikely to lead to an immediate move to take him south, his first few appearances at Morton are likely to be monitored.Should Waddell impress, there’s still the possibility an offer for him could be forthcoming before the transfer window closes at the end of next month.It would take a substantial offer to persuade Dundee to part with him. Although he’s out of the first-team picture right now, he remains highly regarded at Dens.Meanwhile, it was Waddell’s performances in the two Betfred derbies around this time last year that persuaded then Dundee United boss Ray McKinnon, now in charge of the ’Ton, to take him there.While Waddell gets to know his temporary new team-mates, the Dundee squad have settled in at their training camp in the Algarve.They were having double training sessions there today, before Saturday’s bounce game against Mansfield.A second game will follow against SC Farense on Tuesday night, before boss Neil McCann brings the squad back to Scotland next Wednesday.The focus out in Portugal is on making sure the team are ready to go from the first whistle when the Betfred Cup kicks off with a group tie at Stirling Albion next week.For the second year running Neil is stressing the coming come ties are not being considered part of the pre-season build up.He insists the season proper starts with the Stirling game.“I always looked at it that way last year, I didn’t count the Betfred as a warm up to our season, the league season,” he said.“It’s a cup we want to go and do well in so in the pre-season games are vitally important we get the right conditioning into all the players.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people baxter park picnic","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlenty of people turned out for the Park Lives ‘Picnic in the Park’ event at Baxter Park in the sunshine on Thursday.The sun was shining was various activities which included a giant snakes and ladders board and face-painting.One woman getting in on the fun was Maryfield Community Officer – Constable Lydia Thatcher, pictured, who was spotted getting her face painted by some youngsters.The next Picnic in the Park event, Messy Play, event will take place on July 12 from midday to 2pm and is suitable for all ages.

It was not bad but I was prepared to see better because of how they have trained.“I have been very pleased with them so far.

The teams coming down will have an expectation to go straight back up.“Then there are teams that have been down there for a while that will have a real go at getting up.“I would probably goes as far as to be saying in Scotland right now it is the toughest league.“The Championship is the most competitive but we are a club that have ambitions and we are one I think should be in the Premiership.

It was my first game for Dundee United and it was great to get started.“It was a pre-season game and the big thing was to get minutes on the pitch and that was good.“And the goal was good for the confidence going forward.“It was the first time all the boys had played together and gave the manager the chance to have a look at us in a game rather than training.”While it goes without saying United have taken something of a gamble by making so many signings in one summer.There have already been nine new arrivals and the manager has revealed he’d like as many as another four before the Betfred Cup kicks off against Arbroath next week.Rather than being daunted by that, though, Aird is relishing the challenge of being part of what could be a completely new team.“It was a position when they signed nine new players that it was the rebuilding of a club.“The number of signings excited me.

Likewise, young Scott Allardice slotted in comfortably alongside Frans in central defence.Originally a midfielder, he’s now impressed a few times in that deeper role and would certainly be worth another look there when the Betfred Cup group matches kick-off in under a fortnight.Returning to the new faces, a clue who will be handed the goalkeeper’s jersey when the competitive action starts was perhaps given when Swiss Benjamin Siegrist was preferred to Slovakian Matej Rakovan in goal.Siegrist was almost caught out when he was slow to field a pass back in the first half but, generally, looked sound.Rakovan did come on for the second half and did nothing wrong but right now it appears he has work to do to be in the side when Arbroath are faced in that first Betfred tie on Saturday week.While the game did fizzle out a bit in the second half, another boost for United was the appearance of James Keatings for the final 15 minutes or so.The attacker’s first season at Tannadice was ruined by injuries but, if he can stay fit, he’s a player who can play a significant part in what lies ahead.It was his shot with ten minutes left that struck the bar and went in off home defender Euan Spark for the second.Keatings then struck the post with a clever curling effort from 16 yards out.Had that gone in, the score would have provided a fairer reflection of United’s good work.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/10/59dc8f56e5322-e1530277496193.jpg ","title":"volunteer drivers needed for dundee charity delivering food to impoverished folk","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA new charity aimed at alleviating food poverty among families in Dundee is urgently seeking volunteers to carry out its summer programme.Dundee Bairns delivers breakfasts and lunches to impoverished families in the city during the school holidays.It is looking for delivery drivers and attendants to assist with deliveries during its Summer Fun and Food Programme which begins on Monday July 2 and ends on Friday August 11.The charity provides vans so drivers do not need their own car.

ideas as part of the annual two-day gathering.Organisers were delighted to see the creativity spill out to the benches and gardens by the River Ness as industry leaders and those looking to progress their career exchanged ideas.The festival was staged in venues across the city but the majority of day sessions were held at Eden Court.Iain Hamilton, head of creative industries at Highlands and Islands Enterprise, said: \"Folk picked the seminars they needed to see and in between enjoyed meetings outside.\"There has been a really great turnout and most of the sessions have been very busy.\"He was also pleased to see Gaelic play such a big role in the festival line-up and applauded the translation services that opened the session up to everyone.\"The Gaelic media sector is unique and provides so many opportunities and it was great for visitors to the area to hear the seminar in Gaelic as well,\" he said.Most of the festival\u0027 emphasis was put on developing the creative industries for the future and this was highlighted with sessions such as Storytelling for 21st Century Audiences \u0026ndash with questions raised about the future of artificial intelligence and how, with using a formula, computers could one day produce stories.There was also a chance for people to enter the creative sector with sessions for those looking to get into television and music and an opportunity to mingle with leaders from across the industry.Mr Hamilton highlighted this as one of HIE\u0027 aims while planning the festival.\"It is giving access to industry leaders, showing what the trends are and what the future might be, it is also a chance for businesses to meet and see how they can work together,\" he said.\"On top of this it brings businesses to Inverness to see what we have on offer.\"The second day of the festival emphasised the importance of the creative sector and tourism industry working together to form events, films and productions that appeal to locals and tourists.The Highland Cool seminar showcased already established talent in the region such as Black Isle designer Siobhan Mackenzie and producer and songwriter Joe McAlinden.Mr Hamilton added: \"It shows that Highland businesses are at the same level \u0026ndash and can be as successful \u0026ndash as internationally based ones.\"Being based here does not hold you back.

It also aims to guarantee that all commitments to suppliers are fulfilled.The Inverness franchise has been held for about the last two years by American Jack Alldredge who is understood to be from Florida.The company\u0027 managing director Mike Williams said Mr Alldredge had hoped to settle in the UK after visiting the country.\"He loved the idea of living here and fell in love with Inverness,\" Mr Williams said.\"But he has had immigration issues. Sometimes we make it difficult for people to invest in this country. It is a shame.\"For the past 18 months, Mr Alldredge has tried to manage the store from America but the shattering of a glass panel in the building \u0026ndash understood to be leased \u0026ndash was the final straw at the beginning of June.\"Fortunately, no one was hurt,\" Mr Williams said.\u0026nbsp\"In our 18-year history, we have never closed a store apart from relocation so it is sad that after the roof \u0026lsquoexploded\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash which was a glass entrance, leaving a very dangerous situation with other panels \u0026ndash Jack decided to call it a day.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMr Williams said he was disappointed for Mr Alldredge as well as the store\u0027 three employees including a manager.As the store was operated as a franchise, Ableworld is not obliged to step in but it is aiming to honour commitments to suppliers and customers.\"Although saddened by the situation, Ableworld will ensure that all suppliers of stock to the company will not lose out and either Highland Mobility (Ableworld Inverness) will settle all accounts or Ableworld UK will satisfy all the suppliers,\" Mr Williams said.\"Also no customer will lose out on their present deposits or product delivery of orders.\"Ableworld will be setting up support networks for past customers of products and writing to customers explaining the situation.\"Too many businesses in our industry and others pull the plug and leave their customers and suppliers high and dry which is something we will not do.\"He also revealed the company was actively looking to open another franchise in the Inverness area.Inverness MP Drew Hendry said the store\u0027 closure would be a great loss to many disabled people.

You should still be able to have that opportunity to make it in football or any sport regardless of your situation.“This type of scheme is potentially getting people on that right track.”Following sponsorship from Aberdeen-based companies, the Dons will be able to reach more deserving families and local community groups via the scheme. The companies are Swire Oilfield Services, Burness \u0026amp Paull, Aberdeen Standard Investments and Simmons \u0026amp Co International.The initiative is also supported by Stewart Milne Group and the Cormack Foundations.Aberdeen FC Community Trust (AFCCT) already work with many charities and organisations throughout the city to provide support and opportunities.Considine believes there is a social responsibility for the Reds above and beyond what they do on the pitch.Asked if this expanded as far as donating to food banks he said: “There is one out at Banchory my wife and I have donated at a couple of times. I am sure there are plenty of others who have as well at Aberdeen.“People should be supporting these things.”Aberdeen For All is aimed at individuals in the local community who are in need due to a number of reasons such as social exclusion, financial hardship or other disadvantages.Ally Prockter, chief executive of AFC Community Trust said: “AFCCT is delighted to be working closely with Aberdeen FC in relation to their Aberdeen For All initiative.“Social inclusion is a serious challenge which can be overcome in many ways, and for many people it is important they feel as if they are part of something bigger.“Providing AFC match tickets to those who otherwise cannot attend home games is an important step towards making people feel included in our local community.“We work closely with the club and its sponsors to identify individuals and organisations who can benefit from becoming part of the Aberdeen FC family.’Barry Douglas, Seaton Community Church pastor, is delighted to see a scheme supporting those most in need in the local community.Douglas said: “The people this scheme is helping out are from under-privileged backgrounds and who would not normally have access to football.“You really get to see the joy being brought out in them when they receive their tickets.“The tickets I have distributed so far have gone to families who will get a huge uplift from them.“There are more out there who could benefit from this scheme, so I hope it’s a great success.’\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"stevie may on target as aberdeen held 2 2 by st johnstone","story":"\t\t\t\t\tABERDEEN stepped up their preparation for their European showdown against Burnley with a 2-2 draw at Premiership rivals  St Johnstone.Stevie May and Scott Wright were both on the score-sheet as the Reds continue the pre season build up ahead of the Europa League second qualifying round clash with English Premier League Clarets on Thursday July 26.St Johnstone grabbed the lead in the fifth minute when  Richard Foster crossed in from the right to find  David WOTHERERSPOON who took one touch before lashing into the net beyond Joe Lewis from 15 yards.The Reds hit back in the eighth minute when summer signings Stephen Gleeson and Lewis Ferguson linked up down the right.Republic of Ireland international Gleeson threaded a pass to 18-year-old Ferguson who then picked up Stevie MAY’s diagonal run into the box .The striker  dinked a shot beyond keeper Zander Clark to net against his former club.Moments later May was again involved when he flighted in a cross from the right towards Cosgrove who flicked a header just wide of the far post from 15 yards.Aberdeen went ahead in the 27th minute through an impressive solo goal from Scott WRIGHT.The winger collected a pass 35 yards out then ran towards goal.Bursting into the box he fired a lethal finish beyond keeper Clark from 15 yards.The temperature was so hot at McDiarmid Park the teams stopped for water breaks mid way through the halves.In the 39th minute Drey Wright stepped wide of Devlin to open up space but curled his 22 yard effort wide.Striker Rooney came on for Cosgrove at half-time and was immediately involved when he met a Wright cross but headed just wide from the edge of the box.Moments later the impressive Ferguson curled a 25 yard effort inches wide of Clark’s near post.In the 64th minute Considine cleared off the line as  substitute Greg Hurst   got on the end of Liam Craig’s knock down from close range.St Johnstone levelled in the 73rd minute when substitute Greg HURST curled an effort beyond keeper Joe Lewis into the top far cornerIn the 87th minute Comrie broke forward and found Callum Hendry in the box but his 15 yard drive flashed just over goal.ABERDEEN: Lewis, Logan, Devlin, McKenna, Considine, Gleeson, Shinnie, Ferguson, Wright, May, Cosgrove.SUBS: Rooney (for Cosgrove 46), Mackay-Steven (for May 70), McGinn (for Wright 70), Ross (for Gleeson 76), Anderson (for Logan 84) , Campbell (for Shinnie 87), Reynolds (for Devlin 90).Subs not used: Rogers,  Harrington.\u0026nbspST JOHNSTONE: Clark, Tanser, Anderson, Davidson, Wotherspoon, Wright, Kerr, McMillan, Craig, Foster, Scougall.Subs: Gordon (for Kerr 46), G.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

Isabelle Cairns, of Ayr, has hit out at the amount of rubbish being left on the beach. And the Financial Adviser feels that the council could do more. Isabelle said: “There are two beaches here, one part gets cleaned and one doesn’t. “Between Doonfoot side and the Pavillion is generally clean. “But the rest is neglected. “There was a petition signed about this and the fact the council have stopped cleaning parts of the beach. “There are plastic bottles all over the place, I even saw dirty nappies lying. “I get that it costs a lot of money to get staff out, but there are other options for the council.  “They could get community workers in, the ones who are serving community payback orders.” Isabelle claims that Ayr has little to offer outside the beach these days. She said: “What’s in Ayr now? It’s a ghost town. “There is not a lot about, but the beach is an attraction that brings in people from all over the country. “Walking along the beach seeing this mess was nothing short of disgusting. “It gets to me as it’s such a beautiful beach. “What you also have to think about is that all kinds of rubbish is going to be washed out to sea when the tide comes in.  “It’s just going to get even worse going forward as the schools are now off. “More people will be going to the beach and it’s just going to become an absolute travesty. “People have no respect for the beach, but the council should have someone cleaning up when it’s like that.” A council spokesman said: “We monitor our beaches closely and work within the national guidance and with available resources to keep our beaches looking their best, so they can be enjoyed by local people and visitors alike. “We clean and litter-pick the full stretch of Ayr Beach and ask people to dispose of their waste in our bins rather than abandoning rubbish on the sand. “The section from Cromwell Road to the Pier is not routinely mechanically cleaned as it’s classed as an amenity beach rather than a recreational beach, but the stretch is still managed on a regular basis.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12863891.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/8898834.jpg","title":"full time ayr united can","story":"NewsFull-time Ayr United can make their Mark in Ladbrokes ChampionshipThe Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:31, 6 JUL 2018NewsMark Roberts (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMark Roberts insists that being full-time could make all the difference for Ayr United this time round in the Championship. The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lane closure inspection station hotel","story":"NewsLane closure as inspection at Station HotelGable end of the building to be investigated\u0026nbspShareByGary Fanning17:58, 6 JUL 2018Updated18:03, 6 JUL 2018NewsFront entrance to Ayr railway station is blocked off (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOne lane of the A70 will be shut off to allow for an inspecton of the gable wall of the Station Hotel just off Burns Statute Square. In order to carry out the inspection, one lane of the A70 which runs over the railway bridge towards Holmston Road and Station Road will be closed temporarily from tomorrow (7th July 2018). The section of the pavement which runs adjacent to the road will also be closed on a temporary basis. The inspection to assess the gable end will form part of the overall structural survey which the Council is undertaking to obtain a detailed report on the condition of the building. Trains are expected to run as normal, however the temporary pavement closure may affect passengers making their way to and from platform 4. Since the closure of the main entrance, some passengers have been using the pavement next to the A70 as an alternative route. Network Rail and Scotrail have been informed of the partial road closure and we are working with them to ensure passengers can get to and from the various platforms as easily and as safely as possible. Donald Gillies, Director – Place at South Ayrshire Council said: “We’re linking with our partners to limit disruption to the public however these inspections and subsequent works are necessary at this time. As we get a clearer picture of the condition of the building further restrictions may be necessary to keep rail users and the wider public safe. “We will continue to track the work carried out on the privately owned building with a view to recovering the costs of these works from the owners.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrScotrailSouth Ayrshire CouncilTransport"},{"url":null,"title":"drink-driving-shepherd-was-stopped-with-child-in-car","story":"A SHEPHERD who assaulted his partner and then drove away in a car with a child while almost double the legal alcohol limit has been banned from the road for 12 months at Jedburgh Sheriff Court.\nForty eight year old George Wylie of Cranshaws, near Duns, had a breath/alcohol limit of 43 microgrammes - the legal limit being 22 - when police responding to the assault claims breathalysed him.\nThe court was told his 19-year-old partner had threatened to leave him after he came home from working at lambing under the influence of alcohol.\nDuring the bust-up he seized her by the hair and repeatedly kicked her on the body.\nWylie then drove off to a friend\u0027s house a mile away with a five month old child claiming he wanted to take the baby to a place of safety.\nHe was fined \u0026pound270 and disqualified for a year for drink driving.\nIn addition he was ordered to carry out 90 hours unpaid work for the assault and wilfully exposing a child to unnecessary suffering while under the influence of alcohol.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"excitement-building-ahead-of-braw-lads-day","story":"EXCITEMENT is building ahead of Braw Lads\u0027 Day!\nHere\u0027s a quick reminder of what\u0027s happening tomorrow....\nThe Braw Lad will receive the Burgh flag at 8am  \nThe Raid Stane Ceremony will follow at 8.40am\u0026nbsp  \nFording the Tweed at Galafoot is at 9am  \nThe visit to Abbotsford is at 9.15am  \nFording the Tweed at Boleside is at 9.45am  \nThe Gallop over Gala Hill is at 10am\u0026nbsp  \nThe Old Town Cross Ceremony is at 10.30am  \nThe visit to Old Gala House follows at 11am  \nAt 11.30am, the cavalcade will leave Scott Park and go through Scott Street, Gala Park, Kirk Brae, Hall Street, Island Street, High street, Channel Street and Market Street \u0026ndash the dipping of the flag at the war memorial is at midday.  \nAt 7.50pm the march of the Principals and Ex-Principals from Bank Street to the War Memorial will take place.\u0026nbsp  \nAt 8pm the Roses Ceremony will be held.  \nFINAL FLING \u0026ndash at the Volunteer Hall.

closed, listening to the soothing sounds of tranquil music, gently guided by their teacher as they breathe deeply, exhaling all worries away and their minds drift off\u0026hellip\nNow, I know you must be wondering, what on earth are they teaching at Peebles High School? What about prelims, exams, studying, grades?\nBut what do all these pressures bring to the fragile mind of a young person, and how do they process the stress to ensure their mental wellbeing?\nIn steps Suzi Gibson, who has been running mindful meditation sessions with Peebles High pupils as part of Health Week for the past five years.\nAnd so a group of pupils dropped their pencils, calculators and chemistry tools and walked through the doors of a more unique classroom setting, kicking off their school shoes and leaving their cares behind them as the lay in the comfort of Space 108 in Peebles.\nCan mindfulness meditation really help pupils concentrate amid the distractions of 21st century living?\nI decided to experience for myself the sessions offered freely to the pupils by Suzi, who guided sessions at the high school before opening her studio at Greenside, Peebles, in January 2016.\nAdmittedly I had always been a bit sceptical about meditation. I mean seriously, how can sitting on a floor in the lotus position, inhaling the pleasant oil aroma while the ambient sounds of dolphins singing and ocean waves crash, bring me peace of mind?\nI\u0026rsquom a wife, mother, writer, and like most people, my life is busy and my head is bursting with thoughts from which there\u0026rsquos no escape.\nBut I entered the beautiful airy studio with an open-mind and intrigued about the experiences of the pupils.\nOn this particular afternoon, I feel like I\u0026rsquove got the weight of the world on my shoulders. Thoughts are racing through my head like a train out of control. But immediately I feel a sense of calmness speaking to Suzi, as she explains the techniques she is using and gently guides me through the smooth ride to a quiet mind\u0026hellipand I am, going, going, gone\u0026hellip\nI am in a state of deep peace and the mind is calm, so much so, when I hear Suzi\u0026rsquos soft instruction to open my eyes \u0026ndash I don\u0026rsquot want to. I love it here.\nSo now I can see why meditation could potentially tackle a myriad of problems suffered by young students, including mental health. This is a growing problem in the Scottish Borders, with evidence suggesting almost 2,000 children and young people in the region will experience mental ill health at some point in their lives.\nThe sessions are offered to groups of pupils from S1 to S3, who arrive at the studio giggling with excitement and anticipation for their new experience.\nSuzi explained: \"There are some nerves and awareness of peers, especially if there is a mix of ages. The great thing is, once they close their eyes, it becomes completely about their own experience. Fidgeting and chatting stops, there is a sense of calm, and some sleep which is great because they perhaps need it.\"\nEach group is given an insight into the benefits of meditation, as well as exploring how stress becomes unhealthy, warning signs, and how to build resilience through practical techniques that can help reduce anxiety.\nThe meditation guru shared skills with the pupils which, if put into practice daily, can be life-changing.\nSuzi said: \"They are all very relaxed and quite amazed at the experience. I hope they leave with the knowledge that they have the ability to create calmness within themselves using some of the techniques they have learned, leading to greater concentration, focus, creativity and well rested teens.\"\nThe visible difference in the pupils during the session at Space 108 has astounded school staff. \"Some of the teachers and staff who have attended over the years can\u0026rsquot quite believe the quiet and calm that begins to settle in the room. I\u0026rsquove had a few parents afterwards tell me how much their kids enjoyed it,\" said Suzi.\n\"There is a lot of anxiety and tension in our kids today, sometimes a feeling of being relaxed is a little alien to them, then they experience it. That\u0026rsquos the important bit, they have an experience of relaxation and calm, not an intellectual understanding that it is good for them, but an actual experience.\"\nResearch has proven that mindfulness and meditation is very beneficial to a person\u0026rsquos mental health, and many schools are incorporating it into their classrooms, teaching philosophies, and disciplinary programs.\nIn fact, some schools are choosing to replace detention with meditation with it even being used as behavioural therapy in classrooms.\nWhether this trend will catch on remains to be seen, as there are many parents who still prefer traditional discipline, with youngsters being given their marching orders to the principal\u0026rsquos office for unruly behaviour.\nBut one thing is certain, the pupils of Peebles High School reaped the benefits of their mindful meditation sessions with Suzi during Health Week last month.\nPrincipal teacher of pastoral care Kirsteen Robertson, said: \"The studio is beautiful, the students immediately notice how soothing the space is, the lovely smell and lighting. The sessions give our students strategies to relax, think calmly, reducing stress and anxiety and improve sleep. It\u0026rsquos just amazing to see how some of them react.\"\nHaving embraced meditation and its healing benefits, I leave the studio feeling renewed, carefree and a little lighter on my feet.

Identity cards can be faked \u0026ndash phone the company to verify their identity.\n\u0026bull Some companies offer a password system. Ask your utility providers if this can be used and if you have a password with a company make sure the caller uses it.\n\u0026bull Never let people try to persuade you to let them into your home even if they are asking for help \u0026ndash they may not be genuine. If someone is persistent, ask them to call at another time and arrange for a friend or family member to be with you.\n\u0026bull Never agree to pay for goods or give money to strangers who arrive at your door.\n\u0026bull Don\u0026rsquot keep large amounts of money in your home.\n\u0026bull Remember, it\u0026rsquos your home.

petrol or diesel models will be announced by the Transport Secretary.\nChris Grayling will unveil proposals that could lead to the installation of hundreds of thousands more charge points for electric vehicles to encourage more people to adopt ultra low-emission vehicles.\nThe initiatives included in the Government\u0026rsquos Road to Zero Strategy include more money to fund charging infrastructure and the need to assess whether new homes and offices should be required to install charge points as standard.\nThe strategy calls for new street lighting columns on UK roads with on-street parking to have charging points in appropriate locations.\nThe Government is also expected to outline more details of its ban on sales of new conventional petrol and diesel cars and vans from 2040.\nAlternatively-fuelled vehicles such as hybrids and pure electrics held just 5.5% of the UK\u0026rsquos new car market in the first six months of the year, compared with 4.2% during the same period in 2017.\nLaunching the Government\u0026rsquos plans to boost take-up of the technology, Mr Grayling will say: \u0026ldquoThe Road to Zero Strategy, combined with the measures we\u0026rsquove already introduced, will mean Britain now has one of the most comprehensive support packages for zero-emission vehicles in the world.\n\u0026ldquoWe want the UK to become the best country in the world in which to develop and manufacture zero-emission vehicles.\n\u0026ldquoThe prize is not just a cleaner and healthier environment but a UK economy fit for the future and the chance to win a substantial slice of a market estimated to be worth up to \u0026pound7.6 trillion by 2050.\nA study for motoring research charity the RAC Foundation found that growth in electric car use could be stalled by limitations in the public charging network.\nThe mass market appeal of ultra-green vehicles may be restricted without widespread, reliable and easy-to-use charging points, the report warned.\nSeparate AA research shows that eight out of 10 drivers see the lack of charging points as a stumbling block for them to buy an electric vehicle.\nThe motoring firm\u0026rsquos president Edmund King said: \u0026ldquoA big push on a range of slow, fast and rapid charging points should help overcome this hurdle.\n\u0026ldquoThe challenge is then for manufacturers to make a car worth

supplies during the current period of hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer usage has increased significantly.With the current weather conditions forecast to continue people should take simple but important steps to conserve public water supplies.In some areas there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water during the summer and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely and  to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Some water treatment works and distribution networks are working at near capacity to meet demand.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of usage and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce usage wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their usage and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible, use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.Scotland’s public water supply is the lifeblood of the country, for household and business customers and more than 1.3 billion litres is used per day.There is a strong and resilient water distribution network but everyone will need to play their part as Scotland enjoys its hottest and driest summer in many years.To help customers use water wisely, advice is at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or by calling 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer,Chief Operating Officer,Scottish

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.  The family have also received support from the charity \u0026lsquoFinding Your Feet\u0026rsquo, which helps families affected by amputation or limb difference.

Mrs Morris said that although there were some trees along the boundary, they shed their leaves in the autumn, leaving the area bare.  She claimed that she and her husband had called on the housing association for permission to fill in the gaps in the fence to allow more privacy but claimed they had been told they couldn\u0026rsquot as another resident liked it that way.  \u0026ldquoWe wanted to get these slats which are only 94p. We would pay for them and fill in the spaces, she added.  She said they also called for a fence to be installed to stop people using an area past their flats as a shortcut to Tesco, claiming they were dumping rubbish including cans and bottles en route.  Neighbour Fiona Wilson said that motorists ate and slept in their vehicles and let their dogs out of cars.  \u0026ldquoWe are entitled to some sort of privacy, she added.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot go out \u0026ndash everybody\u0026rsquos looking at us.  \u0026ldquoMy bedroom is also to the front.

The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.

Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.

Councillor McMillan said it had been a great honour to be joined by veterans from East Lothian at the flag-raising ceremony which took place on Monday morning.  He told those in attendance: \"Today is an opportunity to recognise the enormous contribution made by service personnel - past and present - and pay tribute to those who very sadly paid the ultimate sacrifice.  \"This November marks a century since the end of the First World War. A large number of residents left East Lothian in service of their country \u0026ndash many of whom, tragically, would never return.  \"Sadly, in the 100 years since, the world has seen all too many conflicts \u0026ndash some on a large scale, others more confined. In war, and in peacetime, our armed forces have promoted peace and security, confronted terrorism, and delivered aid to those in need.  \"That\u0026rsquos why, as Provost of East Lothian, I value occasions such as Armed Forces Day. A chance to give thanks, remember, reflect and look ahead.\"  Mr McMillan also paid tribute to the role of women in the military and in times of conflict, noting that 2018 was also the 100th anniversary of the first women being given the vote.  He said: \"Women played a significant role in the war effort, taking on work such as farming, transport and munition production, and the perseverance of Suffrage activity subsequently led to women being given the right to vote.  \"For a number of years now women have deservedly been playing a full and active role in our Armed Forces \u0026ndash reflective of the increasingly inclusive society in which we all live and are so keen to protect.\"  Veterans who attended the ceremony on Monday were invited to enjoy refreshments after the event."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7979931.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"scotlands-best-black-pudding-made-in-east-lothian","story":"  When the final of this year\u0026rsquos Scottish Black Pudding Championship was held earlier this month at the Edinburgh New Town Cook School, it was Anderson\u0027s Quality Butchers who came out on top.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area.

Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.  Organisers say the display shows Musselburgh\u0026rsquos leadership in developing golf and exporting it.  The museum is open on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 10.30am to 4pm each day."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8006789.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"coast-road-closed-after-car-overturns","story":"  Police said one person was trapped in a car which has overturned and they have closed the road while work to free them is carried out.

The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.

The competition \u0026ndash dubbed the Olympics of Tech \u0026ndash seeks out the most innovative and potentially world-changing software solutions and comes with a first prize of $100,000.  Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.  She said: \u0026ldquoThey are sending the first and second place teams out to Seattle for the competition, which is in the last week in July.  \u0026ldquoIt is quite exciting, I\u0026rsquom just the artist on the team.  \u0026ldquoI do the models and particular effects and textures.  The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.  In April, the team from Abertay University took part in the UK finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup in London.  A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.

Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.

Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.

It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.

A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.

The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.  Details of what happened have not been released publicly, although the Courier understands that it followed a private function on the premises the previous evening.  In April, Police Scotland asked East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board to review the pub\u0026rsquos licence and that of its manager Christopher Darling.  However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.  James Hughes, who currently runs Dunbar Golf Club, asked the board to consider transferring the licence to him as he revealed ambitious plans to invest \u0026pound50,000 in the business with a view to eventually taking ownership of the property.  Mr Hughes told the board that he was preparing to sign a five-year-lease of the pub with its current owner in a deal which would allow him to buy it at the end of the lease.  He said that there were plans to renovate the building to open it up more and make it a family-friendly site.  Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.  Mr Hughes, who has been at Dunbar Golf Club for several years, told the board he had more than 23 years of experience in the licensed trade and had worked in Edinburgh before moving to East Lothian.  He said that if given approval to go ahead the pub could re-open early next year.

A ClubGolf mass participation session was then held over lunchtime to give all children at the school a chance to experience golf, using everything from plastic ClubGolf equipment, professional clubs and golf balls to Scottish Golf inflatable nets.  About 14,000 primary and high school pupils in East Lothian have been visited at their schools as part of the trophies tour in the run-up to the Scottish Open, which takes place from next Thursday (July 12), and the Ladies\u0026rsquo Scottish Open which begins on Thursday, July 26.  Mr Martin said: \u0026ldquoThe trophies tour finale at Sanderson\u0026rsquos Wynd was an amazing day and these children not only got to see the trophies up close but also got to grill a brilliant professional athlete in Beth Allen.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.  However Mr McKinnie said alternatives would be looked at if it received a boost in its support.  He said: \"During the summer months orders can fall as low as 10 a week which is not sustainable. It really is a case of \"use it or lose it\".\"  A spokesperson for the Food Assembly said no public statement on the withdrawal was being made before the end of August.  She said: \"The announcement has been made to our network of hosts and producers, many of them will communicate to their members when they are ready, and we will do a public communication in August.\""},{"url":null,"title":"talented-teenage-drummer-clara-wilberforce-joins-national-youth-pipe-band-of-scotland","story":"  Clara Wilberforce, who has been playing the snare drum since she was in P6 at King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, has linked up with the National Youth Pipe Band of Scotland\u0026rsquos development band.

Proud mum Juliet told the Courier it had been an eventful period from the audition to finding out that Clara had been successful.  She said: \u0026ldquoShe went to the National Piping Centre in Glasgow and she did her audition and she came out and said \u0026lsquoI did so badly, I messed up\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe was so disappointed and I said to her that she was very young.  \u0026ldquoShe was terribly disappointed but I said \u0026lsquonever mind, you are young and will get another chance another year\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe had been in tears and she felt she let herself down.  \u0026ldquoWe forgot all about it and then suddenly emails were coming through to her and myself.  \u0026ldquoShe came tearing down the stairs screaming at the top of her voice that she got into the development band.  \u0026ldquoShe was running round the house, up and down the stairs screaming with joy.  Her first event will feature Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain at the Phil and Aly RSNO St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day Concert at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on November 25.  Music runs in the family, with older brother Ninian, playing the pipes, while Juliet plays the piano and dad Marcus is a member of Haddington\u0026rsquos Siancio Singers.  Clara, who is in S5 at Knox Academy and studying Higher maths, English, geography and human biology, is also a member of the school\u0026rsquos pipe band as well as Haddington Pipe Band, where she is a senior drummer.  Her mum, who praised the efforts of Davey Barnes, who runs Knox Academy Pipe Band, and Dave Henry, drum teacher, said Clara \u0026ldquoloves the drumming and she had made a number of good friends through music and boosted her confidence.  Alastair Bruce, chairman of Haddington Pipe Band, congratulated Clara, who lives in the town, on the achievement.  The youngster won the band\u0026rsquos Niall Fairgrieve Award in 2014 for most improved drummer and has continued to impress.  Mr Bruce said: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoShe has done really well and she is an excellent drummer.  \u0026ldquoShe is onto the development band and that will open up lots of opportunities for her in the future.

Now his son Kit, who lives in Belhaven, has released a new version of the tale which looks at Chris\u0026rsquo 30-year career with the company, its characters and ships.  The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.  Kit \u0026ndash who last year released The Triumph and Tragedy of the Bantams, which focused on a band of \u0026ldquobrave but largely forgotten soldiers \u0026ndash has added his own stories of being a \u0026lsquoMacBrayne Child\u0026rsquo.  He added that his dad was known as the \u0026lsquostoryteller\u0026rsquo in the family and he wanted to make sure the stories were available to a new generation.

The 51-year-old, whose nephew is Scotland rugby star Huw Jones, has driven a taxi for nine years to pay his way through university and has built his own film studio and edit suite at his home in Longniddry.  The dad-of-three said: \u0026ldquoThe TV course has been a brilliant journey.  \u0026ldquoColleagues often ask where I find my energy, and sometimes I have to ask myself the same thing, especially at 4am when I have forgotten to go to bed. Perhaps my endurance and resilience comes from my 12 years as a commando.  \u0026ldquoThere have been sacrifices, the biggest of them being to have had no social life throughout this time, but I am passionate about television and I am now talking to production companies and hoping to make my mark in the documentary genre.  While Matt admits it was \u0026ldquoeasy to feel envious of weekend revellers partying, he said driving taxis allowed him to refine his interview skills for his TV career ahead.  And among those to grace the back seat of his cab over the last nine years have been the likes of Angus Deayton, Ian Lavender, Paul Merton, Alexei Sayle, Ruth Madoc and Steven Berkoff.  Matt, who served with the Royal Marines in Northern Ireland, has already completed a music production with National Museums Scotland for a new exhibition on Scottish pop from the 1950s to present day.

The initiatives included in the Government\u0026rsquos Road to Zero Strategy include more money to fund charging infrastructure and the need to assess whether new homes and offices should be required to install charge points as standard.  The strategy calls for new street lighting columns on UK roads with on-street parking to have charging points in appropriate locations.  The Government is also expected to outline more details of its ban on sales of new conventional petrol and diesel cars and vans from 2040.  Alternatively-fuelled vehicles such as hybrids and pure electrics held just 5.5% of the UK\u0026rsquos new car market in the first six months of the year, compared with 4.2% during the same period in 2017.  Launching the Government\u0026rsquos plans to boost take-up of the technology, Mr Grayling will say: \u0026ldquoThe Road to Zero Strategy, combined with the measures we\u0026rsquove already introduced, will mean Britain now has one of the most comprehensive support packages for zero-emission vehicles in the world.  \u0026ldquoWe want the UK to become the best country in the world in which to develop and manufacture zero-emission vehicles.  \u0026ldquoThe prize is not just a cleaner and healthier environment but a UK economy fit for the future and the chance to win a substantial slice of a market estimated to be worth up to \u0026pound7.6 trillion by 2050.  A study for motoring research charity the RAC Foundation found that growth in electric car use could be stalled by limitations in the public charging network.  The mass market appeal of ultra-green vehicles may be restricted without widespread, reliable and easy-to-use charging points, the report warned.  Separate AA research shows that eight out of 10 drivers see the lack of charging points as a stumbling block for them to buy an electric vehicle.  The motoring firm\u0026rsquos president Edmund King said: \u0026ldquoA big push on a range of slow, fast and rapid charging points should help overcome this hurdle.  \u0026ldquoThe challenge is then for manufacturers to make a car worth buying.  \u0026ldquoThese Road to Vision Zero proposals are a step in the right direction but there is still much to do to wean drivers off petrol and diesel cars."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8042025.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"what-the-papers-say-july-9","story":"  Police launched a murder inquiry after Dawn Sturgess died 10 days after she was exposed to the nerve agent in Salisbury, the Daily Mail reports.

The plans, which still have to be assessed by the 27 other nations of the EU, would result in the creation of a UK-EU free trade area for goods, with a \"common rulebook\".  \"It\u0027s a Trojan Horse deal,\" is how rising SNP star Christopher McEleny described it, predicting that the EU would reject the proposal. \"This is fantasy politics,\" added McEleny, who is also the leader of the party group on Inverclyde Council. \"Every single one of the 27 EU members has to agree it and the plain truth is that they won\u0027t.\"  His comments seemed to be at odds with Sturgeon\u0027s, who described the plan as having \"more realism in it than we\u0027ve seen before from UK government\", although she added \"that\u0027s not saying much\".  Hardline eurosceptic MPs have begun to voice concerns over May\u0026rsquos plans to negotiate a soft Brexit deal. Leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has already warned he will have to wait to see \"have the red lines been turned pink\", as he claimed the proposals could be worse than a no-deal Brexit.  Speaking on BBC Radio 4 he said: \"As with eggs. An egg that is very softly boiled isn\u0027t boiled at all. A very soft Brexit means that we haven\u0027t left, we are simply a rule-taker. That is not something that this country voted for, it is not what the Prime Minister promised.\" A comment underlined by fellow Tory Andrea Jenkyns MP.  The former Ukip leader Nigel Farage described it as a sell out. \u0026ldquoTheresa May has betrayed us all \u0026ndash and Brexiteer ministers are letting her get away with it, he said.  However, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said the newly outlined Brexit plan would deliver for Scotland in three key areas, \"providing Scottish business with frictionless access to the EU market, withdrawing the Scottish fishing industry from the hated Common Fisheries Policy and, by ensuring no border in the Irish Sea, bolstering Scotland\u0027s biggest and most important market, the UK internal market.\"  She also hit out at the SNP, claiming Scottish nationalists had \"used the Brexit referendum as a pretext for pulling our country apart\".  Downing Street is now engaged in desperate efforts to win over Tory Eurosceptics after May\u0027s Brexit compromise plan which keeping the UK closely tied to Brussels was agreed by her Cabinet.  The Prime Minister\u0027s inner circle is now desperately trying to secure support from the party\u0027s eurosceptics for the proposals to create a new UK-EU free trade area for goods.  Cabinet Brexiteers may have already been persuaded to support the plans after a marathon session of talks at Chequers, but backbench eurosceptics continue to express grave doubts.  The common rulebook for goods, including food and agricultural products, could limit the UK\u0027s ability to strike trade deals with countries such as the US, for whom securing market access for American farmers would be a big prize. The cabinet Brexiter Chris Grayling acknowledged the proposal could lead to issues in negotiating a US trade deal.  Full details will be published in a white paper on Thursday, with Brussels expecting a round of negotiations in the week following.  The SNP\u0027s McEleny predicted that May\u0027s team would blame a failure of negotiations on the EU and that the final outcome would be a hard Brexit."},{"url":null,"title":"fiona-hyslop-our-links-with-japan-and-south-korea-have-gone-from-strength-to-strength","story":"  As Brexit uncertainty continues to impact on business confidence \u0026ndash and as we face the threat of losing membership of the Single Market and Custom Union \u0026ndash it is increasingly important that we continue to engage with international partners and build trade and business links.

This is why during this visit I met with key business representatives across a range of sectors including renewables, subsea engineering and life sciences \u0026ndash from Mitsubishi Electric to the Nippon Foundation \u0026ndash to acknowledge the significant contribution these businesses make to Scotland\u0026rsquos economy and to reiterate the message that Scotland is an excellent partner to do business with.  The ties between Scotland and Japan date back 150 years to a time when Scots engineers helped the Pacific nation kick-start its own industrial revolution. The links between our countries have since gone from strength to strength \u0026ndash so that, to date, 90 Japanese-owned businesses at 135 Scottish sites employ over 6,000 staff, generating a Scottish turnover of more than \u0026pound1.8 billion.  In 2016, exports to Japan increased by more than 10 per cent to \u0026pound460m, making Japan the 19th top destination for Scottish exports. With foreign direct investment into Scotland from Japan accounting for almost six per cent of all inward investment over the past decade, I believe there is scope for even closer collaboration \u0026ndash to seize shared opportunities and meet common challenges as both our countries look to address the growing needs of the global market.  Following the launch of our Scotland is Now campaign, this visit was an opportunity to further promote Scotland as a top destination to visit, live, work, invest and study. I held tourism events in both Tokyo and Seoul. I also signed a joint declaration of co-operation between Scotland and Yokohama, the second largest city in Japan and host to two of Scotland\u0026rsquos Rugby World Cup games in 2019.  Building on the constructive meeting I held with Yokohama\u0027s mayor during my last visit, this declaration is an excellent opportunity to exchange knowledge and expertise, while strengthening existing ties in the areas of education, sports, culture and marine industries as Japan builds to the 2019 Rugby World Cup and the Olympics and Paralympics in 2020.  In addition, I met with local representatives and culture stakeholders to share best practices and discuss how culture in Scotland plays a vital role in shaping our cultural identity, strengthening business links and promoting our country internationally.  While in Tokyo I met with representatives from Japan\u0026rsquos Ricca Ricca Festival, the annual international festival of performing arts for young people held in Okinawa. This year, the festival will focus on Scotland as a result of a joint funding initiative between Ricca Ricca, Creative Scotland, Scottish Government and British Council Scotland. As we celebrate Scotland\u0026rsquos Year of Young People 2018, this represents a great opportunity for Scotland\u0026rsquos world leading children\u0026rsquos theatre to showcase their talent to international audiences beyond our borders.  I also met with Japanese city leaders in Tokyo to discuss how Scotland\u0026rsquos arts community can help Japan shape its cultural programme for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Japanese prefectures are now looking to deliver a world-class programme of cultural activity as part of the Olympics and are looking to Scotland for inspiration. It was a pleasure to discuss Scotland\u0026rsquos use of culture as a promotional tool in domestic and international markets while we get ready to welcome our Japanese partners to Scotland this August during Edinburgh\u0026rsquos peak festival season.  I was delighted to witness the signing of an important agreement between Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd, a major Japanese industrial corporation, and the Underwater Centre near Fort William. It will see the world\u0026rsquos first test of an autonomous underwater vehicle take place in Scotland. Kawasaki will carry out a verification test of a prototype AUV equipped with a robot arm for subsea pipeline inspection.  This visit also represented an opportunity to promote our world-leading universities and to announce that the Scottish Government flagship Saltire Scholarship programme will open to Japanese postgraduates. Currently available to students from Canada, China, Pakistan and the US, the fund offers 50 scholarships worth \u0026pound8,000 per year, co-funded by the Scottish Government and partner universities.  In South Korea, I met with key tourism leaders and travel media, an ideal opportunity to further promote business and travel contacts between our two countries. I also met companies that are keen to build on their trade and investment in Scotland.  In 2017, Scotland exported 744 million of goods to South Korea, a 165 per cent increase on the previous year. Korean company Doosan Babcock is a key investor in Scotland, employing approximately 1,200 people across eight different sites,with the main facility in Renfrew.  At government level, I focussed on developing links on rural development and cultural issues.  Scotland has strengths and qualities that make it a unique location for international cooperation and investment. My message to our friends in Japan and the Republic of Korea is that, whatever your reason for coming to Scotland, you will be offered the warmest of welcomes here and will find a bold and positive country shaping a progressive, pioneering and inclusive future."},{"url":null,"title":"sprinklers-not-installed-at-burrell-museum-as-66m-upgrade-continues","story":"  The contractors hired to renovate the Burrell are Kier Construction, the same company which was undertaking work on the ill-fated Glasgow School of Art, which was destroyed by fire last month.  When Kier was awarded the contract managing director of the company in Scotland, Brian McQuade, said, \"We have a solid record of working on major heritage projects of this scale, including the restoration of the Mackintosh Building at the Galsgow School of Art and the refurbishment of Edinburgh College of Art and Aberdeen Music Hall.\"  It emerged after the fire which ravaged the Mackintosh building that while sprinklers had been installed they were not operational.  The Burrell, which displayed a portion of the artworks collected in the 19th century by Glasgow shipping magnate Sir William Burrell, is due to reopen in 2020. It is understood that the majority of the 9,000 artworks have been removed from the building in Pollok Park as it is cleared for Kier to begin work later this month.  A Kier spokesperson referred all questions to the client, Glasgow Life, a charity set up by the city council to deliver cultural, sporting and educational activities. Glasgow City Council has pledged \u0026pound27m towards the upgrade and virtually all of the budget has been raised.  A spokesman for Glasgow Life, confirming that no sprinklers are presently installed, said: \u0026ldquoThere is currently full-time security at the building. The city has an excellent track record in delivering major capital projects on time and on budget and without serious incident.  \"Our management, fire risk assessment and monitoring processes are robust and well established. All contractors comply with the Joint Fire Code and Health and Safety Executive\u0026rsquos guidance for fire safety for construction sites \u0026ndash the industry standard for fire safety.  \u0026ldquoThe vast majority of treasures housed in the Burrell have been decanted ahead of main contractor works and are housed in state-of-the-art museum storage facilities at Kelvin Hall and Glasgow Museums Resource Centre."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-faces-backlash-over-brexit-plan-but-insists-i-wont-let-people-down","story":"  The Prime Minister said the strategy thrashed out with the Cabinet would make sure Brexit was delivered \u0026ldquobecause I won\u0026rsquot let people down.  But backbench Tory Brexiteers hit out at the plans, with speculation at Westminster that some could be prepared to submit formal letters calling for a leadership contest.  Meanwhile, it emerged that Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson backed the proposals at Chequers despite claiming that defending the plans was like \u0026ldquopolishing a turd.  Despite his reservations, Mr Johnson fell into line along with the rest of the Cabinet\u0026rsquos Brexit-backing ministers.  Tory MP Andrew Bridgen compared the Foreign Secretary to Neville Chamberlain, accusing him of \u0026ldquowaving the white flag of appeasement in the direction of Brussels, along with other Brexiteer ministers.  Meanwhile, the Sunday Times reported that in a draft leadership letter circulating in Westminster, rebel Tories accuse the Prime Minister of letting the negotiations with Brussels descend \u0026ldquointo a state of complete capitulation.  It claims the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Brexit promises appeared to be \u0026ldquoa pretence and a charade intended to dupe the electorate and concludes that \u0026ldquoin the interests of our country and the future of the Conservative Party, I feel the time has come for a new leader.  Mr Bridgen, writing in the Mail on Sunday, said Jacob Rees-Mogg \u0026ndash leader of the pro-Brexit European Research Group \u0026ndash was now the only credible challenger to Mrs May after the failure by Cabinet ministers to oppose the Chequers plan.  In a message to the Cabinet, he said: \u0026ldquoAll those harbouring leadership hopes have done their ambitions fatal harm.  \u0026ldquoGrassroots party members will have no truck with their perceived treachery.  \u0026ldquoSome will try to keep their leadership hopes alive by claiming it was not the time to quit and they had a duty to stay on to ensure Brexit is not further watered down.  \u0026ldquoBut it leaves only one credible contender with the integrity and backbone to follow Mrs May: Jacob Rees-Mogg.  But Mrs May told the Sunday Times:\u0026nbsp \u0026ldquoThe only challenge that needs to be made now is to the European Union to get serious about this, to come round the table and discuss it with us.  The Prime Minister will address Tory MPs on Monday and her chief of staff Gavin Barwell has been engaged in efforts to explain the Chequers deal to concerned colleagues alongside Chief Whip Julian Smith.  Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith told the Sunday  the Chequers plan appeared to amount to \u0026ldquocontinued membership of the customs union and single market for goods despite the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos promise to leave both.  \u0026ldquoIf the public perceive that not to be delivered then the Government, I\u0026rsquom afraid, will suffer the consequences at the next election, he said.  Mr Rees-Mogg warned that \u0026ldquoa\u0026nbspvery soft Brexit means that we haven\u0026rsquot left, we are simply a rule-taker.  \u0026ldquoThat is not something that this country voted for, it is not what the Prime Minister promised, he told BBC Radio 4\u0026rsquos Today.  An analysis of the Chequers statement circulating within the ERG was damning about the plans.  The Chequers proposals \u0026ldquolead directly to a worst-of-all-worlds \u0026lsquoblack hole\u0026rsquo Brexit where the UK is stuck permanently as a vassal state in the EU\u0026rsquos legal and regulatory tarpit, the briefing by Martin Howe QC concluded.  The document has not been endorsed by the ERG but was \u0026ldquodevastating, a Brexiteer source said.  The plans agreed at Chequers would create a new UK-EU free trade area for goods, with a \u0026ldquocommon rulebook.  A new \u0026ldquofacilitated customs arrangement would remove the need for checks at the Irish border and ports, treating the UK and EU \u0026ldquoas if a combined customs territory.  Tories who attended the first briefing organised by Downing Street on the plans said their concerns had been met, and Mrs May will hope that restive Brexiteers also fall in line when they hear more about the proposals which will be set out in a white paper on Thursday.  James Cleverly, a deputy chairman of the party who attended the Saturday morning briefing, said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoI went in there with some concerns as a Brexiteer and I come out with those concerns addressed.          Just come out of a briefing in the proposal agreed by Cabinet yesterday. A lot of the reporting around this was inaccurate, and I\u0026rsquom happy with the what was actually agreed.          MPs will be briefed over the next few days. pic.twitter/pncGkCimwt          \u0026mdash James Cleverly (@JamesCleverly) July 7, 2018  He said the briefings \u0026ldquowill massively calm the nerves of people who have been basing their views on the speculation that has been floating around in the media and social media.  The Prime Minister told the BBC: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore leaving the European Union. I think when people voted to leave the European Union, they wanted an end to free movement \u0026ndash free movement will end.  \u0026ldquoThey wanted us to end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK \u0026ndash that will end.  \u0026ldquoThey wanted us to stop sending the vast sums of money every year to the EU that we do today, and so take control of our money, our laws and our borders \u0026ndash and that\u0026rsquos exactly what we will do.  \u0026ldquoBut we\u0026rsquoll do it in a way that protects drops and enhances our economy for the future."},{"url":null,"title":"gove-says-chequers-agreement-offers-proper-brexit-and-urges-colleagues-to-back-pm","story":"  The Environment Secretary, who was a leading light in the Leave campaign, accepted that Friday\u0026rsquos agreement was not everything the Brexiteers had wanted but stressed it was a \u0026ldquoperfect balance between sharing regulations on 20 per cent of the UK economy - a \u0026ldquocommon market of goods - with the EU but being outside the bloc\u0026rsquos remit on 80 per cent of it ie services.  Asked if the Chequers deal was everything he had personally hoped for, the Scot told the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr Show: \"No. But then I\u0027m a realist and one of the things about politics is you mustn\u0027t, you shouldn\u0027t, make the perfect the enemy of the good. One of the things about this compromise is that it unites the Cabinet.  \u0026ldquoAll those of us who believe that we want to execute a proper Brexit, and one that is the best deal for Britain, have an opportunity now to get behind the Prime Minister in order to negotiate that deal.\"  Mr Gove rebuffed the suggestion by his Cabinet colleague and fellow Brexiteer Boris Johnson that selling Mrs May\u0026rsquos compromise would be like \u0026ldquopolishing a t***.  He denied the Chequers deal offered \u0026ldquofake sovereignty or that it would plunge Britain into a \u0026ldquoBrexit black hole and stressed that from now on \u0026ldquocollective responsibility reigns.  The Secretary of State also warned Brussels not to be inflexible in its response, saying if it continued to be so, then Britain would \u0026ldquowalk out of the talks.  The PM, who tomorrow is due to make a Commons statement on her compromise deal and will later address Tory MPs at a potentially fractious meeting of the party\u0026rsquos 1922 backbench committee, is said to be facing a potential leadership challenge with right-wing critics accusing her of \u0026ldquocomplete capitulation to Brussels.  Some 48 signatures from Conservative MPs are needed to spark an automatic leadership contest.  Tory backbencher Andrew Bridgen expressed his unhappiness with Mrs May\u0026rsquos compromise by declaring he would not back it \"if the EU were paying us\".  He told BBC Radio 5 Live\u0027s Pienaar\u0027s Politics: \"I\u0027m very, very disappointed with the offer that we\u0027ve seen coming out of Chequers I\u0027m disappointed that so-called Brexiteers in the Cabinet didn\u0027t pick up the cudgels and fight for a better offer.\"  Yet, despite the offer \"crossing many of the supposed red lines\" outlined by the PM, the Leicestershire MP, when asked about a demand for a confidence vote in his leader, said: \"We\u0027re not there yet.\"  Earlier, he wrote Jacob Rees-Mogg, who leads the pro-Brexit European Research Group, was now the only credible challenger to Mrs May after the failure by Cabinet ministers to oppose the Chequers plan.  Veteran Tory Eurosceptic Sir Bill Cash was also keen not to rush into challenging Mrs May\u0026rsquos leadership and said he would wait for the detail in the White Paper, which is due to be published later this week.  The Staffordshire MP told Sky News: \"There are a lot of questions in here, there is a lot of unhappiness, there is a great deal of concern that we are saying that we leave it\u0027s not \u0027to be or not to be,\u0027 it\u0027s \u0027to leave or not to leave\u0027.  \"The question is how do you leave and is this going to be a proper Brexit? There will be a massive discussion about all this.\"  Sir Bill said he had not written a letter calling for a leadership contest but \"if people were to decide to put in those letters you only need 48 and as a matter of fact nobody can stop them, once the decision has been taken by those people the chairman of the 1922 Committee has to implement the process.\"  Meanwhile, the Labour leadership branded the Chequers deal \"unworkable\" and a \"fudge\" and challenged the PM to put it to a Commons vote.  Sir Keir Starmer described Mrs May\u0026rsquos compromise as a \"bureaucratic nightmare\".  He told the Marr Show: \"I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s got fudge written all over it.  \"If you look at the facilitated customs arrangement, the sort of heart of this, it\u0027s a rebadging of the partnership and it\u0027s based on the idea that at the border you can distinguish between goods that are going to stay in the UK and those going to the EU.  \"It\u0027s unworkable, it\u0027s a bureaucratic nightmare, so this a fudge,\" declared the Shadow Brexit Secretary.  The Labour frontbencher called for MPs to be given the chance to vote between Labour and the Government\u0027s customs plans.  \"We\u0027ve now got two propositions, we\u0027ve got the Labour proposition, which has the majority support in Parliament, and the Prime Minister\u0027s new proposition, let\u0027s put it to a vote. I challenge the Prime Minister: put it to a vote and see where the majority is in Parliament on a customs union,\" added Sir Keir.  His Labour colleague, Hilary Benn, who chairs the Commons Brexit Committee, said he believed the transition period would have to be extended under the Chequers agreement.  Asked if more time would be needed to negotiate a deal with the EU, he replied: \"It\u0026rsquos definitely more likely the transitional period is going to have to be extended because the Government itself now admits that now with this latest version, this facilitated customs arrangement it isn\u0027t going to be ready by the end of the current proposed transition period which is December 2020.\"  He added that if the plans did not work out, then the Government should \"bite the bullet and say remaining in the customs union is much the simplest and easiest way of doing this\".  Justine Greening, the former Education Secretary, said Mrs May\u0026rsquos compromise was \"sensible\" and called on her colleagues to stop arguing.  \u0026ldquoMy sense is that we now really need to stick together as a party, get behind the Prime Minister and try and make sure that we support her as she goes through what are going to be monumentally difficult negotiations with the EU.\"  She added: \"The time for arguments within that Chequers team, within that Cabinet team, has now got to stop.\"  Elsewhere, Gerard Batten, the Ukip leader, said the Chequers deal was a \u0026ldquobetrayal of the referendum vote.  \"May has done everything she possibly can in the past two years to delay Brexit, to impede Brexit, and all in the intended outcome of reversing the referendum decision.  \"The Chequers agreement is the opposite of what Mrs May promised us two years ago, when she said the UK wouldn\u0027t be half-in and half-out of the EU.  \"With this agreement, we are more in than we are out and means the UK will have a similar status to those countries applying to join the EU.  \"The implications of that is obvious. It would seem to me that Mrs May hopes that by getting rid of the Ukip MEPs next March the party will disappear from the political scene.\"  But he added: \"This agreement betrays the referendum result and shows exactly why Ukip needs to become stronger than ever.\""},{"url":null,"title":"watch-hopes-soar-for-boys-trapped-in-thai-cave-as-ambulance-leaves-affected-area","story":"  The Thai official leading the rescue operation said it has gone \u0026ldquobetter than expected and that the\u0026nbsphealthiest boys have been taken out first.  Four were brought to the surface on Sunday, more than two weeks after a football team and their coach were trapped underground.  The next phase of the operation will start in 10 to 20 hours, according to authorities.  Chief of operations governor Narongsak Osatanakorn said 13 foreign and five Thai divers are taking part in the operation.  The British Cave Rescue Council (BCRC) confirmed that seven divers from the UK with \u0026ldquoexpertise in cave diving are assisting.  Two elite British divers, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, were the first rescuers to reach the group on Monday night and are believed to be part of the team.  A BCRC spokesman said: \u0026ldquoThe UK divers are part of the core team, so they will be actively involved and that will include escorting each child out through the flooded passage.  \u0026ldquoThe operation is being supervised by the Thai authorities.  \u0026ldquoThey have had to make a quick decision because they are really concerned about the water level rising.  Two divers will accompany each boy as they are gradually extracted.  The entire operation to get all 13 out of the cave could take two to four days, depending on weather and water conditions, said Thai army Major General Chalongchai Chaiyakam.  A doctor and paramedics are standing by to provide medical attention whenever the rescue team emerges.  Rescuers pumped millions of litres of water out of the cave network to try to extract the group through nearly a mile of tunnels.  Thai officials are not only racing against worsening weather, but also lowered oxygen levels in the underground complex in the north of the country.  Former Thai navy Seal Saman Kunan passed out making the dive on Friday and died.  The boys, aged 11-16, and their coach, 25, were trapped inside the Tham Luang Nang Non cave in the northern province of Chiang Rai after a football game on June 23.  Monsoon flooding cut off their escape and they have been on a rocky shelf inside a cave chamber since.

Although it is now less yomping youths and more budget family hotel, half of the 72 beds are still dedicated to shared dormitories for those who like the simple charm of communal living for which the hostels are famed.  As it nears its 9th decade, the organisation that runs the 34 Scottish hostels undertaken a name-change - from the Scottish Youth Hostels Association to Hostelling Scotland - which was executed this year.  Research showed that while older people used and still use or are rediscovering hostelling, younger people understood the concept less.  Glen Nevis is part of the resulting overhaul that includes developing gems like its hostel on the edge of Loch Ossian, renovation of Lochranza on Arran and could also include expansion with new properties including in St Andrews.  Wardens are also consigned to history, with managers there in their place and new apprenticeships are being developed to help bring in young staff.    Margo Paterson, Hostelling Scotland chief executive, said the evolution will continue as the organisation settles into its new identity.  She said: \"This major redevelopment project truly reflects our commitment to the modernisation of our accommodation network.  \"It also highlights our mission to make more of Scotland more accessible to more people than anyone else, and especially young people, providing great value, affordable, flexible and welcoming accommodation in the best locations across Scotland.\"  She said:\u0026nbsp\"We pride ourselves in excellent customer service, listening to our members and guests, understanding their needs and developing our network to offer the best possible hostelling experience.  \"The new Glen Nevis Youth Hostel, one of our flagship hostels, highlights this perfectly. We want guests to discover the real Scotland with us.\"  She said removing the word youth from their title did not reflect a move away from core customers and schemes to help groups of young people embark on rural adventures are also under way.  The \u0026pound6 membership and guest overnight income supports its charitable youth programmes and the maintenance of the hostelling network.  Following the strategic review of the organisation early in 2018, the 88-year-old hostelling association said: \"The new identity follows on from extensive marketing research and reflects the organisation\u0026rsquos commitment to understanding the needs of its members, guests and employees as the modern face of Scottish Hostelling.  \"The name also more clearly indicates its representation of Hostelling International within Scotland.\"  The 34 Hostelling Scotland hostels is about half of the number hostels from a decade ago, but it attracts 380,000 guests every year, with a turnover of \u0026pound9m and an estimated contribution to the Scottish visitor economy of \u0026pound25m.  As well as the network of hostels across Scotland, members get dual membership with Hostelling International, providing access to more than 4,000 youth hostels in over 90 countries worldwide."},{"url":null,"title":"david-davis-resignation-who-why-and-what-happens-next","story":"  The long-serving Conservative MP was among the new intake when Tony Blair\u0026rsquos new Labour swept to power in 1997. In the two decades since, the former SAS reservist has become an established figure within the party, challenging David Cameron to a 2005 leadership contest which the younger man went on to win. He would become a key ally in Theresa May\u0026rsquos embattled Cabinet.  Why was he important to Theresa May?  The no-nonsense politician revelled in the description of being Britain\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoBrexit bulldog, charged with leading negotiations with his EU counterpart over the country\u0026rsquos withdrawal from the bloc. He has been noted by former colleagues for his \u0026ldquotough, resilient approach. His role as Brexit Secretary was crucial to ensuring Britain leaves the EU next year with what Mrs May described as the \u0026ldquobest possible deal.  So what does this mean for the PM?  It\u0026rsquos hard to imagine a more potentially crippling blow to her premiership. Following a long weekend which started with extended talks over the country\u0026rsquos future relationship with the EU at Mrs May\u0026rsquos Chequers country pad, an agreed strategy met the backing of her Cabinet. It seemed like the most damaging line to emerge from the summit was Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson\u0026rsquos description of the plans as a \u0026ldquoturd. But as the weekend grew older, dissenting voices from the Tory backbenches grew louder. In short, the PM is facing the prospect of steering the country towards the biggest political junction in a generation without her captain at the helm.  Was Davis\u0026rsquos departure telegraphed?  The Brexit Secretary was understood to have serious reservations about both the plan and whether it could be acceptable to Brussels following the Chequers summit, but was absent from the television studios in the aftermath of the talks. He has been close to the exit door on a number of occasions in recent months. Last year reports emerged that Davis said he intended to \u0026ldquoretire in 2019 and leave the transitional period of Britain\u0026rsquos exit from the European Union to Boris Johnson, something later dismissed as a \u0026ldquolighthearted remark.  Is Davis the first of many?  There was a feeling that any departure \u0026ndash be it immediately after the summit or once the EU made it clear Britain\u0026rsquos terms were unacceptable \u0026ndash could trigger a series of resignations from the front benches, particularly from hardliners. Mrs May must be expecting others to go with Davis, and will be particularly keen to know what the likes of Mr Johnson and fellow Brexiteer Andrea Leadsom intend to do now.  Could it get any worse for the PM?  Yes. An avalanche of departures would surely trigger a leadership contest in the Tory party. Simply, if the Prime Minister cannot unite her Cabinet and convince them over the Brexit negotiations, she has no chance of getting the EU to agree to the terms."},{"url":null,"title":"alan-roden-should-scots-support-england-no-it-only-makes-victory-sweeter-for-us","story":"  I sat my final exam at college in the morning before heading to a pub where happy hour pints were just \u0026pound1.  There were Saltires hanging above the bar, and a raucous crowd that erupted in cheers when John Collins scored a penalty to level the game against the eventual champions.  The pub was in York the audience was largely English.  Growing up in northern England, it never occurred to me not to support Scotland, or any of the home nations. Why wouldn\u0026rsquot I?  Unless we were playing each other, of course.  I am a passionate England fan it was Italia \u0026rsquo90 that hooked me. I couldn\u0026rsquot watch the Egypt game live so I recorded it on VHS and watched it in full when I got home. I watched the Cameroon quarter final \u0026ndash the last time England won at that level before Saturday - on a black-and-white TV in my aunt\u0026rsquos farmhouse, and was allowed to stay up late to watch the West Germany semi-final on a tiny TV in my bedroom, before crying myself to sleep.  The first poster on my bedroom wall was of Gary Lineker I\u0026rsquoll never forget watching Gazza play against Sweden at Elland Road in the Umbro tournament in 1995 I had to be picked up off the floor outside a Corfu bar in 1998 because I was inconsolable when Argentina knocked us out on penalties in the knockout stages.  Then, perhaps unwisely for such a diehard England fan, I moved to Scotland.  England\u0026rsquos next tournament game was in Euro 2000, against Portugal. I watched it in a bar in Edinburgh and it was my first real experience of the Anyone But England (ABE) phenomenon.  When Portugal came back from 2-0 down to win the game, the cheers and cries of \"sunny Portugal, we\u0026rsquoll support you ever more\" were deafening.  For someone who grew up in England, yet always supported Scotland, it stunned me. I simply wasn\u0026rsquot prepared for the animosity. I was bitter and upset.  But that was then this is now. Nearly two decades on, I get it, and I revel in it. It\u0026rsquos a footballing rivalry and it\u0026rsquos a healthy one. I even felt comfortable enough to watch last year\u0026rsquos Scotland v England game in the home end at Hampden.  I watched England\u0026rsquos World Cup game against Panama in an Edinburgh bar. There were fans in England tops bellowing out \"It\u0026rsquos Coming Home\", while others cheered Panama\u0026rsquos consolation goal as if it had been scored by Leigh Griffiths himself. It was a cracking atmosphere, with no hint of tension.  Traditionally, of course, it\u0026rsquos the ABE crowd which has more fun. Like the time Frank Lampard\u0026rsquos goal against Germany was disallowed and we went on to lose 4-1. Or the time Portugal knocked us out on penalties. Correction: times, plural.  The pain of defeat has hurt over the years, but boy is this tournament is making up for it.  Every two years the same debate takes place: should Scots support the Auld Enemy?  There are those who insist Scots should back England, arguing that to do otherwise is embarrassing. I\u0026rsquom not one of them \u0026ndash it makes victory even sweeter for us.  There are those \u0026ndash mainly politicians \u0026ndash who pick another team for spurious reasons. The correct choice for politicians whose nation is not playing is that they\u0026rsquore not supporting anyone, precisely because their nation is not playing.  And there are those who watch every England game in the hope of a humiliating defeat for the Three Lions.  This contingent is smaller than in previous years, and some put that down to the humility of Gareth Southgate and his young squad. Yet perhaps a bigger reason is we now have a generation of Scotland fans who have never known qualification for a major tournament, making rooting for England\u0026rsquos opponents all the more futile.  In the binary world of post-indyref Scotland, where everyone is forced to be a Unionist or a Nationalist, it is inevitable that politics poisons the football debate.  In a newspaper column last week, the pro-independence columnist Lesley Riddoch wrote: \u0026ldquoAs Scotland finds its new place in the North Atlantic and the league of small, energy-rich European states, our age-old enmity with England will become utterly irrelevant.  Completely failing to understand that the enmity is to do with a footballing rivalry, not the constitution, does she actually think independence involves sawing along the border and allowing Scotland to float off in the direction of Iceland?  She added: \u0026ldquoOne day, football and the constitutional question in Scotland will be equally disconnected.  It always has been, Lesley, and it\u0026rsquos only fanatical nationalists who make it otherwise.  Among real fans, there is no link between constitutional preference and support or otherwise for England. Some of the most vociferous ABE backers I know are diehard Tories.  It is perfectly acceptable to want Scotland to be part of the UK and to want England to be crushed on the football pitch. It\u0026rsquos also perfectly acceptable to want Scotland to leave the UK and to want England to win on the football pitch.  Or any combination of the above: there are no strict rules.  You don\u0026rsquot get much more passionate about independence than the SNP\u0026rsquos former Westminster leader Angus Robertson, who tweeted this week: \u0026ldquoAbsolutely delighted for England, all English fans, friends and relations. Congratulations.  Oh how the SNP misses him in the Commons.  It\u0026rsquos hard to imagine Angus would have resorted to such petty antics as his successor Ian Blackford and colleagues did last week, when they repeatedly dawdled through the voting lobby and ensured English MPs and Commons staff missed the Colombia game.  A healthy rivalry should not involve sabotage. Just imagine if Scotland had qualified for the tournament and English MPs pulled the same stunt during a crunch match.  So it\u0026rsquos the semi-final against Croatia on Wednesday. Nearly three decades since the last time England reached this stage. Just like Gazza in Turin, it\u0026rsquoll probably end in tears.  But maybe, just maybe, Southgate\u0026rsquos men really are going to bring football home. After all those penalty defeats, all the failures of the \"golden generation\", all the crushed dreams, what absolute joy that will bring me \u0026ndash and what pain it will bring for so many Scotland fans.  I absolutely can\u0026rsquot wait."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8041789.jpg?type=article-full","title":"tribute-to-greatest-test-pilot-can-help-youngsters-dreams-take-off","story":"  Now Captain Eric \u0026ldquoWinkle Brown is to be honoured with the creation of a flying scholarship in his name for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.  Two years after he died at the age of 97, the most decorated pilot in the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) has been permanently honoured with a statue at Edinburgh Airport, his old base.  And there are additional plans for a more far-reaching memorial to the Leith-born aviator, with the scholarship being considered by a group of former pilots connected to his old university.    Eric Brown in a Wildcat, one of the 487 different types of aircraft he flew \u0026ndash a world record  The ex-pilots from the Edinburgh University Air Squadron Association (EUASA) got together to raise the funds for the life-sized bronze statue of Captain Brown, by Scottish sculptor David Annand.  Now Dr Hamish Macleod, chairman of EUASA, said the squadron also wants to put the scholarship in place to allow young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to access light aircraft flying.  He said: \u0026ldquoWinkle was not only a man who loved to fly, but he also inspired a generation of pilots with his modest good humour and outstanding courage. The statue of him outside Edinburgh Airport will give the many thousands of passengers the opportunity to reflect on this Scottish hero who can inspire us all.  \u0026ldquoWinkle\u0026rsquos legacy can also bring a life-changing experience to today\u0026rsquos youngsters assisting them to learn to fly, or simply experiencing the thrill of flying in small aircraft.  The squadron raised \u0026pound50,000 for the statue and are bidding to raise a further \u0026pound50,000 to set up scholarships, with the estimated cost to achieve solo flying standard being \u0026pound3,000.  Captain Brown\u0026rsquos own flying experience started with a bumpy but exhilarating ride in his father\u0026rsquos First World War Royal Flying Corps bi-plane, which sowed the seed of ambition in an eager eight-year-old.  He learned to fly himself at the earliest opportunity he could after leaving Fettes College as a student at Edinburgh University, which was an RAF recruitment route.    Prince Andrew unveiled statue of Captain Eric Brown  During his early adventures, he saw Hitler\u0026rsquos oratory at the 1936 Berlin Olympics with his father and at one stage in his life managed to sing with the Glenn Miller band.  He became a British Royal Navy officer after training at RAF Turnhouse, now Edinburgh Airport, in the late 1930s and came to be affectionately called Winkle, short for periwinkle, by his friends because of his physical stature.  His most amazing achievements were in his role as a Royal Navy test pilot, during which he pioneered the perfecting of breakneck aircraft carrier deck landings.  Captain Brown holds the world record for flying the greatest number of different types of aircraft, a total of 487, which is a feat unlikely to be rivalled. The highly-decorated pilot also holds the world record for landings on aircraft carriers, at 2,407, and for take-offs on aircraft carriers, at 2,721.  Also in action, he used his language skills to interview Luftwaffe chief Hermann Goering, and was among those who liberated Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.  He flew home a rocket-powered enemy aircraft, a Messerschmitt Me 163B-1a Komet, back to Britain from Germany after the aircraft was captured in 1945.    Sir John Elvidge, chairman of Edinburgh Airport, said: \u0026ldquoCaptain Eric \u0026lsquoWinkle\u0026rsquo Brown is a someone who is synonymous with RAF Turnhouse and, in turn, a key figure in the history of what is now Edinburgh Airport.  \u0026ldquoHis achievements speak for themselves and the fact his remarkable career is still held in such high regard after all these years is testament to the man himself.  \u0026ldquoWe are proud of the connection between Edinburgh Airport and the RAF and we want people to share that by learning about this truly inspiring man who served his country with great honour, and this statue is a small token of thanks to him and his legacy.  The statue to honour Leith-born Captain Brown was unveiled at Edinburgh Airport by the Duke of York, who himself served as a pilot in the Royal Navy for almost 20 years and now holds the rank of Vice Admiral.  The pilot has also received high praise from British astronaut Tim Peake who when he died tweeted a tribute from the International Space Station saying Capt Brown was \u0026ldquoto my mind the greatest test pilot who has ever lived.  First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir George Zambellas, said when Captain Brown died that he was one of the Royal Navy\u0026rsquos greats.  Paying tribute after his death, he said: \u0026ldquoThe Fleet Air Arm may have lost one of its finest and best-known pilots, but British aviation has lost something even greater \u0026ndash the most accomplished test pilot of his generation and perhaps of all time, and a huge advocate of military aviation.  His family said in a statement released after his death: \u0026ldquoEric was the most decorated pilot of the Fleet Air Arm, in which service he was universally known as \u0026lsquoWinkle\u0026rsquo on account of his diminutive stature.  \u0026ldquoHe also held three absolute Guinness World Records, including for the number of aircraft carrier deck landings and types of aeroplane flown."},{"url":null,"title":"boost-for-electric-vehicle-charge-points-to-be-announced","story":"  Chris Grayling will unveil proposals that could lead to the installation of hundreds of thousands more charge points for electric vehicles to encourage more people to adopt ultra low-emission vehicles.  The initiatives included in the Government\u0026rsquos Road to Zero Strategy include more money to fund charging infrastructure and the need to assess whether new homes and offices should be required to install charge points as standard.  The strategy calls for new street lighting columns on UK roads with on-street parking to have charging points in appropriate locations.  The Government is also expected to outline more details of its ban on sales of new conventional petrol and diesel cars and vans from 2040.  Alternatively-fuelled vehicles such as hybrids and pure electrics held just 5.5% of the UK\u0026rsquos new car market in the first six months of the year, compared with 4.2% during the same period in 2017.  Launching the Government\u0026rsquos plans to boost take-up of the technology, Mr Grayling will say: \u0026ldquoThe Road to Zero Strategy, combined with the measures we\u0026rsquove already introduced, will mean Britain now has one of the most comprehensive support packages for zero-emission vehicles in the world.  \u0026ldquoWe want the UK to become the best country in the world in which to develop and manufacture zero-emission vehicles.  \u0026ldquoThe prize is not just a cleaner and healthier environment but a UK economy fit for the future and the chance to win a substantial slice of a market estimated to be worth up to \u0026pound7.6 trillion by 2050.  A study for motoring research charity the RAC Foundation found that growth in electric car use could be stalled by limitations in the public charging network.  The mass market appeal of ultra-green vehicles may be restricted without widespread, reliable and easy-to-use charging points, the report warned.  Separate AA research shows that eight out of 10 drivers see the lack of charging points as a stumbling block for them to buy an electric vehicle.  The motoring firm\u0026rsquos president Edmund King said: \u0026ldquoA big push on a range of slow, fast and rapid charging points should help overcome this hurdle.  \u0026ldquoThe challenge is then for manufacturers to make a car worth buying.  \u0026ldquoThese Road to Vision Zero proposals are a step in the right direction but there is still much to do to wean drivers off petrol and diesel cars."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-government-urged-to-propose-practical-alternatives-over-irish-border","story":"  The UK in a Changing Europe released a detailed assessment of what the British Government must address in its Brexit white paper after UK Cabinet ministers agreed to a plan on Friday.  Professor David Phinnemore, professor of European politics at Queen\u0026rsquos University Belfast, contributed to the wide-ranging report in which he addressed the most pressing issues involving Brexit and the Republic of Ireland.  The report argues that Downing Street must provide a credible plan for a customs relationship, setting out a proposal that is acceptable to the EU and is feasible both practically and financially.  It said that while it acknowledges the significant political constraints within which Prime Minister Theresa May is having to act, the UK Government cannot \u0026ldquocherry-pick parts of the single market.  The report states that the UK will have to shift its red lines or accept an inferior deal.  The 36-page report, which was written by leading academics, also states that Mrs May\u0026rsquos Government must allow for continued North-South co-operation in the island of Ireland.  It also states that it should \u0026ldquopropose what kind of governance and dispute settlement arrangement it wants and decide on the institutions it wants to govern future relations with the EU as well as setting out details on the UK\u0026rsquos own governance arrangements.  The report adds: \u0026ldquoThe white paper must address the often conflicting interests within and between sectors addressing the high levels of uncertainty afflicting a number of economic sectors including fisheries and agriculture.  \u0026ldquoIt must choose its preferred model for managing the financial sector and recognise a trade-off between regulatory autonomy and access to EU markets in financial services and indicate what the choice will be."},{"url":null,"title":"island-vigil-for-alesha-macphail","story":"  Local people gathered to light candles for the six-year-old in Rothesay\u0026rsquos Guildford Square on Sunday evening.

Mr Pompeo downplayed North Korea\u0026rsquos statement after the talks in which the country\u0026rsquos foreign ministry bashed hopes for a quick deal and accused the US of making \u0026ldquogangster-like demands aimed at forcing it to abandon nuclear weapons.  The North\u0026rsquos statement, coming so soon after Mr Pompeo\u0026rsquos trip, was sure to fuel growing scepticism in the US over how serious Mr Kim is about giving up his nuclear arsenal.  \u0026ldquoIf those requests were gangster-like, the world is a gangster, Mr Pompeo said, noting that numerous UN Security Council resolutions have demanded that the North rid itself of nuclear weapons and end its ballistic missile program.  \u0026ldquoPeople are going to make stray comments after meetings, Mr Pompeo said.  \u0026ldquoIf I paid attention to the press, I\u0026rsquod go nuts.  Speaking after meeting with his Japanese and South Korean counterparts in Tokyo, Mr Pompeo said his two days of talks in Pyongyang had been productive and conducted in good faith.  But following the stinging commentary from the North, he allowed that the goal of denuclearisation would be difficult and that much work remains.  Two days of talks with senior North Korean officials had \u0026ldquomade progress, he said, and included a \u0026ldquodetailed and substantive discussion about the next steps.  Those include the formation of working group to determine exactly how North Korea\u0026rsquos denuclearisation will be verified and a Thursday meeting with Pentagon officials to discuss the return of remains of Americans soldiers killed during the Korean War.  Mr Pompeo sought to dispel suggestions that the Trump administration has backed down from demanding the complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement of the North\u0026rsquos nuclear weapons.  He said North Korea understood that denuclearisation must be \u0026ldquocomplete and \u0026ldquoverified.  However, Mr Pompeo said the progress achieved thus far did not warrant any concessions.          Today I met with #Japan \u0026lsquos PM @AbeShinzo to discuss #DPRK \u0026amp the US-Japan alliance.

After the historic US-North Korea summit in Singapore, President Donald Trump declared the North was no longer a threat and would hand over the remains of American soldiers.  Yet three weeks later, the two sides were still divided on all the issues, including exactly what denuclearisation means and how it might be verified.  And, the promised remains have yet to be delivered.  Just hours after Mr Pompeo arrived in Tokyo, the North blasted the discussions, saying the visit had been \u0026ldquoregrettable.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin. He pointed out that Wick is 33 kilometres from the wind farm while Fraserburgh is 70km away.\u0026ldquoWe wish Fraserburgh and Moray East well and will continue to develop Wick harbour, Mr Watt said. \u0026ldquoWe will move forward on a strong footing in the renewables market as well as in the fishing and cargo sectors.He added that work on the BOWL base is progressing well and will create upwards of 150 jobs.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay said: \u0026ldquoIt is very disappointing news. Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general. I hope we can bring lots of jobs and apprenticeships to the area.Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was \u0026ldquovery disappointed by the decision as the Wick harbour team has worked \u0026ldquoextremely hard to make the port an attractive base.\u0026ldquoAs the larger of the two offshore wind projects proposed for this area, it would have been a significant boost to the harbour and the region to have MORL based here, she said.But she added: \u0026ldquoIt has been fantastic to see the progress made at Wick harbour this year in preparing for the Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Ltd operations and maintenance contract, and we look forward to the benefits this will bring to the area.Eann Sinclair, programme manager for the Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership, was also disappointed by the decision.

He will be succeeded by Ian Ross, the former East Sutherland and Edderton Highland councillor.Sir Anthony\u0026rsquos decision to step down ends a long association with the area which started in 1993 when he was appointed as chairman of the then UK Atomic Energy Authority. He later chaired AEA Technology and in 2004 took on the role of leading the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) which was responsible for decommissioning Dounreay.In 2008, the then local MP John Thurso asked Sir Anthony to chair Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership. He took on the role and says it has been \u0026ldquoan honour and a privilege to do it.\u0026ldquoI have enjoyed all my time here in my various jobs, he said. \u0026ldquoI do think the partnership has made a major contribution.\u0026ldquoTen years ago the mood was pretty depressed. People were very gloomy. I would say the mood now has changed and is pretty optimistic, although there are challenges. That will always be the case.\u0026ldquoThe big advantage we have here is that it will be a number of years before Dounreay is closed so we had an opportunity to plan for the future. If it had been a car plant it would have been closed in three months.Sir Anthony highlights positive developments such as the improvements at Scrabster and Wick harbours as well as the pioneering MeyGen tidal energy project and the Beatrice offshore wind farm.The North Coast 500 is also making an impact and bringing economic opportunities to the area. The Nucleus archive across from Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport is another plus for Caithness, he adds. Sir Anthony played a part in bringing the facility to the county during his time as chairman of the NDA.Engineering and environmental courses at North Highland College UHI can also help regenerate the Caithness economy. \u0026ldquoThere are real opportunities here, he declared.Improving infrastructure and transport links in the far north are key to helping the area\u0026rsquos economy. Good schools and hospitals are another factor.\u0026ldquoI think the partnership has made a real contribution in the last 10 years, Sir Anthony said. \u0026ldquoWe have worked with other agencies to help create around 1000 jobs over that time but we all had to work together to do it. I am very pleased to see progress being made.Sir Anthony feels it is important to make Caithness as \u0026ldquoattractive as possible for people to come and work in the area.\u0026ldquoThere are still issues to be addressed but, overall, I think significant progress has been made. We played a part but it has always been a contributory role. The partnership is an enabler. The Scottish government has said this area could be an example for other places to follow.Sir Anthony says there is an expertise at Dounreay which \u0026ldquoa lot of places would give their eye teeth to have and it could be used to help the local economy.Caithness strengths are its people, their skills and the natural beauty of the place, but access to the area needs to be improved.Asked about any disappointments during his time as chairman of the partnership, he replied: \u0026ldquoI hoped MeyGen would have got the Contract for Difference \u0026ndash it covers an agreement on the price for the electricity generated \u0026ndash from the UK government, but they did not. That was disappointing. They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor. I have had discussions with him and would be willing to help him in any way I can.Sir Anthony, who is 80, will keep a watchful eye on what is happening in Caithness and plans to stay active with his many other interests and hobbies. He enjoys opera, and swims five times a week.He started his career as a systems engineer with IBM in 1962 and went on to become its chief executive and chairman.Sir Anthony and his wife Jennie live in London and have a son, Paul, and a daughter, Caroline.Monday 9 Jul 2018 6:44 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Subsea 7 order hailed as very good news for Caithness","story":"A MULTIMILLION-pound order that has been won by Subsea 7 and will create up to 130 jobs was described yesterday as \u0026ldquovery good news for Caithness.The company has been awarded a contract by Shell for a development at its Penguins field which lies 150 miles north east of Shetland.Subsea 7, which has yards at Wester and Hastigrow, will build two pipeline bundles in Caithness as part of the deal. One is 4.6 kilometres long and the other 2.7 kilometres.They will be used by Shell to develop the potential reserves in the Penguins field.Subsea7\u0026rsquos local site manager, Willie Watt, said: \u0026ldquoWe would be looking to make a start on this project by the autumn of next year and launch in the late spring of 2020.\u0026ldquoThis is very good news for the site and for Caithness. It is a testament to the capabilities of the people and the product that major companies keep coming back to us.The confirmation of the latest contract comes just months after Subsea 7 won an order from Statoil for its Snorre oil and gas field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. Its total value was said to be between \u0026pound150 million and \u0026pound300m.Work on that contract is expected to get under way in September with three launches due to be completed by November next year.The orders will see the company\u0026rsquos local workforce increase from around 30, at present, to up to 160.\u0026ldquoThis will give us continual work in Caithness until 2020, although there will be peaks and troughs along the way \u0026ndash but this is great news all round, Mr Watt added.Jonathan Tame, company vice president for the UK and Canada, said: \u0026ldquoWe are pleased to have the opportunity to bring our extensive expertise to a project of this importance.\u0026ldquoIn doing so it demonstrates Shell\u0026rsquos confidence in our value-adding solutions, and continues a successful North Sea collaboration that has been in place since 1984.The Penguins field was discovered in 1974 and first developed in 2002.The three pipeline bundles for Statoil will involve the largest diameter pipe assembled in the far north.The bulk of the fabrication will be done in Caithness, with design and project management work due to be undertaken at Subsea7\u0026rsquos premises in Aberdeen and at Stavanger in Norway.At the time that order was announced in December last year, Mr Watt said: \u0026ldquoIt is good to have Statoil back. The last bundle we did for them was in 2003.\u0026ldquoIt is an important project and shows pipeline bundles are the preference for developing the North Sea sector. It is the right product at the right time.The Statoil order will include pipeline bundles and control umbilicals required for the development.The Snorre field is sited within the Tampen area of the Norwegian North Sea.Since the last pipeline was launched in Caithness in March last year, the company has refurbished the rail track which is used to transport the bundles to the sea and on to the tugs before being taken to their destination.Monday 9 Jul 2018 6:44 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116401.jpg","title":"Sunny conditions set to continue all week in Caithness","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCAITHNESS and other parts of the north are set to enjoy more dry and settled conditions under gin-blue skies coupled with virtually unbroken sunshine for the remainder of the week and beyond.On Sunday afternoon the air temperature in Wick peaked at 21.6C (70.9F).\u0026nbspLast Thursday morning the town witnessed a high of 22.5C (72.5F), making it the warmest day in the burgh for any day in June since 2011.The highest temperature recorded in Wick since 1910 is currently 26.7C (80.1F), witnessed on June 6, 1939.

The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism.

This follows a wave of criticism towards bus services in the county, which saw members of the public brand Stagecoach \u0026#8220a disgrace.\u0026#8221The hearing was called to consider failings in relation to the provision of contracted school services and local bus services, many of which were caused by vehicle breakdowns. The traffic commissioner was concerned about the standard of vehicle roadworthiness and presentation.In particular she heard evidence from the Stagecoach Managing Director in Scotland, Mr Robert Andrew, who took the opportunity to apologise in public to OIC officials for the company’s failures. The inquiry also saw representatives from the council give evidence.After hearing this evidence, as well as making a visit to the bus operator’s Kirkwall depot, Miss Aitken also made an order to reduce the number of vehicles authorised on licence held by Highland Country Buses Ltd — the subsidiary of Stagecoach which serves the Highlands and Islands. Of the 210 vehicles which had been licensed, 30 will  now be unlicensed until Miss Aitken is satisfied with the compliance of the company to its licenses and contracts.In response to this, Stagecoach North Scotland managing director, David Liston, said: \u0026#8220We understand the importance of reliable and high-quality bus services to local communities in the Highlands and Islands.\u0026#8220Since these issues arose, we have taken steps to ensure that there are robust maintenance and operational processes in place across our business in the north of Scotland, and we are continuing to focus in particular on fleet reliability and presentation.\u0026#8220We understand the frustrations local people have at times expressed and we would like to reassure our customers that we are working hard to deliver better bus services. In her decision, the Traffic Commissioner has asked that we make a contribution totalling £20,500 to the schools in Orkney, and we are happy to do so.\u0026#8220We are currently arranging for this sum to be paid to Orkney Islands Council for onward payment to the schools.\u0026#8221The Traffic commissioner has clarified that this payment of  £20,500 is not compensatory in nature and does not affect any contractual obligations between the Council and Stagecoach. It is, rather, an ex gratia payment. The Traffic Commissioner decided on this course of action rather than ordering a payment to be made to Scottish Government.This sum is to be split between schools in the county:Orkney Islands Council has responded positively to this decision by the traffic commissioner.\u0026#8220We welcome the outcome of the public inquiry called by the Traffic Commissioner held in Kirkwall on June 5, particularly the decision to distribute the payment locally to our schools,\u0026#8221 a council spokeswoman said.\u0026#8220We’ll continue to work closely with the Traffic Commissioner and Stagecoach on service improvements.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Each of the three winding barrels will have a small motor fitted, and a sensor, which will automatically detect when the clock has wound down to a certain level. In addition, the clock will also be fitted with a pendulum regulator, which will ensure the clock time is more accurate.Cathedral custodian Fran Hollinrake said: \u0026#8220It is the end of an era. It was always a great workout climbing the tower stairs and manually winding the clock, but it was just becoming too impractical with all our other duties. The clock will still be the clock, it will just have a couple of new bits added on.\u0026#8221The previous clock on St Magnus Cathedral dated from 1761, and was made by Hugh Gordon, a clockmaker in Aberdeen. But during the early 20th century, as part of the Sheriff Thoms bequest, a new timepiece was commissioned that would see the cathedral through the 20th century and beyond. The present clock was made when the world was at war, in 1915, although it was not actually installed until 1919, the same week that the Treaty of Versailles was signed that ended the First World War.James Ritchie and Son (Clockmakers) was founded in 1809, and the company specialised in large steeple and public clocks, both making and restoring. If you are familiar with Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh, you will know the world-famous Floral Clock, not far from Waverley Station. It was made in 1903 by Ritchie\u0026#8217s, and was the first of its kind in the world.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Pam\u0026rsquos paintings are absolutely fantastic and we hope this event is a great success.\"Since the age of 63, Pam\u0026nbsphas painted hundreds of pictures, been a member of art groups and exhibited locally.Until recently she also\u0026nbspknitted clothes for infants in the special baby unit at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness and was a puzzle enthusiast, winning the Ross-shire Journal crossword at the age of 99.She celebrated her 100th birthday surrounded by friends and family at the Church of Scotland Hall in the village last year after a neighbour of 36 years\u0026rsquo standing, Joyce Fraser, decided to organise something special to mark the milestone event.Mrs Foster was also joined by friends from the local WRI and art group, along with\u0026nbspstaff and residents of the care home she was about to move to. Mrs Foster\u0026rsquos nieces and nephews from as far afield as the Canary Islands, Edinburgh, Liverpool and Sussex headed north for the event.Her birthday cake, baked by a relative, was shaped as an artist\u0026rsquos palette to represent one of her great passions in life.Mrs Foster was born in Surrey and spent her childhood with her three siblings in Kent, where her father had a grocery business.She started her working life in an office at a department store and then worked as a secretary mainly with legal firms, in England and Edinburgh.Mrs Foster said she and her husband Tony had been \"gradually moving up the country\" before settling in their cottage in Muir of Ord. Her husband passed away in January 2012.Asked the secret of her long life, she said: \"I\u0026rsquove been asked this before and I always say \u0026lsquopure living\u0026rsquo, but of course it\u0026rsquos not! I\u0026rsquove lived a normal sort of life and I\u0026rsquove been lucky, particularly with my health.\"In recent years she has taken up using an iPad, can send emails and enjoys playing Candy Crush.Exhibition and sale days at The Muir Hub, which is on Great North Road, will be staged until\u0026nbspThursday between 9.30am and 4pm.Monday 9 Jul 2018 6:45 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It is not clear why the paving moved but the extreme heat is suspected to be the cause.\"Meanwhile, emergency services were also called into action to tackle wildfires, including one in the Coulhill area of Alness on Tuesday.Firefighters were called to the scene of the 1000sqm blaze at around 10.30am, and remained on the scene for several hours before the fire was brought under control.And farmers in the area have voiced concerns that straw supplies could be set to run out amid the ongoing dry spell, with the National Farmers\u0026rsquo Union urging members to be proactive in negotiating reasonable prices.Monday 9 Jul 2018 6:45 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765869.1531085068!/image/image.jpg","title":"london city airport set for campaign to take more passengers","story":"        London City Airport is considering an application to raise limits on flights and passenger numbers, its boss has revealed.                Chief executive Robert Sinclair believes the airport will approach existing caps on its operations in the next three to four years.            A campaign group pledged to “fight tooth and nail” any bid to ease the restrictions.            Mr Sinclair said London City could play an increasingly vital role in providing vital runway capacity in the south-east as Heathrow’s expansion is not due to be completed until 2026 at the earliest.“In the fullness of the next year or two we will be reflecting on the future and life beyond our current planning caps,” Mr Sinclair said.“We will be considering the potential options, which could include raising the caps.”London City is for now limited to 6.5 million passengers and 111,000 flights a year.Annual passenger numbers have grown by 50 per cent since 2012 and are expected to exceed five million next year. Annual air traffic movements stand at around 80,000.            Any bid to increase operational caps would be made to Newham Council.Some people living nearby already protest against the noise and air pollution linked to the airport’s operations.John Stewart, chairman of campaign group Hacan East, said: “Local residents would fight tooth and nail any attempt by London City to raise its limits on flights and passengers.“Many of them feel their lives are already blighted by planes from the airport. The preservation of the current cap is the reddest of red lines for residents and, I suspect, for many local authorities.”            Heathrow has faced fierce opposition from anti-expansion campaigners for many years as it seeks permission  to build a third runway. The airport won a parliamentary vote on the plans last month.A £480 million programme is already under way at London City to enhance its facilities.This will include eight new aircraft stands, the UK’s first digital air traffic control tower, a full-length parallel taxiway and extending the terminal building.British Airways has moved its Paris Orly flights from Heathrow to London City.

The screen’s too small, the sound’s terrible and, frankly, nobody much enjoyed watching that last match round at your place.            There’s only one thing for it: you’re going to have to shell out a couple of grand on a new one.            Unfortunately, you’ve already spent the last of your savings on lottery tickets and artisan gin so the need for a TV simply cannot be met with the \u2028resources you have available. So what do you do?You could do the right thing and save a bit, maybe buy a new flat-screen next year, or you could, I suppose, stroll confidently into John Lewis, unhook a fancy Sony from the wall and march out with it under your arm.And, if a security guard stopped you by the front door, you could try explaining that it was the will of the people that you had a new TV.You wouldn’t do that, though, would you? There’s a law against you stealing things, even when you really, really want them. If you get caught in the act, you don’t get to keep your ill-gotten gains, you get to visit your local police station and you get to have a criminal record that might well ruin your life.Steal a referendum result, on the other hand, and – even if you get caught – you get to keep your winnings.            READ MORE: Official Brexit campaign ‘broke electoral law’Last week, the Vote Leave campaign, which celebrated victory in the 2016 EU referendum, leaked news that the Electoral Commission was set to find it breached electoral law during the Brexit referendum.In what appeared to be an effort to take back control of this particular story, this particular group of  Brexiteers let it be known that the commission had accused them of breaking their official spending limit of £7 million by passing donations to another campaign group – BeLeave – with which it was allegedly co-ordinating operations.If, indeed, Vote Leave did break electoral law during the campaign, one might be forgiven for expecting that there would be some pretty serious consequences.             After all, ignoring the law in order to win a referendum that will change the course of British history might be considered a more serious matter than half-inching a telly.If the law on spending limits – put in place (and here’s a laugh) to stop the wealthy simply buying victories – really meant anything, there would be police involvement. As it is, this piece of civil, rather than criminal, law is utterly worthless.The toughest sanction available to the electoral commission is the imposition of a fine of up to £20,000. To a millionaire campaigner willing to ignore the law, that might seem like very good value indeed.The spin from pro-Brexit politicians, campaigners, and commentators is that none of this had any impact on the result of the referendum a majority would have voted Leave, regardless of the amount any of the participants had spent. If this is so, one wonders why they felt the need to spend anything on the campaign at all.Remainers hoping that the Electoral Commission’s findings might have some impact on the result are to be disappointed.             It’s no wonder Vote Leave was so relaxed about revealing some of the detail of its own alleged misdeeds.But this scandal – and it is a bloody scandal, regardless of how it might be dismissed by the braying Brexiteers of Little England – should have consequences for future elections and referendums. It is time for spending on campaigns to be a matter of criminal rather than civil law.I fear, however, that we will see little appetite for this necessary change from the main political parties.It is an open secret that participants in elections regularly ignore the rules and regulations that are supposed to ensure financial fair play. As one campaigner put it to me last week: “We all do it and nobody wants to make an issue of it. If we start throwing accusations at our opponents, they’ll start throwing accusations at us. Everyone’s hands are dirty.”This cosy, all-in-the-sewer-together understanding makes a mockery of already toothless legislation surrounding spending limits.An especially bleak irony of the electoral commission’s findings, as leaked by Vote Leave, is that the Brexit campaign was driven by a populist message that departure from the EU would empower those who felt left behind by “political elites” or “the establishment” when the reality, it appears, is that the only people truly empowered by it are a financial elite whose contempt for the law (for what it is currently worth, which is nothing) is out there in the open, now, for all to see.When those who value “Britishness” talk about what it actually means, they will tell you that they pride themselves on our collective sense of fair play.If those Brexiteers who made so much about British values during the 2016 campaign truly meant what they say, they would be clamouring for a re-run of the referendum. A result obtained by murky means, with the law ignored, is surely fundamentally un-British, isn’t it?Anyone who dares to question the validity of a victory secured by a campaign that broke electoral law should expect to be dismissed as an out-of-touch “Remoaner”. The rag-bag of libertarians, right-wing obsessives, and downright racists who are currently pushing for Brexit at any cost will have their way.I can’t see any good reason that anyone – regardless of their political position – would oppose turning the regulation of campaign funding from a civil to a criminal matter. After all, don’t we all want to ensure the high standards politicians talk about to be a reality rather than just another bit of meaningless spin?The EU referendum result will have consequences for generations to come. Those who secured that victory may consider themselves very fortunate indeed that the law governing the way the referendum was conducted is meaningless."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4765532.1530903746!/image/image.jpg","title":"john mclellan closing private schools makes inequality worse","story":"        Pricing out middle-class will create ever-more exclusive institutions, writes John McLellan.                Class warriors of the nation rejoice: one bourgeois institution down, just 69 to go. That bastion of inequality and privilege in Central Scotland, Beaconhurst School, is no more. Cliftonhall, Lomond, St Columba’s ... we’re coming for you next.            In the face of increasing pressure on costs and fees, and the prospect of the loss of charitable rates relief in 2020-21, Beaconhurst announced a merger with Morrison’s Academy, 20 miles away in Crieff, with the hope that its Bridge of Allan campus could be maintained for its junior school pupils in a satellite operation.            But by Wednesday the game was up. The school conceded the exodus of families making their own arrangements – many would have been put off by the prospect of a 40-mile round-trip to the senior school and Dollar Academy is nearer – meant the deal was no longer viable. Beaconhurst will cease to exist and the buildings will probably be sold for development, almost certainly houses, given how quickly a nearby Cala estate sold out. Regular trains to Glasgow and Edinburgh mean Bridge of Allan and Dunblane properties go for Edinburgh prices.Beaconhurst joins Westbourne, Laurel Bank, St Denis and Cranley and, eight years ago, St Margaret’s in Edinburgh, on the list of defunct private schools and it won’t be the last if the rate of fee increases continues to outstrip earnings and closes off the option for more families. Not that independent schools ever expect much sympathy from the Scottish political establishment, but in the last academic year the sector has been subjected to sustained pressure, particularly the confirmation in December of the Scottish Government’s plan to end charitable rates relief.READ MORE: Beaconhurst school in Bridge of Allan ‘likely to close’ following mergerThe argument that the tax change only addressed an anomaly – whereby state schools did not receive rates relief and paid the full amount – was a red herring because the payment was just an accounting device in which councils effectively paid themselves from one part of their books to another.            With a bill totalling about £5m a year for the sector, the impact on fees has been estimated at between £200-£300 a year on day fees of £12,000, or about two per cent. With fee increases now running well ahead of inflation, such as the five per cent just announced at George Watson’s, by the time charitable relief disappears senior school day fees could easily be hitting £14,000. For families with two children at senior school, finding £28,000 represents a net weekly income of £538 which is just £56 below the average UK household income, according to the latest “Living Standards, Poverty and Inequality” report from the Institute of Fiscal Studies. On the reasonable presumption that the average UK family does not have two kids at private school, it’s a fair guess that to meet school fees on top of all other living costs will require a net weekly income of just over £1,000, which is into the top five percent of earnings and a gross income in the region of £70,000. Even in a wealthy city like Edinburgh where a quarter of the total school population, over 11,000 children, are privately educated, that’s a lot of families who have to be right at the top of the wages league over a long period of time for this to be sustainable.Private school critics, like Labour’s Lord George Foulkes and Green MSP Andy Wightman, will shed few tears at the prospect of more parents rejecting the private option because of cost, but far from tackling inequality it will only make it worse as the offspring of the ultra-affluent are concentrated in fewer, more exclusive institutions bankrolled by international elites.Deliberately squeezing private education through punitive taxes is also a disincentive for the schools to increase their work with the state sector, calling into question collaborative projects like the Swire Chinese Language Centre Edinburgh at George Watson’s, a joint venture with James Gillespie’s and Boroughmuir. It’s now being extended to other schools. At the same time, Edinburgh council couldn’t even build the new Boroughmuir big enough to meet its basic needs in the coming years. The list of joint projects between private and state is lengthy and benefits both, but the unfortunate lesson of last year for the independent sector is why go to the trouble when the reward is a political kicking?

I‘m in.Booty-licious route to a job            If there was one thing Sandy Strang understood, it was rigorous application, and a couple of weeks ago I wrote about the importance of university graduates understanding their degree classifications were worth less than a CV packed with extra-curricular activities and work experience. Not so at The Spectator magazine, run by this paper’s former political editor, Fraser Nelson, where a strict “no CVs” policy applies to applications for paid internships.Sandy would have appreciated the stiff set of tasks set for hopefuls, such as provide “a one-page summary on the dismal state of the German military” and “suggest three guests for a podcast discussion on the recent Slovakian crisis”. But he would have loved the demand for “socioeconomic support for any two Beyoncé lyrics”. Like, perhaps, Booty-licious?Says Nelson: “We don’t care where, when or even whether you went to university.” But what if you don’t like Beyoncé?Anyone but England\u2028And finally to Russia and this afternoon’s big game, which Cambridge football blue Strang would have relished.

The Aegon study found 14 per cent of those surveyed were expecting still to be making payments on their home at retirement age. More than 40 per cent said they would likely still be renting at 70.            More than 700 people aged between 18 and 64 were questioned in the survey, which also predicted an increase in “lifetime renters”.            Steven Cameron, pensions director at Aegon, said a combination of homeowners getting on the housing ladder, higher house prices and longer borrowing terms were the main factors in the response.He said: “Paying off your mortgage in time for your 70th birthday is now far from a given. Inflated property prices mean those getting onto the property ladder are doing so at later ages and are borrowing more for longer. Those left with an outstanding mortgage on their property face the prospect of either budgeting mortgage payments into their retirement or alternatively continuing to work.“We know that one in four people expect to still be working at 70, but not everyone will be fit enough or want to do so.”Mr Cameron continued: “As younger generations increasingly fail to get onto the property ladder, renting a home becomes the long-term plan.”The results of the survey came after a Freedom of Information request by insurer Royal London found pensioners paid a total of £24 billion in income tax in 2015/16.            According to the findings, Scottish pensioners paid as much as £1.7bn of the total bill, more than Wales and Northern Ireland combined. The tax paid by pensioners would be on various sources of income such as employment, self-employment and property.Royal London found that between the mid-1990s and the mid-2010s, the number of taxpayers aged over 65 had nearly doubled from 3.32 million in 1995/96 to 6.49 million in 2015/16 – the most recent year for which detailed figures are available.It is estimated that the number has broadly stabilised since then and stands at around 6.37 million in 2018/19, Royal London said.Sir Steve Webb, director of policy at Royal London, said: “Many people might assume that once you retire you cease to be of interest to the taxman, but these figures show that this is very far from being the truth.            “The number of tax-paying pensioners has nearly doubled in the last two decades and with talk of requiring pensioners to pay national insurance on earnings, the older population may think of themselves as ‘generation still taxed’.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 19 ","story":"Shetland’s young sports competitors retained their hold on the Stuart Cup at the weekend, with the margin of victory, in the end, being fairly comfortable.\nGoing into the last event of the junior inter-county, the netball, Orkney had to win by 32 points to overhaul the visitors’ lead. Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kia pro ceed ","story":"3dr Kia pro-ceed sr7, 4 year warranty remaining, one owner, full Kia service history, VGC inside \u0026amp out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

tornadoes and massive electric storms during the trip of a lifetime which started on May 19, with the quartet returning on Saturday.\nThe daredevil and talented photographer captured breathtaking snaps of the huge storms as they crossed Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Texas.\nScott told the Strathy: \"The four of us flew out to Tornado Valley in the hope to witness some of the planet\u0027s

the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\nMonday 9 Jul 2018 6:47
