Esme was diagnosed with nephroblastoma, a type of kidney cancer after initially visiting a GP with constipation, in June 2019\u0027It was quite comforting after it was explained to me, if they\u0027re planning for her future it must mean there\u0027s a future to plan for, so maybe the cancer wasn\u0027t as scary as we expected.\u0027Whether she would have children in the future wasn\u0027t something that had ever even crossed my mind, but I\u0027m glad the doctors are looking out for her.\u0027Whilst waiting for her surgery there was no other children her age or younger in the clinic and we feel incredibly lucky that one day Esme has the chance to be a mum and we\u0027ll be grandparents.\u0027Esme is just two years old but she has undergone fertility treatment, it\u0027s mind blowing that her eggs will be usable when she\u0027s old enough to want her own children.\u0027It would be very difficult to know if she\u0027s one of the only girls to have this type of procedure, but I have never met any other family in the UK that has gone through the same thing as our beautiful Esme.\u0027\u0027She has a long road ahead of her, but we and her doctors are hopeful she will make a full recovery.\u0027The brave little girl underwent an operation to remove the tumour from her kidney two weeks ago - and surgeons also removed one of her ovaries at the same time.They discovered that the cancer has spread to her lung, but doctors have said as the cancer was caught early they are hopeful that a course of intensive chemotherapy should shrink the tumour.

His one-time ally is dismissed as ‘mendacious’ and ‘disloyal’ and a ‘foam-flecked Faragist’. As Mr Cameron himself once said in the Commons: ‘Calm down, dear!’It’s true that, in the case of Mr Gove, Mr Cameron grants he probably believed in the Leave cause he embraced. Mr Gove is nonetheless castigated for his disloyalty. But didn’t he owe a greater loyalty to his country than its leader?No one would complain if the former PM had tried to skewer former colleagues through sober and reasoned argument. It is the hyperbole and name-calling that is depressing. Of course, lies were told on the Leave side – as they were by Remainers. Mr Cameron rightly complains about the notorious slogan on the side of the Brexit bus suggesting that if we left the EU, a further £350million a week could be spent on the NHS. He doesn’t admit, though, that the probable weekly saving of £250 million is huge.       He critiques Gove and Johnson for their contact during the EU referendum and called Gove a \u0027foam-flecked Faragist\u0027       On the other hand, he shows – at any rate in the excerpts so far published – scant understanding of enormous public disquiet over unprecedentedly high levels of immigration during his time in office.All in all, this is not the measured and statesmanlike book of a man esteemed as a ‘class act’ while in power. Months brooding in that garden shed have warped his judgment.There could have been little objection if he had discharged this missile after the issue of Brexit was resolved and the nightmare of a Corbyn government averted. In that case, we would have merely marvelled that beneath Mr Cameron’s suave exterior beats an astonishingly tempestuous heart.Admirably, he initially agreed to postpone publication until after March 29 – when Britain was supposed to leave the EU – so as not to embarrass Theresa May. Presumably under pressure from tired-of-waiting publishers, he has now placed a bombshell under Mr Johnson. For there can be little doubt that his intemperate language about the leadership of the current administration will deepen old wounds in an already stricken Tory party, and worsen long-standing isions over Europe.          David Cameron was advised by George Osborne that Johnson and Gove were \u0027killing\u0027 his leadership and urged him to \u0027destroy their credibility\u0027And, at the same time, his assault on Mr Johnson, Mr Gove and others is bound to give comfort to extreme Remainers who are doing their damnedest to discredit the Prime Minister and the Government.During their party conferences, Lib Dem and Labour delegates will endlessly quote Mr Cameron’s highly negative judgment of Mr Johnson, and use it to weaken him and undermine his policies.So in reply to the question as to who will be most pleased by this book, my answer is: Those who wish the Tory party ill, and long to scupper Brexit.        "},{"url":null,"title":"Metal detectorist unearthed 2m haul Viking jewellery sued Church Scotland half","story":"Share this article However Mr McLennan, is now reported to have gone back on the agreement to share the proceeds with the church, prompting the threat of legal action.His friend and fellow metal detector enthusiast, the Rev David Bartholomew, who was with him when he made his discovery, said the euphoria when the first artefact was pulled from the ground had since turned to acrimony.The Castle Douglas minister said: \u0027Derek was my friend and it is sad that it has come to this.

promised David Cameron want make Brexit work","story":"Share this article Despite their rocky start Mr Juncker said in public that he had \u0027an excellent professional and personal relationship\u0027 with Mr Cameron.  At the same summit, German Chancellor Angela Merkel insisted that Britain could not have got better terms when Mr Cameron tried to negotiate with Brussels. Mr Cameron had tied his referendum pledge to a plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain\u0027s membership of the EU. The UK was granted an exemption from the EU\u0027s founding goal of \u0027ever closer union\u0027 and there were small concessions on immigration.          David Cameron is accompanied by his wife Samantha as he waves goodbye to Downing Street in 2016 However, Brexiteers dismissed the renegotiation as a failure and Mr Cameron\u0027s gamble failed as Britons nonetheless voted to leave.  In his memoirs, Mr Cameron also says he \u0027felt no satisfaction\u0027 in being proved right when the pound crashed in the midst of the referendum result. Remainers had warned of an economic shock in the wake of a Brexit vote, but the Leave camp dismissed such warnings as fearmongering.   Mr Cameron announced his resignation just hours later.  Mr Juncker himself is due to leave office on November 1, the day after Britain\u0027s current Brexit date of October 31. Today he will meet Boris Johnson in Luxembourg as Mr Cameron\u0027s successor-but-one tries to secure a revised Brexit deal before the deadline. The European Commission president has repeatedly insisted that the deal negotiated with Theresa May will not be renegotiated. That deal was rejected three times by Parliament, forcing Mrs May out of office two months ago. Mr Juncker will be replaced by Ursula von der Leyen, a former German defence minister who scraped through by nine votes in her confirmation vote in July.    Boris Johnson questioned Michael Gove\u0027s mental health calling him \u0027a bit cracked\u0027 after being betrayed during 2016 Tory leadership race, David Cameron\u0027s memoirs reveal Boris Johnson questioned Michael Gove\u0027s mental health and suggested he was \u0027a bit cracked\u0027 after the Tory minister betrayed him during the 2016 Tory leadership race, the latest extracts of David Cameron\u0027s memoirs have revealed. Mr Gove famously sabotaged the first Johnson leadership bid in 2016 by launching his own rival campaign, forcing Mr Johnson to pull out. According to Mr Cameron, then-Chancellor George Osborne celebrated Mr Gove\u0027s betrayal, saying: \u0027We\u0027ve taken Boris out, now on to Port Stanley!,\u0027 a reference to the Falklands War. Mr Cameron also worked behind the scenes to help Theresa May win the contest to replace him, the extracts published by The Times reveal.   The former Prime Minister has already accused both Mr Johnson and Mr Gove of behaving \u0027appallingly\u0027 during the referendum campaign. Mr Cameron announced his resignation in June 2016 after captaining the losing side in the referendum, triggering the first Tory leadership contest for 11 years.  In the hours after the referendum result, Mr Cameron says he was \u0027on autopilot\u0027 as he called to congratulate Mr Gove who had been one of the ringleaders of the Vote Leave campaign.          Boris Johnson questioned Michael Gove\u0027s mental health and suggested he was \u0027a bit cracked\u0027 after the Tory minister turned on him during the 2016 Tory leadership race (they are pictured together that year), the latest extracts of David Cameron\u0027s memoirs have revealed He also apologised to world leaders including Barack Obama for his failed strategy to keep Britain in Europe.  Mr Johnson was initially seen as the front-runner to replace him but was forced to quit the race within days after Mr Gove\u0027s entry into the race.   Mr Gove, who had been helping Mr Johnson\u0027s campaign, dramatically quit his team and said the ex-London mayor could not \u0027provide the leadership\u0027 that was needed.   According to Mr Cameron, Mr Johnson wondered aloud whether former Education Secretary Mr Gove was \u0027a bit cracked\u0027.            David Cameron\u0027s autobiography will leave some of the Tory members aghastMr Cameron said he could not resist a cheeky dig at Mr Johnson in reply, saying: \u0027You should have stuck with me, mate.\u0027 The two Brexiteers are now back on the same side but the former PM\u0027s latest revelations will test how far they have patched up relations since 2016.As Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Mr Gove is now responsible for no-deal Brexit preparations in Mr Johnson\u0027s Government.  Mr Gove had previously said he was \u0027not equipped\u0027 to be Prime Minister, and Mr Cameron says he had taken those statements to be sincere.  Theresa May eventually won the race which ended without a full party vote after her last remaining rival, Andrea Leadsom, also pulled out.  Mrs Leadsom quit the race after a backlash over her comments in an interview about Mrs May not having children.  Mr Cameron said the comments were almost certainly not malicious but said the row persuaded Mrs Leadsom that she was not ready for the job.  But Mr Cameron himself also played a role in helping Mrs May win the contest, his memoirs reveal. Although he did not back any candidate officially, he \u0027secretly encouraged\u0027 his Tory colleague Gavin Williamson to help the May campaign in 2016. George Osborne, who was sacked as Chancellor by Mrs May and quit as an MP the following year, is said to have celebrated Mr Johnson\u0027s departure with a cryptic reference to the Falklands War. \u0027\u0027Now on to Port Stanley!\u0027 he said, meaning it was Michael\u0027s turn to fall next,\u0027 Mr Cameron recalls.  Mr Osborne had once been seen as a likely Tory leadership contender himself but he and Mr Cameron were both tarnished by the failed Remain campaign in 2016.  Boris Johnson also complained that \u0027people were looking at me as if I was a leper\u0027 after the referendum result which he helped to bring about. After declaring for Leave in February that year he became one of the most high-profile Brexit campaigners during the referendum campaign.  "},{"url":null,"title":"BBC overtake Netflix enter streaming

In Israel, voters choose a party\u0027s list of parliamentary candidates, rather than iniduals.Opinion polls show Likud and its main challenger, the centrist Blue and White party led by former armed forces chief Benny Gantz, running neck and neck, meaning coalition-building is key to determining an ultimate winner. Tuesday\u0027s vote will largely be a referendum on Netanyahu, who this year surpassed Israel\u0027s founding prime minister as the country\u0027s longest-serving leader.He has cast himself as the only candidate capable of facing Israel\u0027s myriad of challenges.

Will Ian Brown be coming to his show?I’m in an enormous, concrete, box-shaped space. Alone, but the noise of men working nearby – drilling, talking – reverberates around the room. Literally an echo chamber. On the walls rest huge, colourful paintings, ready to be hung. Figures that are lifelike but messed with, so that bits are in the wrong place, or the background appears within the boundaries of the figures, a jigsaw forced together the wrong way.The artist, John Squire, comes in quietly (he does everything quietly, he used to be much louder) and explains how he did it. It starts with a photo – perhaps one he’s found on Tumblr, or taken himself (this one is his wife, at the basin in the bathroom at home near Macclesfield) – which he then manipulates.Damien Hirst introduced him to the Snapchat collage tool and Squire became entranced with it, initially as an entertaining distraction, then as a way of creating art. These ones are done with photo editing software called Magic Eraser, but it’s the same kind of idea. Then, when he likes what he’s got on his smartphone, he paints it, in oil. Big. Hirst encouraged him to go big. The big space for Squire’s show is Hirst’s Newport Street Gallery in Vauxhall, South London. The show is called Disinformation. “It struck me while I was doing the show and watching the news, I saw there was a parallel between confusing the message figuratively and with regards to information,” says Squire.Now we’re standing in front of a distorted, fragmented monochrome guitarist whose face has been obscured by geometric wallpaper. Squire is not certain who the original picture is of. “I don’t know if it’s a famous person, I’m pretty sure not,” he says. “It reminded me of posing around with guitars or tennis rackets as a kid, imagining stardom.” Stardom which became a reality.Squire used to play guitar in a band. Play guitar quite well, in quite a big band: the Stones Roses. You know how it went: friends since bonding over the Clash at school in Altrincham, Squire and Ian Brown spent much of the 80s messing with styles and lineups and everything else. They gained momentum and a following before bursting beyond Manchester with a debut that encapsulated 1989 in vinyl, which often tops lists of the greatest British albums and played a significant part in the youth of a generation. Then a big gap, fighting with record companies, with each other, babies, Second Coming, mixed reviews, more fighting, accusations and allegations, fallouts and walk-outs, the end, solo projects, art … until, after an even longer gap, the reformation in 2012, a tour, then another end.Is that really it for the Roses? “Yeah,” he says.How is it with Ian? They had a pact when they reformed not to talk about all that, he says. “And I’m going to honour that.”Will he be coming to the opening of the show? “No.”Is he invited? “No.”Squire isn’t super eager to talk about the Roses. It’s always the same when he is interview for a show, he says. He gets asked “a couple of questions about the work, then they get down to the serious business of finding out what the scoop is on the band”.Guilty as charged. But that’s because of their extraordinary enduring appeal, and the pivotal part they played in the coming-of-age for pretty much an entire generation. How does he see it now, looking back through the filter of time? “It was quite a brief period that gets a lot of attention still,” he says. “I was surprised at the level of support we got when we got back on stage.”If it sounds awkward … well it is a bit. But it’s never unbearably uncomfortable. We sit down on chairs in the corner, he pours water politely. Later he apologises when he drinks straight from the bottle without thinking. Without thinking is out of character for John Squire, I think.“I don’t want to be difficult,” he says.Fifty-six and still pretty lugubrious, he often pauses before saying something or answering a question. They can be quite long pauses, but they become less and less awkward. I’m not getting that Stone Roses scoop, that’s clear, but the subject isn’t totally off-limits – music and art have been there throughout the years after all.The painting came first. His mum kept a few things he did with felt tips as a kid: a polar bear, Greek soldiers, shields and spears. “I didn’t really become aware that art could be something enjoyed second hand until punk rock.”Record sleeves? “Yeah, and clothes. The paint drips, that was a stepping-stone to abstract expressionism, then ‘who is Jackson Pollock?’, and I can use this to make my own record sleeves.” Which he did, spattering Stone Roses covers with Pollock’s influence.Squire did art A-level at college. He failed it, “because I wasn’t at all interested in the written work, the art history. This idea that museums were filled with dark religious paintings with a high-gloss finish, it made me feel depressed, reminded me of being forced to go to Sunday school.”Mainly self-taught then, same as with the guitar, no? “I did go to some lessons with a piano teacher. I took him the only sheet music I could find, which was Rich Kids by the Rich Kids. He tried to play it on the piano and it sounded nothing like the record. I think I had one lesson and realised it wasn’t going to help me get anywhere. So yeah, I learnt from books.”And became very good at it, particularly on the heavy extended riffs of Second Coming. “Yeah, it’s flattering, but I don’t think I’m a very good guitar player, or a very good painter. I listen to my guitar playing, my songs, I look at my paintings, I tend to focus on the faults, things that I could’ve done slightly better.” He points to a couple of fingers on the manipulated woman in the third panel of the triptych behind us that he’s not happy with. With more time he would have made those fingers better.Whether it’s a song or a picture, the thrill for Squire is the initial impetus of an idea more than the finished result. With a record, “there’s so much repetition – because of the recording process, mixing, mastering – the material wears thin by the time it’s released.”He doesn’t listen to any of the records he’s made – Stone Roses, Seahorses, his solo stuff – but he hasn’t given the music up. He takes breaks from the work in the studio at his farm in Cheshire and picks up his guitar, writes songs, records songs. He doesn’t know what he’s going to do with it only his wife has heard them.Does he like working alone? “Yeah, I find it very therapeutic. You’re not part of a committee, there is purity to that. But sometimes sharing the workload can be a rewarding experience.”As well as the rows, it must have been a laugh as well, being in the Stone Roses. “Yeah, I don’t spend much time laughing while I paint.”His old band don’t just live on for nostalgic fiftysomethings. Their sons – and daughters – are discovering them too. Squire’s own 16-year-old daughter recently showed him a picture of her friend getting a tattoo of his own Stone Roses lemon motif. “My reaction wasn’t ‘yay!’,” he says. “I felt guilty in a way because I knew they were the same age as Martha.”Squire has six children, between seven and 26, some of whom have followed similar paths to their dad. His eldest daughter went to art school and now makes feminist comics. His eldest son is in a band. He’s been to see them a few times. “I should go more often, but it’s too loud.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/965f9535ac7866205b472e47ffb452b4d0fb91db/761_306_3588_2152/master/3588.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc847d2eff39fde399965f8dc6c4b11b","title":"don mcphee","story":"In 2017, ten years on from the death of the great  photographer, we gave readers the chance to buy three limited edition prints of his work.

Bourne’s study of this copy, which has been housed in the Free Library of Philadelphia since 1944, dated the annotator to the mid-17th century, finding them alive to “the sense, accuracy, and interpretative possibility of the dialogue”. She also provided many images of the handwritten notes, which struck Scott-Warren as looking oddly similar to Milton’s hand.“But I always think ‘I recognise that handwriting,’” Scott-Warren said. “I go and check and normally I’m wrong. This time I thought: ‘The case is getting stronger and stronger’.”As evidence stacked up, he said he became “quite trembly … You’re gathering evidence with your heart in your mouth.”The first folio is the first collected edition of Shakespeare’s plays, published seven years after his death. Without it, 18 plays including Macbeth and The Tempest might have been lost to history. Around 750 first folios were printed, with 233 known to survive. They command huge sums at auction, with one selling for £1.87m three years ago.Scott-Warren has made a detailed comparison of the annotator’s handwriting with the Paradise Lost poet’s. He also believes that the work the annotator did to improve the text of the folio – suggesting corrections and supplying additional material such as the prologue to Romeo and Juliet, along with cross-references to other works – is similar to work Milton did in other books that survive from his library, including his copy of Boccaccio’s Life of Dante.The scholar tentatively suggested in a blogpost that he might have identified John Milton’s copy of the Shakespeare First Folio of 1623, admitting that, “in this as in other cases, there’s usually a lot of wishful thinking, plus copious spinning of the evidence to make it seem plausible, and elision of anything that doesn’t seem to fit”.But he soon found that other scholars were agreeing with him. “Not only does this hand look like Milton’s, but it behaves like Milton’s writing elsewhere does, doing exactly the things Milton does when he annotates books, and using exactly the same marks,” said Dr Will Poole at New College Oxford. “Shakespeare is our most famous writer, and the poet John Milton was his most famous younger contemporary. It was, until a few days ago, simply too much to hope that Milton’s own copy of Shakespeare might have survived — and yet the evidence here so far is persuasive. This may be one of the most important literary discoveries of modern times.”As well as numerous textual annotations, the folio also contains a host of line markings, showing the annotator’s engagement with, particularly, Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, The Tempest, Henry IV, As You Like It and King Lear. Scott-Warren believes these can be traced to Milton’s own work.“The book is absolutely covered with lines in the margin of passages and when you’re reading those thinking the annotator is Milton they become really interesting,” he said. “It’s how they echo with his work, the sense that the volume offers you the opportunity to read Shakespeare through Milton’s eyes. Because the lines in the margin don’t give you any verbal content, you don’t know why he’s singled out a passage for attention, but it forces you to think your way into Milton’s head and it does really chime with a lot of what goes on in his poetry, so you can see him constructing himself through Shakespeare.”One highlighted section in The Tempest is the song: “Come unto these yellow sands,  And then take hands:  Courtsied when you have and kiss’d  The wild waves whist.” The unusual rhyme, of “kiss’d” and “whist”, is echoed in Milton’s On the Morning of Christ’s Nativity: “The winds with wonder whist,  Smoothly the waters kist.”“We would already have known about that allusion, they are the only two writers who used that rhyme, but you can see him marking it in the text and responding to it,” said Scott-Warren. “It gives you a sense of his sensitivity and alertness to Shakespeare. What’s quite remarkable as well is that he’s singled out for attention lots of the passages that have become incredibly famous – he goes through and marks out some of the most celebrated Shakespearean speeches.”It has always been known that Shakespeare was a huge influence on Milton – in his poem On Shakespeare, Milton calls him a “son of Memory” and “great heir of fame”, writing of how “Thou in our wonder and astonishment  Hast built thyself a live-long monument.”“But this allows us to see the encounter happening,” said Scott-Warren. “It shows you the firsthand encounter between two great writers, which you don’t often get to see, especially in this period. A lot of that kind of evidence is lost, so that’s really exciting.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/559686a8daca4fb1bd6a6bdf755553fd1a5d0acb/0_167_5004_3002/master/5004.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=809d4b9f1ca22c4ac1c421628da6f52c","title":"wont stick reports of margaret atwoods 2019 booker prize greatly exaggerated","story":"Organisers rush to clarify that judges have not yet decided beyond the shortlist after bookshop brands copies of The Testaments as the winnerThe Booker prize has stressed that it has not – yet, anyway – selected Margaret Atwood’s much-heralded sequel to The Handmaid’s Tale as this year’s winner, after a bookseller mistakenly displayed copies declaring it the 2019 victor.Novelist and academic Matthew Sperling posted an image from an unnamed bookshop of Atwood’s The Testaments on Twitter on Monday. Pictured alongside Lucy Ellmann’s Ducks, Newburyport, which bore a sticker highlighting its shortlisting, The Testaments instead boasted a sticker branding it the winner. “Don’t think you were supposed to use those stickers yet, lads...” wrote Sperling. The Testaments is currently 21 to win at William Hill bookmakers, behind favourite Ducks, Newburyport at 74. Before news had a chance to get round to gamblers that the jury had made up its mind a month ahead of the prize ceremony, organisers were quick to clarify that the panel headed by Peter Florence had not yet ruled.“It will not be decided until the judges meet on 14 October 2019,” they said in a statement.“At shortlist stage for the Booker prize, display packs including shortlist sticker sheets and a winner sticker sheet are provided to booksellers and libraries across the UK.

Its charming old town, array of Unesco World Heritage sites and sizeable port were always draws, but the new success of Game of Thrones, much of which was shot in the Croatian city, has made it a particularly popular stopoff point for cruise ships, whose passengers are told they can see the highlights in a single day.Smaller boats or tenders take the passengers on to dry land, where they are typically bussed into the old town. Tours often start at the 16th-century Pile Gate, followed by a stroll along the Stradun to the city walls, entrance to which costs €30 (£27). Game of Thrones locations and Europe’s oldest pharmacy in a 14th-century Franciscan monastery are big pulls.There is increasingly troubling evidence, however, of the dramatic effect the guests are having, not least on the kind of city Dubrovnik will be. Where once there were bookshops, bakeries, butchers, hair salons and markets, tacky souvenir shops and stalls now cater to the tourists. The boats themselves also burn huge amounts of fossil fuel, creating water, air and noise pollution, and severely affect the marine ecosystem.A growing sense among city residents that tourism has become overtourism has caused the mayor to introduce tighter controls: during mornings just two ships can dock, with a third after midday. Next year a limit of 4,000 daily visitors will be allowed ashore, and in two years each will face a €2 tax.Another proposal is for ships – which tend to leave their motors running so that fridges, air conditioning and other technical functions continue to operate – to be forced to draw their energy supplies from the Croatian mainland instead. The mayor’s argument is that the city should at least benefit financially from the presence of the ships, though environmentalists note that the stipulation won’t stop the ships from running the motors or address the ecological damage. Nor is there any detail about how these measures will be applied, or how to ensure cruise ship operators abide by the rules.Meanwhile, in neighbouring Montenegro, another small city is facing a similar problem to Dubrovnik but is even more vulnerable. About two and a half hours along the coast, the tiny city of Kotor often has three huge ships docked in port, each staying for an average of 12 hours. The third most popular cruise ship destination in the Adriatic, Kotor expects a total of 500 cruise ships in 2019, bringing more than half a million people. “Compare this to 2003 when there were just 50 ships and 50,000 people,” says Vesna Mačič from Kotor’s institute of Marine Biology.Kotor is even more at risk than Dubrovnik because Montenegro is outside the EU, so EU laws don’t apply. The city has no recognised marine reserves, ships can use cheaper oil containing sulphur, and there are no restrictions on noise, which is known to damage organisms such as fish, dolphins and turtles.Kotor’s location – at the end of the Boka Kotorska bay, which is surrounded by large mountains – means gases emitted by cruise ships linger for longer, damaging local air quality. Fishermen and marine biologists also complain that the ships drag along the bottom of the bay, damaging the ecosystem, and that they discharge waste water, thus releasing foreign matter into the bay and further upsetting the natural balance. Flowering sea grass, clams and the rich seabed flora are said to have suffered as a result.“The biggest issue is due to the huge size of the cruisers, meaning only one can be directly attached to the port at one time, and the other two or three on any given day have to be anchored further away,” Mačič says.“This creates huge physical damage to organisms – sponges, coral, sea stars and others – inhabiting the muddy sea floor. On top of that you have the constant lifting and lowering of anchors and the movements of the ships, which affects light distribution and therefore the ability of plants to perform photosynthesis, endangering various types of algae and seaweed.” She wants to see cheap oil banned in line with EU legislation, the number of ships limited, buoys used instead of anchors, and tugboats turning the ships around.In a country where the average salary is around €453 a month, however, there is little appetite for any major restrictions on tourists, who spend an average of around €40 a day. In Kotor, at least, most locals are resigned to the idea that the cruise ships are unlikely to go away.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7ebcd6c6c1f40c29ee0b593b3d2c6ef7ffe652d/0_155_3921_2352/master/3921.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ef6ca194c77ea9980e65a5f897e3905","title":"david cameron brexit","story":"But fixating on the decision to hold the referendum and his woeful politicking with the EU ignores the nitty-gritty of Cameron’s record, and thereby lets him off the hook. Brexit, after all, is symptomatic of things that run much deeper than our relationship with Europe. And on this score, Cameron and his former colleagues have huge questions to answer, if only someone would ask them. In the wake of the crash of 2007-08, they took control of a country that was already starting to show signs of fury, ision and seething resentment. Their biggest sin, it seems to me, was to encourage and accelerate those things, to the point that they were probably always going to explode in some awful drama of national self-harm.Senior politicians are usually strange creatures, with an amazing capacity for holding apparently contradictory impulses in the moment, Cameron probably believed that what he was fumbling towards was not just human and kind, but suited to a world in which people can self-organise as never before. But it was also clear that woven into all this stuff was a very familiar Tory antipathy towards what remained of the postwar settlement. In his interview with Cameron at about the same time, the Observer’s Andrew Rawnsley noted “his attachment to that Thatcherite phrase ‘rolling back the state’”.We all know what happened four years later. Mere days before the election of 2010, Cameron said that any Tory minister considering “frontline reductions” would be sent “straight back to their department to go away and think again”. He then commenced the decade of fiscal savagery that has left some of the most fundamental parts of the public realm hanging on for dear life: “an economic rescue job”, he now says, with his seemingly unshakable doublethink summed up in the claim that “the last thing I wanted to do was to make any cuts to anything”. The triteness is excruciating. Quite apart from the fate of adult social care, children’s centres and other vital services, Britain is now a country in which austerity is part of the everyday ambience, all shut-down pools and libraries, broken-down parks, and once-a-day buses. These things inflamed the sense of neglect that played a key role in the summer of 2016: credible academic research shows that pre-referendum support for Ukip correlated strongly with local austerity.There is a belief around at the moment, encouraged by many of the 21 Conservative MPs recently expelled from the party by Johnson, that it is only now that their party has become unprecedentedly nasty and irresponsible. But in 2013, I can clearly recall seeing huge hoardings at the Conservative conference in Manchester with such crude slogans as “Welfare capped”, “Immigration down”, and the dog-whistling formulation, “for hardworking people”. Cameron’s big speech reduced Labour’s time in power to “millions coming here from overseas while millions of British people were left on welfare”. He also assured his audience that “we must act on immigration directly … and we are. Capping immigration. Clamping down on the bogus colleges … If you are not entitled to our free National Health Service, you should pay for it. If you have no right to be here, you cannot rent a flat or a house … When you are a foreign prisoner fighting deportation, you should pay your own legal bills. If you appeal, you must do it from your own country, after you’ve been deported, not from here.”No one should now let him get away with styling himself as the failed pioneer of a softer, more sympathetic kind of politics. Whether or not he was privately uncomfortable with them, these words alone confirm not just that Cameron looked like an enthusiastic participant in the hostile environment doctrine that led to the Windrush scandal, but that Faragism had already infected the Tory soul.Two years later, having fused all this stuff with the crabby English nationalism awakened by all those warnings about Labour teaming up with the SNP, the Tories won an outright parliamentary majority, but that was only this agenda’s first victory. It doesn’t really matter that Cameron himself limply campaigned to stay in the EU and then shamefully departed the scene: if anyone agreed with the essential thrust of what he had been doing for the previous six years, how were they ever going to end up voting to remain?Politicians’ autobiographies are invariably tedious, truth-eluding things, often destined to be piled up in discount shops. Historians and political anoraks will take what they can from this latest example, but it will not shine much light on connections that are too often ignored. Brexit is partly the fault of irresponsible politicians who were not actually Brexiteers Johnson’s nasty opportunism is not that different from the approach taken by Cameron and George Osborne, two people whose role in Britain’s current disaster is still under-appreciated. Whatever alibis and excuses are given an airing this week, these things ought not to be forgotten."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8d80f76c02f8860881883f2cd89ac8762a296b1/0_155_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=433a6799d94a58184c940a865cc2216c","title":"repeat after me vagina is not a dirty word","story":"Our collective reluctance to say ‘vagina’ shrouds women’s bodies – and their sexuality – in shameWhen Dr Jen Gunter, a US-based gynaecologist, and her publisher, Kensington Books, sought to promote her new book on Twitter, they ran into trouble. The problem was the title: The Vagina Bible. It appeared that “vagina” was red-flagged by Twitter Ads as “inappropriate language”.Gunter was understandably outraged: “When we’re not allowed to say a word the implication is it’s dirty or shameful. Not being able to buy an ad because of the word vagina for a book about vaginas is ridiculous.”A suitably vagina-laden outcry followed, and Twitter permitted the offending promoted tweets on its network. But if Twitter’s default position is to ban the word vagina on the grounds of vulgarity, what does that say about the way we think about women’s bodies?It’s time we all got comfortable with the term vagina – and while we’re at it, vulva, labia and clitoris. How are women supposed to talk about their health or sexuality if the anatomically correct words used to describe their body parts are taboo? While it might make sense to ask a beautician to vajazzle your vajayjay, cutesy euphemisms don’t cut it in the doctor’s surgery.“As a gynae doc I see so many adult women who refer to problems in their “down belowsminniefannyfoof” and then have to spend valuable consultation time trying to get them to specify which bit of their genitalia they are talking about,” observed one medic.Our unwillingness to correctly label female anatomy contributes to other problems, including a “pleasure gap” that sees men’s sexual needs prioritised over women’s. Sex is often seen as synonymous with male pleasure. Female pleasure, however, is usually overlooked, tossed into the too-hard basket.Dr Jessica Eaton, a UK-based psychologist who runs sex education training for teachers, recounts on Twitter how teachers admitted they were willing to say the word “penis” and talk about male masturbation, but none were comfortable talking about vaginas and female pleasure in the same way.The effect of this double standard is captured by Peggy Orenstein, who spent three years talking to young women about their experience of sex while researching her book Girls \u0026amp Sex. In a 2017 TED Talk, she talks about how many young women don’t feel entitled to enjoy sex. They expressed a sense of shame around their genitals, a problem that she says stems from a cultural reluctance to talk about women’s bodies. “There’s no better way to make something unspeakable than not to name it.”If we want to make female pleasure as important as male pleasure, we need to normalise conversations about sex – starting with the proper names for our sexual organs.It’s also essential for kids to know how to talk about their bodies. Sexual health educators argue that teaching children anatomically correct terms for their body parts – genitals included – helps reduce shame and gives them the language they need if they ever become the victim of abuse. Children are less likely to disclose inappropriate behaviour if they don’t have the vocabulary to describe it or believe that they will get in trouble for broaching a taboo topic.Now, many will note that the vagina refers specifically to the internal structure that connects the cervix to the external genitalia. In common parlance, however, vagina is shorthand for the whole kit and caboodle, which is fine with me.As Gunter argues in her book’s introduction, “language evolves and words take on new meaning”. She points out that just as the term “gut” originally referred to the lower intestinal tract but is now used to describe the entire digestive system as well as the liver and pancreas, “vagina” is typically understood to refer to the lower reproductive tracts.So, familiarise yourself with the correct terms for the human body’s reproductive bits and make sure your kids know the difference between the vulva and the vagina. After all, knowledge is power."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/162efa5c635c2c79399dbc09b890a371715c29a5/0_291_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e94826c4116c58dd6eb9408b97a1a54","title":"starting school traumatic parents","story":"My children’s school is good and safe, yet dropping them off has stirred an unsoothable panic I haven’t felt since they were babiesThere is so much to worry about, said Gertrude Stein, you might as well not worry about any of it. But then again she never dropped two children off at school for the first time. Mine started last week and while one was fine, the other stood in the doorway of her new classroom looking tiny and lost and very alarmed and did the thing that, in extremis, parents fear more than tears: no tears. Looking on from the corridor, I felt something lift up and leave my body like the spirits in Ghost.Controlling anxiety is the great labour of our age and one with no discernible end. I try to ide my fears into categories: those with controllable outcomes (there is a mouse in our skirting board), those with no solution but that I consider manageable (why do I persist in buying jeans that are too small when I know I’m too lazy to return them?), and those that form part of a great, amorphous cloud of dread that hovers just over the horizon (where will it end? Why do we live like this? If there is a God, why did He allow Instagram to happen?).When my children were babies, the existential terror of being responsible for other people was so vast the only way to control it was to attach it to real-world anxieties. It didn’t matter how fantastical I just needed a shape to hang on to. For a long time, every time I passed the waste-disposal chute in our hallway, I had to staunch a mental image of tripping, wrenching the door open and accidentally dropping one of my children down the 13-storey shaft to the cruncher below. It wasn’t great, but it was better than shapeless fear.That phase eventually wore off to be replaced with a worse one: the fear not of freak accident or ill-health but unhappiness. Were they unhappy? Why were they unhappy? Was it contextual or constitutional? Were signs of distress actually a good thing, given that the unhappiest people in the world are the ones who can’t show their unhappiness?Once my children learned to speak, it was curious to observe that their own anxieties trammelled along similar lines, the necessity of attaching a cause – any cause – to their fears. Over the past few months, I have talked them down about getting struck by lightning, getting killed in a flood, having a creature “come out of the wall” at them – and something I still can’t get a handle on about the Spice Girls not being real. “What if a bug crawls into my mouth?” asked my daughter the other day, and my answer – “It just wouldn’t, don’t worry about it” – was clearly inadequate because it keeps coming up.Meanwhile, with school, my own anxiety seems to have gone back to square one: amorphous dread. The place is good, and safe, and well organised. Apart from the agony of drop-off, my girls seem happy. But handing them over has thrown up the dust from those earliest days of unsoothable panic and here I am once again: wandering the aisles of the supermarket on a Tuesday morning, crushing an indent into the side of a pack of tofu sausages while shouting at myself in my head. Get a grip, woman! What would Gertrude Stein say?!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/509b59b2a2d27f483ebd41dcbef1f7b6dc5f5693/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ddf8e55a9e369cae48347eb2f312afdf","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of market","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘market’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘market’.Share your photos of what market means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 18 September at 10am.

But many also oppose the changes that a switch to a post-qualifications system would entail, such as moving A-level exams earlier in the year for grades to be published before applications.Increasing numbers of students are using post-qualification admissions for courses still on offer after exam results are published, known as clearing. Williamson is said to be particularly interested in the University of Cambridge’s efforts to get around the lack of exam results – it now offers a “second chance” to high-performing disadvantaged candidates who narrowly missed out on a place during initial applications.Research has found that about 1,000 high-achieving students from disadvantaged backgrounds have their grades under-predicted each year, which can force them to wait a year to reapply.Williamson’s letter to the OfS included a revival of the government’s teaching excellence and student outcomes framework (Tef), which ranks institutions based on data such as drop-out rates, graduate employment and student satisfaction.Williamson called for the OfS to conduct a new Tef exercise for each subject taught at a university, to be published in 2021, as well as a new round of Tef assessments for each higher education provider to be published in 2020.The move to extend the Tef to inidual subjects was criticised by Universities UK (UUK), which lobbies on behalf of Britain’s major universities and colleges.“The current definition of excellence is weighted heavily towards employment outcomes, which overlooks the wider benefits of receiving high quality teaching and learning and how this can be measured,” UUK said.It called for subject-level Tef assessments “to be halted until further consideration is given to the limitations of its methodology, the resource impact and how much actual value it gives students in their decision-making”.UUK welcomed another of Williamson’s proposals to the OfS, for a review of part-time, mature student and flexible learning provision, including a review of funding for flexible learning. One of the failings of the English education system since 2012 has been the steep drop in mature and part-time students, which has been largely overlooked by policymakers.Williamson also told the OfS to pay greater attention to the experiences of international students on British university campuses, including their mental health, wellbeing and employability."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a80852aa1f2f61bf69ffa268be412c5e50985c4/0_0_7111_4267/master/7111.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1aa61db07875a86963ac00f88d02a71f","title":"i wouldnt contour now women over 50 on their beauty routines","story":"After trying out beauty trends in our shoot, four women reveal their go-to products and top tipsRead more from the autumnwinter 2019 edition of The Fashion, our biannual fashion supplementWhat’s your usual look?

In an interview with Net a Porter, Delevingne said that “one of the first things Harvey Weinstein ever said to me was, ‘You will never make it in this industry as a gay woman – get a beard.’”The term “beard” is traditionally used to describe someone who helps conceal another person’s sexual identity on social occasions. Delevingne, who describes herself as “gender fluid”, added she felt the industry has been resistant to her sexuality, saying: “In the beginning, I don’t think it helped.” Delevingne’s remarks echo recent comments by Kristen Stewart, who says she was told to not “go out holding your girlfriend’s hand in public” in order to win mainstream film roles.In 2017, Delevingne alleged that Weinstein sexually harassed her at a meeting, asking her to kiss another woman, and then trying to kiss her himself when she wanted to leave. In the same social media post, she said that Weinstein said that “if I was gay or decided to be with a woman especially in public that I’d never get the role of a straight woman or make it as an actress in Hollywood”. Weinstein has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex.Alongside her successful career as a model, Delevingne has appeared in a string of films including Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, Tulip Fever and London Fields."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc9165cde81e7af1757384680ec2233ee829d88c/0_1626_4345_2606/master/4345.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae4a4c6fbaa39ee58dc4c34bd1954842","title":"nigel slater greenfeast autumn recipes gnocchi orecchiette chocolate cantucci","story":"Dishes from the plant-based Greenfeast: Autumn, Winter – gnocchi and peas, orecchiette and cheese, chocolate and cantucciDinner is different in winter. The change starts late on a summer’s evening, when you first notice the soft, familiar scent of distant woodsmoke in the sudden chill of the air. Then, a day or two later, a damp, mushroomy mist hovers over the gardens and parks. Later, you notice the leaves have turned silently from yellow ochre to the walnut hue of tobacco. Autumn is here once again. You may sigh, rejoice or open a bottle. For many, this is the end of their year. For me, this is when it starts, when warmth and bonhomie come to the fore. With the change of weather, supper takes on a more significant role. What I crave now is food that is both cosseting and warming, substantial and deeply satisfying. Food that nourishes but also sets me up for going back out in the cold and wet. And yet, I still find my diet is heavily plant-based with less emphasis on meat. It is simply the way it has progressed over the years and shows little sign of abating.At the start of the longest half of the year, our appetite is pricked by the sudden drop in temperature, and as evenings get longer, we have the opportunity to spend a little more time in the kitchen. To mash beans into buttery clouds. Simmer vegetable stews to serve with bowls of couscous. To bring dishes of sweet potato to melting tenderness in spiced cream. And, of course, the pasta jar comes out again.My cold weather eating is more substantial than the food I eat for the rest of the year. Dinner becomes about one main dish rather than several lighter ones, and the focus shifts towards keeping warm. On returning home I will now happily spend an hour cooking. Maybe a little longer. The oven gets more use at this time of year, the grill and griddle probably less. More food will come to the table in deep casseroles and pie dishes. The temperature of the plates and bowls will change. We want to hold things that warm our hands, a sign of the happiness to come.There will be carbs. They protect and energise us. They bring balm to our jagged nerves. (Winter is nature’s way of making us eat carbohydrates.) Crusts – of pastry, breadcrumbs and crumble – add substance potatoes fill and satisfy and there is once again a huge sourdough loaf on the table. Rice and noodles are no longer a side dish, and now become the heart and soul of dinner.And, of course, there must be pudding. An early autumn crumble of damsons and almonds. Chocolate puddings (you really must make the ones with dulce de leche). Ginger cake with a cardamom cream and a custard pudding set with cake and apples. There will be nut-encrusted shortbreads with blood orange and baked apples with crisp crumbs and cranberries.I probably eat more puddings during the cold months, but mainly at the weekend. The main course recipes are predominantly for two the puddings though, are all for four or more. The recipes are made for sharing with friends and family. That said, most of them are rather fine eaten the following day. Especially those little chocolate puddings.Bright flavours for a cold day.For the dressingblood-orange juice 2 tbspsherry vinegar 2 tbspSet the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Place a large piece of tin foil in a roasting tin. Wash and trim the beetroot, taking care not to break their skins, and place them in the foil. Add the olive oil, two tablespoons of water and a grinding of salt and pepper, then scrunch the edges of the foil together to seal. Bake the beetroots for 45 minutes to an hour till tender to the point of a knife, then remove and set aside.Slice the radishes in half and put them in a mixing bowl. Slice the peel from the orange flesh, taking care to keep any escaping juice, remove the segments from the membranes, then add the segments to the radishes. Peel the beetroot and cut each one in half, then into quarters, and add them to the mixing bowl.Wash and trim the watercress. (I like to dunk it in a bowl of iced water for 20 minutes to crisp it up.) Put the mint and parsley leaves in with the orange and beetroot together with the trimmed watercress and the pumpkin seeds.Make the dressing: put the blood-orange juice in a small bowl, add the sherry vinegar, season with salt and pepper then pour over the salad and toss gently.The reassurance of pasta. The soothing notes of cheese and cauliflower.Put a deep pan of water on to boil and salt it generously. Finely grate the parmesan. Cut the cauliflower florets from the main stalk.Warm the butter and oil together in a shallow pan, then fry the cauliflower florets for five minutes or so until lightly crisp and golden. Put the orecchiette into the boiling water and cook for about nine minutes or until tender.Pour the cream into the cauliflower, add the grated parmesan and lower the heat. Drain the pasta and add it to the cauliflower and cream. Season with black pepper. Chop the dill fronds, stir into the pasta and serve.• Broccoli, brussels tops, brussels sprouts and kale are all perfectly acceptable in place of the cauliflower. The pasta is interchangeable too, but it’s worth choosing one that will hold a little puddle of sauce, such as casarecce, anelli, cavatelli or ditalini. I suggest you avoid the larger varieties of penne, which is rather like eating pieces of rubber tubing.Hot stock, green peas and the allure of dumplings.Bring a deep pan of water to the boil and salt it generously. Add the gnocchi and let them cook for three or four minutes, until they come to the surface, or follow the instructions on the packet. Bring the stock to the boil and add the peas.Remove the gnocchi with a draining spoon and ide between two bowls. Ladle over the stock and peas, then separate the eggs and lower a yolk into each bowl. Sprinkle two tablespoons of grated parmesan over each serving. Stir the yolk into the stock and peas as you eat, making an impromptu sauce.Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Place the potatoes flat on a chopping board, then slice them at ½cm intervals, cutting almost through to the wood. It becomes immediately obvious why they are sometimes called toast-rack potatoes.Place the potatoes in a roasting tin, trickle with some of the olive oil and roast for about 45 minutes till crisp and golden. Meanwhile, put the tomatoes and unpeeled garlic cloves in a small roasting tin with the remaining olive oil, grind over a little salt and black pepper, then place in the oven. Roast the tomatoes for about 35 to 40 minutes, until they are soft and lightly browned.Remove the tomatoes and garlic from the oven. Pop the garlic from its skin and add the flesh to the tomatoes. Crush the tomatoes and garlic with a fork, stirring in the fresh horseradish as you go. When the potatoes are crisp and golden, remove them from the oven and serve with spoonfuls of the crushed tomato.• Some people find it easier to “hasselback” the potatoes by placing each one in the hollow of a wooden spoon and slicing downwards, thus avoiding cutting through to the chopping board. It’s a good trick.A soup to soothe the soul.Serves 4celeriac 1kgvegetable stock 400mlmilk 600mlchives 25golive oil 125mlhorseradish root 15g, grated pumpernickel or other rye bread 100gPeel and roughly chop the celeriac, then place in a deep pan with the stock and milk and bring to the boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 20 minutes.While the soup is simmering, chop the chives and put them in a blender with the olive oil. Blitz to a bright green dressing.Puree the celeriac mixture, in two or three batches, using a blender. If you have a stick blender, process it directly in the pan. Stir the horseradish into the soup and check the seasoning. Crumble the pumpernickel and toast briefly in a dry, shallow pan till lightly crisp.Ladle the soup into bowls, pour in the chive oil and scatter over the pumpernickel.• Celeriac is one of the more unsung vegetables, but has plenty going for it. I like it shredded and stirred into a mustardy mayonnaise, but also coarsely grated and fried in olive oil and butter until golden and sizzling and served with a spritz of lemon.The smoky flavours of mushrooms and greens.Serves 2dried mushrooms 25ggreens, such as cavolo nero 200gpecorino 200gfregola 200gbutter 25gBring 1 litre of water to the boil, add the dried mushrooms, remove from the heat and cover with a lid. Set aside for 15 minutes to infuse.Wash and finely shred the cavolo nero. Finely grate the pecorino. Bring the mushroom stock back to the boil, add the fregola and cook for 12 to 15 minutes until tender but not soft. The pasta should still have a slight chewy quality. Drain the fregola and mushrooms.Melt the butter in a frying pan and add the shredded greens, frying them for a minute or two till they start to brighten and wilt. Fold in the drained pasta and mushrooms, then the grated pecorino. Pile into shallow dishes.• Fregola is easy to find in Italian food stores. I like to look out for the Sardinian toasted variety, which has a pleasing nutty flavour.• In place of cavolo nero, you could use crinkly-leaved savoy cabbage or young kale.• The quantity of pecorino sounds alarming, but it is there to bring the whole dish together and offer a luxurious contrast to the otherwise humble ingredients.The humble sweetness of baked rice. The syrupy luxury of fig jam.Set the oven at 140Cgas mark 1.Crack the green cardamoms, extract the tiny brown-black seeds, then crush them to a powder. A pestle and mortar will work if you don’t have a spice mill. Pour the milk into a saucepan. Add the ground cardamom seeds, bay leaves, vanilla pod and butter, and bring to the boil.Put the pudding rice and caster sugar in a baking dish, then, as soon as the milk boils (watch carefully), pour the hot milk over the rice and stir till the sugar has dissolved.Slide the dish into the preheated oven and bake for two hours until the rice is soft and creamy and the skin is pale gold. Serve with spoonfuls of soft fig jam.• If fig jam proves tricky to track down, slice six small fresh figs in half and put them in a saucepan with four tablespoons each of granulated or caster sugar and water. Bring to the boil, then lower the heat and simmer till the sugar and water have turned to a syrup and the figs are soft and on the point of collapse.Serves 2dark chocolate 100gdulce de leche 2 tbspeggs 2caster sugar 100gcantucci to serveSet the oven at 160Cgas mark 3. Break the chocolate into small pieces and leave to melt, without stirring, in a heatproof bowl suspended over a pan of simmering water. As the chocolate melts, gently stir in the dulce de leche and turn off the heat.Break the eggs into a large bowl, add the sugar and beat until thick and fluffy. A food mixer with a whisk attachment will give the best results. Stir the chocolate and dulce de leche into the mixture. You need only two three or three stirs to incorporate it. Any more and you might over-mix it.Transfer to two ramekins, using a rubber spatula. Put the ramekins into a roasting tin or baking dish. Pour enough boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins, then bake for 20 minutes until the surface is lightly crisp and the inside thick and creamy. Serve with a teaspoon and, if you wish, cantucci biscuits.• A soft crust appears on these puddings as you bake them, while the inside stays rich and fondant-like. It will stay like that for an hour or two, should you wish to make them a little ahead of time.• Heatproof china ramekins are ideal for these, but you can bake them in ovenproof cups too, or even metal thali dishes.• I have baked these chocolate puddings and eaten them the following day, when they are like thick, fudgy chocolate mousses.Greenfeast: Autumn, Winter by Nigel Slater (Fourth Estate, £22).

It wasn’t something you watch it was something that takes you with itThis story starts in a self-proclaimed communist utopia, a tiny village in the Andalucían countryside where Che Guevara looks out from the sports ground, Republican flags adorn the town hall and political murals are painted on walls a small, isolated place with no police where much of the 2,626 population live in identical homes they built themselves and the town’s seal depicts a dove of peace with an olive branch where they organised raids on supermarkets to feed people, public salaries are equal, collectives work the fields, land confiscated from the aristocracy, and the mayor is fond of Che’s line: only those who dream will someday see their dreams become reality.Which is appropriate, even if this reality wasn’t the dream they had. One hundred and one kilometres east of Seville, Marinaleda is, as the title of Dan Hancox’s fascinating book calls it, the village against the world. The mayor since 1979 is Juan Manuel Sánchez Gordillo, who has the kind of beard you’re supposed to have when you’re a founder of the Collective for Workers’ Unity, an instigator of hunger strikes, and the political leader of a place like this – described as Spain’s Robin Hood – when you’ve been jailed seven times and the target of at least two assassination attempts.One day, or so it goes, Sánchez Gordillo met Bori, a Guinean who had left Bissau first and Portugal next to come to Spain alone after his wife became pregnant. Bori had nothing, was in a bad way, and had heard Marinaleda was a place where they looked after people. Thrust into the media lately, he says he became Sánchez Gordillo’s driver (although other versions have him behind the wheel of a rubbish truck) and they became close. The mayor looked after him, gave him work, somewhere to stay, and helped to bring his family over. Bori also worked on the construction of the railway, and turned his hand to anything he could. His wife and two sons joined him and they set up home in Herrera, 10 kilometres away.Wearing swimming shorts and in bare feet, aged six, one of his sons went to play football at the local club, where they couldn’t believe what they saw. They knew immediately some even dashed to the family home to break the news. Unbeknown to Bori, it turned out his son was good at football. Very, very good at football.On Saturday night, he scored 111 seconds into his first ever start for Barcelona, standing there arms outstretched in front of 81,617 people.When Ansu Fati was called up to train with the first team, he didn’t eat and he didn’t sleep, his dad said. Meanwhile, Bori and his wife cried. Ansu had never even played for the B team before. When he ran on at the Camp Nou, there was a look of incredulity in his eyes. At 16 years, 298 days he was the second youngest player ever to play for Barcelona – Vicenç Martínez was 18 days younger when he made his debut almost 80 years before – and he looked it, too: a competition winner whose prize was to play with a professional club. But then he started playing. And then he belonged. “Daring,” Valverde called him.But, no, that’s not this week. That was three weeks ago now. That night, Bori announced that he could “die happy”, but he would have missed so much more. The week after, Ansu came on as a sub at Osasuna. Six minutes later, he scored. At 16 years, 304 days, he was the youngest goalscorer in Barcelona’s history, the third youngest to score a La Liga goal anywhere, ever. And then on Saturday night, 111 seconds into his first Camp Nou start, he scored again, aged 16 years and 318 days.They could barely believe this and Ansu had only just begun. This wasn’t one of those things that just happens, a coincidence. It wasn’t something you watch it was something that takes you with it something that seemed to take defenders with it too, disoriented and defeated, wondering if it’s real. And the conclusion was that, yes, yes, it is. That he is. Within five minutes, Ansu had left Ezequiel Garay standing like someone had secretly nailed his feet to the floor, stepping past him, and laying it off perfectly for Frenkie de Jong to make it 2-0. No one younger had ever provided an assist and scored, and it still it went on. The next time he got it, there was a nutmeg feet flashing, he stepped inside and bent the shot this close to the top corner. He’d hardly been playing 10 minutes.By half-time, Valverde said, his muscles were feeling the strain. And so with an hour gone, and Barcelona 3-1 up, Ansu departed. The Camp Nou stood to hand him an ovation. Waiting on the touchline, applauding too, was Luis Suárez, who scored a brilliant first within seconds to make it 4-1 and then added another on the way to a 5-2 victory over a depressed, disintegrating Valencia. Suárez is almost twice his age: the day the Uruguayan made his debut, Ansu was two. “Ansu enamours, Suárez kills,” ran AS’s headline. “What this kid’s doing is something we have to take very seriously the hour he played was an absolute scandal.” Marca ran on: “The name’s Fati, Ansu Fati,” opening their match report with the same line El Mundo used for a headline: “A star is born.” El Mundo Deportivo declared: “A kid has become one of Barcelona’s great hopes.”In the hope lies the risk, of course. There’s caution amidst the celebration, even as some rush to proclaim the second coming. There’s something attractive in youth that fades with time, even if the talent doesn’t, an excitement in discovery that can’t always be maintained. There’s a joy in the subversion, the explosion, the moment that’s hard to avoid and harder to maintain. Kids like Ansu bring hope, Jorge Valdano wrote, a hint of Marinaleda in his words, because they come to “break the established order”. And that utopia is difficult to meet, always just out of reach. With young players, it’s not just about what they are but what they might become, future performances projected upon them and achievements assumed. The achievements of others too every New Someone carries a weight they never wanted, good not be good enough. The man – the kid – Ansu overtook as Barcelona’s youngest goalscorer is Bojan. “People say my career wasn’t what was expected: ‘the new Messi’,” he says. “Well, if you compare me with Messi … but what career did you expect?”There’s celebrity, pressure, demands, exposure, infancy immediately lost. At Barcelona that’s especially true, weighed by the expectations of La Masia – as much a concept as a place, a spiritual home as much as a footballing one. And all the more so amid the often-political debate of its declining relevance. Ansu’s world is different now.“It’s not normal,” Valverde said. “It’s all a bit exaggerated: it’s not normal that his first touch is a goal, it’s not normal that his second is an assist and his third almost goes into the top corner everything will go back to normal. This will get bigger and bigger between us we have to deflate it a bit and protect the player.” Sergio Busquets said: “He’s very young. We know what he is capable of, what he’s doing, that the fans are excited, that people are comparing him to great players. We have to support him because we know hard times will come he has to know where he is. He has the qualities. He’s a great player, he’s got a good head on him and he works hard. Hopefully this can be the beginning of a long history here.”“We have to give him time he’s 16,” Clement Lenglet said, but it may be too late for that already.“The devil is called Ansu Fati,” ran the headline in El País, a hint of Messi’s debut in the Gamper Trophy when Fabio Capello called him that. And while Ansu isn’t Messi – although that photo was a public blessing – there’s something about him. Asked if we were all going too far in all the excitement, the former Spain goalkeeper Santi Cañizares replied simply: “No.” Sport had already announced the arrival of Ansu Mania. Now, they echoed Victor Hugo Morales’s famous commentary of Diego Maradona’s goal against England, to ask: “What planet did you come from?!”Which planet? This one, Bissau to Barcelona, via Sevilla, Herrera and Marinaleda, the village where a metal sign declares: “Another world is possible.” As Bori and his son are finding out.• Real Madrid: good, then bad.• Real Sociedad’s new stadium was finally finished, rubbish running track banished forever, and they broke it in by breaking the only team to have won every game so far this season. The noise was superb, the performance too – especially from Martin Odegaard, who scored the first in a 2-0 win against Atlético. Nacho Monreal got the second. “It was a special game, it couldn’t have gone any better I could never have imagined anything as good as this,” he said. All the stats showed how much better la Real were, but one stat is probably the most eloquent of all: 32. That’s how much closer, in metres, the fans behind the goal are to the pitch now.• Joan Jordan’s free-kick was good as Sevilla went top with a 1-0 win at Alavés, but then along came Hervías for Valladolid as they drew with Osasuna, and his was ridiculous. Woof. Coach Sergio standing there grinning and rolling his eyes said more than anything else could.• More on Valencia’s crisis to come, by the way.• “It’s not football,” Celta manager Fran Escribá said after his team spent most of the defeat against Granada playing with nine men after a new ruling – explained and accepted with admirable calm in a tunnel conversation between players and referee – and its VAR accomplice delivered another laughably light red card. And that’s before we get on to the amount of time taken to do it. Game after game. Over nine minutes, in this case, if you’re wondering. He’s right."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e058825df9efe06fbacbdc1b1a7bf7bb422b5951/0_23_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b0ec3f75bcf2b760d965c99c134c9a3","title":"david de gea manchester united new contract","story":"Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea has signed a new four-year deal with the club, ending speculation about his future.De Gea’s moved to Old Trafford in 2011 from Atlético Madrid and firmly made himself one of the team’s key players over the last eight seasons. The Spain international’s new contract will keep him at Manchester United until the summer of 2023, with the option of extending it for a further season.“It has been a privilege to spend eight years at this great club and the opportunity to continue my career at Manchester United is a genuine honour,” De Gea said. “Since I arrived here, I could never have imagined I would play over 350 games for this club. Now my future is fixed, all I want is to help this team achieve what I believe we can and win trophies again, together.“As one of the senior players in the squad, I want to support and lead in any way that I can to assist the younger players, so they know what it means to play here. I still feel that I have so much more to achieve at the club and I truly believe that Manchester United can build on the club’s tradition of success and reward our fans for their support. I am committed to continue repaying the fans for all of the care that they’ve shown me during the good times and the bad.”De Gea has made 367 appearances for United and won numerous trophies including the Premier League, Europa League and FA Cup. In recent seasons he has been linked with a move away from England, with De Gea almost moving to Real Madrid in 2015.Getting his No 1 goalkeeper to commit his future to the club will be a great relief to manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær.“Over recent years, David has proved himself to be the best in the world and a vital part of our plans as we look to take Manchester United back to where it belongs. David is a fantastic person and his outstanding quality provides the perfect base to our defence,” Solskjær said.“Over his time here, David has really understood the values of playing for Manchester United and now represents everything you want in a goalkeeper. As a player he is still hugely determined and hungry to achieve more.

Luciano Passirani, an Italian football journalist, was a guest on the Qui Studio a Voi Stadio show when he made the racist remark and the director of the Telelombardia show reacted immediately by saying that he would never appear on the programme again.He then added: “They have something extra that the rest don’t have, and then they score the goals and drag your team forward. This guy kills you in the one-on-ones, if you try to challenge him you wind up on the floor. Either you have 10 bananas to eat, that you give to him, or …”The director of the show, Fabio Ravezzani, said that Passirani had apologised but that that was not enough. “Mr Passirani is 80 years old and to compliment Lukaku he used a metaphor that turned out to be racist,” he said. “I think it was a terrible lack of momentary lucidity. I cannot tolerate any kind of errors, even if momentary.”On the pitch Lukaku has been a huge success already, scoring two goals in three games as Inter sit top of Serie A. But it has been a troubled time off the pitch after he was subjected to monkey chants by Cagliari fans. To make matters worse, Inter fans then wrote an open letter supporting the Cagliari fans.“You have to understand that Italy is not like many other north European countries where racism is a REAL problem,” said the statement, published on Facebook by a group who occupy the second tier of the Curva Nord at Inter’s San Siro home. “In Italy we use some ‘ways’ only to ‘help our teams’ and to try to make our opponents nervous, not for racism but to mess them up.”Lukaku posted a message on Instagram after the incident in Cagliari, saying: “Many players in the last month have suffered from racial abuse ... I did yesterday too. Football is a game to be enjoyed by everyone and we shouldn’t accept any form of discrimination that will put our game in shame. I hope the football federations all over the world react strongly on all cases of discrimination!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/164e56c29aba38890ca8d979db1c8a7d9ffc9e79/0_144_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf2efe810a911281a5e4feddd0b32400","title":"bedbugs new york infestation","story":"It took me ages to realize my place was infested. That’s when I learned of the life-altering measures required to fix the problemIn these weird political times, I hear a lot of people saying, “Can things get any worse?” I usually scoff and tell them “Yes. Yes they can.” Things can always get worse, and I’ve learned this lesson the hard way – from bedbugs.For the past 10 years I’ve produced a podcast called RISK!, where people tell true stories too intense or explicit for broadcast radio. Some are a laugh riot, but others keep me up at night.Over time, I began to notice that the scarier stories on the show have an uncanny tendency to include these insect parasites. It’s typical of someone to start with a line like, “The summer my mom died, my career collapsed. But the worst part was getting bedbugs.”This recurring theme got me worried – and they say worrying is like praying for what you fear. I’m a kinky polyamorous gay man, so it could have been that sleeping around was how I got bedbugs in the first place. But having more than one partner was also how I figured out the insects were after me.Several years ago, I woke up in my bed next to my friend Kai, a sculptor I was sleeping with. I had just finished making a pot of coffee in the kitchen when he stumbled in, looking shook.“See these marks on me? What are they?” Small red dots ran down his torso. I went numb with deja vu. A week prior, another fella I was dating complained about the same marks, but I’d assumed a mosquito was to blame. “Fuck!” I said. “I hope this isn’t what I think it is!” I ran back to the bedroom and yanked up the mattress to peek at the box spring. There it was. A bunch of little black stains, like someone had taken a thin Sharpie and dotted the fabric. Then I looked a little closer and saw something worse: something brown, oval, and moving. I trapped it on a little piece of masking tape and started Googling to find out what it was.Kai fled the scene, while I fell into the Heart of Darkness of Google spirals. I learned that the little black dots on the fabric were feces and that the contents of those droppings were mostly my own blood. Turns out, not everyone will have a reaction to a bedbug bite, so this had gone on for some time without my knowing. Two people that sleep in the same bed can be bitten by bugs and one might break out with red marks while the other might not.That’s why that bug I found was was so big. He’d been feasting on me for weeks but my skin hadn’t shown it. Did you know bedbugs inject an anesthetic into you, a numbing chemical, so when they do start sucking your blood, you don’t know? Here’s another fun fact: we have no idea what, if any, purpose bedbugs serve in the ecosystem.As I was going all hot and cold with panic, I remember saying out loud, “But this is like crabs, right? I’ve survived crabs before!” Gentle reader, they’re not. The natural habitat of pubic lice is pubic hair, which is a thing that grew on peoples’ bodies till the 1990s. But bedbugs can hide in mirrors, bookshelves, wall units, books, computers, phones, clocks, remote controls, and most importantly, walls.I was turning up so much contradictory information that I finally ran to Barnes and Noble to pick up a “definitive” tome called The Bed Bug Survival Guide, only to find mixed messages there too. The notes I took that day are filled with insane stuff like this: “For a few months after spotting bugs, you should require all guests to your home to strip nude in the hall before entering your premises and to keep their clothes quarantined in garbage bags away from the walls in the hall.” I have a reputation for being as kinky as they come, but even I couldn’t get away with that sort of hospitality. Another one was: “For the rest of your life, if you absolutely must enter a hotel room, keep everything you own in the bathtub!” I remember one source saying, “Vacuum vacuum vacuum! All couches, drapes, and table cloths!” Then a few pages later, it said to be careful about vacuuming because “that’s a surefire way to spread eggs into other parts of the home!”I’m a recovering Catholic, so I couldn’t help but think: “I’m being punished. I must have brought this plague on myself!” I spent the rest of the day texting any guy I’d slept with in months with variations of “Honey! Check your stuff because I might have given you something!” You won’t find that in How to Win Friends and Influence People. As I rifled through contacts, I began obsessing over one incident a couple months past. I met this guy on a BDSM website. I said we could play at my place, but he said, “Wouldn’t it be kinky if we were to have sex in this sleazy pay-by-the-hour motel I heard about in the shadiest part of Queens?” All kink play requires negotiation. This is where I should have said to myself, “Am I agreeing this because it’s hot to me too, or just because he has a sweet booty?” It was the booty.Lucky for him, I guess, the motel was just as sordid as he’d said. Ancient straight porn played on the TV. Everything looked and smelled like it had been the same since 1974. I’d left my backpack at the foot of the bed. Had the bag become like a Trojan horse for transferring tiny motel residents into my home? Probably not. I’m always traveling for work, so any of a half-dozen other hotels might have been the culprit. Still, this paragraph made me feel itchier than the rest. But there was also that whole thing about bedbugs going through walls. Milos, my landlord, was a big-bellied man, always wearing flashy suits and chomping on cigars. He stared menacingly at passersby from his window. Everyone in the building knew Milos spent a fortune on his own ground floor apartment, and peanuts on ours above. When I told him this situation needed fixing, he charitably replied that it was my problem.I ended up paying a bargain-rate exterminator $500 for a fumigation. When he was finished, he said, “That’ll do it!” It didn’t. A month later, I found bugs in the living room. They were like an army that had set up camp several miles from their target. Then the couple across the hall from me revealed they had bugs too. We teamed up to implore the landlord to treat the whole building. But Milos would not relent. I paid Miguel another $500 for an extermination, and so did the folks across the hall. “That’ll do it!” Miguel told us. It didn’t. One day I was recording my podcast in the sound booth, this tiny wooden box I had built off the side of my kitchen. The walls of it were covered in sound-proofing foam. I’d just finished whining into the mic about how exhausted I was from my paranoia that the bugs were all around me now. Suddenly, I became like the guy in the movies looking for the monster, who whispers: “He’s right behind me, isn’t he?” I got the idea to peel back one of the panels of sound proofing-foam glued to the walls of the booth. The whole booth was crawling with them.That became Chainsaw Day. That’s what I call it now. Anyone who knows me will tell you that I’m so clumsy, I should be nowhere near the driving wheel of a vehicle or the on-button of a power tool. But that day, I rushed to the hardware store, rented a chainsaw, and decimated every piece of furniture I owned. And I kept finding bugs! It’s important to remind ourselves what we’re grateful for. Looking back at Chainsaw Day, I’m grateful I still have limbs. But heat is another way to kill them, so I lost piles of books by accidentally setting them all on fire in the oven. Who really knows the right temperature for cooking books?I couldn’t afford to move, but decided I had to. The day I finally found a new place to move into – almost four months after I’d found that first bug – that was the day Milos began acting like a landlord should. The woman living downstairs from me told him she had bugs now too, and Milos finally realized the army was marching his way. He had the whole building exterminated.But two weeks later, right before moving day, I did something bad, and I’m here to tell you, I don’t regret it. I lied.

But plenty of adults have left behind sedentary lifestyles – you just have to find the right approachWhen Sarah Overall was a child, a PE teacher held the entire class back because Overall would not do the high jump. She was tiny – as an adult, she is under 5ft (1.5m) tall – and was scared of hurting herself on the metal bar. “I was too short to get over it,” she says. “I remember the whole class watching.” Netball was “pure hell”. She enjoyed hockey, which suited her body better, but she felt written off by her PE teacher. “I was like: ‘Do you not get that I actually work really hard at the things I can do?’”Now, years later, Overall is a personal trainer and sees the damage that bad PE lessons have had on her clients. “It’s pretty much everybody who comes to me,” she says. “I don’t think I’ve got anybody, especially a woman, who has said: ‘I was good at sport at school.’”It is something other trainers see, too. “Kids at school are not like babies and toddlers who try to crawl, fail, try to crawl, fail,” says Joslyn Thompson Rule, a personal trainer. “They sense embarrassment and shame, and it’s easier not to try than to try but fail. Unfortunately, it becomes a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy and leads to them not being able to do it.” Teenage experience, she says, “can affect your perception of your ability”.The things we are told as children and teenagers stay with us. I was not particularly sporty at school, although I clearly remember being praised by my PE teacher one day after a volleyball class. The idea that I am good at that one particular sport has, weirdly, become a small part of my identity – even though I have never played a game of volleyball since. Likewise, I hated cross-country running with a passion and, for years, told myself it wasn’t for me, only to discover a love of running – especially over fields and hills – more than two decades later.“Kids pick up all kinds of stuff, whether or not anybody actually labels them – they make comparisons with their peers and draw conclusions,” says Wendy Johnson, a professor of psychology at the University of Edinburgh. “There’s nothing intrinsic to say these kinds of labels have to get wired into our identities, but sometimes they do – when kids are often last to be picked for teams or laughed at for being slow or clumsy. Things can happen along the way to reverse impressions like this, but for some kids, these identities can last a lifetime.”The stereotype of the sadistic games teacher is probably largely unfair, but, says Kay, there is “room for improvement in some areas”. Historically, PE lessons were “largely about physical ability”, he argues, but for older children it is equally important for the lessons to cover social and emotional wellbeing.“If you think about some of the things that turn people off sport, they’re probably the same things that turn people off competition,” he says. Competition can be made more inclusive beyond physical ability. “We’re not trying to get rid of competition instead, we’re saying what can you do about the rules, the environment, and how are you going to decide on a winner? By reframing competition, you can make it more inclusive, and make sure that things other than sporting prowess are celebrated.”These could include allowing everyone to play, rather than only a select few making a team, or changing the scoring so it is not only about goals or runs – the outcome of a game – but also giving scores for behaviour or skill.Johnson says she always told her children: “Exercise is good for our bodies, and everyone can find some exercise they can enjoy it doesn’t matter if you’re particularly good at it.” As an adult, you can shift your identity around whether or not you are “sporty” by simply doing it, she says. “Pick up any issue of Runner’s World – it’s full of people who have come to running in their 40s or 50s and ended up getting into it and running marathons. I don’t mean winning, but they see the benefits not just of the exercise, but joining a club, where the focus is on the community rather than being the best.”Labels such as “sporty” have particular connotations, she says, and it is not necessarily useful to think of yourself in those terms. “Not just about exercise and health, but about fashion, values, lifestyles, athleticism and sexual identity. Physical exercise that boosts physical health and psychological wellbeing comes in many forms that aren’t sporty – dancing is exercise, as is gardening, carpentry and housework. If the goal is physical exercise for health, one doesn’t have to have a sporty identity. Think broadly about anything that involves getting yourself moving.”Overall rediscovered sport after enjoying aerobics classes. Hannah Lewin, a personal trainer, says many of her clients suffer from a lack of confidence around sport and exercise, usually instilled in them as teenagers. Instead of something to be enjoyed, sport became “a stressful experience. An early negative experience around being shamed, or being forced to do something you weren’t naturally very good at – and then belittled for not being very good at it – is something I see every day. It really does carry through into adulthood.”Adults tend to find their way to her – and exercise – once their confidence has improved. “They may have had other successes in work or relationships,” says Lewin. Overall adds: “You’re now doing this for yourself. You don’t have the pressure of teammates, and nobody is judging you. Don’t compare yourself with anybody else. Once you find the activity that is right for you, and a situation you are comfortable in, you can be surprised at what you can do.” She has had clients who have gone from sedentary lifestyles to running marathons.All the personal trainers I speak to say you should choose something you enjoy – this isn’t about compulsory rounders any more. “Gyms can be daunting places and you can feel the same as an adult as you did as a child – not being good enough, fit enough, strong enough,” says Thompson Rule. If being shouted at in a HIIT class isn’t working for you – or brings back bad memories – do something else.“If you keep forcing yourself to do something you’re really not enjoying, it’s going to become another source of stress,” says Lewin. “You’ll give up and come back to that old idea of: ‘I’m not sporty.’ That’s not the case. You just haven’t found what’s right for you.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2878d2bdf04edb46e4bfee5a17bf444409fc3126/0_181_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0ae1a889944c086d8bf6bb667588a17","title":"james murdoch fox news interview","story":"Rupert Murdoch’s younger son gave subtle but pointed criticism of the network in an interview with the New YorkerFor decades the Murdoch name has been synonymous with the type of monolithic conservative thinking broadcast and printed by the family’s media empire around the world. More recently, and in particular the Fox News brand, has likewise become synonymous with almost universal praise for Donald Trump. But recent comments given by James Murdoch, younger son of Rupert, point out that not all members of the family are necessarily ideologically aligned.He has seen signs of rising illiberalism and threats to democracy around the world led by authoritarian regimes using the tools of the digital age to spread disinformation, he said.“The connective tissue of our society is being manipulated to make us fight with each other, making us the worst versions of ourselves,” he said.Asked if that included Fox News, he demurred somewhat, but noted: “There are views I really disagree with on Fox.”His foundation Quadrivium, which he established with his wife, Kathryn, who has worked on the Clinton Climate Initiative, has made part of its mission fighting the type of disinformation campaigns seen in recent years that have helped usher in fascist-leaning governments around the world. The group is also working on galvanizing voter turnout, something sure to work against the prospect of Trump’s re-election were it to prove successful.A New York Times investigation earlier this year suggested Murdoch has long held ambivalent attitudes towards Fox News. The NYT said: “When Roger Ailes, the chief executive of Fox News, was ousted in 2016, amid a sexual harassment scandal, James wanted to revamp the network as a less partisan news outlet.”Murdoch’s latest comments are, on the whole, a small fissure in the typically Trump-adoring Murdoch front, but given some of the recent criticism of the president from Fox News personalities, it may be a harbinger of shifting political winds in the family business.Or it could just be the newly freed Murdoch son, who has dallied with centrist and Democratic causes before, reiterating his independence. Around the time of the protests and violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 Murdoch criticized Trump’s comments praising neo-Nazis.One thing it would be hard to say, given comments he gave about Pete Buttigieg – “It’s clear to anyone who hears him speak that he has an extraordinary mind,” he said – and his framing of the 2020 election as “a really crucial moment” for democratic values, is that his vision of a world fighting back against illiberalism includes Trump in it as president."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea6a1ff5def258218a7c31662a8a158b61dd1c38/45_42_3312_1987/master/3312.jpg?width=1140\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=16ce00c6a8d8a8490876f33a46c95b46 2280w","title":"the long view whats next for your money","story":" From savings and investments to debt clearance, we ask UK residents what goals they have for their money. Are Britons planning enough?Everyone has different financial goals with different ultimate aims – from launching a business to buying a house to investing for a better retirement. But how many of us have the right structures and plans in place to actually reach them?Many of us leave planning for our future too late, even though our longer-term goals often require longer-term arrangements. In addition, we tend to put our cash into property instead of financial products, partly because of the cultural importance attached to home ownership in the UK – with getting a foot on to the property ladder widely viewed as a key milestone. Others buy property as an investment, which can generate a rental income and may grow in value. But we’ve also seen property prices fluctuate, which can affect short-term liquidity, so this needs to be carefully considered from every perspective.We hit the streets to find out about people’s financial goals and whether or not they had put in place plans to make those goals happen.Providing for family was a big priority for many. With the rising costs of obtaining a university degree, and less secure work prospects for the next generation, some are feeling less certain about their children’s futures. “My goal is to put my daughter through university and to pay for her education. She wants to study fine art and to do a foundation course initially, so that’s the biggest thing I’m funding at the moment. I do have a financial adviser who I see now and then, who has given me advice on the best way to invest. I have a plan in place – although I’m not sure how much it will cost exactly. As a self-employed worker, finances and pensions can be complicated, but I’ve been investing into a pension since my 20s. In hindsight I probably should have invested in property!”“As a nurse who has worked in A\u0026ampE for a long time, I’m all about living for the moment and spending time with loved ones. Financially, I am stable and have put money aside for my children if they need it. I also have a few months’ wages saved up, in case something breaks in the house. But that’s it – I don’t believe in making big goals and saving up for very expensive things I don’t need.”For more information about saving for your children, go to HSBC’s saving for children guideThe majority of the people we spoke to mentioned buying property and owning a flat or house as their primary goal. For many it seems to offer the security of housing, as well as a form of investment.“I’m about to move to Sweden and I’d like to buy a property there with my partner, which might be fairly expensive. My partner and I are savers, definitely. We already have the money saved up for the purchase and I don’t have any debt. I have only ever used my credit card for things like flights and tend to use cash a lot, to avoid spending unnecessarily. I used to shop a lot but that’s changed – I don’t want to be in debt and overpaying for things I don’t need.”“My goal is to get a mortgage, so I can finally get on the property ladder – but I was recently made redundant, which wasn’t on the cards. It wasn’t great, but the plus side is that I was given a good redundancy package and I already had some savings. My uncle is an independent financial adviser, so he has given me help to get the ball rolling, but my main task is to find a new job.”For more information about securing your first home, go to HSBC’s first-time buyer’s guideOther respondents want to put money away to set up their own businesses – from marketing agencies to pizza joints. According to them, the freedom and independence that comes with running their own venture is the primary draw.“I want to run my own marketing company in Spain – where I’m from – once I graduate, so I’d say that’s my financial goal. Once I’ve done my master’s, I’ll start to save up money for the business. I’ve been asking my parents for money a lot lately, so I do need to have a proper plan in place – it’s just difficult when you’re studying and don’t have much free time. I’m really looking forward to the independence working for yourself brings, and I really like the idea of being challenged creatively.”For more information about finding the right finance for your business, go to HSBC’s guide to business borrowingSome respondents had very specific goals in mind as well as specific measures to help to fund them.“My aim this year is to finish paying for my extension and landscape gardener! I’m retired, so I spend a lot of time at home and in the garden. Last year, I downsized from a larger house to a smaller one, so I have the money to pay for it, which is lucky. I don’t have a mortgage or any huge outgoings and I’m pretty good at staying on top of my finances, but obviously these things cost money. My old house had a stream running alongside it, so I’d like a water feature in my new home, too – that’s the plan, anyway.”Another challenge for millions of people across the nation is dealing with accumulated debts. Getting on an even keel financially is the obvious springboard to building a more secure future, so getting out of the red and into the black is a common goal.“I’m determined to clear my debts. I’m already putting plans in place to do that over the next few years, including the four-month project management course I’m currently enrolled on. It can be difficult working and studying at the same time, but my goal is to land a job in the project management sector, and hopefully start to earn more. That should mean I’m able to find my way out of debt by making regular payments.”For more information about repaying your debts efficiently, go to HSBC’s guide to repaying your debts.Bear in mind, the value of investments and any income they generate can go down as well as up, meaning you may not get back what you invest.Whatever your goals and no matter your level of confidence with investing, HSBC could help you make better-informed decisions and could help you plan better.

Jo Richings, 50, a business coach, author and speaker from Bristol, says she’s keen to invest but is flummoxed by the options available, and she admits she doesn’t have the time to spend researching the alternatives.“At the moment, half of my savings are in the bank and the other half is held in premium bonds, so there’s no interest being made,” she says. “I’m quite risk-averse when it comes to stocks and shares, and don’t know much about what to invest in. I know I need to do more but I haven’t got the patience for it.”However, the current economic climate means it’s more important than ever to take a long-term view on our financial futures, whether it’s saving for – and then living through – retirement, or simply making sure loved ones are taken care of, argues James Hewitson, Head of Wealth and Advice at HSBC. But, he notes, many people think investing is not for them because they believe they are not wealthy enough.“This comes from a common misconception that you need a lot of spare cash to start investing,” he says. “Others simply don’t know where to begin and even if they look into investing themselves they encounter technical jargon – which is a major turn off.”HSBC is taking steps to help its 38 million customers worldwide manage their day-to-day finances and save for the future.

You spend a sleepless night angsting about how you’ll make ends meet when you eventually retire. You keep putting off making an appointment with a financial adviser. Exhibiting these behaviours might mean you share a guilty secret with many adults: we’re in denial about our finances.“There’s so much baggage attached to money,” says Simonne Gnessen, founder of Wise Monkey Financial Coaching. “It’s one of the last taboo subjects. We’re more likely to talk about our sex lives than money.”This is where having a financial life plan comes into its own. “A plan of action can give you a sense of control,” says Glenda Marchant, an accredited coach and mentor with The Spark Initiative. “It’s when we feel life is just pushing us around and we have no say that we start to feel stressed and anxious.”Goals before financesHowever, creating a financial life plan doesn’t actually start with your finances. To start, you need to examine your ambitions for your work and home life. “First and foremost it’s important to know what your true values are, then consider the goals that are significant to you,” says Marchant. “It could be that it’s important to you to feel settled, so you want to buy your own place. Or you might love to explore, so you need the time and money to go travelling. What would a new life look like for you and what plans do you need to put in place to achieve that dream?”James Hewitson, Head of Wealth \u0026amp Advice at HSBC UK, says: “Most people’s budgeting and planning focuses on the short term – for instance, a holiday or a new car. A life plan, by contrast, is about the everyday version of you in the future.”Inflows and outflowsThe first step towards achieving your goals is to face up to the true state of your finances. Spending time understanding the monthly flow of money going in and out allows you to recalibrate your day-to-day living – if, for example, you want to get married in a couple of years.However, Hewitson debunks the oft-spouted advice that young people could save money for a deposit on a house if only they’d cut back on flat whites or avocado on toast.“The most important thing for people when it comes to getting over the fear of setting a life plan is to start small and in a way that works for them. The concept of ‘not buying a coffee and investing the money instead’ frankly doesn’t work for many people – they simply don’t make the link between planning for their future and their daily coffee consumption.”Instead, you should look to invest a small amount of cash little and often by setting up a weekly or monthly direct debit into a savings or investment account. This can help you start the habit of taking steps towards achieving a bigger goal.Take actionHaggle for a better deal on your home insurance. Check your credit card repayment rate. Pay into that company pension plan. And consider investing your money instead of just leaving it in a savings account. After all, long-term investments are an obvious way to align your finances with your long-term goals.“To make the choice between consuming or investing, you need to know the life you want in the future,” says Hewitson. “Otherwise it becomes easier to reverse those decisions and give up your long-term ambitions.”However, he stresses the importance of starting the process early – ideally in your thirties: “The less time you give yourself, the less options you’ll have. The same goes for doing it at your own pace rather than when you’re under pressure because of events such as redundancy.”Investments can carry a higher risk than cash savings and you may not always get back what you put in.Whatever your level of confidence, HSBC UK could help you make better-informed investment decisions.

US rock radio and mainstream record-buyers had been almost implacably resistant to punk: none of the Ramones’ albums had cracked the US Top 40, nor had Blondie. Patti Smith’s ascension to the upper reaches of the Billboard Hot 100 had been achieved only by getting Bruce Springsteen to co-write a hit with her. Now, here was a band that felt like a product of the new wave – short, punchy tracks, distorted guitars, a hint of arty angularity, a mannered vocalist – but that wrote incredibly polished pop songs. They sounded enough like a straightforward hard rock band to appeal to the kind of music fans who had looked on aghast when the Sex Pistols fetched up in America. There was a vague suggestion of AOR, even prog rock about the keyboards.In 37 minutes, the Cars’ eponymous debut album featured enough indelible songwriting that the band joked it should be called The Cars’ Greatest Hits. Their record company did the rest: hired the defiantly un-punk producer of Queen and Journey, Roy Thomas Baker, to add radio-friendly gloss packaged it in a sleeve that featured a gorgeous, grinning model over the band’s preferred selection of arty black and white photos.It sold so well, and for so long – spending two and a half years on the US chart – that the Cars became embroiled in an argument about holding back the release of their follow-up with their label, who worried the band would effectively be competing with themselves.You might have been forgiven for imagining the Cars represented a calculated bid to bring new wave to the American masses, but the way they sounded was just an accurate representation of the inside of frontman Ric Ocasek’s head. By the time the Cars formed, he had been around the block: already in his mid-30s and a father of four, he’d spent the early 70s in a Crosby Stills and Nash-esque acoustic trio called Milkwood. He loved straightforward pop music, but he loved what he called “the left side of the music brain”, too: “My taste was to always go for that mix, even back in the 60s,” he said. “I loved the Velvet Underground and the Carpenters”.Old enough to remember 50s rock and roll first hand, he prized simplicity and directness in rock and knew the commercial value of a striking image – by all accounts a thoroughly charming man, he invariably hid behind a pair of sunglasses on-stage, projecting an air of aloof mysteriousness – but had an abiding passion for the experimental.Left to his own devices, he made a solo album called Beatitude that sounded noticeably weirder than the Cars, bearing the audible influence of early Roxy Music and Berlin-era Bowie. When he branched out into production, he worked with hardcore punk band Bad Brains and Suicide. He gamely attempted to introduce the latter to the Cars’ audience, taking them on tour as a support act, with predictable results: “The booing started before they reached their second song,” Ocasek delightedly recalled.The Cars represented a perfect synthesis of both sides of Ocasek’s taste. They could sound arty and left-field – particularly on their third, underrated album Panorama (1980) – but their success was driven by pure pop songwriting, at which he was astonishingly adept. For almost a decade, he gave the impression that knocking out huge hit singles came as second nature to him: Let’s Go, My Best Friend’s Girl, Shake It Up.Furthermore, the Cars were pragmatic and adaptable. Some of their US rock peers were squeamish about developments such as the rise of synth-pop and of MTV, but the Cars had embraced synthesisers from the start and they seemed to welcome the importance of videos as another extension of the image-consciousness Ocasek and drummer Dave Robinson, who designed most of their sleeves, had displayed from the start.Ocasek’s pop abilities reached a kind of pinnacle on 1984’s Heartbeat City, an exercise in mid-80s arena rock recorded with a master of that genre, producer Robert “Mutt” Lange, that was the most straightforwardly commercial album the Cars made, although Ocasek’s wiry vocals lent it at least a touch of oddness. Tellingly, he wrote but didn’t sing the album’s biggest hit, the super-smooth, ultra-radio-friendly ballad Drive. The album sold 4m copies in the US: six of its 10 tracks were released as singles.Behind the scenes, however, there were problems, including mounting tensions between Ocasek and bassist Benjamin Orr, who sang lead vocals on a number of their hits, including Drive. Furthermore, Ocasek loathed touring, and it’s hard not to think that the sheer scale of Heartbeat City’s success may have influenced his decision to quit altogether. There was no longer any real financial imperative to keep doing it.The Cars broke up after one more album, the lacklustre Door to Door (1987). When guitarist Elliot Easton and keyboard player Greg Hawkes mooted a reunion in the early 2000s, Ocasek demurred, and his former bandmates toured with Todd Rundgren as frontman, under the name the New Cars. Ocasek preferred to concentrate on a solo career, balancing sporadic releases that frequently leaned towards what he would have called the left side of the music brain (Getchertiktz, a collaboration with Suicide’s Alan Vega and writer Gillian McCain from 1996, featured spoken word and exploratory electronics) with production work.By then, his production talents were frequently sought out by artists inspired by the Cars: Weezer, Guided By Voices, No Doubt. Just how influential the band’s early records were was underlined when the Strokes appeared. In case you had missed the fact that their sound was audibly indebted to the Cars, they covered their 1978 hit Just What I Needed live. And indeed, it became obvious when Ocasek was eventually inveigled into a Cars reunion in 2010, minus Orr, who died of cancer in 2000.It wasn’t just that the handful of live shows Ocasek agreed to play were rapturously received, it was how contemporary their reunion album Move to This sounded. Not because they tried to sound contemporary, but because they didn’t need to. The way the Cars sounded in 1978 had become a sonic blueprint that permeated everything from alt-rock to mainstream pop."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/513cf56bb469051222e92799fde6158c27f4a4dd/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=426c794c4244b6c1055502b3b2a4adb4","title":"its all gone how hurricane dorian devastated the bahamas podcast","story":"Oliver Laughland tells Rachel Humphrys about the destruction he witnessed in the Bahamas in the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian.

Coverage included comments from two Tory MPs attacking the policy and led some donors to say they would stop supporting the charity.The RNLI reacted robustly, arguing that its mission had always been to save lives overseas as well as in UK and Irish waters. People began to donate money to show their support for the charity’s work in Africa and Asia.One donor said he had struggled to donate because the RNLI site had crashed under the traffic load. Others said they were setting up direct debits to support the work of the charity overseas and as a riposte to the coverage in the Times and MailOnline.It has been a difficult few weeks for the RNLI. In August, it warned that it faced a “perfect storm” of a shortfall of funds when it was busier than ever saving lives in the UK last week it announced plans to cut 135 positions, including 95 permanent jobs.The Times carried the details of the RNLI’s overseas spending in an article headlined: “RNLI funding burkinis for Africans while cutting jobs.” Part of MailOnline’s headline read: “How £3.3m of donations to lifeboat charity are spent abroad including aid for Tanzania swimmers and creches in Bangladesh.”The RNLI reacted by publishing a long statement in which it explained it had always been dedicated to reducing drowning not just in the UK but across the globe.It denied the suggestion it had not been clear with supporters that some of its funds went abroad. “We greatly value our supporters and have not misled them. The RNLI’s international work has been reported in detail in our annual reports going back several years and information is also available from the RNLI website and regularly reported elsewhere.”It went into detail about two projects mentioned in the articles. “The Panje Project teaches women swim survival skills in Zanzibar. The burkini, which is a full-length swimsuit, is an innovative (and cheap) way of enabling girls in strict Muslim countries to get into the water without compromising their cultural and religious beliefs. The RNLI has been involved in the Panje Project with the majority of the RNLI’s involvement funded by a donor who specifically wanted the money to go towards this project.An RNLI spokesperson said: “In response to the recent media pieces about the lifesaving work we are doing overseas, we have been very encouraged to see a sharp increase in online donations, coupled with some very positive messages of support. But this is such a polarising issue, and we have also received some very negative responses, including people contacting our supporter care team requesting to withdraw or reduce their support for the charity.“The volume of responses we have received on this matter is vast and ongoing – the overall picture is changing constantly at the moment, so it may be several weeks before we have a full understanding of its impact on donations to the RNLI.”On Twitter, one donor said: “Have just sent a donation because a life is a life, wherever it exists. No doubt your overseas work also generates a lot of goodwill for Britain, something the racist headbangers don’t understand!”Another said: “They have had so many donations the site has crashed. It took me a while yesterday to make my donation but it went through in the end.”The RNLI tweeted: “Thank you to everyone who has sent messages of support and made donations to us over the past 24 hours – we simply couldn’t save lives without our amazing supporters.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7621129ae1766cccdf73cdfcba3fbe7280a6d538/0_215_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f87471aba6cf9077adb6fb1d3704be1d","title":"five steps england regain ashes 2021 22 cricket","story":"In the second half of the Ashes series, England’s batsmen hinted at a move away from “it’s the way we play”. They need to run with that mood – or rather crawl with it, and forget about doing everything in a hurry. The only way to win in Australia is to go huge in the first innings, and England need to develop players, especially in the top three, who get high on dot balls. A change to the domestic schedule, so that four-day cricket is played in the middle of the summer on flatter pitches, perhaps with a Kookaburra ball, is essential. When England won in 2010-11, they batted for 150 overs, or five sessions, in four of the seven innings. Under Joe Root’s captaincy they have failed to do so in 62 attempts. Yes, batting has changed – but not that much. In Australia, frisky cameos with the bat win only contempt.The player with the highest batting average during Joe Root’s captaincy is Ben Foakes, with 41.50 from five Tests. He was dropped in the West Indies, two games after being Player of the Series in Sri Lanka. The removal of such a quiet achiever was symbolic of an era in which England have been seduced by potential, style and white-ball form. It evokes the Gerrard-Lampard years of English football, when the national team looked infinitely better on paper than on the pitch. England’s ODI swashbucklers bat in such a persuasive style as to brainwash us into thinking they have, or might, score more runs than is actually the case. A change of culture is overdue. It wouldn’t be easy to leave out players as obviously talented as Jonny Bairstow or Jos Buttler – but then it should not have been easy to drop the best wicketkeeper in the country, especially when his batting average was higher than the rest.The two triumphant Ashes tours of the modern era, 2010-11 and 2019, had one thing in common – the kind of planning usually reserved for a military operation. Joe Root says preparations for 2021-22 start now – but England said exactly the same after the last tour of Australia, and nothing much has changed. A decent first step would be to consult Andrew Strauss and Andy Flower about the marginal gains – not so much 1 percenters as 0.01 percenters – they achieved before and during the 2010-11 series. English cricket also needs to do more than pay lip-service to the avoidance of burnout. In particular, they need to manage, on a micro and macro level, the workload of Jofra Archer, the kind of fast bowler England have craved on Ashes tours since John Snow wreaked havoc in 1970-71. Calculated sacrifices will have to be made. England are scheduled to play 10 Tests against India in the nine months before the next Ashes tour. Huge games, all. But if they are really serious about winning the Ashes, Archer needs to miss some of them.It would be delightful to wolf down humble pie as Joe Root lifts the urn in January 2022, but all on-field evidence suggests he is never going to learn the art of captaincy. The main argument for retaining him seems to be that there isn’t anybody else. That isn’t strictly true, and ignores the fact that other captains would not come with such great opportunity cost – Root averages 53 in Tests when he isn’t in charge, as compared to 41 as captain, and 34 since the end of the 2017-18 Ashes. England have sacrificed their only great batsman for a mediocre captain the trade is unlikely to get much better. When Root was England’s Player of the Series in the 2015 Ashes, captaincy was a thing of the future and he had the most infectious smile in world cricket. It would be lovely to see it again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a8bf319e974d7107af919648fbde2e2c055a215/239_57_1187_711/master/1187.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc72a816d45b0da83797f15fa3aebbd9","title":"guardian womens cricketer year 2019 katie levick","story":" Women’s Cricketer of the Year is an award given to a player who has done something truly remarkable, whether by overcoming adversity, helping others or setting a sporting example by acting with exceptional honesty. Katie Levick is this year’s winner.A question: who is the all-time leading wicket-taker in the Women’s County Championship? Go on, take a guess. Perhaps you are thinking of Katherine Brunt, Anya Shrubsole, or even the recently retired Dani Hazell. On all three counts, you would be wrong. The correct answer is actually Katie Levick: a 28-year-old leg-spinner who hails from Sheffield.You have probably never heard of her, and for that there is a simple explanation: despite her 190 wickets for Yorkshire, and her impressive record in the Kia Super League – across the four years of the competition, she finishes as the leading non-international wicket‑taker with 29 at an economy of 6.6 – Levick has never worn an England shirt.It is that paradox which lies at the heart of the ’s decision to name Levick as the 2019 women’s cricketer of the year. The award aims to recognise “a player who has done something truly remarkable”, with “overcoming adversity” listed as one of the criteria. For Levick, that adversity came in the form of a phone call which she had to make seven years ago to the then England Academy coach Lisa Keightley.Levick had spent 12 months training with the Academy squad, alongside players such as Danni Wyatt and Nat Sciver, and was considered a very exciting prospect. But when she graduated from Sheffield Hallam University in May 2012 the imperative was to find paid work. “I needed some cash,” she recalls. With even the England team still two years away from earning central contracts, cricket was simply not going to pay the bills.Within weeks, she got a full-time job working in a school. “And that’s when I twigged: ‘I’m not going to be able to keep training.’ I knew that I wouldn’t be able to do it all. So I had to make that phone call to Lisa to say: ‘Take me out of consideration from now on.’“It felt really hard at the time. You muddle through and you get told what to do, and that was the first time I’d had to go to my parents and say: ‘Will you be disappointed if I pull myself out of the system?’ But they said: ‘We fully support you. We’re proud of you for getting a job, and making this big decision.’”Levick describes her background as “very normal, working-class, northern”: her dad is an electrician, and her mum works as a hospital receptionist. For many others of her generation, the only route into the England side – at a time when “making it” required a professional commitment to training, with no financial recompense – was through parental subsidy. For Levick, that option was never there.That life, though, still allowed her time for women’s county cricket, which – as an amateur venture – is always scheduled at the weekend. Other players might have been bitter might have dropped out of the sport altogether. Not Levick. “Bitterness does nothing for you,” she says with a shrug. “And playing for Yorkshire, wearing the White Rose, that’s always been my proudest thing. Especially coming from a very sport-dominant family, where you religiously follow Yorkshire and Sheffield Wednesday.”Levick first played cricket thanks to her older brother, Adam, the pair going along to sessions at their local club, Upper Haugh in Rotherham. Sent for county trials by the colts coach Dale Kerruish when she was 11, Levick was “spotted” by the then England bowler Laura Spragg, her unusual action setting her apart even then. “I get compared to a frog in a blender quite often,” Levick jokes. “I have absolutely no idea how I bowl leg spin, it just happened that way. I genuinely can’t do anything else.”Above all it is her consistency that sets Levick apart: “I’ve never been someone who bowls 15 different magical mystery balls, I just know I can put it anywhere I want to. I like to think that the batters facing me know that ‘she’s not going to let up and bowl you a bad ball, so you’re going to have to try and go after the good ones’, and that’s when you obviously pick up your wickets.”She eventually debuted for the Yorkshire first XI aged 16. With two parents working full-time, it was a struggle all the way along: Levick was reliant on lifts from “adopted grandparents” at Upper Haugh, as well as her Yorkshire teammates. “I got picked up a lot from junction 35, that was my pick-up stop!” she says with a laugh. “I used to sit at the side of the motorway with my cricket bag until one of the girls passed!”Twelve years down the line, bowing out of 50-over women’s county cricket as the competition’s leading wicket-taker seems fair reward for such graft.As, too, does her success in the KSL, a competition which every August for the past four years has given her just a small taste of what it might have been like to be a professional cricketer. “I did wonder for years: ‘Could I have done it?’ The Super League was my chance to bowl against international players. Doing all right, you think: ‘Actually, I could have done this.’ So it’s nice for my own peace of mind, I’m content that I know I could have competed if things had gone differently.”In so many ways, Levick is representative of a lost generation of sportswomen who, thanks to the chronic underfunding of women’s sport, have missed out on international glory. The England and Wales Cricket Board’s shake-up of domestic cricket from next season, which will include payment for players below the elite, comes too late to make a difference for Levick, whose future remains uncertain. “With it being the end of the KSL and still the unknown, I don’t know if I will play next year.”Either way, the abolition of the Women’s County Championship in its current form at least cements her name in the record books permanently. Some small compensation, perhaps, for never gaining the England cap she so richly deserved."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f853f99b0bb6795ce64086de28ff32df2fcdc3b/0_147_5144_3087/master/5144.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b105159adba95437b6efafb1a08d78c","title":"rugby world cup unpredictability japan weather","story":"Unfamiliar surroundings and the potential for extreme weather means coaches in Japan must be ready for anythingTo appreciate just how different to the norm the 2019 Rugby World Cup is going to be, you only have to set foot outside. Even on a damp Monday in Tokyo, the humidity is unmissable and so is the air of novelty. Judging by the 15,000 locals who queued around the block just to watch Wales train in Kitakyushu, the next few weeks are going to challenge plenty of familiar assumptionsDrive – or rather crawl – through the busier business districts of the Japanese capital and images of the host nation’s players are plastered across the windows of 24-7 convenience stores. There is even a 40ft high action picture of the Australia fly-half Bernard Foley, not normally a household name, on a tower block overlooking one of the main intersections. The All Blacks long-serving coach Steve Hansen has traversed the rugby world multiple times but even he looks faintly taken aback by the rising tide of craziness.With Friday’s kick-off now fast approaching, England’s trump card is also becoming increasingly apparent. Having coached extensively in Japan, few iniduals have a clearer idea of what awaits than Eddie Jones, who also guided the Brave Blossoms to three pool wins at the 2015 World Cup. Jones has hung around professional sport long enough to know nothing will be easy but his insider knowledge could yet prove invaluable.Because, with the weather forecast for the region unsettled for the next fortnight, this already has the feel of a tournament which could upset even the most carefully-laid plans. If it pours down for New Zealand’s game against South Africa in Yokohama this Saturday, for example, one involuntary slip of a greasy ball could reshape the entire competition. When Warren Gatland is rubbing baby oil on Wales’s training balls on the eve of a World Cup and the lead singer of a Japanese death metal band is among the host nation’s interpreters, anything is possible once the actual rugby starts.In that respect, the next few weeks will be right up Jones’s street. Never mind that England’s opening game against Tonga will be safely staged beneath a closed roof in Sapporo in the more northerly climes of Hokkaido. Jones has long been seeking people capable of adapting to any temperatures and conditions, to the point where discomfort and adaptability become second nature.This inside knowledge of what will be required has shaped his approach from day one. Every coach wants big, fit players but Jones has spent four years looking specifically for resilience, both physical and mental. From the moment he took over as England head coach he has also been fixated on one date: 2 November 2019. Way back in January 2017 he even let the  into the secret of precisely what would happen in the Rugby World Cup final in Yokohama. “England v New Zealand, with England to win by a point. It’ll be a cracking game.”That sense of unwavering conviction has occasionally flickered, not least when England trailed in a dismal fifth in the 2018 Six Nations. Looking back at his unfolding masterplan with the benefit of hindsight, however, is instructive. When it comes to removing players from their comfort zones, Jones has been relentlessly consistent. All the comings and goings in selection, the ridiculously early alarm calls and the excessive backroom staff turnover now feel part of that same grand design.Love him or not, his players can now sense things starting to take real shape. When England bolt all the various key segments of their gameplan together – fitness, defence, a strong set-piece, pace out wide – as they did against Ireland both in February and August they can look devastating.Maybe, too, Jones’s luck is changing. His team to face Tonga is not due to be unveiled until Friday and both Joe Cokanasiga and Mark Wilson have knee niggles but, just when he needs them, his main men should all be available. Maro Itoje, Billy Vunipola, Kyle Sinckler, Ellis Genge, Courtney Lawes, Manu Tuilagi … anyone repeatedly bumping into them can expect a very tiring, painful afternoon. Add in a fit Mako Vunipola and Cokanasiga and, pound for pound, this is the strongest England squad – in all senses – since 2003. A primed, focussed Tuilagi almost feels like a new signing after so many years in the injury doldrums.Hansen also knows his All Black side could have their hands full containing a full-on Springbok pack in perhaps the most heavy-duty opening weekend fixture at any Rugby World Cup in the professional era. Even the hugely-experienced Kiwi lock Sam Whitelock, about to commence his third World Cup, is already sensing a different level of pressure: “Regardless of the opposition in the first game, there’s that knot in the stomach. You don’t know what that first one’s going to be like.”There is particular uncertainty about South Africa’s rush defence out wide, which Hansen has described as “rolling the dice big time” in terms of the riskreward equation. It worked pretty well last month when the Boks held the All Blacks to a 16-16 draw in Wellington but Hansen appears keen to put an element of doubt in South African minds if he can. He also argues Saturday’s winner is far from guaranteed to win the World Cup. “Logic will tell you whoever wins this game, probably wins the pool. But as we found in 2011, you don’t have to necessarily win the pool to get into the final. France did it the other way. It’s not the end of the world if you lose … there’s a lot of water to go under the bridge.” Quite literally so if this week’s weather forecasts prove accurate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b0fbcf8c3b74f0e51b77786363fdcf005bd12e7/0_286_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ce1aef9155fa9fc201f86eb60ea0865","title":"ashes report cards england australia player series","story":"It was a series to remember for Steven Smith, Jofra Archer and Ben Stokes. It was one to forget for Jason Roy and Moeen AliBy Gary Naylor for the 99.94 Cricket BlogJoe Root: 325 runs, average 33 three wickets, average 41A shadow of the bustling batsman and dressing room joker of not so long ago. No century in the series and not much fun either. He won’t ever say that he’s had enough of cricket, but it sure looks like that now – and who can blame him? His captaincy attracted a lot of criticism, but when you have only one batsman average more than 40, you’re going to spend a lot of time playing catch-up. Never a good look for a skipper. He out-reviewed his opposite number comfortably and bowled well in the rush for the line at The Oval – it’s amazing what a release of pressure does. Grade: CRory Burns: 390 runs, average 39Burns started with a century that deserved more than to be somewhat forgotten amid a Steven Smith-dominated defeat, but he was sorted out by the short ball subsequently. Having worked on his game, that flaw is still there but much diminished – so he’s a quick learner. His acrobatic catching in the cordon is a bonus – he might be better employed at first slip. He’s probably a couple of centuries off being penned in as next captain, a particularly seductive proposition as he’s a red-ball specialist. Grade: BJason Roy: 110 runs, average 14He was removed from the firing line when his “stand still and slash at it” technique, which works in white-ball cricket, was horribly exposed in Test matches. Grade: EJoe Denly: 312 runs, average 31The James Vince question persists: do the lovely cover drives outweigh the windy wafts? He benefited from the unfounded assertion that “there’s nobody pushing for a place”, but looks more like a sixth bowler option on the subcontinent who can score a fifty or two than a regular Test opener. He deserves his chance to prove me wrong. Grade: B-Ben Stokes: 441 runs, average 55 eight wickets, average 45That it is not “Stokes’s Ashes” is hardly his fault, his epic innings to win the Headingley Test one for the ages. Now a batsman who bowls, he is following the path trodden by Jacques Kallis – a top-order bat who can break partnerships or capitalise further if it’s his day. Like some of his teammates, he looked exhausted by the demands of a summer that cannot – and should not – be repeated. Grade: AJonny Bairstow: 214 runs, average 24 20 catches, two stumpingsHe regressed to some of his technical problems of the past, hands pushing hard at the ball, the gate an inviting target for a bowler prepared to home in on the stumps. A run of low scores improved (if that’s the word) to a run of starts that he failed to convert. Given that he’s not the best keeper in the country – and maybe not the best in the team – that’s a disappointing return. England’s policy of playing two keepers looks like it might have run its course. Grade: CJos Buttler: 247 runs, average 25No batsman is deliberately given the role of batting with the tail, but that was Buttler’s lot for much of the series and it undoubtedly impacted on his numbers. Like Roy, his one-day virtue is something of a five-day vice, the firm base and arms-free approach inevitably making him vulnerable to the moving ball, as even straight ones are not lined up properly. He’ll almost certainly retain his spot, but he has to start scoring centuries soon if he is to warrant a top-six slot. Grade: B-Moeen Ali: four runs, average two three wickets, average 57 A feast-or-famine player who was definitely in famine mode before he was hooked after the Edgbaston defeat. He is too gifted to be written off, but how patient selectors can be with a bowler who gives away so many boundaries and a batsman who so often rolls the dice remains to be seen. Grade: EChris Woakes: 120 runs, average 20 10 wickets, average 33 A strangely anonymous series for the English-conditions specialist whose bit-part status was as much the result of Joe Root’s reluctance to bowl him as it was of his own inability to take wickets in bursts. Perhaps it’s perception as much as anything, the captain’s new all-action man toy, with its 90mph arrows, looking a lot shinier than his old reliable, slightly vanilla, ex-favourite. Grade: C+Sam Curran: 32 runs, average 16 three wickets, average 23 He added variety and no little skill with his left-arm bustlers ducking in and holding their line out. Promoted to No7, he batted like a No9, his skittishness unworthy of a man who has enough ability to make 50s on a regular basis. Like so many in this England squad, his role is not clearly defined – which can’t be fair to a 21-year-old. Grade: B-Craig Overton: 26 runs, average 13 two wickets, average 54 Overton batted with great heart, but looked rather pedestrian in a series dominated by speedsters and seamers. He might need a similar number of injuries to pacers to get another gig in Test cricket – but, with the schedules as they are, expect to see him trundling in again some time soon. Grade: C-Jofra Archer: 48 runs, average seven 22 wickets, average 20 An effortless fast bowler and an effortless star player we really do believe the hype. Archer wasn’t at full tilt all the time but, when he was, he could knock over anyone, metaphorically and literally. Like another Yorkshire Ashes captain with a Sussex quick (Ray Illingworth and John Snow) Joe Root knew how valuable Archer’s pace was and went to the well a little too often. A superstar is born – however you look at it. Grade: AJack Leach: 54 runs, average 14 12 wickets, average 26 Decent bowler, competent late-order batsman, handy fielder – a perfect example of how analysis can rather miss the story. Leach was the sung as much as unsung hero of Headingley, with his 1* an essential component of an extraordinary win. He’s much more than a turn though, his ability to hold an end in the first innings while attacking in the second is far easier to say than to deliver. He showed plenty of courage – moral and physical. Grade: BStuart Broad: 61 runs, average 12 23 wickets, average 27 Broad lost his old mucker almost before the series started, but shouldered the responsibility of leading the attack with real gusto, charging in for spell after spell, many of them excellent, few (if any) poor. At 33, he got through more overs than anyone except Pat Cummins and Nathan Lyon – and almost all were at full gas. He had David Warner on toast, but his seam movement troubled all the Aussie bats (yes, even “him”). Grade: A-Tim Paine: 180 runs, average 20 20 catchesPaine didn’t bat particularly well, didn’t keep particularly well and reviewed particularly badly, but he got his team off the floor between Headingley and Old Trafford to become the first Australian captain to take the Ashes home since Stephen Waugh in 2001. So who’s laughing now? How long Australia can afford to trade off his lack of output for his leadership remains to be seen, but fixing something that isn’t broken – or, rather, is not broken enough – is seldom a smart move. Grade: CDavid Warner: 95 runs, average 10And speaking of things that are partly broken… Broad had Warner in his pocket all series long, the pugnacious left-hander mesmerised into chasing the ball that angled in from round the wicket and seamed away – Flintoff to Gilchrist style. After a year out of Test cricket, he seems to have lost the location of his off stump and needs to find it pretty quickly if the likes of Matt Renshaw and Joe Burns are not to take his spot. Grade: D-Cameron Bancroft: 44 runs, average 11Bancroft faced plenty of deliveries but seemed to look less and less “in” as they ticked by. He was pulled and replaced by a man who looked no more in than he did – but spent fewer deliveries doing so. Grade: DMarcus Harris: 58 runs, average 10That man was Harris, who came with a growing reputation but looked somewhat lost against the Duke ball in English conditions. None of the pitches were particularly capricious, but all of the English grounds require an opener to play for his off stump, leaving plenty and driving few – at least for an hour or so. Grade: D-Usman Khawaja: 122 runs, average 21Three scratchy Test matches and he was dropped despite the credit built up over 44 Tests and the fact that it wasn’t exactly Stuart Law waiting in the wings. You can’t help thinking that was a little premature and that a little more belief from the selectors might have engendered more belief in the man himself. Grade: C-Marnus Labuschagne: 353 runs, average 50 one wicket, average 56 A concussion substitute after Smith had fallen, stricken, at Lord’s, he immediately looked like a man in form and scoring runs – which is what he was, having plundered plenty for Glamorgan in Division Two of the County Championship. His technique is reassuringly orthodox, punching and driving, cutting and pulling and never getting out of shape trying to hit the ball too hard. A top score of 80 suggests he needs to work on converting good scores into those that shape matches. Grade: B+Steven Smith: 774 runs, average 111I made up my mind a couple of years ago as to where Steve Smith stands in cricket history and he’s only improved since then. No batsman in history can ever have gotten off strike with a nudge into the leg side quite as often as Smith does. And surely none has handled the expectations attendant on a comeback with such insouciant brilliance. Archer’s adrenaline-charged helmet-rattling spell at Lord’s aside, Smith seemed to be playing against history as much as the opposition, but none of those 774 runs were cheap and, without them, even this hotchpotch of an England side would have won the series. Grade: A+Matthew Wade: 333 runs, average 37Some might say I’m being churlish but both of his centuries, though plenty busy and aggressive, were made in second innings when the shape of the match had been (largely) determined. He batted like the wicketkeeper he once was and was just about as mouthy, which might not be a good idea when Archer is bowling as it merely advances his speedometer. Grade: BTravis Head: 191 runs, average 27Head lost his place to Mitchell Marsh at The Oval when Paine fancied the idea of a little more bowling in a back-to-back Test. He started with a solid Test at Edgbaston, but fell away and the change was an obvious one to make. He can come back a better player in 2023. Grade: C-Mitchell Marsh: 41 runs, average 21 seven wickets, average 12 Marsh always seems to have to prove himself whenever he dons the Baggy Green and he did that this time round with as fine a spell of swing bowling as we saw in the series. He didn’t quite nail his batting, which is the more obvious route into the XI, but he looks a fine addition to the squad of pacers. Grade: B+Patrick Cummins: 71 runs, average 10 29 wickets, average 20 Cummins would have been a worthy player of the series had Steven Smith not been on another plane altogether. A captain’s dream, he charged in day after day, the hostility never dialled back as much as a single notch. World No1, he justified that ranking with some jaffas that might even have got Steven Smith out, but it was his stamina that stood out, working hard for every wicket and getting his just deserts across all five Tests. Grade: AJames Pattinson: 69 runs, average 23 five wickets, average 33 Quick and reliable, it was a surprise to see him turn out just twice in the series, particularly in the light of his extensive experience in England and his near all-rounder level batting. That said, a captain might wonder what he offers that differs from Cummins (quicker) and Hazlewood (who moves it more). It was good to see an old pro back in the saddle after so many injuries. Grade: B-Peter Siddle: 72 runs, average 24 seven wickets, average 42Was it really him? Given a holding brief, he nevertheless went at three an over, but made a critical contribution in the tone-setting first Test, getting Australia out of the depths of 122-8 to 210-9 in the company of, well, you know who. Siddle had found a way to make a difference. Grade: CNathan Lyon: 79 runs, average 20 20 wickets, average 33A great start looked like it would set up another fine series for the man they call The Goat, but he was strangely anonymous, his rhythm slightly off key, his output below his standards. He’ll point to 20 wickets as a decent return, but this was not the metronome England had feared. Grade: BJosh Hazlewood: Nine at na 20 wickets, average 22Hazlewood sat out the first Test but bowled beautifully from then on, rather like an old-fashioned English seamer, but 5mph quicker and from a five inches higher release point. He moved the Duke ball no matter its age and had the splice-slamming heavy ball to keep the batsmen honest. He doesn’t have the snarl of a Cummins or the regular 90mph thunderbolts of Starc, but he causes the best batsmen problems whether they’re on two or 102. Grade: A-Mitchell Starc: 57 at na four wickets, average 32There’s no better indicator of the strength of the Australian pace phalanx than the fact that he played just one Test in which he went for a few, knocked over a few in a sensational spell and biffed a few off tiring bowlers. He may have fallen out of favour with his own selectors, but I’m pretty sure other countries’ would bite his hand off.

Now it’s achieved a still more remarkable feat, by provoking Frankie Boyle to publicly reconsider his scorched-earth sense of humour. Boyle is on his first tour of his native country for a decade, to coincide with the filming of BBC show Frankie Boyle’s Tour of Scotland. Full Power features favourite routines from his recent Prometheus albums and finds the Glaswegian interrogating comedy – his own in particular – in the age of Nanette, trolling and the performative taking of offence.On either side of that, there’s more of the big-hitting, bad-taste standup we expect of the New World Order frontman. And a dash of intimate material, too, prompted perhaps by Boyle’s being among – well, if not friends, compatriots at least. Several routines are prefaced by commentary on the different receptions they receive north and south of the border. English audiences are aghast at tales of his hardbitten Glasgow upbringing – whereas to many Scottish crowds, Boyle reports, they sound practically genteel.But if his childhood wasn’t really brutal, his comedy still is. The show starts with a tour of the 2019 landscape, as Boyle delivers jaundiced takes on the Michael Jackson documentary, Comic Relief and white saviours, and on that gift to comedians, Liam Neeson’s vigilantism. For those of us who adore his sometimes visionary New World Order sermons, Full Power is fairly light on politics. But there’s fine material on the stupidity and bad faith that swirl around Brexit, and a deathless one-liner explaining Jacob Rees-Mogg’s appearance.One striking routine counters the latter’s homophobia with an image of Jesus struggling to reattach a leper’s penis – then doubles the laugh by imagining a Question Time panel interrogated on the subject. Another pictures our political leaders engaged in “hierarchical sodomy” at boarding school. (“The last time this cabinet saw eye to eye was over the back of a weeping first-year.”)There’s milder stuff – like the material on Boyle’s Donegal-born parents, a rare foray into his personal life. But the most eye-catching section – which shelves the vitriol for something more reflective – addresses comedy in sensitive times. Partly, that’s an excuse to call out those acts who rail at PC and pretend their free speech is being policed. Having mocked those who identify as trans, Ricky Gervais is himself mocked for identifying as a standup comedian.But it feels equally like a sincere attempt on Boyle’s part to appraise – with reference to Gadsby and to Bill Hicks – the value of his own brand of humour. At a time when violent speech has gone mainstream, has his antagonistic comedy become conformist? Can comedy operate as a vehicle for the truth – or just for “funnier lies”? And if comedy is about surprise, is it possible to “surprise people politely”?It’s an inquiry in progress, and it’ll be fascinating to see where it leads. Not, one suspects, towards any dilution of Boyle’s baroque vision, which in Full Power’s closing stages conjures the Queen plotting to revert to her dragon body, the chilling moment when young Frankie lost his childhood innocence, and the corpses of abused children being cast from the yachts of the super-rich. It’s another strong set from Boyle, combining old but gold material with new thoughts on the purpose of his comedy.

Even the bunching of the ear pads has been smoothed out. The shape of the ear cups forces the headband, which is lined with a soft-touch silicone pad, to sit further back on your head. Wear them too far forward and they’ll slide off.And they no longer fold in half. Instead the ear cups simply rotate, fitting into a wedge-shaped case, which Bose says is thinner at one end than the QC35 II’s and therefore easier to fit into a flight bag. But not folding means they are harder squeeze into an every-day bag without the case. A small step back in my opinion.On the head they feel slightly heavier than the QC35 II. The ear pads are slimmer and the ear cups feel more airy, which helped keep my ears cooler, but they grip the sides of my head noticeably harder. They were comfortable for extended periods, but they didn’t feel as immediately snug and relaxed as the QC35.The controls have been redesigned too. Two buttons on the right take care of power, pairing and voice assistant control – Google Assistant, Alexa or Siri - with advanced Google Assistant or Alexa functionality baked-in if you’d like.A button on the left ear cup controls the noise-cancelling level. Press and hold to activate conversation mode, which pipes in sound from outside so you can talk to someone – although you look exceptionally rude doing so.The new touch controls are the best I’ve used on any headphones, and worked reliably even in inclement weather, but not at all with non touch-enabled gloves. Double tap the Bose logo on the right ear cup to pause or play. Swipe forward or back for track skip, and up and down to adjust volume. Seven full swipes takes you from minimum to maximum volume with a continual progression in between.Connectivity was rock solid to phones and tablets, both Android and iOS. The headphones support Bluetooth 5, but only the SBC and AAC audio codecs. That’s fine for Apple users, because AAC is the highest quality an iPhone or iPad can support, but Android or Windows PC users looking for more advanced formats such as Qualcomm’s aptX series or Sony’s LDAC will have to look elsewhere.Audio latency control was good, with audio and video perfectly in sync with all the major video apps and services, including the often problematic YouTube. Games showed a little bit of audio delay.The Headphones 700 can also connect to two devices at once, which means you can watch a video on an iPad and then take a call on your phone or similar. It worked great with mobile devices, but connecting them to a computer and a phone simultaneously caused audio issues.You can pair lots of devices and hot swap between them using the Bose Music app or you can simply disconnect and reconnect your devices manually using their Bluetooth settings.The original QC35 pushed noise-cancelling technology to the next level and the Headphones 700 match them, competing favourably with Sony’s best, particularly on commutes, handling wind noise better than any other. Turned up to maximum, the noise cancelling is very effective, blocking or diminishing even the most difficult of sudden or loud noises. The difference between the Headphones 700 and even mid-range models is night and day. You get what you pay for.Bose has re-engineered its noise-cancelling system for greater flexibility. Now you can choose from 11 levels from maximum noise blocking to fully open, piping ambient sounds from your environment into the headphones using the microphones on their surface.That means if you want some awareness of what’s happening around you, such as conversations in an office, but without the hum of air conditioning or computers you can adjust the level accordingly. The ambient sound mode is a cut above too, sounding far more natural and open than any other similar technology I’ve used.Press the noise-cancelling button on the left ear cup to switch between three favourite noise-cancelling levels, which default to zero, five and 10. Every time you switch levels or in and out of conversation mode, the noise-cancelling ramps smoothly up and down again like someone turning a big analogue volume knob. It’s a small detail that makes the whole experience feel all the more luxurious.Bose products always have a signature sound that has proven isive in audiophile circles. The Headphones 700 are no different. If you didn’t like how the QC35 or even the original TriPort headphones sounded, you won’t like these.If you do, then you’ll be treated to well-balanced audio with punch in the low end for a fully rounded sound and clarity in the highs to make tracks sparkle. You’ll also hear an almost clinical separation of tones, which allows inidual instruments and notes to stand boldly on their own, not blended into a mush.The Headphones 700 can handle most music genres well, with an easy listening and open sound that’s slightly more spacious than the QC35. Overall they are some of the most consistent and best-sounding headphones you can buy, right up their with Sony’s MX-1000M3.There is no equaliser control yet, but Bose said it was working on the ability to adjust the sound of the headphones as part of its new architecture.Voice calling, as well as voice assistant access, is a new focus for the Bose headphones. Using a series of microphones they perform a similar beam-forming noise cancellation on your voice as smart speakers. The result is clear and loud voice pickup even in the noisiest of environments. If you make a lot of calls or talk to Alexa, Google Assistant or Siri all the time these are for you.The Headphones 700 last just shy of 20 hours between charges when using Bluetooth and noise cancelling turned up to maximum, but longer when used via cable. While not industry leading, given Sony’s MX-1000M3 last in the region of 30 hours. That’s long enough to last a week’s commuting or a transatlantic flight.It takes just under 2.5 hours to charge them via USB-C, which is fairly slow compared to the fast-charging smartphone. A 15-minute quick charge provides over three hours of playback time though, which is handy if you forget to charge them.The Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 mark a shift for the company, attempting to erge from a perception of being bought by business travellers towards a design-led luxury offering with a £350 price tag to match.They’re certainly sleeker and more expensive-looking. The way they operate is smoother too, whether it’s the fading and in and out of sound modes or the best-in-class swipe touch controls.They are also the best-sounding Bose headphones to date, with a consistent refined performance. Audiophiles may still be put off by the Bose sound signature. Noise cancelling is top notch, but now adaptable with a sliding scale of levels available, and voice calling or voice assistant control is best-in-class. If you make calls or talk to Alexa, Google Assistant or Siri a lot, these are for you.But part of the seamless design is the removal of folding arms. The ear cups still rotate to flat, but the headphones are harder to fit into a general commuting bag than the QC35. The ear cups feel more spacious and cooler when wearing, but the headband squeezes your head noticeably harder than the QC35, and as a result weren’t quite as comfortable. They are still more comfortable for extended periods than key competition though.The Headphones 700 support Bluetooth 5 for better connectivity, can connect to two devices at once, which is extremely handy, but they struggle connecting to both a computer and a smartphone. Hopefully an update can solve those problems, but stick to mobile devices for now and everything works fine.The lack of higher quality or low-latency Bluetooth audio formats beyond SBC and AAC is slightly disappointing for non-Apple users, and while battery life is solid at just shy of 20 hours, it’s not class leading.They’re pricey, but the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 are some of the best headphones you can buy. They just don’t quite transform the market in the same way the original QC35s managed in 2016.Cons: expensive, no aptX etc, bugs with PC connectivity, don’t fold This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

The new services are a part of a move by film studios and TV programme makers to sell their output direct to consumers, rather than through a service provider such as Netflix.Each service will have separate content and those wanting to watch will have to sign up to a monthly subscription or annual fee.The change means viewers will have to pay for multiple services to access the content they want, on top of fees for satellite and cable TV and the TV licence fee that funds the BBC.HBO Max is part of Warner Media, which owns the film studio behind Lord of The Rings and Harry Potter, the DC Comics superheros including Batman and Superman, and HBO shows including Big Little Lies. In the US, Warner Media has taken back the rights to Friends, dealing a major blow to Netflix. The long-running saga is the most-watched show on Netflix.Sky-owner Comcast will launch the NBCUniversal streaming service, taking back another big Netflix hit in the US version of The Office. It also owns the Universal film studio behind the Jurassic World and Fast and the Furious franchises.The monthly bills of these two services in the UK have not yet been set, but they are likely to be £6-£8 a month – although Sky customers will get the NBCUniversal service either for free or at a very low cost.The details of Apple’s new streaming service were unveiled last week. The mobile phone giant is selling fewer phones and expanding into services that customers will pay for every month rather than rely on big ticket phone purchases every two or three years.Apple has earmarked $6bn to produce original programming over the next few years to make its service a must-watch. Star attractions will include Jennifer Aniston in her first TV series since Friends, a comedy-drama called The Morning Show with fellow A-listers Reece Witherspoon and Steve Carrell. The service will cost £4.99 a month, but be free for the first year for owners of Apple devices.Disney’s service, Disney+, will officially launch on 12 November and is likely to start in the UK early next year, priced at £5.99 a month. It will offer content including the Star Wars films and original $100m TV series The Mandalorian the Marvel universe, again including exclusive TV series spin-offs Pixar films and family fare from Toy Story to Frozen plus TV hits such as The Simpsons.Netflix and Amazon Prime Video have amassed 240 million subscribers worldwide, with almost 20 million in the UK, with little opposition. The new services are roughly half the cost of Netflix, and designed to be cheap enough to crack the global duopoly without breaking the bank for viewers.The £5.99-a-month Britbox will mostly offer archive shows, with some original commissions but without the budget of its international competitors. Richard Broughton of media research firm Ampere Analysis said Britbox could struggle to find viewers willing to pay. “While the different streaming services are not all competing for the same audiences, Britbox is facing a bit of an uphill struggle because it is largely relying on a lot of content that has historically been watched free-to-air.”When the next wave of services launch viewers will find they have never been so spoiled for choice, but the price of being able to enjoy all the best shows, films and sport on offer could add up to a wallet-busting £1,500 a year.“It would be difficult for many households to justify spending £1,500 a year, it is higher than many rent and mortgage payments around the country,” said Broughton. “We suspect people will enter an era of switching from one service to another and back again when they spot new shows or get bored.”Ampere reckons that there is space for a number of streaming services to do relatively well, attracting 1 to 2 million subscribers each, but Netflix and Amazon will remain the two biggest players over the long term.“It is both a golden age of TV but also potentially nearing peak TV,” said Broughton. “There is far more content than anyone can hope to consume and with the costs involved the big question is whether it is sustainable.”Sky TV £22 a month, £264 annually.

A supremely measured character piece that has steadily improved as its central tragedy has materialised. JS Read the review.In 2005, Charlie Brooker and Chris Morris’s twatcom seemed oddly dated – a satire of a cultural moment that had already passed. But time has rendered it deeply prescient: Barley occupied a perfectly sealed echo chamber of self-conscious idiocy, and he self-branded furiously, long before social media came for our souls. Before there were hipsters, Nathan and his fellow self-facilitating media nodes were already keeping it Mencap. PH Read the review.The revitalised Doctor Who occupies its rightful position in the TV firmament: rarely the best show in any week or year but always there, always changing, always offering fodder for analysis, arguments and lists. Jodie Whittaker’s arrival as the first female Tardis-jockey maintained the show’s record of refreshing itself just when its relevance threatens to wane – and with so much goodwill behind it, its standout episodes are still a celebratory shared experience. JS Read the review.None more noir but containing flashes of unexpected humour, this was one of the more impressive of the bleak dramas that flooded out of Scandinavia. The bridge of the title was the Øresund, which connected Sweden and Denmark and led to multinational cooperation on a murder enquiry. Step forward ill-matched cops Martin Rohde and more interestingly Saga Norén, a brilliant but bizarre investigator unlike any maverick TV detective ever seen. PH Read the review.Filigree telly, with every painstakingly staged scene a plush indulgence – but Netflix’s more-or-less true story of the British royal family has enough grit to make it more than just a luxury. Claire Foy’s steely Elizabeth II introduced a fine study of people unsure how to live lives made extraordinary by huge privilege and indistinct power. JS Read the review.Terminally overlooked in favour of flashier, flimsier fare, Joe Weisberg’s tale of suburban subterfuge rewarded the few who did tune in with six seasons of gorgeous, slow-burning drama. Real-life husband and wife Matthew Rhys and Keri Russell convinced as a pair of Russian spies playing house in picket-fence 80s America, struggling with notions of loyalty, fidelity and family. The show’s finale, which shifts between toe-curling tension and devastating poignancy, should be regarded as one for the ages. GM Read more here.A starburst of fantastically inventive offence, Trey Parker and Matt Stone’s crude animation combined grotesque hilarity with a deceptively serious purpose. South Park was both a gleeful dismantling of the American dream and a laser-guided exploration of the tender spots where freedom of speech and liberal sensitivities collide. As such, it has proved surprisingly prescient many of America’s current cultural fault lines first became apparent here. PH Read the review.A tender, truthful look at the beating heart of small-town America, shone through the prism of one of its most engrained institutions: high school football. It had us all rooting for the Dillon Panthers, for Coach Taylor and Tami Taylor, quarterback Matt Saracen, cocky running back Smash Williams, badboy fullback Tim Riggins, endlessly lovable nerd Landry Clarke and Tyra Collette, the town’s only anti-football fanatic. We followed them for every triumph and every touchdown, all the while screaming at our screens: “Clear eyes, full hearts, can’t lose.” KAArriving in 2004, when US president George W Bush was becoming almost as much of a concern as Al-Qaida leader Osama Bin Laden, Adam Curtis’s startling documentary series explored the shockingly congruent aims of fundamentalist Islam and American neo-conservatism. Equally striking was Curtis’s trademark style, all logical provocations and uncanny juxtapositions it’s historical documentary as polemical art installation. PH Read more here.The audacious legal drama took on a ripped-from-the-headlines case every week, tackling everything from fake news to election tampering, police racism and the terrors of surveillance culture. It responded so staggeringly fast to events that it sometimes felt too real. But it was also a rare drama that focused on women – rounded, complex, great, flawed, wonderful women – from the eponymous Alicia Florrick, who moved so far beyond the pained good wife of the opening episode, standing by her man through a humiliating sex scandal, to Diane Lockhart, the barnstorming firebrand in fabulous jewellery (one of the most glorious characters of the century). An exciting, exhilarating slap in the face to the very end. KA Read the review.What initially appeared to be a charming muse on the lives of two eccentric metal-detecting hobbyists soon revealed itself to be something more profound. Mackenzie Crook’s labour of love was very funny, but it became ever more moving and thought-provoking. It was underpinned by a deep but open-minded and inclusive respect for our collective past, and animated by one of the most sweetly convincing friendships in television history. PH Read the review.Even viewers familiar with Chris Morris’s original 1997 current affairs satire raised a few startled eyebrows at Brass Eye’s one-off return in 2001. Morris plunged into what, at the time, was one of the most emotive issues in British life – press coverage of paedophiles – and steamrollered every taboo he could get his teeth into inside half an hour. Newspapers howled, commentators pontificated, politicians blustered – and perhaps that was the point. PH Read more here.With reality TV shifting from catty to comforting in recent times, both the BBC and Channel 4 have enjoyed the sweet smell of success with Bake Off. Mel and Sue’s exodus was a blow to its softly-softly charm and Prue Leith is a more straight-talking judge than Mary Berry. But 10 series in, the amateur baking contest is still an autumn staple. As with most long-running reality shows, there’s still a sense of familiarity despite some changes this year’s series features its youngest ever set of contestants. HJD Read the review.The characters introduced in Shane Meadows’s 2007 film of the same name have acquired a vibrant small-screen life of their own. No wonder: they’re incredibly resonant – they depict the kinds of British lives that are rarely explored at all, let alone with such tenderness and wisdom. We’ve taken This is England’s characters to our hearts but the series also functions as a parallel history of our country, warts and all. PH Read the review.Rob Delaney and Sharon Horgan made their comedy great by never playing safe. At first it was a filthy gutbuster about a careless sexfest then it frankly faced the grim reality of parenthood without losing its dirty grin. Finally, killing their darling just before it could flag, the pair delivered one of the best TV endings ever. A hardcore sitcom classic. JS Read the review.The recent 10th anniversary of Jade Goody’s death sparked much conversation around the original lock-em-up-and-throw-away-the-key-for-a-bit reality show. Big Brother was in many ways one of the most heinous shows ever broadcast, from “Nasty Nick” Bateman fleeing the country to escape the tabloids to Kinga’s wine bottle and Shilpa-gate. But it was also a show that would change TV – and our concept of celebrity – for ever. HJD Read more here.Cross-continent reboots are notoriously rubbish. But when they evolve beyond by-the-numbers remakes and find an identity of their own, they can become excellent. A case in point: The Office US (originally subtitled “An American Workplace”) found its feet once it stopped trying to be Gervais Part Two and instead established its own perpetually bored protagonists, led by Michael Scott, Steve Carell’s self-proclaimed “world’s best boss”. HJD Read the review.It would be easy to take David Attenborough’s startling odysseys into the natural world for granted. But technological developments have only increased their wonder, while the exponential destruction of the environment has lent them a polemical edge. Attenborough’s two Blue Planet series have presented more mindblowing, naturally occurring psychedelia – long, strange trips into beautiful but inhospitable realms previously unexplored (and all-too-often degraded) by humanity. PH Read the review.Few shows in TV history have scythed on to the screen with as much elan as Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s spy v spy thriller, which arrived with dialogue as impossibly sharp and cool as the European locations and Jodie Comer’s couture costumes. The death dance between Comer’s psychopath and Sandra Oh’s coiled-spring MI5 nerd means each episode has a handful of outlandish payoffs that other dramas spend whole seasons working towards. JS Read the review.It might have ended back in 2001 but Simon Pegg, Edgar Wright and Jessica Hynes’s flatshare sitcom can stake a legitimate claim as the most influential comedy of this millennium: its quick cuts, genre parodies and geek humour have been adopted by everything from Community to Preacher. Yet for all the Star Wars homages, Spaced was, at its heart, a terrific character comedy, boasting a cracking cast that included Mark Heap’s tortured artist Brian and Julia Deakin’s formidable, chianti-powered landlady Marsha. GM Read the review.Tracking a single murder case across 20 hours of subtitled drama might have seemed a hard sell. But this Danish procedural had a secret weapon in detective Sarah Lund (Sofie Gråbøl). Lund’s knitwear became an unlikely totem of the show, but the real appeal was Gråbøl’s remarkable performance. Over three gripping seasons, Lund told us everything and nothing about herself, becoming one of the great TV enigmas. PH Read the review.Amazon has struggled to get its TV originals right, but it made a perfect start with this mercurial, millennial dramedy. The plaudits for breaking new ground by centring on a transgender character were deserved, and no TV show before or since has handled ersity of gender and sexuality so assuredly. On top of all that is a seriously funny look at people failing to turn fluid modern adulthood into happiness. JS Read the review.Set in the Ripper-plagued Yorkshire of the 1970s, David Peace’s original novels are strewn with feverish internal monologues. Adapting them for television was always likely to prove tricky. However, this trilogy rose to the challenge superbly, drawing on the erse but complementary visions of three different directors (Julian Jarrold, James Marsh and Anand Tucker) and a host of superb performances to bring the era unnervingly to life. PH Read the review.Arriving on our screens with almost eerie timeliness three months into the Trump presidency, this adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s dystopian novel serves as a helpful reminder that, if we’re not careful, things could get even more like Gilead. The show’s patriarchal hellscape, where the chaste culture of kept women sits uneasily next to the machine guns and combat gear of the men doing the keeping, is terrifyingly well-realised, while Elisabeth Moss delivers a remarkable performance as Offred, the Handmaid who dreams of blowing it up. GM Read the review.Wise-ass but frequently just plain wise, Jon Stewart was a broadcasting natural with such range that he was equally convincing whether presenting a show in the aftermath of 911 or excoriating Chicago’s fondness for deep-pan pizza. For more than a decade, he was a unique and persuasive liberal voice in American affairs we shudder to imagine what he would have made of the current US political situation. PH Read more here.Ambition is probably Charlie Brooker’s best quality as a writer: he had the balls to start his sci-fi anthology with an episode about the prime minister being forced to violate a pig, then took the chance to take Black Mirror global by shifting from Channel 4 to Netflix. Now every new helping of his dystopia is event telly, drawing in A-list talent and, with one-offs such as the interactive Bandersnatch, continuing to push at the medium’s limits. JS Read the review.No one knew what to expect from the reappearance, after nearly 30 years, of David Lynch’s mystery drama. From its first frame to its soul-rending primal scream of a conclusion, The Return proved thrillingly baffling, full of indelible images (nuclear explosions, demonic cockroaches, David Bowie as a giant kettle) and dizzying dream logic. At the centre of the chaos was Kyle MacLachlan, radiating previously untapped levels of magnificence as both the valiant Agent Cooper and his breathtakingly evil doppelganger. GM Read the review.The underwhelming Netflix reboot of Mitch Hurwitz’s comedy, about a dysfunctional and in retrospect vaguely Trumpian dynasty, shouldn’t detract too much from the legacy of its brilliant first three seasons, which raised the bar for intricate, intelligent sitcommery. Such was the density of references, callbacks and gags that Arrested Development proved to be that rare thing – a show that became funnier on repeated viewings. GM Read more here.It was the story of a US footballer, accused of murder and subsequently acquitted. But it was so much more besides. Over seven compelling hours, Ezra Edelman pulled back from his immediate subject by homing in on its minutiae. Exploring the context of OJ Simpson’s rise and fall, Edelman constructed a startling treatise on race, gender, celebrity and capitalism itself. The result was an alternative history of modern America. PH Read the review.More like a definitive historical document than a TV series. While Vietnam remains a scab at which America is compelled to pick, Burns’s panorama feels like the last word. Beginning decades before the war and following its echoes up to the present day, the series plunged into the quagmire, illuminating the horror for all to see but concluded with threads of humanity reclaimed from the carnage. PH Read the review.For all its problems (and there were many, from a lack of ersity to Lena Dunham’s impressive propensity for foot-in-mouth moments), Girls changed the half-hour sitcom for the better. Originally billed as an updated Sex and the City, it grew into something more troubled and more troubling, bringing the best of mumblecore to the small screen via a spaghetti-slurping, often half-naked antihero (Dunham’s Hannah Horvath), who proved as relatable as she was entirely out of control. HJD Read more here.David Milch’s unique, picaresque western earned its spurs in the early stages of the HBO TV gold-rush. But it was more singular and ornery than any of its contemporaries. Milch created a universe that was simultaneously recognisable and utterly alien – then peopled it with extraordinary characters such as Ian McShane’s Al Swearengen. Sacred, profane and well deserving of its glorious feature-length resolution this year. PH Read more here.Julia Davis’s Jill Tyrell is the most grotesque comedy creation in living memory. Jill responded to her husband’s cancer diagnosis by attempting to break up the marriage next door, then staging an exceptionally excruciating mock funeral for her spouse (who had recovered but been forcibly committed to a hospice) and trying to seduce a 12-year-old. An absolute monster and an absolute masterpiece of provocation and bad taste. PH Read the review.Aaron Sorkin’s sparky, witty and (some would say excessively) erudite political drama achieved the impossible: it made niche US legislation, from lame-duck sessions to filibusters, utterly compelling. Plus it gave us the most popular president in US history, Josiah “Jed” Bartlet. Fans must watch it now and weep into their fake newspaper at the Trumpian state of things. There were certain missteps (the patronising 911 episode, we’re looking at you), but this was TV that showed America it is possible to hope for better, even the best, from the leader of the free world. KA Read more here.Was Larry David ever wrong? Frequently. But you could usually just about sympathise with his wrongness and understand his arrival in a variety of hideous scrapes. In a sitcom that was both deeply meta (David was playing a constructed but also deconstructed version of himself) and proudly traditional (it overflowed with sight-gags and classic setups), the comedy of excruciation reached its peak. PH Read the review.Rarely has a drama demanding such commitment from viewers captured the popular imagination to this extent. It’s testimony to the excellence of Jed Mercurio’s writing but mainly to masterful central performances from Martin Compston, Vicky McClure and Adrian Dunbar who, as anti-corruption unit AC12, represent a still point around which all manner of police malfeasance swirls. Line of Duty’s interrogation scenes have set a new standard in small-screen tension and release. PH Read more here.Still badly underrated, Tina Fey’s sitcom rendering of her experiences inside the US TV machine was a fiery take on the tension between creative types and money men, the latter embodied by an all-timer performance from Alec Baldwin as an insane network exec. But it was as cynical about comedians as it was suits, the result being a joke machine with few limits on its satire or its silliness. JS Read more here.A corrective to the cliche-ridden and frequently blokey police procedurals that dominated the first two decades of this century, Sally Wainwright’s slice of Yorkshire noir pulsated with poignant realness. In Sarah Lancashire’s stoic sergeant Catherine Cawood, it found a true heroine for our times, resourceful, funny and empathetic. A good thing too, because the world Wainwright constructed around her – full of death, addiction and desperate poverty – was almost overwhelmingly, authentically bleak. GM Read the review.Donald Glover’s foray into dramedy fizzes with pop-culture callbacks, political subtext and dark lols, following underachieving Earn, wannabe rapper cousin Paper Boi and their black millennial peers. Its best episodes are the ones where racial conflict meets all-out weirdness, among them Helen – in which Earn feels thoroughly adrift at a Germanic festival – and Teddy Perkins, the Shining-inspired, Get Out-style tale of Darius’s (Lakeith Stanfield) trip to pick up a piano from a mysterious hermit. HJD Read more here.The king of 00s sitcoms: formally innovative, with its point-of-view filming and audible inner monologues, and unflinching in how it used that format to be disgustingly honest about diseased male minds. A textbook contrasting duo in careless Jez and cowardly Mark gave writers Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain the platform for greatness, and the quality barely dipped across nine seasons. Peep Show was always, hilariously, an inch over the boundary of good taste. JS Read more here.When Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Fleabag arrived on stage in London some six years ago, critics had their doubts (one even commented “I doubt if this material will spin off into a long-running radio or television series”). How wrong they were: as well as returning to the stage for a sold-out run this year, Fleabag’s two-series TV run saw Waller-Bridge infuse the nascent sadcom genre with classic British awkwardness, encompassing grief, family breakdown and, of course, Obama-themed masturbation. HJD Read more here.Despite the widespread calls by superfans to rewrite the entire last series, from Daenerys’ descent into madness to Starbucksgate, Game of Thrones remains the biggest show of the century so far. Even Ed Sheeran sitting by a fire singing a ditty about hands of gold can’t irreparably dent its reputation. And it did come up with the goods throughout its eight-year reign: from the thrills and blood spills to the men baked in pies and the best battles ever seen on the small screen, right through to Cleganebowl. Only The Winds of Winter book will spare us all from Westeros withdrawal. KA Read more here.It didn’t invent the mockumentary, but Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant’s debut was so stylistically confident it defined swathes of the comedy that followed its 2001 premiere: two decades on, people are still making pale imitations. Its creators haven’t topped it either but with time, their casting decisions look as extraordinary as their scripts. It’s hard to fathom now that Martin Freeman, Mackenzie Crook and Gervais himself were all then relative unknowns. JS Read more here.The show that arguably killed off the antihero drama: nothing since has been able to top the depraved descent made by Walter White (a never-better Bryan Cranston), from milquetoast chemistry teacher to meth overlord, and few have dared to try. Yet as grimly engrossing as White’s transformation was, what kept us returning to Vince Gilligan’s low-key epic was Aaron Paul’s performance as his reluctant partner in crime, Jesse Pinkman, whose frayed humanity shone through the moral murk like a beacon. GM Read more here.The craven, idiotic likes of Peter Mannion and Nicola Murray would be paragons of probity and wisdom in today’s parliamentary landscape. But at the time, Armando Iannucci’s scabrous comedy felt like an indictment of everything wrong with the spin and cynicism of British politics. Luckily, it was also hilarious, mainly thanks to the inventive invective of Peter Capaldi’s ferocious “Iago with a BlackBerry” Malcolm Tucker. PH Read more here.The sex! The swagger! The suits! Matthew Weiner’s Madison Avenue masterwork went down with all the smooth, smoky allure of one of Don Draper’s copious Old-Fashioneds. But by ning the entire 60s, showing the mammoth social shifts in an ad agency in minute detail – from the advent of the Pill and second-wave feminism to the rise of hippies and the dropping of LSD – it became more than just the tale of one mystery man and compulsive philanderer come good: it was a meditation on how modern America came to be made, one iconic advert at a time. KAAlong with The Sopranos, David Simon and Ed Burns’s Baltimore crime saga showed that small-screen entertainment could be anything it aspired to be: polemical, panoramic, funny, tragic or all of those things at once. Beautifully written and performed, this was both TV as high art and TV wrenched from the soul. To this day, it’s an exemplar of a certain brand of intelligent, ambitious and uncompromising television. PH Read more here.It is hard to fathom now, but when Tony Soprano first slumped into an armchair in his psychiatrist Dr Melfi’s office, TV was still largely looked down upon. The slogan for the Sopranos’ broadcaster – ‘It’s not TV, it’s HBO’ – felt telling in its dismissiveness, as if making a television programme was something to be ashamed about. The Sopranos changed all that.When it first aired, some were quick to dismiss it as just another mob drama. But David Chase took a cleaver to the conventions and cliches of the gangster epic. Its Family wasn’t some pinstripe-clad crew swaggering down Brooklyn back alleys, but a tragicomic rabble reigning over the unprepossessing suburbs of New Jersey. It was a world populated by fragile and petty people, arguing over Tupperware like Paulie Walnuts or ordering a hit over rumours about their bedroom activities like Uncle Junior. And its protagonist was a hulking, ferocious don beset by panic attacks and cowed by his far more ferocious mother.And what a protagonist! Here was a man who would break off from his daughter’s college open day to brutally murder an informant, and we were supposed to if not actively root for him, at least follow him into the abyss. Yet follow him we did, because of the qualities that moved him beyond the mobster stereotype. From the off, this was a show with bigger thoughts in mind: the downfall of the white working class, Jungian psychoanalysis, shifting sexual politics and the eternal question of whether an interior decorator could kill 16 Czechoslovakians. And it played with form with the eagerness of Tony tucking into some ‘gabagool’, staging Godot-like one-acters in the Pine Barrens and devoting entire episodes to the fever-dream musings of a comatose Tony.The Sopranos hastened TV’s transformation into a medium where intelligence, experimentation and depth were treasured. Critics still put it at the top of best of lists like this one. Fevered conversations are still had online about the show’s symbolic use of eggs, ducks and teeth, and of course that rug-pull of an ending. For anyone currently making TV, the show stands as something to aspire to, perhaps even better. That is easier said than done, of course. Plenty of programmes have come at the boss, but none has managed to carry out a successful hit.

I don’t think I’d have written Happy Valley if I hadn’t seen Nurse Jackie. You could feel the creative energy buzzing through every episode, in the way it was written, shot and performed. Every episode had a hundred stories riddled through 25 minutes. It was surprising, dark, relevant and very funny. It was a show in which all the characters were complicated, flawed, sometimes unlikable but always funny and deeply engaging. It has an unparalleled place in my head as inspirational telly. God should appear as a character in TV shows more often.The ReturnedThe French drama The Returned has really stuck in my mind. First because it’s incredibly gripping and you don’t know what’s going to happen next. But also because I think both in its story – and in the mood it creates – it somehow captures the strangeness of how it is to live in our present world. It’s that feeling of living in a bubble, where inexplicable events come and go like in a strange fever dream. Yet however much you try and escape, you always find yourself returning to where you came from. You can’t break out to any other kind of future. This bubble is it, but it’s odd and frightening – the past keeps coming back again and again, and you don’t know who to trust, and you don’t even trust yourself.I was bowled over by Ronald D Moore’s 2004 reimagining of Battlestar Galactica. The best form of sci-fi, powerfully dramatising contemporary themes such as terrorism, rebellion, prejudice, artificial intelligence and good government. All in space! No aliens, no transporters and a hugely complicated, pathetic, funny and devious bad guy in Gaius Baltar, one of the most fallible villains ever screened.The SopranosEven with all the groundbreaking and original TV that’s been made in the last 20 years – and there’s been a lot – it’s still The Sopranos. For the world and the language and the humanity and the inhumanity and the complete disregard for the lives of beloved characters, because who gives a fuck here comes a better one. And for Gandolfini.Both intimate and epic, Chernobyl is a character-driven drama that becomes a portrait of a nation and a belief system. Every word and frame and sound and performance within the five episodes feels weighed with forensic precision. The result is a lean, compelling, propulsive and relentless piece of storytelling. Chernobyl is a great example of the achievements of a collective: an extraordinary piece of dramatic teamwork.Mad MenI would nominate Mad Men, a show I was completely obsessed with, and my first experience of true “bingeing.” Its representation of the 1960s, the era of my own teens – I was 21 in 1970 – was extraordinary. The period can be unconvincing on screen, but here was a show that was authentic and moving and, at the same time, stylish and smart. I loved Jon Hamm, who was a complete revelation to me, and I had a crush on January Jones, in fact all of them were wonderful, Christina Hendricks, John Slattery, Elisabeth Moss, Jared Harris, I could go on and on. I’d say The OA is my show of the century. It’s like nothing else. It’s so earnest and so ambitious and not trying to be cool or edgy I assume its creators didn’t ask themselves “What’s hot right now?” before they pitched it. It just swung for the fences AND it got killed by its network smack in the middle, so it can live forever in my imagination, which is inferior to those of Zal Batmanglij and Brit Marling.The OfficeWhenever any person is thinking about writing a TV show, they’re advised to look at this for reference. I did it before I made Awkward Black Girl, and again before I wrote another pilot that would not see the light of day. I was a fan of the British version and was certain the US version would butcher it, but I was so happily wrong. The US version was so perfectly, achingly relatable. From the Diversity Day episode to one of the greatest TV love stories of all time, it has truly influenced my sense of humour and it is in my canon of all-time great TV.I’m sure everyone is wrestling with the incredibly tough task of identifying a single show from such remarkably strong competition, most recently Chernobyl and also Narcos, Six Feet Under to name just a few. I’m going with Friday Night Lights for its heart and soul, the compelling nature of its characters and storylines, the way it’s filmed and how the music is scored. Once you fall in love with this series, there are just so many episodes to lose yourself in. Is it really possible that a television show can have you sharing the mantra Texas Forever?House of CardsIf I have to pick just one it would be House of Cards. The first season about the American politician Francis Underwood, his wife and their ambitions for the presidency was great fun and mind-blowing at the time. It had the whole package and seemed almost flawless – great acting, a complex and provoking story, and creators who knew how to balance the genre. Maybe the most impressive thing about the show was that we actually came to love Francis Underwood even though he was ruthless."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5328313b90920941d935e2cb125669cef247fec2/0_288_4281_2569/master/4281.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5eec6e2470da369c347cca14247a3b1e","title":"suspension of belief how the bridge went from shock to shlock","story":"A change in sidekick saw the Scandi thriller plunge headlong into ridiculousnessHot on the heels of Wallander and The Killing, The Bridge hit British screens in 2012 at the height of our Scandi noir obsession. The first season introduced us to Swedish detective Saga Norén (Sofia Helin) and her Danish counterpart Martin Rohde (Kim Bodnia), who were forced to work together to find out who had placed the head and torso of one corpse and the legs of another at the point on the Øresund Bridge where Copenhagen meets Malmö.He was laid-back and sarcastic, she was rules-obsessed and blunt to the point of rudeness due her difficulty picking up on social cues. (When Martin invited her to dinner and his wife Mette offered to give Saga the recipe, she responded: “No, it wasn’t tasty.”) Their opposites-attract dynamic might not have been original, but the characters’ quirks and their emphatically platonic chemistry made it feel fresh.The shocking end to season one, when the serial killer they were tracking picked Martin’s son for his last victim, threatened to rock the show’s foundations. But it came back stronger than ever, combining a storyline about eco-terrorism with Martin’s search for vengeance and Saga’s awkward attempts to support him, which ended tragically when he poisoned his nemesis and she turned him in. After that, she needed a new partner, and the show went off the rails.Martin’s replacement, Henrik Sabroe (Thure Lindhardt), was pleasant enough but also gulped handfuls of illegal drugs from a sandwich bag before work and spent his evenings at singles nights, even though he had a wife and kids at home. Or did he? Four episodes into season three, the show revealed that his family had gone missing years earlier and we’d just been watching his hallucinations. Not only was this a betrayal of fans’ trust, it signified a dismaying shift in focus.While the detectives’ personal lives had always been part of the story, now they threatened to take over – and in the most improbable ways possible, such as at the end of season three, when Saga’s mother killed herself and framed her daughter for murder. The central mysteries were similarly difficult to stomach, including victims with amputated body parts staged in grotesque tableaux, a stoning, and a man tricked into injecting his daughter with a lethal neurotoxin.Never the most fast-paced show, it became increasingly ponderous and took the cliched route of putting Saga and Henrik in a relationship.

Photograph: PA Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe has sought to reassure unionists over the backstop.In a speech at the DCU Brexit institute in Dublin on Monday, Mr Donohoe said he understood the fears expressed in the unionist community about the backstop, but emphasised the importance for Dublin of the deal agreed by the EU and the UK. The backstop is an insurance policy written into the withdrawal agreement, or Brexit treaty, guaranteeing no harder border on the island of Ireland. “The Government takes these concerns very seriously, as we do the concerns of everyone who is troubled by Brexit and its potential impacts on both parts of our island,” he said.However, Mr Donohoe said the backstop “should not be viewed as a challenge to any tradition on this island, as a challenge to unionism”.“Its purpose is to provide certainty, to businesses and communities on both sides of the border that they will continue to operate and go about their daily lives as they do today. Nothing more,” he said. The Minister argued the backstop represents a compromise. “It is not the same as Northern Ireland staying in the EU,” he said. He added that the Government is “working to reconcile the interests of both unionism and nationalism”. Meanwhile, he said that work with the European Commission has “intensified with the goal if at least avoiding physical infrastructure at the border in the event of a no deal Brexit”. Mr Donohoe’s comments come after two British ministers suggested over the weekend that progress had been made on the thorny issue of the Northern Irish backstop. In separate interviews aimed at talking up the prospects of a deal, Britain’s home secretary Priti Patel, and Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay contended that discussions centred on overcoming the problem the backstop has caused for prime minster Boris Johnson’s government were progressing, and that a deal was still possible by October 31st.Both hinted they were moving to a situation where Northern Ireland would be more closely aligned to the EU but that arrangement would fall short of being a full backstop.Mr Donohoe said that a solution “has to recognise the unique geographical and historical situation of Northern Ireland”.In concluding remarks, the Minister said that Brexit and a shift from openness and free trade to economic nationalism posed “a new national question” for the State. “I believe this is a new national question we are facing today and that the Brexit process and the profound challenges of political economy, diplomacy and geopolitics that it confronts us with compel us to seek answers.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4018815.1568556287!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"louth td rejects alternatives to brexit backstop","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLouth TD Declan Breathnach, centre, at a protest outside Government Buildings in 2017. Photograph: Cyril ByrneA Border county TD has dismissed a UK think tank’s proposed alternatives to replace the contentious Brexit backstop after attending the group’s “roundtable discussion” in a hotel outside Dundalk.Fianna Fáil TD Declan Breathnach said he attended Prosperity UK’s “alternative arrangements commission” meeting at the Carrickdale Hotel on the Border at the weekend to hear their administrative and technological proposals to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.The Louth TD said there was credibility in some of the proposed solutions but the arrangements did not take into account how the Border community worked and issues of trust and economies of scale between north and south.“I went there to listen,” he said. “I had engaged with them in the past. I went there to say to them that some of their ideas are very good but it is in the context of finding a solution within the backstop.”He declined to elaborate on what was said at the two-day conference as it was covered by Chatham House Rule, an informal agreement protecting the source of remarks at a private meeting, but he said he could say that he told them he did not believe their ideas would avoid a hard border and that the backstop was still the best option.Integrity of UKAlternative arrangements to the backstop have been dismissed from the EU and the Irish Government to the UK government’s own alternative arrangements working groups as not providing the same solution the backstop does in terms of avoiding a hard border.The original backstop, which would keep Northern Ireland and the Republic aligned under EU economic rules, has been rejected by Conservative MPs and the Democratic Unionist Party as “anti-democratic” and undermining the integrity of the United Kingdom as it would keep the North tied to EU regulations.Prosperity UK’s commission, which is chaired by Remain-voting MP Greg Hands and pro-Brexit MP Suella Braverman, has suggested various measures including a tiered “trusted trader” scheme that would “cut down paperwork and avoid routine customs checks” at the Border.Mr Hands said the group held their meeting in Dundalk as a “bridge-building exercise” to get feedback on their proposals and to find a potential solution to the Brexit deadlock on the basis that the backstop was not going to pass through the House of Commons.“The backstop is a route to a no-deal Brexit,” he said. “For anybody wanting to get a Brexit deal that works for all sides and all communities, the answer lies in alternative arrangements.”Intertwined economiesThe group also proposes special economic zones and regulatory areas both at the Border – between Derry and Donegal, and Newry and Dundalk – and between Ireland and UK that would cover sanitary and phytosanitary regulations protecting food and animal health but based on an assumption that the UK would stay aligned with the EU on these rules initially.“The only way you can have an economic zone to work is to have an all-island economic zone. You cannot pick and choose because the economies are so intertwined,” said Mr Breathnach.Mr Hands, who voted for Mr May’s proposed UK-wide backstop and withdrawal deal, said Prosperity UK wanted the Border meeting held in private as it would be more helpful and constructive.No Government or Dáil representative from Fine Gael attended the meeting.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Just over one-in-four current students said they had borrowed from a payday lender compared to 11pc 10 years ago.Students squeezed by high living costs reported spending their entire maintenance loan for a term, which can be as high as £3,000, in just five weeks and having to resort to loans and credit cards. A third said they choose to hide these debts from their parents.Although drinking alcohol and going to nightclubs were still the most popular ways those surveyed spent their money, more and more young people are prioritising things like gym memberships and healthy food, the research said.Going to the gym was the most popular choice after alcohol and nights out, with 33pc of today’s students saying they spent money on a membership, an increase of 50pc on a decade ago.The surge in low-cost flights has caused a massive upturn in the popularity of student holidays with today’s students 68pc more likely to take a break, while the popularity of healthy food, like the notorious breakfast of avocado and toast, soared by 74pc.Student loans | When do graduates start repaying and how much?Emma Craig, a money expert at Moneysupermarket, said the rising cost of living and the inability of students to make their student loan last were likely to be the reason for the increased borrowing.“Payday loans are rarely the most cost efficient way to borrow and should be a last resort,” she said. “If you’re a student heading off to university this month, now is definitely a good time to think about how you’re going to manage your finances. “If you think you may need to borrow money at some point, taking out a student current account with an interest free overdraft can be a good option. “Before you decide which bank to go with, make sure you shop around to ensure you’re choosing the current account that’s best for you, particularly in the long run.”More than a third of students are also relying on credit cards to fund their time at university, while visits to so-called “Instagrammable” restaurants, those which will look attractive for a social media post, are an increasing spending priority for students.The Daily  reported last month that Ucas, which administers the university admissions process, was criticised for promoting a private loan company which specialises in lending to students.Among the literature sent to prospective students was an advert for Future Finance, which offers loans at rates of 13.41pc, far higher than that of a normal student loan or the best available personal loans on the market.At the time, Future Finance told the  it assesses inidual affordability and promotes responsible borrowing, while Ucas said it always recommends the government-funded student loan as the best option.Political outsiders including jailed TV magnate advance towards second round in Tunisian electionsBrexit latest news: Boris Johnson walks into ambush as

The different colours of the bands help scientists to understand what is happening in Jupiter\u0027s atmosphere This artist\u0027s illustration depicts the exoplanet LHS 3844b, which is 1.3 times the mass of Earth and 49 lightyears away.

In colour are active regions of the atmosphere of the Sun e.g. solar flares and coronal mass ejectionsThe changes are unprecedented, scientists say, and it is not clear why they are happening.Nasa reveals spectacular photo of avalanche on MarsThe kind of brightness spotted by researchers usually comes from radiation thrown out as gas and dust is eaten up by the black hole. As such, it could be just the beginning in a major change in the activity of the black hole.“The big question is whether the black hole is entering a new phase — for example if the spigot has been turned up and the rate of gas falling down the black hole ‘drain’ has increased for an extended period — or whether we have just seen the fireworks from a few unusual blobs of gas falling in,” said Mark Morris, UCLA professor of physics and astronomy and the author of a paper describing the discovery..Scientists will now keep looking at the area and hope that new images can help resolve that question. That could in turn help us understand how black holes grow and the kinds of effects they have on the galaxy and the larger universe.The brightening could have come from the fact that a star was seen going very close to the black hole in summer last year, or that another mysterious object known as G2 had its outer layer ripped off when it passed by in 2014. It might also be the result of big asteroids passing near the black hole, scientists said.The black hole poses no danger to life on Earth. It is 26,000 light years away, and the radiation coming out of it would need to be 10 billion times brighter to have any effect here.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That would speed up progress on a Brexit deal acceptable both to the UK and the EU, as the so-called Irish backstop has been a major stumbling block.DUP leader Arlene Foster rejected the speculation, saying late on Thursday: UK must leave as one nation. We are keen to see a sensible deal but not one that ides the internal market of the UK.”Still, the pound gained more than 1 per cent against the dollar on Friday morning to trade as high as $1.2475, a seven-week high.

The former London mayor and foreign secretary won his leadership bid by beating Jeremy Hunt in the Tory race the day before. Theresa May stepped down following her resignation as Conservative Party leader on 7 June.“It’s clearly about a reduction in no-deal risk being perceived,” said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets. He noted that shorting, or betting against, sterling has become a very “crowded” – and hence less attractive – trade, prompting traders to bet the other way which also lifted the currency.Last week MPs passed a law preventing a no-deal Brexit on 31 October and refused to grant Boris Johnson an early general election, which he hoped would give him a majority in parliament.But the chances of leaving with an exit agreement are also uncertain as the only deal agreed with the EU after two years of talks has been rejected by Britain’s parliament three times.Since the vote to leave the EU, the pound has lost 17 per cent against the dollar and almost 15 per cent against the euro. \u0026nbspAdditional reporting by ReutersOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The 5 per cent share of short-changed workers is equivalent to about 1.5 million people.\u0026nbspA government report last year noted that there is effectively no state agency enforcing holiday pay regulations and cited evidence suggesting that the unpaid amount is equal to losses from violations of minimum wage rules.Lindsay Judge, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “The UK has a multitude of rules to govern its labour market – from maximum hours to minimum pay. But these rules can only become a reality if they are properly enforced.“Labour market violations remain far too common, with millions of workers missing out on basic entitlements to a pay slip, holiday entitlement and the minimum wage.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Team Europe celebrate winning the Solheim Cup at Gleneagles in Auchterarder, Scotland.

Workers must be paid the higher National Living Wage if they are 25 or over. The current rate is £8.21 per hour.The analysis by the Resolution Foundation reveals that the risk of being short-changed on pay or holiday is closely linked to the worker’s personal characteristics, the type of their contract and their industry.For example, workers aged 25 and under are almost twice as likely to be underpaid the minimum wage as any other age group.\u0026nbspOne in seven workers in the hotels and restaurants sector say they receive no paid holiday entitlement, while one in six workers aged 65 or over report the same violation – more than any other age group.Workers in firms that employ fewer than 25 people are most likely to miss out on paid leave, as are workers on zero-hours and temporary contracts.The scale of labour law breaches may be even bigger as the Resolution Foundation points out gaps in available data.\u0026nbspSurveys miss out some important questions and workers are often unaware their employer is breaking the law or they may be reluctant or too frightened to report the truth, the think tank says.Meanwhile, the HMRC findings on minimum wage underpayments are based on the number of firms that were caught and so also understate the true picture, the foundation added.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However, Libra differs from many cryptocurrencies as it is centralised in its nature against the founding member companies, in a similar way that fiat currencies are centralised against a central bank,” Ana\u0026nbspBencic, president of digital exchange\u0026nbspNexthash, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbsp“Due to the ... circle of multi-billion dollar companies essentially managing their own currency, it is not surprising that central banks are cautious of money moving in this direction.

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.The deleted scene, below, has caused speculation that the X-Men could join the Marvel Cinematic Universe, following Disney’s acquisition of 20th Century Fox, which has the rights to the franchise.The footage was released shortly after Avengers: Endgame director Joe Russo said Spider-Man leaving the MCU was a tragic mistake.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The former London mayor and foreign secretary won his leadership bid by beating Jeremy Hunt in the Tory race the day before. Theresa May stepped down following her resignation as Conservative Party leader on 7 June.“It’s clearly about a reduction in no-deal risk being perceived,” said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets. He noted that shorting, or betting against, sterling has become a very “crowded” – and hence less attractive – trade, prompting traders to bet the other way which also lifted the currency.Last week MPs passed a law preventing a no-deal Brexit on 31 October and refused to grant Boris Johnson an early general election, which he hoped would give him a majority in parliament.But the chances of leaving with an exit agreement are also uncertain as the only deal agreed with the EU after two years of talks has been rejected by Britain’s parliament three times.Since the vote to leave the EU, the pound has lost 17 per cent against the dollar and almost 15 per cent against the euro. \u0026nbspAdditional reporting by ReutersOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It existed during the Cretaceous period, around 76 million years ago.The partial skeleton was found in Dinosaur Provincial Park in southern Alberta in 1992, but had long been confused with another genus of pterosaur until further analysis, published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, showed the creature was unique.“These are among the most popular and charismatic of all fossil animals,” said Michael Habib, research associate at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County’s dinosaur institute.“They have been inspiration for countless movie monsters, they were critical parts of global ecosystems worldwide during the age of dinosaurs, so they are key to understanding the ecology and extinctions of that time.Created with Sketch.Science news in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.120 Turtle embryos influence sex by shakingThe sex of the turtle is determined by the temperatures at which they are incubated.

The tallest of the skeletons uncovered measured at 1.9mThe definition of a species is not so clear cutResearchers settled upon the name “frozen dragon” as a nod to the now icy landscape in which the skeleton was discovered, but in reality it would have thrived in a temperate climate that supported lizards, turtles and small mammals.Professor Habib, a fan of Game of Thrones, admitted he initially suggested calling the species Cryodrakon viserionin reference to one of the show’s dragons, which was reborn in ice, according to National Geographic.Despite its fearsome name, the dinosaur suffered many battle scars during its lifetime, with scarred bones and the tooth of a velociraptor-esque creature lodged in the remains.Scientists believe that because of its muscular shape it was a ground hunter who used flight to burst away from danger or to seize its prey.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This tells us a great deal about the anatomy of these large flyers, how they flew and how they lived.”For decades, scientists wrongly classified the remains as part of\u0026nbspthe Quetzalcoatlus\u0026nbspgroup\u0026nbspof pterosaur, first found in Texas.When Prof\u0026nbspHabib, who was measuring the bones to map how the creatures flew, saw the skeleton four years ago, he began to suspect it was unique.He was able to establish it was an azhdarchid, one of the largest types of pterosaur ever known. But his real breakthrough came while studying the creature’s neck vertebrae.Prof Habib discovered that the arrangement of pneumatophores – the holes through which air sacs entered the bones’ interior – were unlike that of any other known azhdarchid.Asteroid that killed dinosaurs hit with force of 10bn atomic bombsHigher oxygen levels helped dinosaurs to flourish, say scientists‘Forgotten dinosaurs’ returning from edge of extinction in US rivers“The creature is similar to the largest pterosaurs known, yet key characteristics gleaned from the cache of bones show it’s actually part of a new genus and species,” he said.“This particular group of pterosaurs includes the largest flying animals of all time. Their anatomy holds important clues about the limits of animal flight and may be important in the future for biologically inspired mechanical design for flight.”Researchers next hope to establish how the muscles of the ”frozen dragon” might have attached to its bones to gain better insight into how it moved.Prof Habib wishes to further measure the bones to learn more about how it flew – the scientific process that first led him to the species’ discovery.Additional reporting by SWNSShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The 5 per cent share of short-changed workers is equivalent to about 1.5 million people.\u0026nbspA government report last year noted that there is effectively no state agency enforcing holiday pay regulations and cited evidence suggesting that the unpaid amount is equal to losses from violations of minimum wage rules.Lindsay Judge, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “The UK has a multitude of rules to govern its labour market – from maximum hours to minimum pay. But these rules can only become a reality if they are properly enforced.“Labour market violations remain far too common, with millions of workers missing out on basic entitlements to a pay slip, holiday entitlement and the minimum wage.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Team Europe celebrate winning the Solheim Cup at Gleneagles in Auchterarder, Scotland.

Workers must be paid the higher National Living Wage if they are 25 or over. The current rate is £8.21 per hour.The analysis by the Resolution Foundation reveals that the risk of being short-changed on pay or holiday is closely linked to the worker’s personal characteristics, the type of their contract and their industry.For example, workers aged 25 and under are almost twice as likely to be underpaid the minimum wage as any other age group.\u0026nbspOne in seven workers in the hotels and restaurants sector say they receive no paid holiday entitlement, while one in six workers aged 65 or over report the same violation – more than any other age group.Workers in firms that employ fewer than 25 people are most likely to miss out on paid leave, as are workers on zero-hours and temporary contracts.The scale of labour law breaches may be even bigger as the Resolution Foundation points out gaps in available data.\u0026nbspSurveys miss out some important questions and workers are often unaware their employer is breaking the law or they may be reluctant or too frightened to report the truth, the think tank says.Meanwhile, the HMRC findings on minimum wage underpayments are based on the number of firms that were caught and so also understate the true picture, the foundation added.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

None of their ecological needs is considered.”Gekoski)Four Paws\u0026nbspsaid in many cases during the investigation across Europe last month animals were seen kept in small enclosures or cages, causing psychological and physical damage.The group says while Asia’s wildlife tourism industry is widely reported, little is known about the “ruthless” abuse closer to home and the evidence found was “horrendous”.\u0026nbspIs elephant riding in Thailand abuse?At German circuses, visitors rode on elephants’ backs – controversial because behind-the-scenes training often involves hitting the animals with sharp hooks.In circus rings they were made to sit on small chairs, play football and stand on one leg.Researchers say that every year there is a tug-of-war between the elephants and villagers, and in winter the animals have to pull sledges.“Elephants are highly intelligent herd animals who migrate and occupy vast areas of land. It is extremely cruel to keep them enclosed in small spaces and exploit them,” said Mr Harkin.“Lack of movement in captivity can result in joint or back problems, in addition to the indeterminable psychological distress.”Tourists in Spain were put at risk when they played and took selfies with a tiger, the researchers said.“The footage shows how the tiger snaps at a visitor while playing chase – behaviour expected from a tiger but that makes interactions extremely dangerous for humans.“The tiger is a predator weighing about 300kg with sharp teeth and claws. Her natural instincts cannot be suppressed.”The female tiger is among more than 100 other wild animals rented out for film productions and used as tourist photo props.“Tigers are commercially traded and treated as a commodity throughout Europe, and this can overlap with illegal tiger trade,” said Mr Harkin.Elephants poked with pointed sticks for UK tourists at Indian resortAt a French zoo an animal tamer went into a cage alone with up to 10 tigers elsewhere orangutans were kept in small cages.“Ironically a video is played before the show pointing out the importance of conservation of tigers. The commercialisation and exploitation of these animals have nothing to do with the conservation of wild tigers – on the contrary,” he said.\u0026nbspBack in the Czech Republic, at a castle in\u0026nbspCesky Krumlov, investigators also saw three bears kept in a stone moat, denied the chance to climb or roam free.\u0026nbspThe Independent has asked the castle authorities and a\u0026nbspSpanish company\u0026nbspwhere tourists take selfies with tigers\u0026nbspto comment.“It is unacceptable that in the 21st century it’s legal in Europe to abuse wild animals for entertainment,” said Mr\u0026nbspHarkin.“What happens to the animals once they become too old or sick to perform or when the cubs are too old for petting?”Wales may ban ‘cruel practice’ of using wild animals in circusesHynek\u0026nbspNavratil, director of\u0026nbspCirkus\u0026nbspHumberto, said their animals, which were in “perfect condition, better than in zoos”, were regularly checked by vets and were considered family members and colleagues, trained with a rewards system.Stereotypical behaviour\u0026nbspfrom stress\u0026nbspis never seen in Czech circuses, he said. “We play with them, it keeps their brains working.”“Activist groups spread disinformation and stimulate xenophobic behaviour towards people in circuses. Because of that, we are reporting death threats to police, every week,” Mr\u0026nbspNavratil\u0026nbspsaid.But the circus “defeated” the groups by\u0026nbspopening its gates\u0026nbspto the public, including training, so people can see the conditions. “We have nothing to hide,” he went on.“We do not take Four Paws and such organisations as partners to dialogue. They do not not know anything about us, nor they do not know anything about our animals... We cannot respect them.”\u0026nbspIllegal breeding was not possible, he said, adding: “Our animals are not slaves. Sometimes some animal does not want to perform on a certain day.

The Government has to push for change, otherwise it will only be a matter of time until someone  dies.”New statistics published by NHS Digital have shown a dramatic increase in the number of young children admitted to hospital with anaphylactic shock - a reaction so severe it can be fatal.A worrying  children aged  and under were treated for anaphylaxis from  to , compared to  from  to  - a rise of over a third.Clare, , who lives in Canterbury, Kent, with husband Stewart, , a tennis coach, and her two remaining daughters Charlotte, , and April, one, knew Sadie had issues from when she was a baby.Her reactions were severe, with her lips quickly swellingshe came into contact with milk, but it took six months of doctors trips before they got help.Eventually tests showed she was allergic to dairy and nuts.There are no official Government guidelines on allergy testing, and Clare calls care haphazard - Sadie was in and out of hospital for the first four years of her le as she kept having reactions.Eventually her family paid for private tests, with Clare claiming kids with allergies should be checked regularly as things change so quickly with them.“I cant tell you what kind of stress we suffered,” Clare says.“I battled severe anxiety for the first four years of Sadies le. Its so scary, you get conflicting information, I didnt know what was safe.But things didnt get easier.“The first time she had an anaphylactic shock she was five, Clare recalls. “We put that down to a contaminated spoon in an ice cream parlour.“The second time it happened shed accidentally eaten a brioche bun and had a delayed anaphylactic shock two hours later.“She had another one after a plain burger. There was no dairy listed in the ingredients but she reacted.“Still there was no follow up appointment.It was at a family picnic in Whistable, Kent, in August , that Sadie suffered a fatal anaphylactic reaction after eating a ham sandwich - even though Clare had checked the packaging to be sure she could have it.Although the family gave her medication and quickly got her to a nearby medical centre, Sadie was unresponsive.She went into cardiac arrest, and nothing could be done to save her.Lynne Regent, chief executive of the Anaphylaxis Campaign charity said modern diets could be to blame.One child in  now has a serious nut allergy which means every school across Britain is affected, she says.Allergies can be hereditary.If there is asthma in the family, sometimes you get children developing food allergies but it also happens in families where there is no history of anything.Our eating habits have changed exponentially over the past few years. We all eat more processed food and there is less cooking from scratch. We eat dferent sorts of food from all over the world.We dont know why this might cause allergies but its a change in behaviour that might explain why allergies are increasing. Its something we need to research.A Swedish study of over one million children found that babies born via Caesarean section are five times more likely to develop food allergies in later le.Presumably this is due to the dferent bacteria a child is first exposed to, Dr Brough says. Whether they go through the birth canal or not and the impact this has on their gut bacteria.Babies fed formula milk are also more likely to suffer skin allergies such as eczema and dermatitis, though evidence is thin on the ground.It is probably the lack of breastfeeding rather than formula that is the issue, Dr Brough explains.There is only one proper study due to ethical issues but children in the control group with low breastfeeding rates had double the risk of eczema up until one year of age.Many parents say their childs allergies appear to have been present from birth.One of those is Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, whose daughter Natasha died aged  after eating a Pret a Manger baguette containing sesame seeds on a BA flight to France.Natasha was severely allergic to sesame seeds but they weren’t listed in the ingredients.Tanya , from Fulham, South London, struggled to access the right support in Natasha’s younger years.“I gave Natasha a tiny bit of banana when she was six months old and she had an anaphylactic reaction,” Tanya recalls.“I became terried about what might cause a reaction. I went to my GP and asked about allergies and I asked whether Natasha should have a test, but he said No, its really rare, nothing to worry about.“He told me to wean her on to a dairy milk formula. I did, and she had a full anaphylactic reaction. Her lips and face swelled, she was struggling to breathe. Still, we were offered no tests.”Until Natasha was two, she survived on chicken and vegetable soup made at home by her mum as the family tried to avoid potential allergens. She was also diagnosed with asthma.“Aged two and a half, she grabbed a bread stick with sesame seeds on it and she reacted, Tanya explains. It was then she was finally given a blood test.“Sometimes just walking into a coffee shop would make her react, we put it down to milk proteins in the airthey were making frothy coffee.Tanya believes the rate of allergies has increased so fast that professionals are struggling to cope.We are facing a time bomb when it comes to allergies – and it’s going to explode, she says.After Natasha’s death in , her parents set up the Natasha Allergy Research Foundation, a charity which aims to raise awareness of allergies as well as pushing for change.Their biggest success is with Natasha’s Law, legislation which will force businesses to list the full ingredients on prepackaged foods from the summer of .Mum Emma Amoscato has two children - James, six, and Amalia, three - with allergies and hopes the law will make things easier for her.“A lot of places now will have a disclaimer and say they cant guarantee any of their food is free from anything,” explains Emma, , a writer from Bedfordshire.“At the moment, restaurants only have to list the top  allergens and both of mine have quite rare allergies.Swollen lips and or eyes, itchy skin or a rash like hives, wheezing and finding it hard to breathe or speak, feeling faint, dizzy or confused, vomiting or having diarrhoea are just some of the symptoms of severe allergy and need immediate action.This is by no means a full list of symptoms, so always speak to your doctor about what you should watch out for.Sometimes there are other factors that on the day can increase the severity of your reaction. These are called co-factors and these can include exercise, feeling unwell with a viral illness, alcohol and tablets, such as some painkillers.For some people with allergies, more serious reactions such as anaphylaxis may only occurthey have eaten a specic food, or taken the medication to which they are allergic, then they exercise.People with asthma and allergies are known to be more at risk of severe reactions than those without.Just like Sadie’s family, Emma struggled to get testing for James. He was a grizzly baby and by the time he was  weeks old he had severe eczema.His reactions grew steadily stronger and around his first birthday he was referred to a specialist and diagnosed with allergies to milk, garlic, egg, sesame, some nuts and sumac.He was admitted to hospital with anaphylaxis after taking a sip from another child’s milk cup while on holiday. Dad Carl, , had to inject him with adrenaline.“After that it kicked in for us how serious it was,” Emma says. “We kept asking ourselves what wed doit happened again, wondering what would happenwe werent with him.“We read news stories about children like ours who have died, it’s a huge worry every day of our lives.People say its because we are too clean but my children have had allergies since birth. That doesnt explain what has happened to them - we need answers.Sadie’s parents Clare and Stewart believe the UK has a lot more work to do when it comes to providing care and awareness for allergy sufferers.“No one  should have to die for things to improve,” says Clare.“Sadies little sister is also battling allergies. I live every day terried that I will have to say goodbye to another little girl.I cant do that - something must be done.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Presumably their own ­unelected pseudo-Government will see to it, since Boris Johnson won’t agree.This pro-EU elite — Letwin, Blair, Mandelson and the rest, in treacherous collusion with Brussels — want to “resolve” Brexit. They mean “reverse” it, with a referendum question splitting the Leave vote and stitched up for Remain.Brexit won’t be “resolved”we back Leave again. They won’t accept that result any more than the last.

Leavers expect it.Most know it could hit them in the pocket too. But maintaining a fat bank balance and a comfortable existence isn’t the argument-clincher for them that it is for many Remainers.It’s no surprise Remain MPs are gleefully deploying the “Yellowhammer” report to ratchet up the hysteria about Brexit. It won’t impress Leavers.And we would love to read an “impact assessment” into telling a .million majority their votes didn’t count and surrendering our economy to Marxists.No Deal risks short-term disruption.

The Tories are crazy to rubbish him.Read on Pages  and  how he enthralled paying punters at a packed venue in a diehard Labour constituency.Some in No cannot shake off their ­dislike of Farage. They must rethink. It will be extremely tough to switch Labour-voting northern Leavers to the Tories to counter Tory losses to Remainers. A smart deal with Farage could secure an election majority, and Brexit.Reject that and it looks bleak.MEGHAN’S clothing campaign is a top idea.Every item bought means an identical one is donated to a group which provides smart outfits to help unemployed women find work.We hope it is a massive success.

For a packet of  cigarettes the saving will be as much as £. But Hancock, it appears, will not be celebrating.He has complained that he wasn’t consulted about the Chancellor’s plan to reintroduce duty free on trips from EU countries, and that it will help to undermine the Department of Health’s campaigns to persuade us to smoke and drink less.Obviously, that is good advice. But is anyone really going to take up smoking or go on a drinking binge just because it becomes a little cheaper to buy cigarettes and alcohol at an airport Duty free is a harmless little treat for ing holiday- makers — something to ensure we remain in good cheer for a few weeks after wefrom holiday, or a little in the way of compensationit rained all week on our Spanish beach.Duty free, as anyone over  will remember, used to be a staple part of a foreign holiday. The concept arose because once we have passed through security at a port or airport, we are deemed for tax purposes already to have left the country.Customs and Excise authorities concluded, there- fore, that they had no right to charge us duties designed to capture taxes from domestic consumption.We are theoretically still liable to pay duty on goods when we are entering a country. But in practice most countries will waive duty on small quantities of alcoholic drinks and tobacco products brought in by arriving passengers.As a result, passengers arriving in Britain from non-EU countries are currently allowed to bring back up to four litres of still wine, a litre of spirits,  litres of beer and  cigarettes without paying duty.For passengers arriving in Britain from other EU countries, however, the rules changed in  — seven years after the creation of the single market.Duty free was abolished for people travelling between EU countries. In some ways, the single market was more generous than the previous duty-free regime.Rather than just four litres of wine, for example, we are now allowed to bring unlimited quantities of wine without paying UK duty, so long as it is only for personal consumption.Given that the duty on wine is a lot lower in France than in Britain, we can save a small fortune by stocking up in a French hypermarket.What the EU single market did stop, however, was our ability to travel, say, from France to Britain without paying duty in either country. What Sajid Javid wants to do is to give us the best of both worlds.From October  — assuming we leave the EU without continuing to be subject to the rules of the single market — we will regain our duty-free allowances.But, in addition, we will continue to be allowed to bring unlimited quantities of alcohol and tobacco which we bought in France and which we intend to use only for personal consumption.The main beneficiaries of duty free, needless to say, are smokers and drinkers. But you don’t have to smoke or drink in order to benefit from its existence.The profits from duty free allow airlines and ferry operators to keep their ticket prices down. When the EU proposed to abolish duty free in the s, the travel industry calculated that , jobs in the UK were dependent on its existence.That was no doubt exaggerated for effect, and of course the budget airline industry has grown hugely in the past  years.Butwe want to be able to continue to fly to Spain for a tenner , the reintroduction of duty free is going to be a signicant influence on what airlines can offer by way of cheap tickets.The fuss over Sajid Javid’s proposal has reopened isions in the Government over so-called “sin taxes” on booze and fags.For some, like Matt Hancock, who this week praised the sugar levy on fizzy drinks, sin taxes are a useful instrument for persuading us to lead healthier lives. Others, the Prime Minister included, are more guarded.The problem with slapping taxes on alcohol, cigarettes and unhealthy food is that they are regressive taxes which impact disproportionately on the poor.I would say to Matt Hancock: Give us all the advice on healthy living that you can. And I don’t object to proportionate taxes which reflect the cost of medical care for smokers and excessive drinkers.But leave it to us to decide how we want to lead our lives — and don’t deny us a small pleasure like being able to buy a small duty-free treat on our way home.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is because they are so far apart that architects had to factor in the curvature of Earth.Today, it’s still as unnecessary as it ever was. And it’s no longer the longest suspension bridge in the world. But it remains, in my opinion, the most beautul.In fact, and I’ve said this often, it’s the most beautul man-made thing of all time. Apart from maybe the Riva Aquarama speedboat.When I stand on the south shore on a misty morning and see the wafer-thin road disappearing off into the sea, it takes my breath away. It really does.So I’m glad it was made. And I’m glad too that the Labour government also built the Post Office Tower, even though it is now just a hazard to aircraft.Then there’s Concorde. The world did not need such a thing.And the technical challenges facing the engineers were huge. A Nasa boffin once told me that getting a passenger plane up beyond Mach  was more dficult than putting a man on the moon.But that old commie Tony Benn had decided Concorde was going to succeed, so he pushed and he pushed and, by God, are we glad he did.Can you imagine such a thing Because even though the beautul white bird is now grounded, we still have those memories of the shattering noise it made and the way it could make the sun rise in the West.I remember once, standing on a beach in Barbados as a British Airways Concorde roared overhead at treetop height.After it had passed, a stunned American on the next sun lounger looked at me and said: “You Brits.”I was so proud, I didn’t get round to telling him it was half French.Since Concorde though, Britain hasn’t really done anything of any great importance. There’s been talk of a new railway line from London to Manchester, but in evolutionary terms that’s just a shuffle. And now it probably won’t happen anyway.Which is why I am SO excited about the idea of a bridge linking Larne, in Northern Ireland with Portpatrick, in Scotland.Weirdly, the Labour Party — the party that created the Post Office Tower and Concorde and the Humber Bridge — are furious, saying it’s not needed and will be too expensive and it’s only been suggested to get Boris out of his backstop hole.But can you imagine such a thing A -mile bridge supported on columns ,ft high, and rising even higher in the middle so ships can pass underneath. It would be magnicent.Yes, it would be dficult to make. The seas there are rough and deep and the seabed is littered with discarded Second World War mines and bombs.But as John F Kennedy once said: “We choose to go to the moon and do the other things not because they are easy, but because they are hard.”ACCORDING to a headline in The Times this week, The Handmaid’s Tale is increasingly ringing true.Really  We are heading for the terrying society portrayed in Margaret Atwood’s brilliant book A society where women are kept either for breeding or cleaning  Where girls can be killed for speaking  Or mutilated for looking at someone in a funny way And where children are taken away at birth and given to someone  I know cricket fan and woman Theresa May has suggested that Geoffrey Boycott, who has a conviction for domestic abuse, should be given a knighthood.But that’s a long, long way from sewing up the vagina of the woman he beat.I once saw a sufferer in Burma and the pain was so excruciating that powerful muscle spasms had snapped both his legs.And it wasn’t ordinary rabies our man in Morocco had caught either. It was “furious rabies” which causes extreme thirst and a morbid fear of water. At the same time.Mercully, he has now died. And we, meanwhile, are left to ponder what sort of a God comes up with a disease like that to end nearly , lives every year.ON the basis you should know your enemy, I read a book on holiday this year about why we shouldn’t kill animals.It wasn’t called – “If you eat meat, you’re a bastard”, but that was the thrust.And after a while, I deliberately left it in the rain, so I didn’t have to finish it.However, since I ed to Britain about a month ago, I still haven’t been able to eat pork.Cows  Chickens  Sheep  Not really bothered.But some of the things I read in that book about how pigs can play video games and feel love – they stuck.And so did the bit about how frightened they look when they are being taken to the slaughterhouse.I tried this morning to have a bacon sandwich but I couldn’t bring myself to put it in my mouth.It’s annoying. Pork was always my favourite meat but I’ll have to find a substitute.I’m thinking badger. Or maybe a nice roast fox.I know people who’ve found lost phones in their trouser pockets, and most women are of capable losing anything up to a medium-sized dog in their handbags.But I’ve never heard of anyone losing themselves. Until now.A party of tourists on a bus tour of Iceland spent hours searching for a missing passenger only to find she was in the search party.She hadn’t recognised the description of herself and it wasn’t until three in the morning that her mistake became clear.Bet she was popular.AT long last, space boffins have found a planet which they reckon could be capable of supporting le.They will know soonit has an atmosphere but they’ve already worked out that the romantically named K-b does have water. And it’s only million million miles away, which means that with current technology, we could reach it in just two million years.The only problem I can see is that it’s twice the size of Earth, with eight times the mass, so any astronaut who had survived the -light year journey would weigh quite a lot when he arrivedSo much, in fact, that after a little while, his brain would be dragged into his spinal cord.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Second, it must protect the integrity of the EU’s single market. Third, it must not involve any checks on the island of Ireland.Barclay said the UK could meet the first two of these tests, but not the third. He said there was no point in presenting any detailed proposals until the EU shted on the question of checks.One Government source explains thatthe UK did, the “EU would nuke the proposals and we would be in chaos”.So the challenge for Boris is to get the EU to move on this third point. His Monday meeting with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker gives him a chance to lobby him on this very issue.Juncker is an instinctive deal-maker and, with his term as president due to end on October , he will be keen to resolve Brexit before he goes.I also understand that several EU governments, including in France, are now apprehensive about the possibility of a second referendum.They believe it would be bad for the EU for the UK to stay in given how contested UK membership now is.They fear this would lead to every Council decision, all new EU legislation and every European Court of Justice judgment becoming a matter of controversy.The EU, though, will not abandon Ireland. This means that whatever proposal Boris comes up with will have to be something Leo Varadkar is prepared to swallow.The first meeting between the two men has given Downing Street some hope that they can find something that works for Dublin, them and the DUP.The DUP’s willingness to entertain Northern Ireland continuing to follow EU rules on agriculture has opened the door to further discussions.If Parliament had not tied Boris’s hands, he could have seenthe risk of No Deal would have pushed Dublin and the EU to compromise on the checks front. But his ability to negotiate is now weakened.For this and other reasons, the odds are still against a deal. But there is a greater chance of one than a week ago.The Liberal Democrats start their conference today in their strongest position for years.They are polling around  per cent and in line to make major gains at the next election.At conference next week they are expected to adopt as their position that a Lib Dem government – stop laughing at the back – would simply revoke Article , cancelling the referendum result.This will establish them as the most unambiguously anti-Brexit party, a development that concerns a growing number of Labour MPs in Remain seats who want their party to take a clearer line on the issue for fear of losing ground to the Lib Dems.At the same time, the policy means that the Liberal Democrats can tell voters they will make the whole issue go away. By contrast, a second referendum would drag things out.If politics is now about Leave v Remain, rather than Left v Right, expect the Lib Dems to come back with more MPs than they have ever had before, following the next election.One of the things that urgently needs sorting out in this country is technical education.Those who don’t want to do an academic degree are being ill-served by further education.Gavin Williamson, the new Education Secretary, told Cabinet this week that there are up to , people trained in Hair  Beauty yet only a need for about , new recruits to work in this industry each year.The result is tens of thousands of people doing courses that don’t lead to them getting jobs or boost this country’s productivity.Those who want a second Brexit referendum are now arguing there shouldn’t be a General Election until a second referendum has taken place.Tony Blair, Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson and Tory rebel Oliver Letwin have all made that case this week.Leave aside the massive issue of whether there should be a second referendum before the result of the first one has even been implemented, this plan would mean that this Parliament would have to carry on sitting until well into .This is a disastrous idea. This is a useless Parliament and keeping it going will just add to the national paralysis.With no party able to command a majority in the Commons, nothing can get done. Eventhis Parliament could muster a majority for a referendum, which is far from certain, it could do so for little .It is hard to see what meaningful domestic legislation can come out of this Parliament given that neither Boris Johnson nor Jeremy Corbyn can secure the backing of most MPs.The public desire for politicians to get on with both Brexit and the domestic agenda is why No will spend next week trying to emphasise its tough-on-crime policies.I understand Boris Johnson will put flesh on the bones of his plan to end early release for violent and unrepentant criminals.Friends are urging Amber Rudd to stand in the West London seat of Kensington at the next election.Its controversial Labour MP, Emma Dent Coad, has a majority of just .The thinking goes that the constituency isn’t keen on either No Deal or Jeremy Corbyn, so Rudd could do well standing as an independent.But it is exceptionally hard for independents to win seats, andRudd were to go down this course, she would be standing in the constituency for the first time – she is currently MP for Hastings, down on the south coast. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We have Farage’s no-deal Brexiteers pulling one way.And those who want no Brexit at all pulling in the other direction.Neither are true democrats, because during the referendum the Leave camp promised to get a good deal from the EU, while Remain politicians said that they’d respect the result.And while those isive groups may shout the loudest, neither represent the majority of the British public who just want politicians to get on with it and work together to deliver a sensible Brexit.That’s why we’ve this week formed our cross-party MPs For A Deal group, to remind the public that there is still a majority of politicians who would prefer a deal-based Brexit to a catastrophic no-deal Brexit or an undemocratic no Brexit at all.Founding members include Tory leadership candidate Rory Stewart, Lib Dem Norman Lamb and Labour’s Caroline Flint.We all come from very dferent political backgrounds, and even on Brexit we’ve had our dferences. Some of us voted for Theresa May’s deal, not because it was perfect but because it delivered on the result of the referendum.Others couldn’t support it because they felt it was a ‘blind Brexit’ — a leap into the unknown — and asked May to come back with something better.But we are all agreed on one thing.After May held cross-party talks with Labour in May  she came back with ten changes to her deal, and we all believe that this compromise package was more likely to get through Parliament.We all believed at the time that MPs should have been able to debate and vote on this, but sadly it was rejected by second referendum advocates and no-dealers.The Withdrawal Agreement Bill, as it’s known, included protection of workers’ rights, food standards and the environment, which would have benefited us all.We now hope that Boris Johnson brings a similar offer back to Parliament so we can vote on it.Sometimes it’s easy to forget that  Conservative MPs backed May’s deal in March this year while more than  other MPs voted for dferent forms of a Brexit in indicative votes.The desire to agree a Brexit deal is there.A failure to do so may well result in the consequences set out in the government’s own ‘Operation Yellowhammer’ no-deal report.Sensible MPs desperately need to face down the isive voices on either side and come together in the national interest.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I really want to know what motivates these EU fanatics. They must hate their country.”Others took aim at the BBC with one tweeting: “Disgusted to see the Last Night of the Proms politicised by remainers - shame on them and the bbc.”Prior to the concert, Kate Hobbs, of the EU Flags Proms Team, said she hoped the flags would be a timely reminder to the audience that music is a universal language which unites people.As Rule, Britannia! was performed onstage, mezzo-soprano Jamie Barton waved the rainbow flag to loud cheers from the audience.The EU Flags Proms Team first co-ordinated the stunt back in  and have repeated it each year at the annual classical music festival.The campaign group said the initiative was crowdfunded by a group of music lovers to ensure the EU flag would be waved alongside the union jack at the event.We were keen to demonstrate that it is possible to be patriotic at the same time as maintaining a European and internationalist identity, the EU Flags Proms Team said.Speaking of opening number Woke, its composer Daniel Kidane said: “For the Last Night of the Proms, my wish is for my piece to be taken as a musical call for greater empathy and a willingness to try something new — whether musically or culturally.“We can all play a part in staying vigilant and woke.”Viewer Nick Mudge said: “Sad Last Night of the Proms is not immune from BBC ‘wokeness’.”The BBC said in a statement said flags are “a traditional part of the Last Night of the Proms”.Many members of the audience were also seen waving the European Union flag.One man was wearing a blue T-shirt with the words “Thank EU for the music” emblazoned on the front.The BBC said it tried to avoid giving “undue prominence” to the flags and its “primary focus is on the musicians and their performances”."},{"url":null,"title":"legal ban eating dogs blocked far east","story":"Environment ministers have drawn up a new criminal offence in Britain of possessing dog and cat meat.Former DEFRA Secretary Michael Gove ordered the move in the summer despite the sickening practice being rare in the UK.Dog groups persuaded him that it would send a powerful message to South East Asian countries where the practice is still re, matching a similar law passed in the US last year.But The Sun can reveal that nervous civil servants have stepped in to halt the ground-breaking move.Campaigning Tory MP Giles Watling was told by the MoJ that one of the reasons it acted was that it would be “culturally insensitive” of the Government to dictate to other nations what they should eat.Mr Watling told The Sun last night: “Dogs are our companion animals. We do not eat them, and that is a very important message to send to the rest of the world.“It’s not culturally insensitive because we’re not telling them what to do – we’re just telling them what we do.“We shouldn’t be worrying about that, so I was surprised that was the MoJ’s objection.”Justice officials also argued that it would be dficult to enforce the law and the current ban on transporting or exporting dog and cat meat suffices.Eating dog is already banned in Germany, Austria, Taiwan, South Australia and Hong Kong.An estimated  million dogs a year are slaughtered to be eaten, across China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia.Most are stolen off the street.Their meat it is considered both a delicacy and a health tonic.The World Dog Alliance mounted a campaign in the UK last year for a full ban on any activity relating to the eating of dogs.A series of MPs back a ban, including former Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan who dubbed it “a disgusting habit”.A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: “We currently have some of the strongest animal welfare laws in the world.The government is currently considering whether any changes are needed in this area in the UK and will set out any plans in due course.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Even Top Gear presenter Freddie Flintoff has admitted he’s interested in the idea, recently saying “anything is possible”.Blogger Mark Sargent, who has become a celebrity since starring in the Netflix show, was one of the speakers at the conference, where tickets cost £ for one day and £ for the full residential treatment.Mark, , who has just finished a European tour taking in Stockholm, Dublin, Belfast and Cardf, thinks we live on a flat disc covered by a dome — a bit like a snow globe.But he admitted: “To prove that we would have to have our own rocket program.”Others claim gravity is a myth, there is no such thing as space, the Sun isn’t million miles away and the edge of the planet is a huge wall of ice.Tech worker Robin Campbell organised the weekend event, called Globe Lie UK Convention. The -year-old, from Bristol, delivered the opening lecture on Saturday in a darkened hall at a Christian centre in the village of Cleobury Mortimer.It was a beginner’s guide, packed with slides and photos of supposedly devastating “evidence.”The theory rests on the idea that Nasa — and all the other space agencies — have been faking images of Earth. The obvious question is: “Why would the world’s most powerful nations spend trillions on bogus space programs ”According to Robin and Mark, they discovered secret lands “beyond the rim” of our pancake-shaped planet in  during an expedition to Antarctica. At that point they realised Earth wasn’t a globe, but didn’t tell the rest of us because they wanted to keep the resources in these outer lands, including gold and oil, for themselves.Among the believers is craftsman Ruben Dario Jaramillo, who was selling £ models of flat earth.The -year-old Londoner told me: “My we Cynthia thought I was cheating on her because I was spending so much time researching flat earth theories.”Cynthia is now a believer as well.Instead of having to explain how a flat Earth could possibly work, the movement’s followers prefer to deny the spherical option.Tony Riley, , from Liverpool, doesn’t classy himself as a “Flat Earther” and says he is searching for proof we live on a ball.Clearly passionate about the subject, the businessman eloquently described some of the scientic experiments he has carried out as he questions long established theories.Tony thinks gravity is a “pseudo-science”. He said he doesn’t “know where the Sun is”, and “maths doesn’t prove the real world”. Having said we should only believe what we can observe, he then dismissed the existence of the International Space Station which, with a decent telescope, can be seen orbiting the Earth.Tony said: “It does look like a structure, but it looks holographic.”Mother-of-two Roxanne Glen, from London, prefers to be called a “globe sceptic”. She said: “Natural observations have told me the Earth is flat.”EXPERT: Autopilot ies the pitch to maintain altitude.CLAIM: If Earth is round, why can you see objects beyond the horizon EXPERT: Many factors come into play, such as the elevation of the land you are on, the height of the object and refraction causing light to bend.CLAIM: We’d feel itEarth was rotating at ,mph while hurtling through space.EXPERT: We can’t feel Earth move as we move with it at the same speed.CLAIM: It’s been covered up that explorer Admiral Richard E Byrd found land as big as the US beyond the South Pole.The -year-old building liaison worker believes schools are breaking the law by not teaching pupils that our planet could either be spherical or flat — or something .Roxanne has a YouTube channel and goes to Speakers Corner in London every month to persuade others of the “truth”.Everyone at the event had the same message — seek out the facts.That’s certainly good advice to anyone tempted to follow the globe deniers down their rabbit hole of misinformation and half truths.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

people and highly effective at targeting young people.It follows a spike of mysterious and le-threatening lung diseases - believed to be linked to vaping - over the summer.In the US, six people are

history of underlying health issues.While more than  people, mostly otherwise healthy and in their teens or s, have shown up at hospitals with breathing dficulties.Often theyve also suffered with vomiting, fever and fatigue for several days prior.Some have even ended up in intensive care on a ventilator for several weeks.Investigators are still trying to understand what causes the illnesses.Meanwhile, health officials have warned people against buying vaping products on the street or using marijuana-derived oil.Theyre not completely risk free, but they carry a small fraction of the risk of cigarettes.E-cigarettes do not produce tar or carbon monoxide, two of the most harmful elements in tobacco smoke.The liquid and vapour contain some potentially harmful chemicals also found in cigarette smoke, but at much lower levels.While nicotine is the addictive substance in cigarettes, its relatively harmless.Almost all of the harm from smoking comes from the thousands of other chemicals in tobacco smoke, many of which are toxic.Nicotine replacement therapy has been widely used for many years to help people stop smoking and is a safe treatment.Theres no evidence so far that

e-cigarettes from store shelves.Sales of e-cigarettes are banned in New York to people under  years old, an age that will rise to  in November.Cuomo said he has told state police to increase

out of homes around the country every day, checking that customers’ electricity is safely wired and testing all gas appliances to make sure they’re safe.“We regularly visit customers who haven’t had their electrical wiring or gas appliances checked in  to  years, which is a concern.We have so many gadgets in the house nowadays that it can be dficult to keep on top of them all, but it’s important to keep an eye on whether they’re working as they should be.“Some of the unsafe appliances we’ve come across could have had a devastating effect on our customers’ health and safety, had we not identied them.”It also emerged more than two thirds of UK householders actively worry about the safety of the appliances in their home, while half have received an electric shock from one.But more than half do not test their household gadgets as often as they’re advised to by the manufacturer, and almost two thirds of respondents admit they have used an appliance despite it being faulty.The average Brit knowingly has three broken electrical gadgets – including items from toasters and laptops to lighting and boilers – in their house.The study also found  per cent were unaware that monitoring their energy use is a good way to look after appliances.Using a smart meter can help identy changes in energy consumption which could be attributed to dferent devices being turned on or

hear it, see it, taste it or smell it, and it kills around  people a year – but fortunately, carbon monoxide poisoning is preventable.“Tell-tale signs of a carbon monoxide leak include sooty stains on your cooker, finding your gas fire has become dficult to light, and spotting that the flame on your boiler is burning yellow or orange instead of blue.“Faulty central heating systems are one of the most common sources of carbon monoxide in the home.So as well getting your boiler checked once a year, it’s essential to have a carbon monoxide alarm fitted, and to call an expertly-trained

Such proposals have not yet been made.“The Commission will remain available to work  .“The October European Council will be an important milestone in the process.Before todays meeting the PM said he still believes a deal could be done by Halloween.He wrote in the : If we can make enough progress in the next few days, I intend to go to that crucial summit on October  and finalise an agreement that will protect the interests of business and citizens on both sides of the Channel, and on both sides of the border in Ireland.I believe passionately that we can do it, and I believe that such an agreement is in the interests not just of the UK but also of our European friends.Bo-Jo’s visit to Luxembourg comes as the DUP showed signs they were softening on the idea of an “all-Ireland” farming market after our orce from the bloc.Jeffrey Donaldson, the party’s chief whip, said the idea of an agri-food sector to avoid a hard border was being considered.He told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland said: “Where there is political will, there is certainly a way.

But things were very dferent for women back then: the blokes were in their own station working on dferent crimes, and I spent the whole time wishing I could cross the police yard that separated the two stations. aposIt was frustrating. aposAs women, we were expected to only work on crimes that affected women and children, things like indecency, sexual assault and domestic violence. aposI felt I was equal and the system should allow me to be equal, and it didn’t. aposI respected the work policewomen did, but I just wanted to do the same as the blokes.    aposThankfully, the Sexual Discrimination Act changed everything, and we were allowed to work alongside men at last. aposPolicing was dferent in those days. aposI spent a lot of time out in the community, talking to people. aposI’d go for a cuppa with the local prostitute, or have a long old chat with the greengrocer. aposI was good at it, gaining people’s trust and getting tip-offs. Soon I was made a detective, the perfect role for me, as I’m nosy and love piecing things together to make a narrative. aposIn December  I was promoted to join the Flying Squad, a branch of the politan Police’s Serious Crime Branch. aposIt was a dream come true and I couldn’t believe it when I got the call to say I’d made it. aposMost of the time I was stopping armed robbers before they got to security firms. aposIntelligence would come through that a robbery was about to take place, and we’d be there ready to strike. aposThere was a real adrenaline rush feeling when you’d get out the car to stop a crime. aposIt felt like no one could stop you, running across the pavement and about to take out an armed robber.  aposBut as the only woman on the Force, it was very hard. aposThere was one bloke in particular who made my le hell, and the others acted like I was in the way. aposBecause I was female, they acted like they had to look after me. Putting up with them was really tough, but I was determined to stick it out. Terrible crimes aposAfter a few years with the Squad, I went back to being a detective again. Murder cases can stay with officers their whole le – it can be  years later and it’s still bugging you. aposDealing with the family left behind is the hardest part… aposThey said goodbye to their loved one that morning, then they didn’t come home. aposOften they can be angry and in shock, and as the detective, you can be the recipient of that anger, but you still have to find out as much information about the victim from them as you possibly can. aposThat can be such a distressing responsibility. aposI saw terrible things during my career and some cases have really stayed with me.  aposThere was a little eight-year-old boy who went missing on the Royal Wedding day in . aposLondon was like a ghost town and he was just taken off the street, whipped away asa great bird of prey had plucked him from the ground. aposHe was found dead and his killer is probably still walking around. aposHow do they live with what they’ve done  aposThere’s another case I can’t forget. aposA man took a pair of expensive shoes back to a shoe shop because he didn’t like them. aposBut they had been worn and the manager said, “I’m sorry, but you’ve worn these.”  aposThe man pulled out a kne and stabbed the manager in the neck. aposA le lost, over something so stupid. aposI was also on the scene at the Deptford fire, where  teenagers were burnt to death at a party. aposThose images, unfortunately, have always stayed in my head. There was a boy hanging out of the window… aposI hate it. I wish those pictures would go away. aposIt was a terrible, terrible thing. Speaking out aposThere were only three female DCIs at that time, so when the author Lynda La Plante was looking for a woman detective to interview as research for a new book, one of my colleagues told her, “You should meet Jackie.” aposI’m forever grateful for that introduction, because it changed my le. aposTalking to Lynda was cathartic.  aposI’d go to her house and chat for hours – it was like therapy. aposShe would never take notes, but would just sit and listen. aposThen the next time I’d see her, she’d have developed this great plot from the ious elements I’d told her and it would keep evolving from there. aposWe took her to the murder squad, the CID offices, the coroner’s court, to forensics and the pathology labs where they do post-mortems. aposIt was a funny feeling speaking out about le on the Force for women. I felt a bit like I was betraying the organisation I was part of. aposBut I felt like I needed to say it like it was too. aposIt was strange watching the first episodes. aposI was afraid people would say, ‘It’s not really like that.’ aposIt was also painful, because that was my experience – I suffered that prejudice, andother women in the police say they didn’t, I say they’re liars. aposThe show was ahead of its time in terms of the subjects it dealt with, like misogyny, child abuse and abuse in care homes. aposI never get bored of comparisons to Jane Tennison.  aposBut I’m not her: Helen Mirren brought a lot to the character, and so did Lynda, of course. Jane is a combination of the three of us. I met Helen during filming. She was phenomenal, a gt to the show. aposThere are key dferences too. aposI’m gay and Jane was straight and that was the right thing to do. aposLynda said, “Shall we make her gay, Jackie ” aposAnd I said no, because I thought it would dilute the character, and the world wasn’t ready for it yet. aposI left the Force in , just shy of  years of service, but I never strayed too far. aposI did a Masters in Addiction Psychology, and I still volunteer twice a week in prisons, helping inmates with their addictions. aposI suffered with my own alcoholism – giving up booze meant completely rewiring my brain, and now I help others do the same. aposAs a detective, I didn’t manage the home le balance. aposIt just blurred into one – my work was my le. aposIf I wasn’t there, I’d be thinking about it. aposIf you’re dealing with a murder investigation your brain doesn’t just switch off at  o’clock. aposBut these days, I live in the country with my partner and we have a lovely le. aposShe’s always telling me to slow down, but I don’t know what a quieter le would look like. aposLe in the Police Force has changed beyond recognition for women and that’s good. aposPrime Suspect contributed to that change, and I think Jane Tennison did a lot to sht attitudes towards females. aposI’m proud to have been a part of that.’ Lynda La Plante on Jackie "},{"url":null,"title":"bride wrecks 1000 perfect wedding","story":"NewsBride wrecks £, perfect wedding dress in unusual Blackpool photoshootAngela and Mark Hargate walked out from the beach and leapt into waves to pose together in chilly Irish SeaShareCommentsByHannah PhillipsKelly-Ann Mills:,  SEP Updated:,  SEP NewsAngela and Mark Brown in the sea at Blackpool \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

In the Netherlands, the number of Brits applying for Dutch citizenship shot up from around  in  to more than  the next year, to close to , the year after. While the Dutch authorities allow people living in Britain to hold a Dutch and British passport at the same time, some Brits living in the Netherlands have to renounce their British citizenship in order to become officially Dutch.  As uncertainty rages in Westminster and the future of the UKaposs place within the EU remains unclear, some people have taken the plunge and committed themselves to our neighbours across the North Sea. Anna, a Brit living in the Netherlands, said it felt weirder than she expected when she sent off her British passport to the Dutch authorities and it didnapost come back. For her, fatigue and disappointment with the Brexit process, coupled with a strong sense of her European identity, led her relinquish her British citizenship. If this is what Britain wants, then Iaposm not British anymore, Anna said in an interview with the BBC.   Now itaposs just a huge relief to be done with all the mess, to know that, no matter what happens in Westminster, it doesnapost affect us. Although she is no longer in line for the blue passport much coveted by some patriots living in the UK, Anna said that she remains British and still has milk in her tea - whatever her passport says. Another person who is no longer a Brit on paper but feels a great affinity to the country is Jack. Feeling anxious and asthe rules of the citizenship game in the UK keep changing, he decided to fully commit to the Netherlands.    While he shed a tear when he said goodbye to his British passport, fear that he may be asked to leave his good friends, good job and beloved country of residence post-Brexit led Jack to the decision. He said: On the one hand a passport is just a document which entitles you to live and work and travel in certain places, but on the other hand thereaposs a big emotional connection. Samantha is another Brit living in the Netherlands who has happy the anguish of not knowing where her future lies is over now she has become fully Dutch..

Nearly , badgers – a protected species – will now be shot dead as  culls, including  new areas, get the go ahead, up from , last year.    Tuberculosis infections in cattle blight farms and cost taxpayers more than £m a year in compensation payments. But this decision, the biggest cull to date, flies in the face of scientic evidence proving it to be not just cruel but a failure too. The number of cattle slaughtered because of TB rose from , in , when badger culling began, to , in -. It is estimated , badgers are likely to suffer “immense pain” in culls, according to former government adviser Prof Ranald Munro, with % taking more than five minutes to die after being shot. Prof Munro’s remarks come as he and  other vets, scientists and animal welfare campaigners wrote to Natural England, the body that oversees the culls. A  independent review of strategies for tackling tuberculosis also warned against an “over-emphasis” on the role of wildle in its spread and concluded badgers were not the primary cause. It said transmission was greater from cattle to cattle and suggested farmers needed to do more to prevent it.  It also found culling had only a modest effect in curbing TB. But the government never responded, instead prioritising the views of Tory-voting farmers and landowners over those of highly respected scientists.

The shelf-stacker has been jailed over his part driving the car for his two accomplices in the violent robbery at the Tesco store in Kidsgrove, Staffordshire. Steven Banks, , was been jailed for  years over the crime.Banks had phoned in sick the day of the robbery, then carried out the inside job alongside two masked accomplices, reports StokeonTrentLive .   As he waited in a Ford Mondeo, the other men entered the Kidsgrove store and went straight to two members of staff filling the tills with cash. One -year-old worker, who was standing near the mobile safe with some of the money, was struck to the back of her head. Still dazed from the blow, she was subjected to a terrying attack. Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard how she was thrown against a wall and hit with such force to her chest she was knocked off her feet. She later recalled: “The man was shouting at me to ‘shut up, stay down, hands up’. I thought he had a gun.”    The pair bundled £, of cash from the safe into a bag and escaped. But a quick-thinking employee scribbled down the details of the getaway vehicle. Prosecutor Hugh O’Brien Quinn said: “The car was later found abandoned nearby. The defendant’s fingerprints were recovered from the gear stick.” It emerged the Mondeo had earlier been stolen and fitted with  plates. Now -year-old Banks, formerly of Burslem , is starting a y prison sentence after pleading guilty to robbery. The events unfolded early on November ,  as two cars made their way in convoy from Birmingham to Kidsgrove. One was the getaway vehicle and the other, a Mercedes, was used to transport them back after dumping the Mondeo. The court was told Banks is the only person to have been charged in connection with the case.    One robbery suspect is still at large and another is ‘in custody for a similar offence’. Mr O’Brien Quinn said two mobile phones were seized from Banks. The phone data placed him at the scene. “The defendant was in financial dficulties,” he added. “He had sent a message to a girlfriend, suggesting he had considered robbing a petrol station. “He then received a message on November  from another woman, asking him where all the money had come from the day before. He later told police it was in relation to wages from Tesco – but he was not paid on or around November .” Banks would have known exactly what time the tills would be filled for the day. Samina Rashid, mitigating, said the other men had approached him because of his Tesco links. “He certainly had no idea what had gone on inside until later. He received a financial payment for his role,” she added. Banks has since been living in Scotland so he can care for his poorly mother. In a victim impact statement, the worker injured in the attack revealed she has never worked since and was forced to leave Tesco due to ill health.

For example, it doesnapost contain any alcohol, making it halal and a great choice for tee total customers.

The part of town where Dundee Harp was founded is long removed, but that section of town was still there in the s.”Rob continued as he traced Dundee Harp’s once fertile source of talent: “We can start at Pat Cassady’s barber shop, or across the street at the premises of Terry McMahon’s pub – The Harp.“Both were on Brook Street in the Westport area of Dundee, otherwise known as The Burn. Heading east towards City Square, to the right past Daniels brae, you pass the Burn Bar.“A quick look inside would probably see brothers Pat and Jim Sturrock pouring sumptuous pints of heavy, and Eddie Greenan would normally be standing at the far end of the bar.“A bit further on, you would be at the Blackness Road junction before heading down the Blackie past the Blue Mountains, and now entering the bustling shopping expanse of the West Port.“With the Globe Bar visible in a rear-view mirror, crossing over Tay Street reveals the Overgate. This historic artery had a pulse and an energy all to itself.“Those memorable stretches of the old town nurtured the players who turned out for Dundee Harp FC.”Rob revealed that Arbroath had a star defender, a local lad called Tom O’Kane.Rob went on: “He took no prisoners and could leather a ball from one end of the pitch to the other.“At the beginning of the - season, Tom was poached and somehow persuaded to leave his home team to sign for Dundee Harp.“The town of Arbroath was outraged at the smash-and-grab by Harp.“Were underhand means used to attract O’Kane “Probably.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/06/image.jpg1_.396679.jpg ","title":"blether exhibition on dundee uniteds greatest gaffer jim mclean is wonderful","story":"Tannadice Park currently hosts a wonderful initiative as Dundee United remembers the glory years under their greatest-ever manager.Tom Cairns, chairman of the Dundee United Business Club, along with several other volunteers, host the ‘The United in Memories’ display at the ground.Said Tom: “This year, it features The Jim McLean Years and can be viewed every Wednesday until late November .“On display is an array of interesting memorabilia encompassing the managerial career of the most successful manager in Dundee United’s history.“The event is staffed by knowledgeable volunteers from Dundee United Business Club.”This has got to be a must-see event for every United fan – and, indeed, every football fan.Admission is free via the main door at Tannadice Park from pm until .pm and has easy disabled persons access."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/07/5d382714055389.83294295-e1564477706176.jpg ","title":"dundee boss mcpake to shake things up for alloa clash following recent losses","story":"Dundee boss James McPake will ring the changes for tomorrow’s Championship clash with Alloa Athletic.On the back of a disastrous derby display in their - defeat at Tannadice, the Dark Blues were dumped out of the Challenge Cup by League Two Elgin.Manager James McPake will certainly make one change but is likely to make more after two disappointing results.Goalkeeper Calum Ferrie was sent off last Sunday and will serve a suspension this weekend.

He gets them working for each other and they get good energy in their team. They’ll be a force this year.”On top of that, Robbie admires the way the man who had a troubled spell at Tannadice more than a decade ago has resurrected his managerial career.He added: “As all managers know, we go up and down. We have good periods, then we have dficult periods.“I’ve had that as well and it’s about resilience. Ian’s had that and he’s shown it. He’s gone to a club and shown what capabilities he’s got.“He’s built something at Ayr and it’s like anything, it’s about getting time.“If you get three or four years, you get the chance to build something and get stability.“The problem in the game now is that you are getting two or three months.

defeat of Ross County.Instead they delivered the blunt lack of creativity that had resulted in shooting blanks in four of five games before beating County.Striker Stevie May, at £, the most expensive signing during McInnes’ six years at the club, made a quickto Pittodrie.May had the final two years of his Pittodrie contract cancelled three weeks ago to pave the way for a move to St Johnston having netted just eight times in  games for the Dons.May had not scored this year with his last goal coming in Aberdeen’s - loss to Celtic on Boxing Day – and that was a penalty.As was the case in his time at Pittodrie there was plenty of effort and desire from May but at no point did he threaten to end that long scoring drought.The woodwork denied Aberdeen in the th minute when Sam Cosgrove met a cross from Greg Leigh but his header hit the base of the far post.Aberdeen went ahead in the th minute when Leigh burst forward at pace. He was tackled with the ball cannoning off Lewis Ferguson into the path of Ryan HEDGES who clinically fired a left-foot drive beyond keeper Zander Clark from  yards.Aberdeen hit the self-destruct button in the rd minute through a combination of poor defending and a rare slip-up from keeper Joe Lewis.From the left Tanser found Michael O#Halloran unmarked outside the box and he was given too much time to strike a low shot which squirmed between the ing Lewis’ hands.Early after the break Saints’ Davidson twice threatened when heading wide and then having a vicious -yard drive well saved by Lewis at the near post.Saints were enraged in the th minute when they were given a penalty – then had the spot-kick rightly taken away from them.Referee McLean pointed to the spot after Kennedy went down when running across Andy Considine. If there was any contact it was minimal and it was Kennedy who clipped Considine.So rare in Scottish football, the referee was open to the notion that he could be wrong and used common sense. There were no flying pigs among the seagulls swooping over Pittodrie.Following consultation with assistant Graeme Stewart on the touchline, McLean overruled his initial decision.Aberdeen were denied by a superb save from Clark in injury time when Ferguson’s powerful -yard free kick took a defection off the defensive wall but the keeper adjusted."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/09/5d7a379f9a70a8.35215925-375x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet clive kenzie ava and lola all need a new home can you help","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable animals from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home Handsome Clive is around four to five years old and is looking for a home with a secure garden so he can enjoy the sunshine.We sadly don’t have any history on Clive but we do know he needs a home with no cats as he will chase them!He would make an ideal companion for another dog or for someone on their own looking for a companion to get them out and about.Can you offer Clive his forever home  vw, px\"  This cheeky girl is full of fun and has lots of energy to keep you on your toes.She needs a home where she is the only pet – she isn’t good with other dogs and is not used to cats.Kenzie, who is around two years of age, is a playful girl and loves to play with her toys and romp around in the garden.Can you offer Kenzie her forever home  vw, px\"  This adorable pair are looking for a home together.They can be a little shy to begin with but curiosity soon gets the better of them.Ava and Lola, who are three years old, would be suited to a quiet home where they can be pampered and enjoy the good le.They are Indoor cats and not used to getting out.Can you offer Ava and Lola the new home they need Mrs Murray#s Home for Stray Dogs and CatsTel:   "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44893623-1-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44893623-1-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44893623-1-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.44893623-1-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"pounds for primaries first token in today and prize fund boosted to 15000","story":"Today is your first chance to collect a token for the Evening Express Pounds for Primaries competition.So far, since launching the new cash giveaway,  primary schools in total from across the north-east have registered to take part.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives. There is also support for parents and carers.At SDS centres customers can get information, advice and guidance about jobs, the local labour market, training courses and apprenticeships as well as how to prepare for interviews and help with CVs and applications.The work of SDS careers advisers in schools and centres is supported by Scotland’s careers website myworldofwork, where you can access advice  hours a day. It is packed with career information, advice and tools such as the CV builder. There is also a dedicated exam results section.Details of the local SDS centres are available at myworldofwork centres and information about events and opportunities is also available on Facebook.Pauline Graham, Project Manager for the SDS Exam Results HelplineSir,I had a great time at this year#s Islay Show. It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 16 2019","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Colin MacInnes captured this photo of these two fluffy cygnets at the Corran Burn in Lochgilphead back in July.A couple of adult swans were spotted floating nearby at the time on Loch Fyne and Loch Gilp around Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"an album with atmosphere and depth","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowExtract of an album review by Marc HigginsThis striking album is a collaboration between singer songwriter Sheila K Cameron and John Saich and Mags Russell of Argyll#s Wild Biscuit productions.In  they collaborated on an album called More Like a River than a Road. These songs were associated with the Tlell River on Hai Gwaii in Canada. These tracks, with a selection of later collaborations, make up River to Sea from Tlell to Tiree. The title documents Sheila#s journey from the coast of Canada to Tiree, where the track All You Really Need is the Sea was written.This artist is probably best described as a folk blues singer. She has the sharply observing, descriptive eye of the classic singer songwriter troubadour and while her voice is given gravitas and character by time, she swings and has the timing of the blues singer.Wild Biscuit#s musical accompaniment gives Sheila#s characterful voice depth and presence. The menacing guitar on I#ve Waited a Long Time and the atmospheric double bass and keyboards on Where the Pebbles Grind and Scrape complement Cameron#s lyrics and singing.Remembering Mr Toast is an atmospheric and evocative, less bombastic or overblown Scottish Jim Morrison, finding real beauty in a melancholic memory. The delicate hesitant guitar and reflective lyrics continue on Don#t Sigh and Go on Then, beautul, bitter sweet country love songs. All You Really Need is the Sea and Deep and Real are spiritual songs, again moving between an intimate relationship to consider the huge landscape and the restorative natural world.Is it blues, country, easy listening, folk or poetry set to delicate sympathetic music  It doesn#t matter. Close your eyes, listen to Sheila#s rich voice, with its cadence and rhythm. Enjoy the flow of words and the pictures they conjure on this warm and captivating set of recordings."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll course draws skippers and compliments","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMid Argyll Radio Sailing put its toe in the water last Saturday when skippers arrived with their model radio controlled yachts from the club#s first competition.Several Scottish clubs # Ayr Bay Radio Yacht Club, Greenock, Rhu and Paisley # travelled to Mid Argyll joined by others from as far afield as the Preston area.A total of  yachts raced each other around the club#s Loch a Bahrain course near Cairnbaan.A steady wind from the south produced some exciting close encounters results and near misses.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

With the world championship they also secured the Champion of Champions accolade for the fourth year in a row.The band#s success has been remarkable since being formed with Inveraray  youngsters just  years ago by current leaders Pipe Major Stuart Liddell and lead drummer Steven McWhirter. The band rose rapidly through the ranks, winning the world title, and many others besides, at every grade in which it competed.Inveraray is now established as the Grade  band to beat and players are attracted from around the world # but regardless of its international make-up, Inveraray still lies at its heart.That fact was clearly in evidence as the reception was crowned by a magical performance by the world champions, enjoyed by all and captured for posterity on the many mobile phones raised to the heavens.Speaking as he presented the quaich, Councillor MacMillan congratulated the band on its success, achieved in a relatively short period of time thanks to the dedication of all concerned.Argyll and Bute MP Brenan O#Hara said the band#s success has been #absolutely remarkable# and quipped that Inveraray#s success had turned him into a #born-again piper#, so inspired has he been.Pipe Major Stuart Liddell, Inveraray born and bred and from a line of superb pipers, said: #I want to thank all band members for their hard work over the past several years, and of course their families who have put up with so much and made sacrices for it to happen # particularly those with young families. It is greatly appreciated.#He added: #Thanks to the town of Inveraray and everyone  who has supported us. We couldn#t have done it without you.#And it was on to a selection of brilliant tunes to entertain the adoring fans clustered around the green.Speaking after the event, Inveraray Community Council convenor Linda Divers said: #Thanks to everyone who came out to show their support to Inveraray and District Pipe Band, and to Councillor Donnie MacMillan for coming along tonight.#The community council would like to thank all helpers as well as the British Legion and the band for the use of their tents.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

It forms an integral part of the councilrsquos strategy to build on the investment already made in the Borders Railway, which currently terminates adjacent to the Lowood site in Tweedbank.ldquoThe council purchased the land following an appropriate investment appraisal process and the development of a detailed financial model, which followed the Treasuryrsquos lsquoGreen Bookrsquo best practice.ldquoCouncillors considered the business case in full and three specic reports in December , January  and May  prior to the purchase.ldquoThese reports included the necessary information on site valuations, now released publicly."},{"url":null,"title":"mp-lamont-join-cross-party-bid-get-eu-deal","story":"BORDERS MP John Lamont is joining a cross-party group set up to get a deal with the EU through Parliament.Around  Conservative, Labour and independent MPs launched lsquoMPs for a dealrsquo on Tuesday.And the memberfor Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk says he is signing up, in a bid to find an alternative to a no-deal Brexit.Explaining his decision, Mr Lamont said: ldquoI am a democrat, who was disappointed with the EU Referendum result.\"But I also think the result needs to be implemented and done so in a sensible way.\"Thatrsquos why Irsquom joining this cross-party group to get a deal approved by Parliament, get us out of the EU and move the country on.

Last weekend, we were fortunate to be invited to an orchard in East Lothian to pick some apples.As we entered Lewis stopped for a moment and said ldquoWow.He has seen apples growing on trees before, but I think it was the sight of so many apple trees together all in fruit. It was a visual feast, even for me.And so we picked some apples, in the company of a friend who uses local fruits to make juices. Lewis just couldnrsquot decide which apple tree to pick from first. He wandered about in awe, eyeing the apples.There were many ieties in the orchard, but I sadly canrsquot remember all their names.ldquoI think Lewis is in paradise, I remarked as I watched him.ldquoWhatrsquos paradise  asked my nearly six-year-old inquisitive daughter Skye. I had to think about my answer.ldquoSome people say itrsquos a perfect place, but other people say itrsquos a perfect feeling.ldquoCan be both then, maybe at the same time Skye replied.I smiled and agreed. We both watched Lewis, as he wondered under the small trees, dancing with delight at the sight of so many delicious looking ripe apples.ldquoYea said Skye, ldquoLewis is definitely having paradykes.ldquoWe say in paradise I said, in a bit of a teachery tone.ldquoBut you can have it too insisted Skye ldquobecause itrsquos a happy feeling.How could I disagree  ldquoYoursquore right I smiled.ldquoThis one Lewis called out. The apple was just out of reach and so his sister ran up and carefully picked it for him, in the way she had been shown. Lewis studied the apple before eating, savouring the moment.He was indeed both in, and having, paradise.We collected a small basket full of apples of dferent ieties, and after giving our thanks we started our walk back to the car. As we meandered along the path Skye asked for a story about an apple.So I told the story of Johnny Appleseed. Then a riddle ldquoA wee roond hoose, sometimes red, sometimes green, the maist bent lum ye hae ersquoer seen. Nae windaes or doors tae open or slide, it has a secret, therersquos a star inside.The answer of course is an apple. The bent lumbeing the stalk, and the star being the seed core when the apple is cut horizontally through the middle.As we walked, I reflected on the symbolism of the apple, and how it has been used in folklore and legend. And of course there is the famous apple which fell on Newtonrsquos head.Well it probably didnrsquot really fall on his head, as that seems a later embellishment, but for sure Newton himself often told the tale of the falling apple and the inspiration it gave him. He lived well into old age, and I think he understood the power of a story to convey the meaning of an event or idea.We approached our car and I took my sonrsquos hand to keep him safe as we crossed the road.ldquoDad he said looking up at me, ldquoyou are my walking apple.I laughed at the image and wondered what he meant. Was he referring to my rotund body shape perhaps ldquoWhy am I your walking apple  I asked him.ldquoCause I love apples and you are walking with me he said, with a sense of poetic meaning only a young child can convey.I was momentarily overwhelmed by this simple but moving comment. Lewis, aged only four, conveyed a powerful symbolism for apples that morning.The apple falling from the tree in front of Isaac Newton was a symbol of scientic discovery. For my son, an apple is a symbol of love. And my son loves the apples he eats, and the ones which walk with him.

This occurs when cats come in contact with chemicals such as fuels, lubricants and some solvents.Usually, self-grooming causes the cat to ingest the toxin, or in some cases they inhale it which can cause a severe pneumonia.The toxin can cause problems throughout the body and on the skin too.When Jonny had examined Tikka, he immediately sent her to our Tranent surgery for blood tests and intravenous fluids as she was dehydrated.Fortunately, Tikkarsquos blood tests were normal so she did not have kidney damage.She tolerated her fluid therapy well and was soon looking much happier however several areas of her skin had become red and she was losing hair especially on her front legs.Tikka did not want to eat or drink. She was given analgesics, antibiotics and soothing cream was applied to her skin.Our nursing staff ensured she was as comfortable as possible and as she was not eating by herself, they fed her via a feeding tube several times a day.Her skin became red and thickened and some areas sloughed off.She had to have cream applied frequently to the damaged skin, just asshe had suffered burns.Tikka was finally well enough to go home where Mrs Taylor continued to treat her skin. Tikka started eating well again and is improving daily. Her fur is regrowing and soon she will have her beautul coat again.Now Mrs Taylor was very vigilant and realised she had to do something to help Tikka immediately.If you suspect your cat may have had contact with petroleum-based substances, please contact your vet as soon as possible.Often the first sign you may have is your pet smells of petrol or diesel.There may be vomiting or diarrhoea. They may actually be dizzy or confused or showing other neurological problems such as staggering and trembling. There may be respiratory signs such as coughing or wheezingthey have inhaled the chemical.Do not try to make your pet vomit as this can exacerbate the toxicity.The first thing you should do is try to remove the chemical from the fur.In many cases, it is best to bring your pet straight to your vets as soon as possible. The nursing staff at veterinary practices are well trained in dealing with intoxication emergencies.With petroleum products there are three main areas where the body can be affected: l The internal organs especially the kidneys, so your vet will want to blood sample your pet to check for any damage to the kidneys or other organsl The respiratory system can be affected especiallythe toxin is inhaled. This often happensthe patient vomits then inhales some resulting in a very severe pneumonia. Your vet may wish to take x-rays to check for this.l The animalrsquos skin can also be affected. The petroleum products sit on the fur then soaks through to the skin where they are held in contact by the fur. This causes them to act as a caustic substance, damaging the skin and hair follicles. Often the first sign before the skin damage is seen is hair loss due to the follicle damage.The treatment for these causes is supportive at all times. There are no specic antidotes. Intravenous fluids are administered, this helps overcome dehydration and helps eliminate toxins from the body.Analgesics are given to help keep pain from damaged skin and internal organs to a minimum.Antibiotics are given, as damaged skin is very prone to secondary infection and they are always givenpneumonia is present. Skin treatment has to be intense to keep infection to a minimum and encourage damaged skin to recover.Thankfully Tikka has made an excellent recovery, thanks to Mrs Taylorrsquos quick thinking and the intense nursing care given by the nursing team at Dunedin Vets."},{"url":null,"title":"tim-39-s-tales-magic-real-39-s-around-us","story":"Of course, in stories magic is very real a frog or beast can transform into a prince, dragons and witches can fly, animals can talk, wishes can be granted by faeries and spells cast by wizards. Anything is possible in a story.But thatrsquos just in stories eh  Itrsquos not real magic.Well lets us imagine for a moment that we actually did live in the world of a story that animals could really talk and a frog could transform into a prince with a kiss, that dragons and witches flew in the sky, animals spoke to us and wishes could be granted by magical creatures and spells cast.If we lived in this story world then wersquod soon take all this magic for granted. Wersquod stop noticing it, or even commenting on it.We wouldnrsquot see it as magic or unusual because it would be everyday stuff.ldquoYea yea, there goes another dragon come on wersquore late, yes that man used to be a frog, yes that wizard makes spells and that woman can make wishes come true, so what. Donrsquot speak to that squirrel wersquove no time to talk.But of course we do live in a magic world, a world just as magical as any story world. Itrsquos just that we have stopped noticing the magic that is real.In our world, a frog may not turn into a prince with a kiss, but a caterpillar turns into a butterfly, a tadpole into a frog.And such magic is all around us. Leaves change colour with the seasons, magic transformation is everywhere. Animals do talk, any dog lover will tell us that.Have you ever seen a hare and made eye contact and felt the connection or watched a squirrel hide nuts, and then come up to you asking for more Walk in a wood, or by a riverbank, or just sit in your garden or a park and the magic is all around you. We watched wood pigeons nest in a small elder tree outside our front window over the summer. Two eggs hatched and we watched as they were fed and finally flew the nest. It was, truly, magic.The magic all around us is still vast, and we could all make our own list the sound of birdsong, watching a butterfly flutter, a spiderrsquos web decorated with dew, the glimpse of a deer in a wood, the mist wrapped mountains, a red sparkling cloud during sunset, a wee beastie under a rock as it scampers for cover, the whisper of an ancient tree and the sweet smell of a wood.But I believe that sadly too many of us donrsquot notice real magic anymore.And when we donrsquot notice something we donrsquot feel connected to it, so we donrsquot care about it. And when we donrsquot care about it we donrsquot protect or value it.And when we donrsquot value it, we canrsquot feel the wonder and sense of awe it creates. And so we trash it, ignore and neglect it, exploit it. And we forget we are part of this magic that we are sons and daughters of nature too. And so we disconnect ourselves from what can truly make us feel happy, and instead drug ourselves with the articial magic of our own technology which makes us feel all powerful.But the truth is we are not.Ultimately we rely on the natural environment for our physical and emotional well-being, as much as the creatures we are making extinct.We need nature, it doesnrsquot need us, and eventually it is in control. Asto make this point huge waves hit the rocks of Prestonpans in a storm not so long ago, drenching the nearby houses in a display of naturersquos power. It was scary but also spectacular.In  such a storm was believed to have been the result of magic conjured by the ldquoNorth Berwick Witches.That storm, like the recent one, was indeed magic, conjured by nature, which can whip up a whirlwind more effectively than any wizard or witch.Magic is real.

They are notorious for feeding on clothing and natural fibres, especially wool, fur, silk, feathers, felt, and leather. These materials contain keratin, a fibrous protein that the worm-like larvae of the clothes moth can digest.

Because desflurane has a much more profoundly deleterious effect on the environment, in most situations it makes sense to choose sevoflurane.In surgeries that require a long anaesthetic, desflurane is the better choice because it is released from a patientrsquos body more quickly than the lower carbon alternative - allowing them to wake up more quickly.:Glasgow moots climate bondsDr Gallagher added: ldquoWhat wersquove tried to is make sure all our anaesthetic colleagues make an informed choice when theyrsquore deciding which one to use andthey do use desflurane it is because of sound clinical reasons and not just because itrsquos there.Other options to put patients to sleep include intravenous anaesthetics, which have even less impact on the environment.It has been estimated that one bottle of desflurane emits the same amount of co - one tonne- as a daily  mile round trip made by car for  weeks of the year.A recent study, published in The Lancet Planetary Health journal, highlights the potential for reducing emissions in health care settings and, at the same time, potentially reducing costs. Emissions due to anaesthetic gases accounted for approximately , tonnes of COe at two North American sites ndash ten-fold higher than the anaesthetic gas emissions from the UK hospital. The authors say this is largely the result of a higher usage of desflurane in the two North American hospitals.Dr Stephen Young, consultant anaesthetist, said ldquoThis is a really signicant environmental change, with a carbon dioxide equivalent reduction of  less cars commuting to the hospital every day. We have done this whilst maintaining high standards of anaesthetic care to our patients.ldquoIt has been estimated that five per cent of carbon dioxide equivalentemissions from acute hospitals are due to the use of inhalational agents. This is equivalent to around half the CO used to heat all hospital buildings and water.ldquoThis is just one of the areas in which NHSGGC is driving forward a focus on sustainability and making a dference to its carbon footprint.Dr Cathy Lawson is the National Fellow for Sustainable Anaesthesia for the Association of Anaesthetists and the Centre for Sustainable Health Care in collaboration with the Newcastle Upon Tyne hospitals.In her role, Dr Lawson works towards implementing sustainable systems within anaesthesia, encouraging doctors and hospitals to consider their environmental footprint by considering alternatives to established practices.One of the initiatives devised by the fellowship is to build the Environmental Champions Network comprised of one anaesthetist volunteer from every hospital in the UK and Ireland so that information can be shared.Dr Lawson said: ldquoWe know that people are starting to embed sustainability and sustainable projects within anaesthesia and therersquos been some really great work done and some really good ideas.ldquoWhat we hope the network will achieve is to help promote the work that people have done locally on a national scale so that people can see what projects have happened around the country and think they could do them too.Eventually, the network will be used to collect national data sets and get more information from hospitals so the fellowship can work on more concrete data and less estimates.Dr Lawson said: ldquoIf we have more accurate data we can get more accurate values of carbon foot-printing from some of our areas of practice that we know are high carbon impact.She echoes Dr Gallagher by saying that patient safety must always come first, and that will sometimes mean using less the sustainable desflurane gas.There are other initiatives being investigated that can lower emissions including recycling schemes and waste distribution. Dr Lawson said: ldquoAnaesthetics and theatres are a really resource intensive area of a hospital with lots of staff, lots of equipment, we use a lot of medication and we use a lot of water, energy and light.ldquoAs an industry, wersquore really trying to step up in terms of sustainability and looking at the products that are coming into the supply chain and in hospitals in the first place.

Foraging programmes of events will also take place across Forth Valley and Lomond, and in Fe.Throughout the festival,participants foraged for and learn about medicinal plants, how to cook with wild ingredients and indulge in feasts made from foraged food.As well as fungi hunts, hedgerow and wildflower walks, the Lanarkshire programme offeredforagers the chance to explore Kirkfieldbank Community Orchard, where more than  trees have been planted by Clyde Valley Orchards Cooperative Limited, which represents the remaining apple growers in the area.The event, according to the organisationrsquos director Duncan Arthur, who lead the walk, aimed to highlight a lost age of apple-growing and attempts to keep alive a flavour of some of the arearsquos apple industry and its social impact.The valley, he says, was once richly decorated with the sweet-smelling blossoms and fruits of countless trees.ldquoApples in Scotland go away back to Roman times when they were introduced, but their hey day was about  years ago when there was a marked increase in the land given over to orchards, he says.ldquoThey grew Victoria plums which suited area well. Scottrsquos jam-makers were in Carluke, and crops of gooseberries were used for their pectin to make strawberry jam.ldquoThere were strawberries, soft fruits, damsons, and then came plums, apples and pears.Hundreds of orchards sprung up in large estates, delivering fruit to jam producers and markets. At the dawn of the th century, there were more than  hectares of commercial orchards throughout the Clyde and Avon Valley.Growers had found the valleyrsquos sheltered slopes, well-drained soils and moderate rainfall ideal for fruit growing. While the location - handy for large areas of population ndash meant they could easily transport their stock to fruit markets and shops.However the closure of railways followed by the s arrival of supermarkets with their demands for perfect-shaped fruits, cheaper imports, changing demand for sweeter, crisper, prettier fruit, saw many orchards wither and the land go fallow.The apple industry, which as well as providing jobs and income to the area brought cultural aspects in songs, stories and art, crumbled.A recent study of  of Clyde Valleyrsquos orchards sites found just over half were still intact, covering an area of just over  hectares. But while there was still signicant fruit grown in the area, most was not used, with around ha of orchard lost or abandoned.Of the trees that remained, many were aged with most orchards found to have less than  trees remaining.However an effort by the Co-operative has led to new trees being planted in private orchards and the Kirkgatefield Community Orchard Juice from the crops is now collected and sold to help fund further planting.However, Mr Arthur adds that the notion of the area once again providing signicant input to the nationrsquos apple harvest is unlikely.ldquoOur overall objective is tothe character and environmental benefits that came with the orchards and not lose any more of what were traditional orchards to development and neglect.ldquoDferent native ieties of apples is a nice thing to have, but what is really important to the area and the environment is to have trees which support other things like pollination, bugs, fungus and mosses.According to Wendy Barrie, cook and publisher of the Scottish Food Guide, the loss of much of Scotlandrsquos apple heritage has impacted on the way we cook as well as eat.ldquoScotland was world-famous for our apples and the orchards in places like Clyde Valley as well as at Newburgh in Fe and the Carse of Gowrie between Perth and Dundee, supplied an incredible range of ieties.ldquoWhat we get the supermarkets today is poor in comparison, she says.The bountul crops found their way into countless dishes, relishes and jams which helped add flavour to Scotsrsquo plates long after the last apple had been picked.ldquoBack in days gone by we didnrsquot have lemons from Sicily to provide flavour and sharpness, and apples were an important part of cooking, she adds.ldquoThey also provided pectin as a jellying agent for jams, and there were many uses for the apples they grew.She adds: ldquoTherersquos no one answer as to why our orchards have gone. Supermarkets, world trade, we import cheap appeals from New Zealand and France, while we could be growing our own. ldquoldquoWe need to keep heritage ieties alive."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10416810.jpg?type=article-full","title":"doug-allens-life-lens","story":"But despite his globe-trotting adventure, Fe-born wildle camera Doug Allan believes his native country remains one the most beautul in the world and the perfect place to learn how to e.And he says that his homeland is ahead of England in terms of tackling the issue of single-use plastics, one of two big problems facing the planet.Mr Allan, originally from Dunfermline, has travelled the world working on TV series including Blue Planet and Frozen Planet.The Scottish Government has made a commitment to ban plastic straws by the end of the year, while also introducing a depositscheme for some drinks containers.Speaking before another trip to the Arctic to film, the -year-old, who now lives in England, said the devolved Government in his homeland was ldquoahead of the curve.Doug films a whaleHe said: ldquoWersquove got two big issues that have been highlights recently.ldquoDavid Attenborough in Blue Planet  undoubtedly brought plastics to the forefront, which was a huge thing that needed to be done.:Floating Antarctic ice goes from record high to record lowsldquoThere are now Government initiatives to stop so much waste, but also to develop new plastics, which will be totally biodegradable or totally recyclable so that we donrsquot end up just ditching so much.ldquoThe Scottish Government in particular are ahead of the curve in terms of bringing in bottle deposits, all that sort of thing, and banning single-use plastics, straws.

A voting democracy is a secret society of iniduals. I, who voted to remain in the EU, will be continuing to feel aggrieved that we are leaving due to the misinformed views of only % of the electorate, who were foolish enough to believe the lie painted on the side of a bus. It is no use pleading they didnrsquot know Brexit would be like this when most didnrsquot know anything about the consequences at all.The whole shambles of Brexit has brought to the table the need for a more sophisticated format for informing the public and then determining what is really the will of the people.Bill Brown, Milngavie.WITH every passing day and twist and turn of this seemingly interminable nightmare of Brexit, Theresa Mayrsquos three times voted-down deals look ever more reasonable and attractive.

All energy consumers pay for the cost of investment in new network capacity so the regulator ensures that it obtains the best deal possible for them.Ofgem launched a consultation in December last year on proposed changes to SSEN’s plan in an effort to ensure value for money for consumers.Following consideration of consultation responses and further analysis, the regulator has decided to approve the plan subject to the conditions set out in its decision.Approval is conditional on a total of at least MW of new wind farm projects on Orkney either being awarded a Contract for Dferenceor being judged likely to be developed by December .Ofgem would expect to be satisfied that new wind farm projects are likely to be developed despite not being awarded a CfDan independent audit states that the project is financially viable, has signed a relevant grid connection agreement and has been granted planning permission.However, SSEN has stated disappointment that the regulator is maintaining its position that the MW of new renewable electricity generation needs to secure planning permission and demonstrate financial viability prior to granting approval for the construction of the link.Ofgem has extended the date in which developers need to meet these conditions from December  to December . SSEN has said this means, in turn, that the construction of the transmission link may be delayed for at least a two-year period,the full time is required to secure the MW target, or shorterthe need is met at an earlier stage.SSEN’s Transmission and Distribution businesses now intend to consult with Orkney developers and other stakeholders to help establish the optimal #whole system# solution in an effort to make the most of Orkney’s renewable potential.Talking about Ofgem#s decision, Rob McDonald, managing director for transmission with SSEN, said: “Whilst we are clearly disappointed with today’s decision, our commitment to work with Orkney developers and other stakeholders to unlock Orkney’s vast renewable potential has not changed.“With both the UK and Scottish Government committed to net zero emissions, we firmly believe Orkney and Scotland’s other two major island groups will have a key role to play in the fight to prevent the worst effects of climate change.“We now look forward to working with developers and other stakeholders on Orkney to collectively explore the best way forward to unlock Orkney’s renewable potential.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We havenrsquot landed on firm conclusions but that conversation is under way, she said.Sinn Fein, the SDLP, Alliance and the Green Party have all said publicly they are willing to explore options for the upcoming election to maximise the number of pro-Europe MPs in Westminster to vote against any possible no-deal Brexit plans.copy -.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree.

Launched officially on July , it was a case of getting straight down to business! The volunteers cover quite a large area, including Broughshane, Kells, Ballymena and the surrounding rural local areas.The group has  volunteers, however by August it had responded to  purple and red incidents in support of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service.This translates into  inidual responses. The group prefers to send more than one responder to each patient in case their needs are beyond the capacity of a single person. Cardiac arrest is a case in point and while only three of patients have been in this specic condition, many more have been suffering from chest pain.Responders grow in experience and expertise, with the group aiming to have an experienced person at each incident to support them. The four committee members have ided this task between them.The more active members are learning fast, particularly through their exposure to NIAS crews and rapid response paramedics, who have been patient and helpful with them.The group held their second monthly members meeting and training event at the end of August and used this to reflect on their experiences, share what they had learned and build vital patient care competence.More members are needed and they are asking people to get in touchthey want to volunteer. Working with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service and Dalriada Urgent Care, there is a planning and training programme organised for January soyou are interested check the group out on Facebook.The group posted recently: “One thing has become clear in the course of our first month’s activity -we need to recruit and train more responders. “We are working with NIAS on dates for another training course and this will determine our recruitment timetable.”A spokesperson added: “We owe huge thanks to those who made our new service possible.“The people and organisations who contributed so generously to help us meet our funding needs.“The NIAS Community Resuscitation Development Team, who guided us through the complexities of setting up the scheme, trained our members for us and continue to support us.“The Governance team at Dalriada Urgent Care, who supported us in our recruitment efforts and other vital matters such as insurance.“The front line staff of NIAS who have supported and guided us on scene.“And, last but certainly not least, our volunteers, who continue to give the community their time and newly-acquired expertise and to meet their new challenges with great resilience and good humour.“Its a privilege to work with you.”Follow the Braid Valley Community First Responders on Facebook to keep up to date with all their news and to see how you can become involved.

Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces.

In truth, the margin of defeat flattered St John’s who, for the second game running, failed to fire.They got out of jail at the weekend when an injury-time Pearse Donnelly goal almost plundered an unlikely victory before Conal Delargy kicked the equaliser. The general consensus was that Casements had missed the boat and that the Johnnies would win the replay, but Portglenone boss Barry Dillon said he knew his players could better Sunday’s performance. “We sat back too deep on Sunday, it was our own fault,” said Dillon. “Maybe the fear of winning made them a bit apprehensive, but we knew we had more in us. “In the first half of the drawn game, we showed we are the better team and we had that belief coming into this game that we could go and finish it.” While Portglenone fielded an unchanged team from Sunday’s drawn game, St John’s started Domhnall Nugent, Brian ‘Bam’ Neeson and Sunday’s goal-scorer Donnelly. Yet, as was the case on Sunday, it was Casements who made the brighter start with a hat-trick of frees from Conal Delargy and Ronan Kellyhelping them establish a - to no score lead after a cagey opening  minutes. It took the Johnnies  minutes to open their account following a well-worked move finished by Matthew Fitzpatrick, but Paddy Kelly responded in kind for Portglenone minutes later. Peter McCallin got his side’s second score on  minutes with St John’s struggling to break down a well-organised Portglenone defence. The Whiterock Road men then lost Donnelly to a black card and Delargy converted another free to move his side - to - ahead. When Kieron McKenna added another from play, Portglenone looked in a strong position approaching half-time and a Paddy McBride free with the last kick of the half was badly needed by the under-par West Belfast outfit. The second half was just four minutes old when Portglenone cut a dash through the heart of the St John’s defence to score a brilliant goal with full-forward Michael Donnelly firing past Padraig Nugent. Less than a minute later, St John’s hit back with a goal of their own. Having been off-target with a few efforts from frees,Neeson’s fortunes changed when an attempt at a point dipped under the crossbar and beyond the reach of Portglenone goalkeeper Ryan O’Neill. That should have been the catalyst for St John’s to kick on, but instead it was Portglenone who regained control of proceedings as another Delargy score moved them four clear once more. St John’s continued to squander chances at the other end with Neesonand Fitzpatrick firing wide of the posts. McBride converted a free before Dermot McAleese broke forward to score for Casements. Ryan McNulty landed a stunning point from play with  minutes of normal time remaining, yet their hopes of another rousing comeback were dented when they lost centre-forward Conal Kelly to a second booking. McBride briefly reduced the gap to two points while Nugent was forced to make a great save to deny Niall McKeever at the other end. Michael Kelly scored an excellent point moments after his introduction for Portglenone and a Ronan Kelly free gave them a four-point cushion approaching full-time. Rather than sit back and defend their lead as they did last Sunday, Dillon’s men went for the jugular and further points from McKeever and midfielder Fergal O’Kane put them six clear. There was one last surge from St John’s with Michael Bradley’s sideline being fisted into the net by Fitzpatrick deep into stoppage time and the Antrim star had a second goal-bound shot blocked with the final play of the game. Yet Portglenone were the better team over the two games and they progress to a semi-final meeting with Lámh Dhearg on Saturday, September  at Creggan.

For Martin Moreland, Principal of Mercy College, it was very dferent indeed.Born on the Ormeau Road in South Belfast, Martin was the youngest of six children. Having left school with no exams, Martin’s road to the classroom and education sector began as an engineer.“I never really thought I would be a teacher because I never had the confidence to be one,” he explained.“It was a dream in a sense but I never really thought it would be a reality.“I left secondary school with no exams. I went out into the world of work – it gives you a lot of le experiences or the real world as I call it.“I went into engineering and had several jobs. My we has a job in education and she told me about a course up in Derry that gave you access into university. I went and got a GCSE in English and Maths and spent three years up in Derry doing the course.Martin was accepted into St Mary’s University College and after his first teaching job in West Belfast, has moved to the North of the city.“With my engineering background, my first job was a Technology and Design teacher in St Colm’s in Twinbrook and I spent  years there. I loved it there, it was a great community and a school that was thriving.“I moved on to Mercy where there was just  kids. I started off as a teacher before becoming Principal and I’ve been in the role for ten years.”Martin then reflected on the many changes in education over the years, not least the challenges and successes of Mercy College.“When I came in, it was about building up confidence and profile of the school, given our location in North Belfast.“Pupil numbers now are  but our challenges now is very much to do with space and classrooms.“We have been co-educational for a few years now which is fantastic. We have a   ratio girls and boys in Year . Our LLS programme is still really successful and we were the first school to start that.“The standards are amazing – % of girls are getting three A-Levels from A* to C which is very unique. % of our GCSE students got five GCSE’s at the top grades and there are not many other schools in the North that can boast such results.“Finances remain a huge challenge for us. There is no room for any extra money in the system. It is not easy at all.”Away from school, Martin is kept a busy man being a father of ten children.“I am a family man. I am a father-of-ten so at home it is a very busy household, with the kids ranging from  to .“I am very much an outdoor person. I like nature and sunshine. I am also big into running and gardening. With my technology background, I like a project such as a pond or a patio to keep me entertained.”As for the future, Martin is content at Mercy College but would love no more than see a new building for the school in his working le.“I am  now and I suppose you start to think about how many more years I can give in education.“I probably have another ten years in me. I am happy at Mercy College – there are so many challenges every year.“I really want to see our newbuild come for the school which is in the pipeline – just need Stormont up and running to approve it.“The future of the school is very bright. There is a lot of work still to be done to maintain our standards and results and improve facilities for the kids.“"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"meabh set to sing the anthem at croke park","story":"AN Under- Lámh Dhearg footballer will perform Amhrán na bhFiann in front of thousands of GAA fans on Sunday ahead of the Dublin -Galway All-Ireland Senior Ladies Football Final. -year-old Méabh McNeill told Daily Belfast that she is “super excited” to be singing in front of up , fans at Croke Park ahead of the finale to the ladies football season. “When I was seven myself and my brother went to Scéim Samhraidh at our club, Lámh Dhearg,” she said. “One of the events was learning and singing the national anthem.

This is the frustrating thing.”Stormont has been in cold storage for more than two and half years due to a stand-off between Sinn Fein and the DUP on issues such as Irish language legislation and a ban on same sex marriage.Hopes for a new set of talks were sparked following the funeral of murdered journalist Lyra McKee in April, but Ms McDonald said that although talks are ongoing, nothing substantial is expected any time soon.“We still are in a situation where the DUP are not demonstrating the necessary appetite to embrace solutions to issues to get the assembly back up and running, and neither are the British Government in terms of restoring powersharing or indeed agreeing or embracing the backstop to protect the island of Ireland,” Ms McDonald added.“Not being unkind to the man– the reality is that any British secretary of state or Tory coming here… they don’t have the same skin in the game in terms of Irish interests that other people who have been elected here have.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Conor Murphy Ms McDonald said some points were discussed with Mr Smith, but these did not include whether the DUP would accept a Northern Ireland-only backstop, as had been reported in the last few days.“I don’t know is the short answer,” she said.“I have heard the speculation that they will revert to those provisions but certainly the Secretary of State hasn’t given us that impression, much less confirmed that.“We told himhe has any notion to misuse the institutions in the North as a bargaining chip or buffer in that then he’s barking up the wrong tree.”Sinn Fein said it is looking any upcoming general election at Westminster as “an opportunity for all of us to show that Northern Ireland voted to remain”.Ms McDonald did not rule out having the party stand aside in the hotly contested South Belfast seat for another pro-remain candidate to take a greater share of the vote against the incumbent DUP MP.“We will look at every possible and plausible mechanism to maximise the pro-remain vote. We haven’t landed on firm conclusions but that conversation is under way,” she said.Sinn Fein, the SDLP, Alliance and the Green Party have all said publicly they are willing to explore options for the upcoming election to maximise the number of pro-Europe MPs in Westminster to vote against any possible no-deal Brexit plans."},{"url":null,"title":"film of ira bomb gang emerges in bbc ni documentary","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There are other guys in Derry who are on the edge of that, the problem with this is and Declan Morgan was right, there is a human cost, a psychological cost, a physical cost.“People are getting their hopes built up thinking something is going to happen and then they’re deflated again, you can only pull yourself up so many times.“I’m having dficulty pulling myself up week by week, to continue fighting this, and it would be a hell of a lot more dficult for people who aren’t aware of the detail and the argument that goes into getting this far.”For victims it is about much more than monetary compensation, that comes secondary to an apology from the state and institutions responsible and a package that enables them to move on with their lives in a better way – which includes appropriate healthcare and support.Last Friday, Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland Sir Declan Morgan said it was \"shocking\" that victims are still awaiting action.He revealed that before Sir Anthony Harte, who chaired the Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry, died, he had expressed \"profound disappointment\" at the lack of progress.Sir Declan said it \"epitomises how the lack of an assembly impacts negatively on the lives of Northern Irelands citizens\".‘Absolute disgrace’The Historical Institutional Abuse Redress Bill was listed amongst parliament business on Monday but was not dealt with because of prorogation.Mr McCourt believes the suspension of parliament by Prime Minister Boris Johnson has essentially “killed off” the Redress Bill.“To all intents and purposes the Redress Bill is killed off. If the legislation is not passed and hasn’t gone through the House of Lords and received the royal seal of approval then it is killed off.“The fact that it hasn’t been dealt with at this stage is an absolute disgrace, Declan Morgan is right to bring it back up again.“Even at this point they are still talking about it being a devolved matter, the hope of having this dealt with through the NI Assembly does not exist, the only avenue for this to go forward is through Westminster.\"Speaking at Westminster on Tuesday, Independent Unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon said she was \"extremely annoyed and disgusted\" that the motion to discuss historical abuse in NI wasnt even moved because of prorogation.\"By proroguing parliament tonight, the Prime Minister has wilfully and deliberately deprived victims of a -minute debate. He has sent out a clear signal that those victims to not even merit a debate.“It’s appalling, I ask the Secretary of State to demand that the Prime Minister comes to NI, sits at the meeting and looks the victims of HIA in the face and explains to them why he is so disrespectful and discourteous of the hurt and the suffering that they have had to endure.”Unexpected and emergency debates were to blame, Julian Smith explained, and he apologised for the change in business which he said “in no way diminishes how seriously I’m progressing the issues or affected the commitments I have made.”Mr Smith said officials have prepared the policy and lawyers the draft law and he has asked that it be included in the Queen’s speech as a matter of urgent priority.He was however challenged about why legislation hasn’t been brought forward and was told that the state is failing victims yet again.Scotland’s progressIn Scotland their inquiry is ongoing, the report is not written, but the Scottish First Minister has instructed the civil service to initiate an advanced payment scheme. Anyone over  years of age or with a terminal illness can now apply for an award of £, – which is not their full and final settlement.Some child migrants who were taken from homes in Northern Ireland and shipped off to Australia have also received payments.Mr McCourt believes the same could have been done for victims in Northern Irelandthere had been the political will to do it.The HIA inquiry studied allegations of abuse in  homes and other residential institutions between  to .These were run by the state, local authorities, the Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland and the children’s charity Barnardo’s. The largest number of complaints related to four Catholic-run homes.A report in  recommended that victims should receive compensation, however, the process of securing compensation stalled when devolution collapsed in the same week.After a four-year Inquiry and over two and a half years since the publication of the report, the government has still failed to deliver a promised apology and financial redress.In recent weeks Secretary of State for NI, Julian Smith, gave assurances to victims that a Redress Bill would be fast-tracked through Westminster.

Members were told that a key element of this innovation project was the provision of mechanism to support the transfer of skills and expertise to company staff and university students.Personalised MedicineIn relation to the prioritisation of the Future Fund of £m and the further anticipated match funding from NI Government and other partners, the emphasis is on advancing with projects such as the Graduate Medical School as a key catalyst for the much-needed expansion of the Ulster University Magee Campus. The delivery of a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellenceat Ulster University and Altnagelvin is also a priority for this fund as is the provision of an integrated, Council-wide, multi-skills employment pathways intervention support programme.The report advised that work on these innovation projects as well as the proposed SMART and digital city projects were advancing in close collaboration with local industry and partners and relevant government departments, while the strategic outline cases for major regeneration projects for Derry City and Strabane Town Centre are at an advanced stage of progress.The Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence intends on harnessing the power of Genomics to predict and diagnose inherited and acquired disease, and to personalise treatments and interventions.The Ulster University representatives said it will expand its partnership with Genomics Ireland and other commercial enterprises to sequence the genomes of % of NI’s population contributing to a research database that can be interrogated to develop personalised medicine solutions with worldwide application and valuable I.P. and how it will also contribute to health improvement locally through a unique ‘community buy-in’ approach.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOVxcXC8wOVxcXC8wOTEyMTkwNlxcXC9TVFJBQkFORS1ERVZJQ0UtLnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjo2NDcsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjozNDAsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2NhY2hlLnJlc2l6ZWQuY29cXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6IjhlOTFmNGZjY2ExNDE2YjZiOGFkN2MwMzExOGY0ZWQ0NThmOWJlMmIifQ==/strabane-device.png","title":"security operation creggan area derry following discovery mortar device strabane","story":"District Commander Superintendent Gordon McCalmont said: \"It is our assessment that the New IRA is responsible for the mortar device that was discovered outside homes in Church View Close in Strabane on Saturday morning th September.

The proposed new school will also be in the trusteeship of the De La Salle Congregation.St Patrickrsquos Grammar has maintained its opposition to the merger proposal since it was muted in , while both De La Salle and St Maryrsquos support the merger.Mr Joe McCann, St Patrickrsquos Grammar principal, said he is ldquodisappointed that an apparent EA source had broken the news of the merger plan locally before his and the other schools were formally notied.St Patrickrsquos parent body mdash The Parents and Friends Associationmdash said that it will ldquovehemently fight these proposals with every means necessary, through the courts and, unfortunately, in the media.PFA spokesperson, Cormac Artt, criticised the EA on how the news was leaked ahead of the schools being notied last Thursday and the argument that local children will be educated together and the likelihood of capital funding for a single-site school build.Mr Artt continued: ldquoThis proposal cites an enrolment of  pupils and alleges that this yearly intake will be made up of up to % who will be admitted by academic selection.ldquoHowever, the census figures suggest thatall those who live within a three-mile radius and those for whom the school is the nearest Catholic grammar are admitted automatically without sitting the GL entrance assessment, there will be very few,any, places for those applicants seeking admission via academic selection.Mr Artt suggested that the outworking of this means that the rural communities and primary schools who have been an integral part of the grammar schoolrsquos -year history, will no longer have a place in this proposed super school, including those in Teconnaught, Loughinisland, Strangford, Kilclief, Dundrum, the Ards peninsula, Castlewellan and Newcastle.ldquoThe choice for boys in these areas who wish an academically selective education will therefore be travel to Newry or Belfast to try to secure a selective grammar school place in Catholic schools that are already heavily oversubscribed, he said.ldquoThe alternative for those who wish to keep the tradition and connection with Downpatrick will be to attend the state academically selective, Down High School. Aside from the injustice of this on the rural communities, is the impact this will have on families.While the EA said that the proposals have ldquoalready been subject to formal stakeholder consultation with parents, staff, governors and pupils, Mr Artt disputed that.ldquoParents of students from St Patrickrsquos Grammar requested a meeting with the De La Salle Trustees in April to discuss the Trusteesrsquo vision going forward. They finally responded in June by refusing to meet the parents citing rsquoit is not clear what,anything, will be gained by a meeting,rsquo which clearly makes the parents think that they do not care about the pupils of the school where they are Trustees.ldquoThe Board of Governors, staff and parents are overwhelmingly opposed to this proposal and for the De La Salle Trustees, who are the only stakeholder supporting this vision, to refuse to speak to the current parents is a disgrace.De La Salle principal, Ciaran Maguire, said he was ldquodelighted to see the proposal going to full public consultation.He told the Recorder: ldquoItrsquos been a long time coming. I am reassured now that the families of the greater Downpatrick area will have an opportunity to finally get behind the vision to secure the town as a model of good practice, where childrenrsquos education is a priority.ldquoThe De La Salle Congregation have been working on bringing post primary education in Downpatrick into the st century. In , they first proposed that St Patrickrsquos Grammar should become a co-educational school.ldquoThe Department of Education at the time wanted to see a proposal that was reflective and inclusive of all schools in the Downpatrick area. That advice was taken by the De La Salle congregation and they have been working, in partnership, on a solution to ensure that all children in the greater Downpatrick area have an education system that they can be proud of.Mr Maguire said the origin of the transfer test ldquowas a solution to a problem back then, suggesting the problem is dferent now and a new solution is needed.He added: ldquoWhat we need now for our children is something radical and exciting for all those involved. If we are the child-centred schools we say we are, then this is undeniably the right thing to do, not just for my pupils, but for the St Maryrsquos girls and St Patrickrsquos boys.Mr Maguire contended that while some may see the proposal as ldquoas an attempt to wipe out a schoolrsquos history and tradition, itrsquos an opportunity for them to continue their great work in preparing our children for le.He said that it will cater for all children from the local feeder schools, without the fear of having to sit and possibly fail a test.Mr Maguire added: ldquoWe are removing barriers those same barriers that our children currently struggle with, the fear and anxiety of not fitting in, not being good enough.

Over the past three years Irish Lights has proactively engaged with the local community and relevant state agencies to establish the best approach to the site. he continued.ldquoWe have now developed and tested new technology to achieve a sustainable solution that will enable retention of the historic lens and sweeping beam at St. Johnrsquos Point. I look forward to meeting with the community to discuss these plans in more detail.The Lecale Lightkeepers say that while they accept there is some concession on CILrsquos part in proposing to keep the sweeping beam at the lighthouse, they have been informed by the Commissioner that the range of the beam will be reduced by up to nine miles. They also claim that the beamrsquos iconic ldquoloom will be lost, robbing the lighthouse of what they describe as its ldquointangible heritage.A spokesperson for campaigners said that through their freedom of information requests for communication between CIL and others, they have found a ldquolack of appreciation for the intangible heritage of lighthouses and a disregard of the views of coastal communities.ldquoWe have seen examples of modernised lights and none have retained their original characteristics. The new light source proposed for St Johnrsquos Point would be an LED which, in itself is suspect, as according to the Royal Society Publication April , LEDs have detrimental effects on Epaunal Marine Communities.Campaigners say Newry Mourne and Down Council has already voted unanimously to protect the sweeping beamrsquos current mechanism and trustsrsquos that CIL will not be given planning permission to proceed with its proposal.ldquoThe lighthouse is a listed building and its character, the light, must be protected, declared the campaignersrsquo spokesperson.ldquoWith the loss of the historic lights at Fastnet, Mew and Tory it is even more vital that St Johnrsquos Point should be kept for heritage purposes.

He showed great promise as a soccer player, playing locally for Ballynahinch Olympic and catching the eye of Norwich City.Well-liked and respected, and much loved, Katie says that her family never realised that Mark was suffering with mental health issues.Katie said: ldquoMark was an extremely engaging young man who got an A in his  plus. We called him the brain box of the family, teasing him about going to the grammar school which after the eight of us, that was quite a novelty.ldquoOur wee manrsquos funeral was one of the largest ever seen in Ballynahinch and held on New Yearrsquos Eve. If he only knew how much he was loved. It was truly heartbreaking.ldquoWhy, why, why was our overwhelming thoughts  Before Mark died, we had rarely heard of the word suicide. Now, sadly, any of us would struggle to speak to anyone who hasnrsquot been affected in some way.ldquoMark was outwardly a happy young man, who always had a smile on his face. He was always laughing and his friends knew him as Quinny. He loved his family and friends.Katie said that Mark was buried in his Olympic strip and his jersey number  was retired by the club shortly afterwards.Ballynahinch Olympic has continued to honour Mark every year at their awards night presenting the Mark Quinn memorial cup to the young player of the year.Katie has also made a plea for those who feel le is a struggle to talk to someone.She said: ldquoIf anyone reading this is struggling, please let someone know. Talking can make all the dference, we wish we knew then what we know now.ldquoThe pain and devastating reality of living without your son, brother, nephew or uncle truly causes physical pain. But there is also help in dealing with the loss of someone to suicide. In the early days after Markrsquos death when our faith was extremely tested, we received tremendous support from our parish community.Katie also asked for support for the upcoming football tournament at St Patrickrsquos Grammar next Saturday, September  and for Ballynahinch Olympicrsquos annual fundraising effort.She said: ldquoWe hope everyone will come along to the Red High next weekend to enjoy the football tournament. Itrsquos sure to be good day and all money raised will go to Ballynahinch counselling services and The Edge, as we feel that the Edge contributes enormously to the youth of our town. Ironically, Mark would have been  years old on September  a week after tournament.Former schoolmate, Conor MacNamara, spoke on behalf of the men involved in the fund-raising initiative.   He said: ldquoSo far the lads have raised over pound, with great support from past pupils, ex-teachers and of course Quinnyrsquos family.ldquoThese are dferent times now compared to . Mental health awareness is something that people are much more open about these days. It has a high profile in the media too which makes it easier for people to hold up their hands and admit that they are struggling with their own mental health.ldquoIn particular, young people feel a lot of pressure from unhealthy relationships with social media.ldquoBut still, suicide is still very high in Ballynahinch, Downpatrick and other parts of the county.

We canrsquot afford to push action further down the road all the time or expect others to be the ones to sort out this mess.ldquoWe want to see the Wales Pension Partnership, the Welsh Assembly, the Welsh Government and all other public body pension funds ditch fossil fuel investments and we will be keeping the pressure up until they do the right thing, both for the planet and for future generations here in Wales and around the world.Previous research by Friends of the Earth found that the eight local authority pension funds in Wales invested over poundbn between them in fossil fuel companies.Last year Monmouthshire Council was the first in Wales to vote to est its pension fund from fossil fuel companies. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

is encouraging schools here to take advantage of beneficial dog safety and responsible dog ownership lessons for their students. Their free dog welfare workshops, delivered as part of the Charity’s ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, enhance the National Curriculum and seek to provide children between the ages of seven and  years with the knowledge and understanding they need to act responsibly and safely around dogs in their homes and those they may see out and about.Each workshop benefits pupils by involving a pretend dog as its focus, with the aim of developing compassion and consideration for all living beings.Not only do children - whether dog owners or not - learn how to behave safely around dogs, they also learn all about the commitment involved in owning a dog through a creative and interactive learning experience.Last year, Cathy Clyde, Dogs Trust’s NI Education and Community Officer delivered workshops to , children. This year they are on track to improve on this number yet again. With the growing success of the ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, Dogs Trust now employs  education and community officers across the UK to provide workshops in their designated regions.Cathy said: “Through debate and discussion, our responsible dog ownership workshops encourage learners to embody important values around dog ownership such choosing the right breed or type of dog for your le style, as well as understanding that dogs are a lelong commitment and not a disposable commodity. I would welcome the opportunity to work with schools in the area and encourage them to get in touch, as pupils really do get a lot out of the workshops as do their dogs.”For more information about ‘Be Dog Smart’ visit www.bedogsmart.org.ukFor more information or to book a ‘Be Dog Smart’ workshop, contact Cathy Clyde on    or email cathy.clyde@dogstrust.org.ukCarrick firefighters form guard of

former St Michael’s Grammar School pupil explained: “The lady came into the shop struggling to breathe, she was in full-blown anaphylactic shock.”Emmett acted quickly and gave the woman an adrenaline shot: “I could see the rash on her neck so I knew she had an allergy.“I thought I’d have to do CPR. I gave her a shot of adrenaline and it didn’t really do anything.“Then I gave her a second adrenaline pen and it seemed to work until the ambulance arrived.“She required two more in the ambulance but from what I’ve heard she seems to be good now, thank God.“I’m also trained as a doctor so I think that certainly helped.”He added: “It’s not the sort of thing you expect to see and I’m glad I was able to help.”Emmett, whose long term ambition is to work in anaesthesia, has been in touch with the lady’s family who expressed their gratitude for his lesaving actions: “Her daughter contacted me and said she couldn’t thank me enough.”Emmett’s family back in Lurgan have expressed their pride in the young doctor’s heroic actions.His aunt Margaret McManus said: “We are very proud of him. He lost his twin brother, Finbar, three years ago and he has worked so hard. His mum dad and granny Eilish and sister Emma are so proud of him.”Emmett said: “My family has been through a tough time, I lost my brother when I was studying for my medical degree, I couldn’t focus on my exams.

Several motorists were warned about their speed but the sad thing was that two motorists received Fixed Penalty Notices for speeding.“On top of this one motorist obviously didn’t see us driving behind him when he decided to lt his mobile and start chatting to a friend instead of concentrating on the road. As a result this motorist also received a Fixed Penalty Notice for his misjudged action.“I would prefer to inform you that we had a successful day and caught nobody as it truly saddens me to issue these fixed penalty notices but some people just will not learn.“What I also noticed today was that not one person waved to us.

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jm_1.jpg","title":"how do you retain staff and keep them enjoying their job","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business With such intense competition for talent, the challenge for employers isn’t just finding prospective candidates, it’s also keeping them, writes John Moore, managing director of Hays NI Astonishingly, almost half of professionals surveyed in the Hays What Workers Want Report said that they left at least one new job within the first  months because it didn’t match expectations formed during the application process. A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/da1.jpg","title":"clarity telecom building telecoms from the ground up","story":"Posted on Monday September  by Ulster Business Clarity Telecom helps businesses of all shapes and sizes develop their communications needs from the ground up, and is now rolling out its fast-growing cloud software across the UK and Ireland. Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call.
