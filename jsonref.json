Brutal blast of wind and rain will...Share this articleHe would be replaced at the top of the company by deputy finance boss Chris Wootton in an acting capacity.It would cement his position as one of the most powerful players on the high street, having already acquired House of Fraser and Evans Cycles last year.Neil Wilson, analyst at Markets.com, said the move suggested an impending tie-up between House of Fraser and Debenhams.          Mr Ashley owns just under 30 per cent of Debenhams through Sports Direct, the retail firm\u0027s largest shareholder (stock image)\u0027One wonders why Ashley does not simply go the obvious route and bid for Debenhams and combine into the House of Fraser rump,\u0027 he said.\u0027The rationale for tying these companies together is clearly compelling. If the coup fails, he will surely launch a takeover.\u0027If it succeeds he will be able to tie up the operational side and shore up finances from his own resources. Whether this boardroom coup fails or not, there is surely only one outcome from all of this: Mike Ashley will get what he wants.\u0027In January, Mr Ashley teamed up with fellow shareholder Landmark to eject Debenhams chairman Sir Ian Cheshire and chief executive Sergio Bucher from the board.The shock announcement comes just days after Debenhams issued its latest profit warning.It warned that trading headwinds, efforts to put the group on a secure financial footing and macroeconomic uncertainties are hitting the company hard.The profit alert was the fourth in just over a year.Meanwhile shares in Sports Direct slipped as much as 2.6 per cent on Friday.Laith Khalaf, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u0027Such an unnecessary change of CEO looks somewhat disrespectful to other shareholders of Sports Direct, but then those who hold the stock must surely have already come to terms with Mike Ashley\u0027s unorthodox style.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Amanda Holden followed home man black Volkswagen","story":"    Amanda Holden has been left too scared to leave her own home after she was followed home by a man in a black car\u0027He\u0027s been reported.

I don\u0027t, I am just letting you know that I need you guys to understand that I am happy.\u0027I have to go now. I have to go.\u0027  After R.

Dame Kelly was responding to a tweet by Good Morning Britain in support of Martina Navratilova who had suggested that trans women who competed in women\u0027s sports were \u0027cheating\u0027 because of a biological advantage          Trans cyclist Rachel McKinnon calls out Holmes\u0027 sponsors Garmin and Specialized for supporting and suggests they drop her for not holding the same values          McKinnon, who also has academic pursuits, is one of a few transgender world champions across the sporting world. She achieved a 2018 UCI Masters Track Cycling gold medal at a competition in Los AngelesShe wrote on Twitter: ‘So hey Specialized and Garmin have you been following how your athlete Kelly Holmes has been extremely transphobic lately on Twitter?’ She added: ‘Specialized, you have a trans athlete. Garmin, you cool with this?’Miss McKinnon urged the companies to ‘take a stand’ as Dame Kelly was ‘trying to ban trans women from competing in women’s sport’ in breach of International Olympic Committee (IOC) policy.Miss McKinnon has argued that since IOC rules introduced in 2003 allowed trans women to compete, ‘not a single trans athlete has even qualified for the Olympics, let alone won a medal’.           Holmes responded to the criticism by saying she felt strongly about competitive sports, and wanted evidence there was no disadvantage before she would back downCycling specialists Specialized said it would investigate Dame Kelly’s comments, posting on Twitter: ‘Thanks for flagging this, Rachel. This is not representative of our brand values.’Dame Kelly, who won gold in the 800m and 1,500m running events in the 2004 Olympics, hit back – telling Miss McKinnon that involving her sponsors was ‘going about this in the wrong way’. In a tweet, she questioned why she had been blocked by a fellow athlete ‘if this subject is open to debate’.She added: ‘Calling me transphobic is just ridiculous – far from it. I have an opinion you don’t like... that’s that!’ Dame Kelly has lent her support to the Fair Play for Women campaign, which insists that female athletes are at a clear disadvantage against trans rivals.Tennis star Miss Navratilova has already clashed with Miss McKinnon in a row over male-born transgender athletes competing against biological women, branding it ‘cheating’.The Wimbledon champion and LGBT campaigner deplored the ‘tyranny’ of transgender activists who ‘denounce anyone who argues against them’.Miss Navratilova – who faced abuse and prejudice after coming out as gay in 1981 – accused Canadian Miss McKinnon of sending ‘bullying tweets’, and said her views had now ‘strengthened’.Long distance runner Miss Radcliffe has said tighter rules need to be applied if transgender women are to compete. IOC guidelines say transgender women must suppress testosterone levels for at least 12 months before they compete.She told the BBC: ‘People will manipulate this if there is an opening there to make money and win medals and we’ve seen the lengths people go to, the lengths Russia went to cheat in sport.’    Sharron Davies says the argument about trans women competing in female events is simply a matter of ‘biology’.The former Olympic swimmer, 56, claimed it was unfair to compete against those ‘who were born into a male body with all the advantages that will bring’.She told Radio 4’s Today programme that simple biology meant a transgender competitor would have a better ‘red blood cell count, increased lung capacity, better hand-eye co-ordination, longer limbs, denser bones, leaner muscle, bigger hearts’. Miss Davies, pictured, added: ‘Take swimming. Michael Phelps has got size 15 feet, your average female has size five or six feet, so if we were to move a man into swimming they would totally dominate all the women’s events.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Highly educated middle class women marry down","story":"    English language teacher Catharine Higginson, 49, is married to James, 47, who runs a small-scale construction companyOn the surface we\u0027re worlds apart.

I could wait forever for a \u0027suitable\u0027 man whom everyone would deem my intellectual equal, but here was a lovely man who made me laugh, who rubbed along amicably with my children, and what\u0027s more — he seemed to adore me.Of course all my university friends were surprised.

Mum was concerned, however. One girlfriend confessed she\u0027d asked her to check him out for her! She reported back that we were madly in love.James is not intimidated by my friends. Over the years he has bonded with two of my family members who are both seriously high-brow academics. We married in 2005 and live near Biarritz, south-west France, renovating properties, and are blissfully happy.While I am happiest curled up with a Mary Wesley novel, James never reads.

He was from a well-off background. We\u0027d go to the theatre and buzzed around the countryside in his red classic sports car. Another chap I dated went on to become an MP.          PR consultant Fiona Scott, 52, is married to Steve, 53, who left school at 16 The relationships didn\u0027t work because I was always mindful of how I behaved around them. I felt I couldn\u0027t ever be \u0027me\u0027.I met Steve when I was 30 in a nightclub in Swindon. He had separated from his then-wife. I was forging a career in television. He made me feel comfortable and cherished for who I am.At last it was lovely not worrying about whether I\u0027d say the right thing, have read the right book or earned the \u0027right\u0027 amount. Those were things Steve set no store by.That\u0027s why on our second date I put my cards on the table and explained I needed to know what our future held. I wanted marriage, children and the whole \u0027happy ever after\u0027. In my 30s, I didn\u0027t want to waste my time.I\u0027d started planning my move and didn\u0027t want to say goodbye to a new future in the U.S. based on someone who wasn\u0027t serious.Mum really liked him and Dad loved him from the beginning. He trusted Steve because he saw a man who adored his daughter. We married four years later in 2000.I now juggle running a successful PR company with stints directing television programmes. Steve is an engineer. He redefines what it means to be handy! It is no bother to Steve to build some cupboards over the weekend. He is in his element painting and decorating or poring over the manual for a new gadget, whereas I struggle to wire a plug.Forget the flashy car I used to be driven around in, there is nothing sexier than a handy man who can make you laugh.I call Steve \u0027Spreadsheet Man\u0027 because he loves to track our life. He has a spreadsheet calculating our bills for the past 20 years. It would never strike me to do this.When I look at our wedding pictures I don\u0027t see a D.H.

I see a happily married couple who love one another and are best friends.Steve says: It doesn\u0027t bother me that Fiona is a graduate with letters after her name.

Sami left school at 16.Throughout my 20s I was on a fast-track career trajectory as an accountant. After graduation I walked into a job where I met my first husband on my first day.He was an engineer and we married when I was 26. We had a fantastic apartment and a great social life. We went to New York, Iceland, Holland, Canada.In 2008 I was made redundant. Suddenly I was at home all day and depression swooped in. My ex travelled for work and I felt he wasn\u0027t very sympathetic when he came home. Turning 30 was a wake-up call for me. I realised I wanted to spend my working days doing something that mattered. My ex couldn\u0027t fathom my thinking and our marriage failed.Six years ago when I was 31 I moved to London to make a fresh start. I worked as a Spanish tutor to pay my way through my PGCE.It was then I met my husband Sami. He\u0027d put an ad on a website looking for like-minded single people to go travelling with. He was working as a cleaner for a company renting apartments.I didn\u0027t have many friends in London, so thought, \u0027why not\u0027. We travelled around Europe. Needless to say we didn\u0027t stay in smart hotels. Within three months we were dating. Sami proposed five months later. My family met him with an open mind, but they did challenge me about his suitability, demanding to know how on earth he\u0027d earn enough money to support me if I ever lost my job again.Sami won my parents over by cooking for them. He loves to take on the domestic role. Nothing is beneath him! He is happy to give the loo a good scrub, too.Sami says: I love the fact my wife is so intelligent. I call her the woman with two brains! I enjoy taking care of her and making her happy. We are a good team.

Nine years ago it forced the BNP to drop its ‘whites only’ membership rule.Labour said it will co-operate fully with the EHRC, but said it rejects ‘completely’ any suggestion it has acted unlawfully. Last night moderate Labour MPs predicted high-level resignations.The move comes two days after it emerged that Mr Corbyn’s aide Laura Murray sought to block the suspension of a member who described an anti-Semitic mural of a group of ‘hook-nosed’ men as ‘great’.It was reported yesterday that another ally of the leader, Thomas Gardiner, had intervened repeatedly to downgrade suspensions for anti-Semitism.The EHRC – which was founded by the Blair government – said it acted after receiving two dossiers showing examples where anti-Semitism was not dealt with properly by Labour. One was from the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism, and the other was from the Jewish Labour Movement.On a shameful day for Labour, Mr Corbyn remained silent over the threat of an investigation.Jewish Labour MP Ruth Smeeth, who has been subjected to anti-Semitic abuse, called it a ‘devastating indictment’. She added: ‘Decent members will be horrified that we have got into this position. I welcome the EHRC intervention but today is another dark day in the history of our party which could and should have been avoided if concerns raised had been heeded last year.’Labour deputy leader Tom Watson said he was ‘deeply saddened’ at the EHRC move.He said he would contact Labour general secretary Jennie Formby to ask for all relevant files and data to be retained ‘so that investigators can form a clear picture of the processes and culture around Labour’s response to anti-Semitism’.Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, said it was ‘utterly disgraceful and unacceptable’ that the party had taken so long to deal with anti-Semitism.‘We need to remove this stain from our party, and we need to expel these despicable iniduals, so we can go into the next election, united by our historic values, not poisoned by this vicious disease,’ she said.The EHRC will now contact Labour to set out its concerns. If the response is found to be unsatisfactory, it could launch a formal investigation.A spokesman for the watchdog said: ‘Having received a number of complaints regarding anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, we believe Labour may have unlawfully discriminated against people because of their ethnicity and religious beliefs.      ‘Our concerns are sufficient for us to consider using our statutory enforcement powers. As set out in our enforcement policy, we are now engaging with the Labour Party to give them an opportunity to respond.’A Labour spokesman said: ‘We completely reject any suggestion the party has acted unlawfully and will be co-operating fully with the EHRC. Labour is fully committed to the support, defence and celebration of the Jewish community and its organisations.’Labour MP John Mann, who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group Against Anti-Semitism, predicted the EHRC’s move would eventually lead to resignations of senior party figures.‘Obviously there will be resignations from those in power as this fully unfolds,’ he said. ‘Everyone should let the EHRC do its job.’Gideon Falter, of the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism, said: ‘It is a sad indictment that the once great anti-racist Labour Party is now being investigated by the equality and human rights regulator it established. Since the Holocaust, Britain has led the world in promoting human rights, and it could scarcely be more important to British society that the Jew hatred festering in the Labour Party is firmly brought to an end.’The Jewish Labour Movement said it asked the EHRC in November last year to investigate the allegation that the Labour Party was ‘institutionally anti-Semitic’.

On a sunny day in Brighton, the town was swamped with people from all over south-east England, and especially from London.Usually families would stay in a seafront guesthouse or a ‘Hi-De-Hi’ style holiday camp, which offered a brief respite before the children would be back on the beach building sand castles, rock pooling or, more likely, begging for coins to feed the enticing arcade games.And what would a trip to the seaside be without a piece of rock?

File photograph: Collins A former investigator into Anglo Irish Bank whose shredding of papers contributed to the collapse the trial of the bank’s former chairman Seán FitzPatrick has agreed to testify before an Oireachtas committee.Kevin O’Connell, former legal adviser to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE), has told the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation that he is happy to appear before it to offer his account of what happened.He has said in correspondence this week that he is willing to testify after the committee has reviewed a 450-page report due to be submitted by his former boss, Ian Drennan, the Director of Corporate Enforcement. The report will set out the factors that led to the collapse of Mr FitzPatrick’s trial.Mr O’Connell, who no longer works at the ODCE, declined to comment.Ian Drennan\u0027s reportThe committee still had not received Mr Drennan’s report as of Wednesday due to concerns raised by the State’s corporate law watchdog over whether the submission would be covered by Dáil privilege protecting him from legal action from people named in the report.Mr O’Connell wrote to the committee on February 12th telling them that he should not be solely blamed for the collapse of the trial and that he had “long been looking forward to the full set of facts” relating to “mistakes and errors on my part” and “on the part of others” being heard.He said he had become “the personification of all that was considered wrong about the State’s dealing with that case”.Mr Drennan told the committee during an appearance last month – his first since his appointment in 2012 – that the factors contributing to the collapse of the trial “extend well beyond” the failures within the ODCE.Mr FitzPatrick was accused of furnishing false information to the bank’s auditors Ernst \u0026amp Young, now EY, over his loans at the bank. He denied any wrongdoing. His first trial collapsed in 2015 after Mr O’Connell admitted shredding papers relevant to the case in “a panic”.The judge directed an acquittal in a 2017 retrial over the ODCE’s mishandling of the investigation.

File photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireOne of the striking things about today’s Ipsos MRBI poll findings is the degree to which views in Northern Ireland on Brexit and the political management of it at Westminster cross the community ide.It is not, for example, surprising that a strong majority (85 per cent) of voters from a Catholic background disapprove of the way Theresa May’s government is running the UK. But what is striking is that 72 per cent of voters from a Protestant background agree.This shared view – consensus is perhaps too strong a word – extends across several of the questions about their political leaders and Brexit options that Northern voters were asked in today’s poll.Asked if they believed that DUP MPs – who are allied with Conservative hard Brexiteer MPs – were “doing a good job or a bad job representing Northern Ireland at Westminster”, a whopping two-thirds of voters (67 per cent) said they were doing a bad job. Among voters from a Catholic background, the number was 83 per cent. But among those from a Protestant background, it was still an absolute majority – 52 per cent, against 34 per cent who said they were doing a good job.On Arlene Foster’s performance, 82 per cent of voters from a Catholic background said they were dissatisfied with her performance but so did 57 per cent of voters from a Protestant background.There is – by Northern Ireland standards, at any rate – a high degree of cross-community agreement on Brexit: Northern Ireland is united (more or less) in preferring the softest of soft Brexits.Asked if they wanted all of the UK to stay in the EU single market and customs union to ensure no hard border and no checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, two-thirds – 67 per cent – of voters agree, against just 17 per cent who disagree.Broken down by community background, 52 per cent of those from a Protestant background agree, 81 per cent from a Catholic background agree, 83 per cent of those from another background and 65 per cent of those who gave no background also agreed.In the case of a hard Brexit, more Northern voters prefer checks on goods between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, than favour checks on the border.Asked if they want Northern Ireland to leave on the same terms as the rest of the UK even if it meant checks on the border, almost half of voters (48 per cent) disagree, with 35 per cent agreeing.But asked if they want special arrangements for Northern Ireland to avoid border checks – even if it means checks on goods moving to the UK – 60 per cent of respondents agree, with 21 per cent disagreeing.ContradictionsInevitably, there are some complications and contradictions in people’s views: that’s hardly surprising. Some 54 per cent of voters from a Protestant background want to leave on the same terms as the rest of the UK, even if this means border checks, while 51 per cent say they prefer checks between Northern Ireland and the UK over checks on the border.However, taken across the range of questions, it seems clear that the strong desire of people in Northern Ireland, evident in both communities, is for a soft Brexit, with no hard border, no checks on goods and the minimum of disruption.Translate this into politics: it’s clear from today’s numbers that the Brexit line being pursued by the DUP is significantly at odds not just with the Northern Irish electorate as a whole, but it is also at odds with the views of the Protestant and unionist communities from which the party draws its support.Among those communities, it’s clear that that many of them are okay with the idea that some east-west trade friction is consistent with remaining in the UK. Voters from a Protestant background are entirely committed to remaining in the UK – and in favour of a soft Brexit. And in the event of a hard Brexit, they favour avoiding friction on the border with the Republic.Another way of putting this: Brexit is about Brexit, not about unionism vs nationalism.It’s not, of course, clear if that knowledge will prompt any rethink among the DUP’s leadership. But no politician wants to cut himself, or herself off from their base."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3818262.1551987738!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish times poll northern ireland voters do not want dup tory brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May and DUP leader Arlene Foster. Photograph: Daniel Leal-OlivasAFPGetty ImagesVoters in Northern Ireland overwhelmingly reject a hard Brexit, would vote to remain in the European Union in a second referendum and would prefer checks on goods travelling between Great Britain and the North rather than checks on the Irish Border, according to a special Ipsos MRBI poll in Northern Ireland.A parallel poll in the Republic finds that almost half of all voters favour a referendum on Irish unity and a clear majority would vote in favour of reunification.The poll finds that Northern voters are deeply dissatisfied with the management of Brexit by the UK government and, most significantly, with the Democratic Unionist Party, with more than three-quarters of all voters saying they are dissatisfied with the UK government.Two-thirds of all voters (67 per cent) say the DUP is doing a bad job of representing Northern Ireland at Westminster, while 69 per cent of people – including 57 per cent of those from a Protestant background – are dissatisfied with DUP leader Arlene Foster.Checks on goodsStrikingly, the poll shows that in the event of a hard Brexit, more voters would favour checks on goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland than would favour checks on the Border.Almost half of all voters (48 per cent) disagree with Northern Ireland leaving the EU on the same terms as the UK if it means border checks in Ireland.But 59 per cent say they want a special arrangement for Northern Ireland for no checks on the Border – even if it means some checks on goods travelling between Great Britain and the North.But by far the biggest majority (67 per cent) is in support of a very soft Brexit where the UK stays in the EU single market and the customs union to avoid the need for checks anywhere.Northern voters are ided on whether there should be another Brexit referendum but if there was one, they would vote overwhelmingly (59 per cent) to remain in the EU.While voters are clearly at odds with the approach of the DUP to Brexit, they are also critical of Sinn Féin.Just 13 per cent of voters are satisfied with the way Sinn Féin’s Northern leader Michelle O’Neill is doing her job, with 61 per cent dissatisfied. A large majority – 60 per cent – of voters believe that Sinn Féin MPs should take their seats at Westminster. Among voters from a Catholic background, the figure rises to 64 per cent.Just over a third of Northern voters want a referendum on Irish unity. If one was held, just 32 per cent would vote in favour of unity, while 45 per cent would vote against. The number in favour of unity rises to 58 per cent among voters from a Catholic background, with 18 per cent against and 24 per cent who say they don’t know.Referendum on unityIn the Republic, the picture is different. Almost half of voters (49 per cent) say there should be a referendum on Irish unity, and if such a referendum was held, 62 per cent say they would vote in favour.The poll in the Republic was conducted on Monday and Tuesday of this week among a representative sample of 1,200 voters aged 18 and over in face-to-face interviews at 120 sampling points in all constituencies. The margin of error is plus or minus 2.8 per cent.Over half of southern voters (54 per cent) say they are satisfied with the way the Government has handled Brexit, but they are deeply ided on the choices that may face the Irish Government in the future.Asked if the Government should compromise on the backstop – the guarantee that there will be no hard border that has brought the Brexit talks to a standstill – in order to secure a deal and avoid a hard border, 43 per cent say the Government should compromise, while 42 per cent say that they should not compromise even if this risks a hard border.Voters are similarly ided when asked about the options if there is a hard border. Asked if there should be checks on goods at the border to avoid checks on goods going to the EU, 35 per cent agreed. Asked if the checks should be on goods going to the EU to avoid checks at the border, 33 per cent agreed."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3818273.1551987864!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"majority of northern voters want minimal disruption to daily life","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThere is broader support for Northern Ireland having a special customs arrangement to ensure no checks on the Border with the Republic. Photograph:  Charles McQuillanGetty ImagesAs Northern Ireland’s future post-Brexit remains unclear, today’s Ipsos MRBI poll finds that the majority of Northern Irish voters wish to see minimal disruption to daily life, with 67 per cent believing that the UK should stay in the EU single market and customs union to ensure no hard border with the Republic of Ireland and no checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Despite this desire to maintain the status quo, appetite for a second Brexit referendum is mixed. Fieldwork for today’s poll took place on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of this week among a nationally representative sample of 536 eligible voters in Northern Ireland. Interviewing was conducted face-to-face, in-home, across all regions.Although 48 per cent of voters are in favour of another Brexit referendum, almost as many – 44 per cent – are against. There are notable community differences, with 63 per cent of Catholics in favour and 61 per cent of Protestants against.If there was to be a second referendum, 59 per cent say they would vote to stay in the EU and 30 per cent say they would vote to leave. Again, views fall distinctly along community lines, with support for remaining in the EU higher among Catholics (76 per cent) than among Protestants (42 per cent).Beyond Brexit, the options for border and customs arrangements facing Northern Ireland draw mixed levels of support.Although it is the position of Northern Ireland’s leading party – the DUP – that Northern Ireland should leave on the same terms as the rest of the UK, this view does not enjoy majority support. Just over a third (35 per cent) agree with the DUP, while almost half (48 per cent) disagree. As would be expected, Protestant voters are more likely to agree with the DUP on this, with 54 per cent sharing this view.There is broader support for Northern Ireland having a special customs arrangement to ensure no checks on the Border with the Republic 60 per cent agree with this position, despite the potential for some checks on goods crossing the Irish sea to Great Britain.Today’s poll indicates that support is strongest for the whole of the UK staying in the EU single market and customs union to avoid a hard border with the Republic and ensure no checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. Sixty-seven per cent of voters support this position, 17 per cent oppose it. Once again, the community lines are clear 81 per cent of Catholics are in support compared to 52 per cent of Protestants.There is no clear consensus on how Brexit will impact Northern Ireland in terms of its constitutional future. While over a third of people think that Brexit will make the prospect of a United Ireland more likely (36 per cent), a similar number think it will make it no more or less likely (35 per cent). Thirteen per cent of voters think Brexit will make the prospect of a United Ireland less likely, while 16 per cent simply do not know what impact, if any, Brexit will have.Views on Irish unity remain mixed. While 45 per cent of Northern Irish voters feel there should not be a referendum on Irish unity, just over a third – 38 per cent – feel there should be one. Opposition to a referendum is strongest among Protestants (62 per cent) while Catholics are more likely to favour another referendum (55 per cent).If there was to be a referendum, 45 per cent say they would vote against Irish unity and 32 per cent would vote in favour. Almost a quarter of Northern Irish voters (23 per cent) are undecided. In this climate of uncertainty, the push for consistency from Northern Irish voters is clear.Sally Abernethy is a Senior Research Executive with Ipsos MORI Northern Ireland"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3818302.1551988807!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit contents of cox s codpiece could swing meaningful vote","story":"UK Attorney General Geoffrey Cox has said he intends to look inside the Brexit \u0027codpiece\u0027 to ensure it\u0027s in working order as the latests talks on the backstop resume.  Video: Parliamentlive.tv\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s attorney general Geoffrey Cox outside of Downing Street in London on February 26th. Photograph: Toby MelvilleReutersFileGeoffrey Cox was back in the House of Commons on Thursday for a mid-morning performance that owed as much to his am-dram experience in the Cambridge Footlights as to his years at the Old Bailey.The attorney general had little to boast about after a disastrous dinner in Brussels with Michel Barnier’s negotiating team, which left EU officials dismissing Britain’s latest proposals as “insane”.But Cox was in crowd-pleasing form, making a virtue of a disparaging term used by hardline Brexiteers to describe the concession he was seeking so that he could change his legal advice on the Northern Ireland backstop.“It is government policy to achieve the necessary change in the backstop that will cause me to review and change my advice. That is government policy that is the subject of the discussions that we are having. I would say that it has come to be called ‘Cox’s codpiece’. What I am concerned to ensure is that what is inside the codpiece is in full working order,” he said.Theresa May’s hopes of winning a majority for her Brexit deal next Tuesday rest on persuading the DUP and hardline Conservative Brexiteers that Britain cannot be trapped indefinitely in the backstop.Downing Street perceives the DUP as the key to unlocking the support of all but a handful of diehard eurosceptics on the Conservative backbenches.The EU has ruled out a time limit or a unilateral withdrawal mechanism and Cox’s efforts are now focused on an arbitration mechanism to determine when the backstop can end.Minimising frictionDUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson told the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee on Wednesday that arbitration was unacceptable and that only Britain’s sovereign parliament and government should be allowed to determine how long the backstop lasts.Others in his party believe that arbitration could offer a way out of the backstop but that its effectiveness depends, as Cox told MPs on Thursday, on the question the arbitrator is asked.Cox told EU negotiators this week that instead of determining if both parties are acting in good faith, arbitrators should be asked if Britain had made reasonable efforts to find an alternative to the backstop.If the answer was yes, Britain should be allowed to replace the backstop – which would see the whole of the UK remain in a customs arrangement with the EU and Northern Ireland following some single market rules – with a “mini-backstop” that would seek to minimise friction on the Border.Cox will return to Brussels on Friday for talks that are expected to continue through the weekend. But the two sides are so far apart that it now appears unlikely that the attorney general will secure the changes he needs to change his legal advice and persuade the DUP to vote for the Brexit deal.The prime minister has promised to bring the deal back to the Commons by next Tuesday for a “meaningful vote” and that its defeat would be followed on Wednesday and Thursday by votes on a no-deal Brexit and an extension to the article 50 negotiating period.Alternative offerIf a defeat on Tuesday is unavoidable, the government could offer MPs an additional vote similar to January’s Brady amendment which said the House would support the withdrawal agreement if the backstop was replaced with alternative arrangements to keep the Border open.If May wins a majority for an amendment outlining Cox’s arbitration proposal, she will still have to face votes on a no-deal Brexit and an extension. But she will have reduced further the price of Brexiteer support for her deal and demonstrated to the EU that such a concession would win a majority at Westminster.The prospect of delaying Brexit has weakened the incentive to compromise on all sides at Westminster as each faction believes that extra time gives their preferred option a better chance of success.A delay could allow backbench MPs to take control of the Brexit process as they seek to build a cross-party consensus behind a softer Brexit.Such an outcome, which could see Britain remaining in both the single market and the customs union, is a nightmare for Conservative Brexiteers.The DUP are relaxed about a delay, pointing out that the only form of Brexit that presents a real threat to unionism is May’s deal with the backstop in its current form.From a strictly unionist point of view all other options, including remaining in the EU, are acceptable.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Once detected, separate instruments will define whether it sits in the so-called Goldilocks Zone, neither too hot, nor too cold for liquid water to form.Finally, researchers will study the chemical make up of the atmosphere, hunting for signs of gases like methane which could indicate that life is thriving on the surface.Mr Skidmore said: “Work to discover Earth-like planets around other stars may eventually lead to us answering the question of whether extra-terrestrial life exists.”Astronomers have so far found over 3,000 planets beyond our Solar System, but none, as yet, has been shown to be truly Earth-like in terms of its size and distance from a Sun similar to our own.  The new observatory, which launches in 2026, will be able to go further, looking not just for the planets themselves, but also evidence of life. The project is led by the European Space Agency but the suite of instruments will be designed by the University of Warwick.Professor Don Pollacco, University of Warwick, which leads the PLATO Science Management Consortium, said: “These planets will be close enough to facilitate a historic search for signs of life in their atmospheres using the next generation of large telescopes. “For the first time we will start to understand if life exists beyond the solar system.”The UK Space Agency also announced a further £7 million funding for a space weather mission to learn more about the dangers posed by the solar wind.The Solar wind Magnetosphere Ionosphere Link Explorer (Smile) mission will study the powerful ejections from the Sun which interact with the Earth\u0027s magnetosphere, and can potentially crippled satellites, power grids and communications networks.Space tourism: 10 ways you can leave planet EarthRecent research by Oxford University suggested that an intense solar storm could leave Britain with £16 billion worth of damage. The most severe incident - known as ‘the Carrington Event’ - happened in 1859, shorting  circuits, starting fires and causing the Northern Lights to dance in the sky as far south as Hawaii.In 1989, a geomagnetic disturbance caused a voltage collapse of Canada’s Hydro-Québec power grid, leaving six million inhabitants without power for nine hours and in 2005, X-rays from a solar flare disrupted the GPS system for about 10 minutesThe new UK funding will be used to develop a Soft X-ray Imager instrument, which will be designed by University of Leicester, University College London and the Open University, ahead of launch in 2023.Prof Graziella Branduardi-Raymont, Smile mission Co-Principal Investigator at UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory, said: “Space weather remains one of the biggest risks facing humanity and Smile will make a fundamental contribution in furthering our scientific understanding to help mitigate it.”Professor Paul Monks, Pro-Vice-Chancellor and Head of College of Science and Engineering, University of Leicester, added: “SXI will be the first instrument to provide true global imaging of the solar wind exchange process within the magnetosphere. “The results of which will have meaningful implications for safeguarding our environment on Earth.”Announcing the funding at the start of British Science Week, Mr Skidmore added: “These two exciting space missions are brilliant examples of the UK’s space industry’s innovation and expertise.“Space weather – such as solar wind – is a potential threat to our communications systems here on Earth so this research examining how the wind interacts with our planet’s electromagnetic system.”Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: Theresa May to urge EU to change deal amid impasse over backstop Comment: Remainers might get their way for now, but the EU superstate dream makes Brexit inevitableShoreham air show trial: Pilot Andrew Hill cleared of manslaughter Indian police arrest teenager paid by terror group to carry grenade in his lunch box How popular is Donald Trump?

The party made a manifesto pledge to have 3 million apprenticeships by 2020, and introduced a new system whereby businesses would pay for these training positions. However, four years on, the perception of apprenticeships is still mixed and both students and companies say they need more support to help meet the government’s target. Apprenticeships got a boost in popularity and became more appealing to school leavers in the wake of higher tuition fees. Many students who might previously have submitted applications to universities without a second thought found themselves weighing up their options more carefully, and for some, an apprentice scheme proved to be a good alternative to a degree. Created with Sketch.Ucas chief puts the case for apprenticeships Show all 2Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.However, despite the government’s target of bringing more young people into the workforce via apprenticeships, many school leavers still find it difficult to get the information they need about the schemes that are available. In some cases, schools are failing to provide information, and still focus on university places and Ucas forms. Moshe Shamash, 21, says that he had no clear idea about what he wanted to do when he left school, but he knew that university was not the right path for him. “It was a mixture of grades and the fact that I wasn’t sure,” he says.\u0026nbsp“I was hearing stories about people who didn’t get jobs after uni.”Shamash is now a software engineer apprentice at Workplace by Facebook, but he tells the Independent that it was not easy to pursue this path. “At school there was no mention of apprenticeships,” he says. “The general feeling that you have to go to uni was quite prevalent. They weren’t too impressed that I was going on an apprenticeship scheme.”This experience is echoed among other apprentices. Jack Moore, 20, an apprentice at Vodafone, says that although his school was initially supportive of applications for apprenticeship schemes, “that very quickly went away”. “Then it was all about Ucas and going to uni, so I was the only one in my year who actually went on to do an apprenticeship,” he says. Despite the lack of support from some schools, for many young people the benefits of doing an apprenticeship far outweigh the attractions of going to university. Nayan Maghmare, 19, is also on the apprenticeship scheme at Vodafone. He says he joined the scheme because it felt like a “win-win situation”. “You get corporate experience and you earn money. There are particular skills that you learn on the job that you might not learn at uni,” he says, highlighting time management in particular as a skill he has picked up in the workplace. Ishaan Korotan, 19, decided on the apprenticeship route for similar reasons, joining the scheme at Cisco. “I’m really interested in cyber security and I thought ‘what better way to learn about it than by working for the company’ –\u0026nbspin terms of knowledge and skills you get from working within the industry it’s quite valuable.”It is not all upsides, though.\u0026nbspSri Konreddy, 19, is also at Cisco, and says she has less free time than her friends who are still in education. “I’m adulting much sooner than my friends at university,” she says. However, she adds: “It’s a good thing for me. I’ve made friends for life and the support has been great.”Meanwhile, for businesses, while apprentices are widely viewed as a good thing, the government’s apprenticeship levy, aimed at supporting these schemes, has not gone down so well. The levy, which was introduced in 2017, requires employers paying more than £3m in total each year to allocate 0.5 per cent of their payroll costs to training. This financial obligation was supposed to support the apprenticeship strategy –\u0026nbspbut in 2017-18, apprenticeship starts were down 24 per cent year-on-year, falling from 494,900 to 375,800. James Reed, chairman and chief executive of Reed Recruitment, says: “It’s clear that the apprenticeship levy is in urgent need of simplification in order to make a success of it. “It is also clear that financial incentives on their own are not enough to achieve the kind of results the government had hoped for.”Schools refuse to let students hear more about technical coursesHammond to announce £125m new funding for apprenticeships and jobsBusiness groups urge apprenticeship reform as GSCE results roll inThe apprenticeship levy is poisoning our economyThe Independent announces new editorial apprenticeship schemeCharlie Mullins, founder of Pimlico Plumbers, has long been a vocal critic of the levy, although he supports the aim of increasing the numbers of apprentices joining the workforce. “The apprenticeship levy was supposed to increase the number of new apprentices, in a genuine effort to combat the UK’s skills gap,” he says.“On paper, so far so good but in reality it has proven an unmitigated disaster, and has led to a catastrophic collapse in new apprenticeship starts.“The problem is part perception, and part that the levy is just too damn complicated and time consuming to claim for businesses already heavily burdened with the existing tax bureaucracy. “Business owners, especially of SMEs, just don’t have the time to get their heads around how to claim the money. What we need is a simple system where the government pays businesses directly for each apprentice they take on.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

They certainly should have been. \u0026nbspWith profits plunging by 45 per cent to £160m, their annual payments this year will amount to just 3 per cent of their salaries.\u0026nbspNo one working at the retailer now will have experienced anything like that.\u0026nbspJohn Lewis to close Knight \u0026amp Lee department storeM\u0026ampS, Debenhams and John Lewis reveal disappointing Christmas salesYou have to go back to 1954 to find a comparable number, when their grandparents, great-grandparents in some cases, received 4 per cent.\u0026nbspBut there are reasons to feel cheerful\u0026nbspeven if it might not look that way.For a start, John Lewis is one of those vanishingly rare institutions in Britain in which everyone who works there really is in it together.\u0026nbspRetail CEOs regularly pick up millions for doing far worse than the leadership of this one, where there are no such rewards for failure. Lewis bosses do fairly well for themselves, but the salary of the top paid executive is fixed to a multiple (75) of the average hourly rate of non management partners. You won’t find anything like that at the retailers which are listed on the stock market.\u0026nbspThey also get\u0026nbspthe same percentage bonus that\u0026nbspeveryone else does.\u0026nbspThere are none of the free shares other retail bosses get through long term incentive schemes, which aren’t really long term and only incentivise them to feather their own nests.\u0026nbspThat’s has to be worth\u0026nbspsomething.\u0026nbspBetter still is the fact that John Lewis isn’t firing people in the way other retailers are, retailers\u0026nbspthat are barely making any money at all.\u0026nbspJohn Lewis’ numbers aren’t pretty. They have been hit as a result of its IT investments, various one off costs, and the fact that the chain, which also owns Waitrose,\u0026nbsphas had to respond to the widespread discounting that’s been going on as reeling rivals struggle to make sales.\u0026nbspThe latter causes a particular problem for a chain that\u0026nbspboasts of “never being knowingly undersold”.\u0026nbspThing is, the discounting it\u0027s been forced to match\u0026nbspisn’t sustainable. It will die off as struggling rivals\u0026nbspdie off, if not before.\u0026nbspAt some point you can see there being maybe two or three general retailers left on the British high street. One of them will be John Lewis.

Such an unnecessary change of CEO looks somewhat disrespectful to other shareholders of Sports Direct, but then, those who hold the stock must surely have already come to terms with Mike Ashley’s unorthodox style.”On Tuesday,\u0026nbspDebenhams\u0026nbspissued its fourth profit warning in quick succession.In February, the chain\u0026nbspreceived a £40m cash injection from lenders, allowing it to pursue long-term refinancing.However, on Tuesday, the group said “this process is likely to be disruptive to our business in the coming months”.Meanwhile, like-for-like sales in the first 18 weeks of the financial year dropped by 5.7 per cent, with UK sales down 6.2 per cent.We’ll tell you what’s true.

And, yet, the iconic spaghetti kiss from Disney’s 1955 animated film has been oft imitated but never surpassed, as the two pups indulge in an Italian delicacy, all soundtracked to Sonny Burke and Peggy Lee’s “Bella Notte”. And, as Tramp proves, there’s no greater act of chivalry than offering your date the last meatball… Gabriel Axel’s Oscar-winning 1987 Danish film is a visual treat for any self-confessed gourmand. The story sees two pious Protestant sisters offer refuge to a French woman fleeing the political tumult in Paris after the collapse of the Second Empire in 1871. They agree to hire her as a housekeeper, All the very best chefs know that a dash of pure imagination is key to creating a true culinary wonder. It’s a lesson well-taught in Steven Spielberg’s 1991 classic, Hook, as a grown-up Peter Pan (Robin Williams) looks on in disbelief as the Lost Boys tuck into what appears to be nothing at all. It’s only when he truly believes that he can see the brightly colour feast laid out before him. And what childish feast would be complete without an old fashioned food fight? 420 Breakfast at Tiffany\u0027sSure, the 1961 film’s title may be a little misleading. Its protagonist, Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn), in reality only has breakfast outside of Tiffany’s, popping out of a cab in the early morning light to peer into the jewelry shop window, all while enjoying a pastry and some coffee in a paper. The moment has still remained the peak of glamour, decades later, so who cares if it’s all a little white lie?It’s a classic scene that proves to be surprisingly instructional. Francis Ford Coppola’s 1972 film has a full-blown recipe tucked within its elegant drama, as Vito Corleone’s close associate, Peter Clemenza (Richard Castellano), offers his version of the perfect pasta sauce. As he explains: “You start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it you make sure it doesn\u0027t stick. You get it to a boil you shove in all your sausage and your meatballs. And a little bit of wine, and a little bit of sugar—that\u0027s my trick.620 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate FactoryAlthough the 1971 musical is, as a whole, a sugary delight, it’s hardest to resist the temptation of Willy Wonka’s Fizzy Lifting Drinks, a soda described as so bubbly that it lifts anyone who drinks it right off the ground. It’s no wonder that it was the one stop on the tour that ended up tempting the pure-hearted Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) and his grandfather (Jack Albertson). Now, the real question is: does it come in different flavours?For anyone who considers pizza to be the true love of their life, Ryan Murphy’s 2010 romcom is a perfect cinematic match. It’s hard not to relate to the moment Liz Gilbert (Julia Roberts) bites into a piece of authentic Italian pizza, during the Naples stop on her global adventure of self-discovery, and declares: “I’m in love. I’m in a relationship with my pizza.”820 Beauty \u0026amp the BeastAlthough we might not fully be convinced that the grey stuff is delicious, the “dinner and show” approach to Lumiere (Jerry Orbach)’s hospitality is something we could certainly get used to. In Disney’s 1991 animation, Belle (Paige O\u0027Hara) is presented with a whole cavalcade of sumptuous dishes: including beef ragout, cheese souffle, pie and pudding en flambe. And there’s a sage piece of advice to go with it all, too: “If you\u0027re stressed, it\u0027s fine dining we suggest!” Indeed. While there’s been a growing fad of ambitious, unusually themed cakes – you need only look at the success of the TLC reality series Cake Boss – there are few cinematic cakes that quite stick in the memory like Jackson (Dylan McDermott)’s armadillo-shaped groom cake from 1989 comedy-drama Steel Magnolias, a spin on the tradition from the American South of having another cake separate to the main wedding cake. And did we mention that it’s red velvet on the inside? When it came to director Sofia Coppola conjuring the ultimate image of decadence for her 2006 biopic on the French queen, there was no more perfect treat than Ladurée’s famous macarons. Delicate and pastel-toned, the meringue-based confection has long been the speciality of the French bakery, first established in 1862. A new flavour was even created in honour of the film, with the Marie Antoinette offering a combination of rose and anise flavours.Food is often regarded as one of the best ways to understand a culture, and The Hundred-Foot Journey is wonderful for showing the efforts the talented, self-taught novice Hassan (Manish Dayal) goes to in order to comprehend that. During a picnic he reveals he has mastered the five “mother sauces” of French cuisine, and the delicate tasting process that follows demonstrates just how important food is to France.“In prison, dinner was always a big thing.” So much so that the Wise Guys ate better than most people on the outside. “Beyond the Sea” plays in the background as the gangsters prepare their meal: Garlic sliced so thin with a razor blade that it would “liquefy in the pan with just a little oil”, meatballs in a tomato sauce that’s “a little too oniony”, steak cooked medium rare, iced lobsters, prosciutto, salami, cheese, red wine and good Scotch. Maybe crime does pay after all.There are few pleasures in life more fulfilling than that of cooking for others. In Chocolat – based on the book by Joanne Harris – a slow-motion scene where dinner party guests tuck into the feast created by expert chocolatier Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) is full of warmth and laughter.In a world where people seem more than happy to fork out £15 for some mushy avocado on toast, $5 for a milkshake doesn’t seem too unreasonable. Vincent Vega (John Travolta) takes his boss’ wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out to Jack Rabbit Slim’s for a burger, where she decides she wants the “$5 dollar shake”. “You don’t put bourbon in it or nothing?” a bewildered Vincent asks the waiter. When it arrives, Mia takes a long sip: “Yummy.” “I gotta know what a $5 shake tastes like,” Vincent says. He takes a sip. Then another. “Goddamn, that’s a pretty f***ing good milkshake.”Nora Ephron’s feature film based on the intertwining stories of chef Julia Child and Julie Powell, the blogger who rose to fame after documenting her pledge to cook all 524 recipes in Child’s cookbook, is all about the joy one can find in food. It is some of the earlier scenes that capture this best, like when Julia (Meryl Streep) and her husband Paul (Stanley Tucci) arrive in Paris and stop at a French restaurant, where Julia is served a sizzling platter of sole. It looked so mouth-watering in the final edit that Ephron “wanted to call up Martin Scorcese and say, ‘you’ve never shot a fish like that before’”.  Fearsome critic Anton Ego takes a bite of ratatouille and is transported back to his childhood, where it was a favourite comfort food, in the best scene from Pixar’s wonderful animated film. The detail is superb, from the process of Remy the rat preparing the dish to the moment Ego’s pen falls to the ground as he remembers the power of a favourite meal in evoking memories we thought were lost.“I don’t want this, I want large bread… but I can rise above it, I’m a professional.” The miniature bread catastrophe is a beautiful parody on every self-absorbed rock star to have kicked off over something as ludicrous as the food they’re served backstage. Guitarist Nigel Tufnell sits next to a tray of sandwiches looking baffled as his manager walks over. Look, he says, picking up a sandwich. This, this miniature bread. It\u0027s like... I\u0027ve been working with this now for about half an hour. I can\u0027t figure it out. Let\u0027s say I want a bite, right, you\u0027ve got this... After all the trauma she has been through – at the hands of her abusive husband and a racist ex-employer – Minny (Octavia Spencer) arrives at her employer Celia Foote to find a beautiful dinner cooked for her as a thank you for everything she has done for Celia and her husband. You see the care that has gone into it as Celia lays everything out on the table, from a “mile high meringue” to the fried chicken Minny taught her how to make. “That table of food gave Minny the strength she needed,” the narration explains. “She took her babies out from under Leroy and never went back.”It was a scene that helped propel a revolution in American dining. Il Timpano, a dish inspired by the notoriously tricky-to-make Italian meal, is the star of a moment in Big Night where chef brothers Primo (Tony Shalhoub) and Secondo (Stanley Tucci) prepares it as the centrepiece for a feast attended by their rival, Pascal. “Goddamit, I should kill you,” he screams, throwing his fork down after tasting Il Timpano. “This is so f***ing good, I should kill you.”120 Lady \u0026amp the TrampWho would have guessed one of the most romantic scenes in cinema would involve two dogs eating scraps in an alleyway?

He also called for the ouster of all but one of the Debenhams’\u0026nbspboard, with finance chief\u0026nbspChris Wootton stepping up to become acting chief executive.Debenhams\u0026nbspshares shot up as much as 40 per cent on Friday morning before falling back to trade 13 per cent higher at 3.5p, still a tiny fraction of their peak of £2 back in 2006.Sports Direct, which owns 30 per cent of Debenhams, said it would provide more detail on its rationale for the radical shake-up in due course.Under the proposals, Mike Ashley would take executive control of Debenhams, without having to stump up the cash to buy the 70 per cent of shares which Sports Direct doesn’t own.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Such an unnecessary change of CEO looks somewhat disrespectful to other shareholders of Sports Direct, but then, those who hold the stock must surely have already come to terms with Mike Ashley’s unorthodox style.”On Tuesday,\u0026nbspDebenhams\u0026nbspissued its fourth profit warning in quick succession.In February, the chain\u0026nbspreceived a £40m cash injection from lenders, allowing it to pursue long-term refinancing.However, on Tuesday, the group said “this process is likely to be disruptive to our business in the coming months”.Meanwhile, like-for-like sales in the first 18 weeks of the financial year dropped by 5.7 per cent, with UK sales down 6.2 per cent.We’ll tell you what’s true.

And, yet, the iconic spaghetti kiss from Disney’s 1955 animated film has been oft imitated but never surpassed, as the two pups indulge in an Italian delicacy, all soundtracked to Sonny Burke and Peggy Lee’s “Bella Notte”. And, as Tramp proves, there’s no greater act of chivalry than offering your date the last meatball… Gabriel Axel’s Oscar-winning 1987 Danish film is a visual treat for any self-confessed gourmand. The story sees two pious Protestant sisters offer refuge to a French woman fleeing the political tumult in Paris after the collapse of the Second Empire in 1871. They agree to hire her as a housekeeper, All the very best chefs know that a dash of pure imagination is key to creating a true culinary wonder. It’s a lesson well-taught in Steven Spielberg’s 1991 classic, Hook, as a grown-up Peter Pan (Robin Williams) looks on in disbelief as the Lost Boys tuck into what appears to be nothing at all. It’s only when he truly believes that he can see the brightly colour feast laid out before him. And what childish feast would be complete without an old fashioned food fight? 420 Breakfast at Tiffany\u0027sSure, the 1961 film’s title may be a little misleading. Its protagonist, Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn), in reality only has breakfast outside of Tiffany’s, popping out of a cab in the early morning light to peer into the jewelry shop window, all while enjoying a pastry and some coffee in a paper. The moment has still remained the peak of glamour, decades later, so who cares if it’s all a little white lie?It’s a classic scene that proves to be surprisingly instructional. Francis Ford Coppola’s 1972 film has a full-blown recipe tucked within its elegant drama, as Vito Corleone’s close associate, Peter Clemenza (Richard Castellano), offers his version of the perfect pasta sauce. As he explains: “You start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it you make sure it doesn\u0027t stick. You get it to a boil you shove in all your sausage and your meatballs. And a little bit of wine, and a little bit of sugar—that\u0027s my trick.620 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate FactoryAlthough the 1971 musical is, as a whole, a sugary delight, it’s hardest to resist the temptation of Willy Wonka’s Fizzy Lifting Drinks, a soda described as so bubbly that it lifts anyone who drinks it right off the ground. It’s no wonder that it was the one stop on the tour that ended up tempting the pure-hearted Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) and his grandfather (Jack Albertson). Now, the real question is: does it come in different flavours?For anyone who considers pizza to be the true love of their life, Ryan Murphy’s 2010 romcom is a perfect cinematic match. It’s hard not to relate to the moment Liz Gilbert (Julia Roberts) bites into a piece of authentic Italian pizza, during the Naples stop on her global adventure of self-discovery, and declares: “I’m in love. I’m in a relationship with my pizza.”820 Beauty \u0026amp the BeastAlthough we might not fully be convinced that the grey stuff is delicious, the “dinner and show” approach to Lumiere (Jerry Orbach)’s hospitality is something we could certainly get used to. In Disney’s 1991 animation, Belle (Paige O\u0027Hara) is presented with a whole cavalcade of sumptuous dishes: including beef ragout, cheese souffle, pie and pudding en flambe. And there’s a sage piece of advice to go with it all, too: “If you\u0027re stressed, it\u0027s fine dining we suggest!” Indeed. While there’s been a growing fad of ambitious, unusually themed cakes – you need only look at the success of the TLC reality series Cake Boss – there are few cinematic cakes that quite stick in the memory like Jackson (Dylan McDermott)’s armadillo-shaped groom cake from 1989 comedy-drama Steel Magnolias, a spin on the tradition from the American South of having another cake separate to the main wedding cake. And did we mention that it’s red velvet on the inside? When it came to director Sofia Coppola conjuring the ultimate image of decadence for her 2006 biopic on the French queen, there was no more perfect treat than Ladurée’s famous macarons. Delicate and pastel-toned, the meringue-based confection has long been the speciality of the French bakery, first established in 1862. A new flavour was even created in honour of the film, with the Marie Antoinette offering a combination of rose and anise flavours.Food is often regarded as one of the best ways to understand a culture, and The Hundred-Foot Journey is wonderful for showing the efforts the talented, self-taught novice Hassan (Manish Dayal) goes to in order to comprehend that. During a picnic he reveals he has mastered the five “mother sauces” of French cuisine, and the delicate tasting process that follows demonstrates just how important food is to France.“In prison, dinner was always a big thing.” So much so that the Wise Guys ate better than most people on the outside. “Beyond the Sea” plays in the background as the gangsters prepare their meal: Garlic sliced so thin with a razor blade that it would “liquefy in the pan with just a little oil”, meatballs in a tomato sauce that’s “a little too oniony”, steak cooked medium rare, iced lobsters, prosciutto, salami, cheese, red wine and good Scotch. Maybe crime does pay after all.There are few pleasures in life more fulfilling than that of cooking for others. In Chocolat – based on the book by Joanne Harris – a slow-motion scene where dinner party guests tuck into the feast created by expert chocolatier Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) is full of warmth and laughter.In a world where people seem more than happy to fork out £15 for some mushy avocado on toast, $5 for a milkshake doesn’t seem too unreasonable. Vincent Vega (John Travolta) takes his boss’ wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out to Jack Rabbit Slim’s for a burger, where she decides she wants the “$5 dollar shake”. “You don’t put bourbon in it or nothing?” a bewildered Vincent asks the waiter. When it arrives, Mia takes a long sip: “Yummy.” “I gotta know what a $5 shake tastes like,” Vincent says. He takes a sip. Then another. “Goddamn, that’s a pretty f***ing good milkshake.”Nora Ephron’s feature film based on the intertwining stories of chef Julia Child and Julie Powell, the blogger who rose to fame after documenting her pledge to cook all 524 recipes in Child’s cookbook, is all about the joy one can find in food. It is some of the earlier scenes that capture this best, like when Julia (Meryl Streep) and her husband Paul (Stanley Tucci) arrive in Paris and stop at a French restaurant, where Julia is served a sizzling platter of sole. It looked so mouth-watering in the final edit that Ephron “wanted to call up Martin Scorcese and say, ‘you’ve never shot a fish like that before’”.  Fearsome critic Anton Ego takes a bite of ratatouille and is transported back to his childhood, where it was a favourite comfort food, in the best scene from Pixar’s wonderful animated film. The detail is superb, from the process of Remy the rat preparing the dish to the moment Ego’s pen falls to the ground as he remembers the power of a favourite meal in evoking memories we thought were lost.“I don’t want this, I want large bread… but I can rise above it, I’m a professional.” The miniature bread catastrophe is a beautiful parody on every self-absorbed rock star to have kicked off over something as ludicrous as the food they’re served backstage. Guitarist Nigel Tufnell sits next to a tray of sandwiches looking baffled as his manager walks over. Look, he says, picking up a sandwich. This, this miniature bread. It\u0027s like... I\u0027ve been working with this now for about half an hour. I can\u0027t figure it out. Let\u0027s say I want a bite, right, you\u0027ve got this... After all the trauma she has been through – at the hands of her abusive husband and a racist ex-employer – Minny (Octavia Spencer) arrives at her employer Celia Foote to find a beautiful dinner cooked for her as a thank you for everything she has done for Celia and her husband. You see the care that has gone into it as Celia lays everything out on the table, from a “mile high meringue” to the fried chicken Minny taught her how to make. “That table of food gave Minny the strength she needed,” the narration explains. “She took her babies out from under Leroy and never went back.”It was a scene that helped propel a revolution in American dining. Il Timpano, a dish inspired by the notoriously tricky-to-make Italian meal, is the star of a moment in Big Night where chef brothers Primo (Tony Shalhoub) and Secondo (Stanley Tucci) prepares it as the centrepiece for a feast attended by their rival, Pascal. “Goddamit, I should kill you,” he screams, throwing his fork down after tasting Il Timpano. “This is so f***ing good, I should kill you.”120 Lady \u0026amp the TrampWho would have guessed one of the most romantic scenes in cinema would involve two dogs eating scraps in an alleyway?

They killed many of the 123 British soldiers and 42 Royal Ulster Constabulary police who died there\u0026nbspbetween 1970 and 1997. Described by British home secretary Mervyn Rees as “bandit country”, the area\u0026nbspwas so dangerous for British forces personnel that they only travelled by helicopter. \u0026nbspBritain Before Brexit: a portrait of Northern IrelandThose lethal wires linked to explosives are long gone thanks to the Good Friday Agreement (GFA) of 1998, but in a broader sense the 310-mile-long border that ides Northern Ireland from the Irish Republic itself constitutes a trip wire which, if touched or interfered with in any way, has the capacity to trigger a political explosion that could end 20 years of peace.\u0026nbspThe removal of the physical border with its hundreds of blocked and cratered roads and blown bridges, channelling traffic through a few heavily guarded military checkpoints, was an essential part of the GFA.Protestants and Catholics, unionists and nationalist communities, which each make up about half of the 1.9 million population of Northern Ireland, could choose to be British or Irish without either being able to dominate the other. A stable balance of power between the two was held in place by an elaborate structure of institutions and laws negotiated by the leading nationalist and unionist parties of the day and buttressed by the British and Irish governments\u0026nbspacting in cooperation along with the EU.\u0026nbspThis structure has maintained a hard-won peace for over two decades, but it is now crumbling under the impact of Brexit. The referendum of 2016 opened the way for – indeed made it difficult to avoid – the resurrection of the border as an international frontier between an Irish Republic as a member of the EU, with all its rules and regulations, and the UK determined to be outside it.\u0026nbspThe radicalism and gravity of what is proposed by the Brexiteers is masked by mumbo-jumbo about “backstops”, “hard borders”\u0026nbspand “max fac” (maximum facilitation) borders that will somehow be automatically monitored by technical gadgetry which, though\u0026nbspyet to be invented, will apparently be sure to make any human presence unnecessary.The debate about the “backstop”\u0026nbspin the UK ignores the political and demographic realities on the ground in Northern Ireland.Ryanair boss calls May and Corbyn ‘idiots’ and demands end to BrexitThe threat to a hard border is often portrayed as coming from dissident Republican groups that never accepted the GFA.But these are small, fragmented, under surveillance by MI5 and lack popular nationalist support. More likely are spontaneous protests by farmers and local people on the border determined to prevent an international frontier once again cutting through their neighbourhoods.\u0026nbspAll this stuff about bar codes and cameras is nonsense because only the good guys will obey them.\u0026nbspMuch of the border runs through land populated (on both sides) by a majority of Catholics and nationalists.\u0026nbspAny new barrier would probably in practice require the deployment of military force.After all, the EU is like a club which requires porters at the door to keep non-members out\u0026nbsp– or ensure that, if they do enter, they abide by the club’s rules and regulations. In the case of\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland, s at the gate would be customs and other regulatory officials, but these could not be stationed there in the face of local nationalist opposition without police protection and the police would not come without the deployment of the British Army, which\u0026nbspwould presumably operate from a network of fortified positions,\u0026nbsppotentially even\u0026nbspblocking many of the 300 roads crossing the border – as they did in the past.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe “backstop” is portrayed as an insurance policy under which all of the UK would remain in the customs union if the UK and EU cannot agree some other way of avoiding a “hard border”. But the latter could not be recreated without reigniting the Northern Ireland conflict, something that neither nationalists nor unionists want to happen, but that might be brought about by the momentum of events, just\u0026nbspas it was in Northern Ireland in 1968-69.\u0026nbspSome supporters of Brexit argue naively that the UK government could solve the problem by allowing almost free passage of people and vehicles and relying on cooperation and goodwill to ensure that their passage, and the goods they carry, will be registered electronically.Feeney is scathing about such plans, saying: “All this stuff about bar codes and cameras is nonsense because only the good guys will obey them. The rest would cross the border from Cavan and Monaghan where there are no bar codes or anything else.”Cheap but illegal Brazilian beef and American chicken would thus flood out of the UK and into the EU through the unguarded Northern Ireland breach in its defences. The EU could not permit a trade deal with the\u0026nbspUK that allowed Northern Ireland to become a smugglers’ paradise.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.But the problem of the Irish border is not primarily about trade and commerce, important though these may be.What is really at issue here – and the “backstop” is unwittingly at the centre of this – is the shifting balance of power between the Catholics and Protestants on the island of\u0026nbspIreland.\u0026nbspBrexit may be isive in England but is even more so in Northern Ireland because it plugs into the 400-year struggle between the two communities, a historic confrontation which over the last hundred years has\u0026nbspgained its most visible expression in the island’s partition.\u0026nbspMany observers in Northern Ireland are frightened by the seeming carelessness with which the British government and the Conservative Party have presided over the rebirth of\u0026nbspthe Irish Question. They appear to ignore its toxic legacy as an issue that has bedevilled British politics from the First Home Rule Bill in 1886 until the partition of Ireland in 1921, and again during the 30-year conflict from the first Catholic civil rights march in 1968 to the GFA in 1998. \u0026nbspThe latter agreement was under pressure but was working until the Brexit vote in the UK reopened old issues and old wounds. Northern Ireland voted Remain by 56 to 44 per cent but sectarian isions have widened.Why looming collapse of cash as a means of payment is a Brexit issueJust how bad tends to be underestimated in Westminster because British politicians, aside from Tony Blair, have traditionally had a blind spot about Ireland until things go irredeemably wrong and it is too late to do anything about them. The same is largely true of the British media according to commentators in Belfast.“Those that covered the conflict 20 years ago catch on pretty quickly about what is happening here,” one local journalist told me. “Those that are here for the first time are completely bewildered because they don’t know what happened in the past.”\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspPeople who live in Northern Ireland have an acute sense of how problems that had been neutered, though\u0026nbspnot resolved, by the GFA are stirring into life.“I am grappling with the idea of a hard border which I would call a Second Partition of Ireland,” says Tom Hartley, a Sinn Fein veteran and former lord mayor of Belfast. He is baffled by British actions that appear so much against their interests, saying that “they had parked the Irish problem, but now Ireland has moved once again into the centre of British politics”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Neither the nationalist community nor Sinn Fein, which has won more than two-thirds of the nationalist vote in Northern Ireland in recent elections, wants to go back to war.Nationalists have done well out of the peace. Catholics\u0026nbspno longer face religious discrimination when it comes to jobs, housing and justice, as they did in 1968.Irish TV host tears up as she lists Troubles victims in Brexit warningSinn Fein are conscious that demographically the nationalist community is growing faster than the loyalist one:\u0026nbspalready 51 per cent of school children are Catholics compared to 37 per cent who are Protestants. Within two years, the Catholics may be the majority of the voting population, though this does not necessarily guarantee political power.I lived in Belfast between 1972 and 1975 writing a PhD about Joe Devlin, the northern nationalist leader in the first decades of the 20th century, at the Institute of Irish Studies which was part\u0026nbspof Queens University. These were the worst years of the Troubles. In 1972 alone some 479 people were killed, including 135 soldiers, and 4,876 were injured.Everybody in Northern Ireland has a lot to lose and not a lot to gain, but some of the most important struts of the agreement that established long term peace have been cut away by the British government in pursuit of BrexitI got used to the sounds of bombs and gunfire and the sectarian geography of Belfast became imprinted on my brain. Along with the rest of the population, I automatically calculated the real proximity of danger without giving the matter much thought.I once showed a visiting American publisher around the city and, years later, he told me that he had been struck by one moment during our tour when he had queried me about the route we were taking, saying: “I thought you said this street was dangerous?” And I had replied, as if stating the obvious: “No, I said that that side of the street was dangerous, but the side we are on is safe.”\u0026nbspAlmost everything is safe in Belfast today, though the sectarian boundaries are largely the same as they were 50 years ago.I drove through the site of Harland and Wolff shipyard that at its peak employed 35,000 men, almost all Protestants from east Belfast. Today it is the site of the Titanic exhibition which is, along with other developments, dwarfed by the enormous yellow gantry crane marked H \u0026amp W in giant letters. Housing is, and has always been, segregated in Belfast and east Belfast remains a Protestant stronghold, aside from a small Republican nationalist enclave called Short Strand pressed up against the Lagan river. It is protected by one of the many peace lines or walls in the city topped by metal staves.“They got higher when the Protestants discovered catapults,” said a local observer, who pointed to the grills over the windows and the slates on the roofs that look normal but are made out of metal so they do not break when stones hurled over the peace wall hit them.\u0026nbspI once had a shabby flat off the Antrim Road in north Belfast, but I could not remember the name of the street. This used to be a particularly murderous part of Belfast because of the jigsaw puzzle of Protestant and Catholic districts permanently engaged in low level war against each other, most often in the shape of tit-for-tat or retaliatory killings.“Get your retaliation in first,” was an old Belfast joke, though retaliation was not necessarily local. If a Catholic was killed in Short Strand where the Catholics were weak and outnumbered, then the retaliatory killing of a Protestant might be arranged from Ardoyne, where the Catholics were strong and well organised.Likewise, if a Protestant UDR (Ulster Defence Regiment) soldier was shot by the IRA in County Fermanagh 70 miles to the west, there might be a tit-for-tat revenge murder of a Catholic in Belfast.\u0026nbspPeace may have come but militant commemorative murals showing fallen heroes and historic scenes on the side walls of houses are repainted every few years.“The Republican ones became rather ethereal a few years ago, but now they are showing more guns,” commented a friend. One enormous mural on a wall in the Ardoyne shows a wounded James Connolly, the socialist leader, in the GPO in Dublin during the Easter Rising in 1916. \u0026nbspDerry Girls and MPs stage Northern Ireland abortion protestWhy abortion remains illegal in Northern IrelandMPs urge government to redraft new domestic abuse billElaborate\u0026nbspcommemorative shrines to fallen Republican martyrs, who died fighting the British security forces, are common all over west Belfast, the political heart of the northern nationalist community. But the British Army fortresses in the area have all gone, the places where they once stood used for public housing or community centres. The Falls Road, which\u0026nbspused to be one of the world’s most menacing streets, looks spruce and cheerful with fewer closed shops than most British cities.I had mostly lived close to Queens University during my three years in Belfast, but when I went back the houses along University Road had been demolished, which was no great loss, and replaced with better looking buildings. The pub where I used to drink, the Club Bar, had been replaced, so far as I could see, by a small Tesco store.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCould Belfast and Northern Ireland go back to the three-cornered battle between Protestants, Catholics and the British security forces which I had witnessed?Everybody in Northern Ireland has a lot to lose and not a lot to gain, but some of the most important struts of the agreement\u0026nbspthat established long-term peace have been cut away by the British government in pursuit of Brexit or because some in its ranks see the GFA as a Labour project that mistakenly diluted British control over Northern Ireland. \u0026nbspThe bits of the GFA that have been abandoned are important.\u0026nbspThe British government is meant to be neutral between unionists and nationalists so as to enable it to play a mediating role between the two communities. David Cameron and later Theresa May have shown their support for the unionists, a bias that became total when Ms May\u0026nbspbecame reliant on the DUP for her parliamentary majority.Similarly, the British and Irish governments were supposed to cooperate if local power sharing arrangements failed, as they have\u0026nbspbut the government has shown increasing hostility to the nationalists in the north and to any role by the Dublin government.The most destabilising factor in Northern Ireland today is the British government itself.We’ll tell you what’s true.

This\u0026nbspallowed\u0026nbspthe screen to blend into the wall behind it.TVs are turns on for only five hours a day on average, yet they occupy a large space on the wall in the living room,\u0026nbspthe firm\u0026nbspsaid at the time.\u0026nbspThis means TVs hang on the wall just as a black screen for more than 19 hours every day. With a TV turned off, it is easier to see dust or fingerprints on the screen – especially when the screen is large.Efforts to minimise the visual impact of wires trailing behind the TV have also been made previously, with high-end sets now shipping with Samsung\u0027s OneConnect box.Galaxy Fold: Samsung plans two more foldable phonesIt works by combining all the wires into one cable that can be threaded relatively tidily up to the TV.\u0026nbspSamsung already makes use of wireless power technology in some of its devices, including its flagship range of Galaxy S10 smartphones.There is no word yet on when a wireless television\u0026nbspmight be released and Samsung does not comment on rumours surrounding unreleased products.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Used for conditions such as myopia and cataracts.The team stuck electrodes into the water of four hot springs, and left them for a month to be colonised by the bacteria.“The natural conditions found in geothermal features such as hot springs are difficult to replicate in laboratory settings,” said Dr Haluk Beyenal, who supervised the study.\u0026nbsp“So, we developed a new strategy to enrich heat-loving bacteria in their natural environment.”Some of these electricity-producing bacteria have the power to convert toxic pollutants into less harmful substances.Two types of bacteria ‘consistently low in people with depression’As they do so, the electrons passing through their body as they digest their food are dumped outside their bodies on minerals or metals, using hair-like structures that protrude from their bodies like wires.This produces a stream of electricity in an efficient process that can conceivably be used in low-power applications.While scientists hope that the\u0026nbspmicrobes could one day\u0026nbsppower\u0026nbspall kinds of systems, they have been limited by the handful of varieties that have been grown in labs.But by employing the naturally occurring populations in places like Yellowstone, they hope they can develop something that helps to both produce electricity and clear up pollutants.We’ll tell you what’s true.

It’s aiming for a morning splashdown in the Atlantic off Florida’s coast, the final hurdle of the six-day test flight. Saturday’s launch and Sunday’s docking were spot on.\u0026nbspCanadian station astronaut David Saint-Jacques was the first to enter the Dragon when it arrived and the last to leave. He found the capsule “very slick” and called it business class.\u0026nbspNASA astronauts have been stuck riding Russian rockets since space shuttles retired eight years ago. NASA is counting on SpaceX and Boeing to start launching astronauts this year. SpaceX is aiming for summer.We\u0027re not going to\u0026nbspsee\u0026nbspevery part of the mission because of a communications blackout. But we should be able to follow along and hear most of the important parts.(For context, there\u0027s no way the US can do this at the moment: its hope was always the Space Shuttle programme, so when that was cancelled it was left without a way of travelling up and down. Now it has to rely on the Russian space agency, which it pays to take astronauts to the ISS.\u0026nbspIf this works, it could change all that, by completing a plan to let private US companies build the rockets and capsules that will allow them to fly to space again. So it\u0027s a big day for Nasa and space travel generally, as well as SpaceX.)Please allow a moment for the live blog to load.Created with Sketch.SpaceX Dragon heads back to earth after ISS mission Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Space X Dragon departs from the International Space Station and heads for earthSpace X Dragon undocks from the International Space StationSpaceX Crew Dragon is pictured about 20 meters (66 feet) away from the International Space StationA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the Crew Dragon spacecraft, lifts off on March 2 2019Astronauts aboard the Space Station preparing to open hatchet to the SpaceX Dragon capsule carrying a instrumented dummy after it successfully docked with Space StationA dummy(L) named Ripley onboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket with the company\u0027s Crew Dragon spacecraft onboard after the opening of the hatch during the Demo-1 missioNThe SpaceX team watches as the SpaceX Crew Dragon docks with the International Space StationSpaceX Falcon 9 rocket docked with the International Space Station during the Demo-1 missionA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the Crew Dragon spacecraftAstronaut David Saint-Jacques taking a look inside the SpaceX Dragon capsule carrying a instrumented dummyA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the Crew Dragon spacecraft lifts off on an uncrewed test flightA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the Crew Dragon spacecraft, lifts off on an uncrewed test flight A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket with a demo Crew Dragon spacecraft on an uncrewed test flightSpaceX\u0027s new crew capsule approaches just before dockingAstronaut Eric Boe, assistant to the chief of the astronaut office for commercial crew, left, and Norm Knight, deputy director of flight operations at Nasa\u0027s Johnson Space Center watch the launch of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying the company\u0027s Crew Dragon spacecraftSpace X Dragon departs from the International Space Station and heads for earthSpace X Dragon undocks from the International Space StationSpaceX Crew Dragon is pictured about 20 meters (66 feet) away from the International Space StationA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the Crew Dragon spacecraft, lifts off on March 2 2019Astronauts aboard the Space Station preparing to open hatchet to the SpaceX Dragon capsule carrying a instrumented dummy after it successfully docked with Space StationA dummy(L) named Ripley onboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket with the company\u0027s Crew Dragon spacecraft onboard after the opening of the hatch during the Demo-1 missioNThe SpaceX team watches as the SpaceX Crew Dragon docks with the International Space StationSpaceX Falcon 9 rocket docked with the International Space Station during the Demo-1 missionA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the Crew Dragon spacecraftAstronaut David Saint-Jacques taking a look inside the SpaceX Dragon capsule carrying a instrumented dummyA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the Crew Dragon spacecraft lifts off on an uncrewed test flightA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the Crew Dragon spacecraft, lifts off on an uncrewed test flight A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket with a demo Crew Dragon spacecraft on an uncrewed test flightSpaceX\u0027s new crew capsule approaches just before dockingAstronaut Eric Boe, assistant to the chief of the astronaut office for commercial crew, left, and Norm Knight, deputy director of flight operations at Nasa\u0027s Johnson Space Center watch the launch of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying the company\u0027s Crew Dragon spacecraftBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Political editor Joe Watts explain whyClick to followIndy PoliticsGeoffrey Cox has found himself in the growing dictionary of BrexitismsThere was a bizarre moment in the Commons on Thursday when MPs appeared more concerned with an item of Tudor attire that covered a man’s dignity, than they were with governing the country.The codpiece, as modelled by Henry VIII in almost any portrait, is a sort of upturned pouch designed to shield and also draw attention to a gentleman’s crotch.But the word’s vague similarity\u0026nbspto\u0026nbspattorney general Geoffrey Cox’s surname\u0026nbspand to a particular legal device, means it has now entered the growing dictionary of Brexitisms that afflicts our news copy.Phrases such as “the Malthouse compromise”, “the Brady amendment”, “Canada plus, plus, plus”, “Maximum Facilitation”, “Max Fac 2”, \u0026nbsp“the backstop” and “the backstop to the backstop” will now be joined by “Cox’s codpiece”.It manifested out of Cox’s efforts to secure a new addition to Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement – he wants to use a legal instrument to create\u0026nbspa legally binding way for the UK government to say it wants Britain to leave the dreaded “backstop”\u0026nbsp(an arrangement the UK could otherwise be trapped in indefinitely if it fails to secure a future trade deal with the EU by 2020).Created with Sketch.

Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.But the device he is seeking to use is in legal circles called a codicil – which no-one really knew how to say beyond a courtroom until this month – and so it was replaced with “codpiece”.The phrase finally sealed its place in the Brexit dictionary when the man himself told MPs on Thursday: “It is government policy to achieve the necessary change in the backstopBrexit department’s top civil servant to retire just as UK to leave EU“That is government policy, that is the subject of the discussions that we are having. I would say that it has come to be called ‘Cox’s codpiece’. What I am concerned to ensure is that what is inside the codpiece is in full working order.”A canny way for the attorney general to avoid answering what had actually been quite a difficult question on the government’s approach.The problem for Mr Cox is that as far as anyone can tell at this point, it does not look like his negotiations to secure a codicil or an addendum or an annexe or anything else to\u0026nbspthe agreement are going anywhere.The EU – which is adamant that the backstop in its current form should remain untouched – said that there is no solution to the impasse in sight.If Cox cannot achieve an adequate change, the government will\u0026nbspnot get the support of Tory MPs and the DUP, and the government’s deal falls.The irony maybe that, given the intransigence in Brussels, whatever the attorney general does come back with in a bid to convince Tory Eurosceptics, may represent an altogether different item of biblical attire.

It\u0027s time that she got on board and recognised there is a deal that could command a majority in the House.According to a new poll by The  published this morning, voters in Northern Ireland\u0026nbspoverwhelmingly\u0026nbspreject a hard Brexit - and would rather remain in the EU.\u0026nbspSignificantly, two thirds of those polled said the Democratic Unionst Party (DUP) - responsible for propping up Theresa May\u0027s government - is doing a bad job of representing the people of Northern Ireland at Westminster.\u0026nbspA further 69 per cent of people are also dissatisfied\u0026nbspwith party\u0027s leader, Arlene Foster.\u0026nbspHere is the extract from Downing Street released on Thursday evening ahead of the prime minister\u0027s speech on Brexit this afternoon. The location of her speech is Grimsby - an area where 71 per cent of residents voted to leave the EU in June 2016.\u0026nbsp“Just as MPs will face a big choice next week, the EU has to make a choice too.\u0026nbsp“We are both participants in this process.\u0026nbsp“It is in the European interest for the UK to leave with a deal.\u0026nbsp“We are working with them but the decisions that the European Union makes over the next few days will have a big impact on the outcome of the vote.”Please allow a moment for the liveblog\u0026nbspto loadWe’ll tell you what’s true.

That means getting this agreement through in a way that doesn\u0027t inject poison into our relations for many years to come.That\u0027s what the UK has said we want to do, it\u0027s what most people in the UK want and feel very strongly about.But it does need the EU also to be flexible in these negotiations and understand that we now have a very, very clear ask.MPs will vote on Tuesday on whether to support Ms May\u0027s deal, in a second meaningful vote that could determine the course of Brexit.It follows the humiliating 230-vote defeat Ms May\u0026nbspsuffered the last time the Commons passed judgment on her Brexit deal in January.Mr Hunt said:\u0026nbspWe know what it would take to get a deal through the House of Commons, and that is for a significant change to allow the attorney general to change his advice to the government and say we couldn\u0027t be trapped in a customs union forever.That\u0027s not an unreasonable thing to ask and we have made, I think, some progress in the last few days. There\u0027s a bit more to make. It\u0027s entirely possible to get there.And frankly I think future generations, if this ends in acrimony, will say that the EU got this moment wrong. And I really hope they don\u0027t.Conservative Party deputy chairman James Cleverly said it was inevitable that the UK and the EU have ended up at this point and urged colleagues to hold their nerve as the final point of a negotiation of this magnitude it gets most intense, it gets most difficult, it gets most challenging.May makes last ditch plea for EU to give ground in Brexit talksHe added: I think we are getting close to the point where modest but significant changes can unlock this.Elsewhere, international trade secretary Liam Fox urged Conservative Brexiteers to rally behind the deal or run the risk of Brexit not happening.The thing that I fear is that there will be ... a risk that we might not deliver Brexit at all, he told BBC\u0027s Newsnight.In parliament there are a large number of MPs who do not see it as their primary objective to deliver on the referendum and would want to keep us locked to the European Union.Negotiators are preparing to work through the weekend in a frantic effort to break the deadlock over the backstop measures, which are aimed at preventing a hard border with Ireland if no alternative trading arrangements are in place.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Or do you want to Remain?’ “It would be a confirmation referendum, a bit like what happened with the Good Friday Agreement.”Created with Sketch.Political figures caricatured at German carnival Show all 22Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Prime Minister Theresa May is depicted as piercing the economy with BrexitUS president Donald Trump is depicted as an angel flying behind Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman who is wielding a bloody chainsaw Italian Inteior Minister and deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini is depicted as feeding racism and nationalism.

At this point we should be pushing for a deal.“Some have already said they won’t support another referendum\u0026nbspbut there is a larger group that might go with the whip but are just really worried about the direction we’ve taken.”Ian Lavery, the party chairman, has also raised strong concerns about the party’s position, warning\u0026nbspthe shadow cabinet this week that\u0026nbspMr Corbyn would not become prime minister if the party backed a fresh\u0026nbspreferendum.Mr Corbyn said yesterday that\u0026nbsphis meeting with Sir Oliver and Mr Boles, together with Labour’s Lucy Powell and Stephen Kinnock, had left him\u0026nbsp”more certain than ever” that a Brexit deal could be agreed.\u0026nbspWriting for the Daily Mirror, he said:\u0026nbsp“Yesterday, I saw senior Labour and Conservative MPs to discuss a close economic relationship with the EU, which would help protect jobs like those of the Honda workers in Swindon, some of whom I also met.“I left both meetings more certain than ever that we can find a way to work across parliament to force the government to back a sensible Brexit plan that protects jobs and more determined to achieve it.“I will continue to reach out to get a decent Brexit deal so our country can spend more time talking about our children’s future than a customs union.”Appearing to shift away from backing a fresh referendum, the Labour leader said a soft Brexit deal was “the best Brexit compromise for for both 17 million Leave voters and 16 million Remain voters”, adding: ”But we can’t accept a damaging Tory Brexit or a no deal outcome, so we also support preparing for a public vote in case parliament is not able to achieve a sensible Brexit.”Mr Corbyn’s latest attempts to help pave the way for a Brexit deal are likely to anger party members and many MPs, who insist it should be focusing its attention on a fresh referendum that could stop Britain leaving the EU.While the “Common Market 2.0” proposal being pushed by Sir Oliver and Mr Boles is\u0026nbspnot identical to Labour’s own preferred\u0026nbspplan, there is a significant degree of overlap, raising the prospect of a cross-party consensus for a soft Brexit.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMPs will vote on Ms May’s proposed deal next week. If it is rejected a second time, the government has promised to let the Commons vote on whether to pursue a no-deal outcome or seek to extend the Article 50 process.A Labour spokesperson said: “The best outcome for the country is an immediate general election that can sweep the Tories from power.“If we cannot get a general election Labour supports all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

The\u0026nbspring was a reminder to men in the remote community in South Sudan that the child was “ready for marriage”.The\u0026nbspwomen’s rights activist turned radio host recalls that haunting memory and countless others she has encountered in her work while speaking to the audience of Peace of Her Mind.The weekly talk show is South Sudan’s first female-run radio programme and it tackles some of the toughest and most grim issues women face in the world’s youngest country, including child brides.Set up last summer,\u0026nbspin conjunction with Oxfam International, it airs on\u0026nbspSouth Sudan’s Eye Radio, which broadcasts across the country.\u0026nbsp“The radio is changing people’s minds. People are listening to the show and learning,” Ms Kiden tells\u0026nbspThe Independent from her office in Juba, where the show is based.\u0026nbspThe South Sudanese rights advocate grew up in a refugee camp in Uganda after fleeing South Sudan in 1995 during the country’s 20-year bloody war for independence with the north.She was inspired by her mother, who fetched water to make money to keep her children fed and clothed. And so on returning to South Sudan in the early\u0026nbsp2000s, Ms\u0026nbspKiden\u0026nbspdedicated her life to fighting for women’s rights, including helping set up the radio show.Gender-based violence is an increasing problem in South Sudan, which plunged back into civil war in 2013,\u0026nbspafter gaining independence from the north in 2011.1.5 million on brink of starvation in South Sudan, despite peace dealThe UN has said rape was used as a weapon of war in the five-year conflict, which nominally ended in the autumn with a peace deal signed between President Salva Kiir Mayardit and rebels.Women have been among the most affected by the violence. According to\u0026nbspUnicef, 65 per cent of women and girls have experienced physical andor sexual violence in their lifetime, and approximately 51 per cent have suffered domestic violence.Meanwhile, poverty, violence and hunger are driving\u0026nbspa spike in child marriages as families are increasingly forced to promise their young daughters to grooms in exchange for food and cattle dowries or protection.Although official statistics are not available, in areas like Nyal, in the north, Oxfam said new data it has gathered showed as much as 71 per cent of all girls were married underage, making it the second highest rate in the world after Niger.\u0026nbspWomen are traditionally expected to be the breadwinners, responsible for securing food and water for the family as well as being the chief parent and housekeeper,\u0026nbspMs Kiden explained.But at the same time, they are rarely given the opportunity to express themselves, are often not permitted to go to school and do not\u0026nbsprealise what their rights are, she added.Poverty and hunger are fuelling the rise in South Sudan’s child bridesLost boys: the child soldiers of South SudanSouth Sudan’s need for humanitarian funding is ever more urgentThis is at the heart of Peace of her Mind, which does not pull any punches with its subject matter.So far, they have tackled everything from child marriage and the dangers of early childbirth to domestic violence and rape.The pilot was first aired last summer and the show started broadcasting every Friday in the autumn. It reaches communities from the south to the north of the country.Its main host is veteran South Sudanese reporter Hellen Samuel known as “Mama Hellen” who said it was an important platform for women to learn their basic rights and open a conversation about taboo subjects.Ms Kiden said the all-female team were surprised when at the launch of the show most of the callers were men. \u0026nbsp“I had one male caller defending child marriage. He was saying that by the time a woman was 20 she was too old and no one would marry her,” Ms Kiden explains. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLoice Kiden is a host on South Sudan’s new Peace of Her Mind show tackling issues women face in the war-ravaged country (Oxfam International )“I always lead by example and so used myself as one,” she adds.Ms Kiden told the man she was 30,\u0026nbspunmarried, and armed with a university degree that allowed her to secure a decent living to properly support her family. She said she was not worried about finding a husband.“I said that letting a girl be educated would be double the profit,” she jokes:\u0026nbsp“This lady would be able to buy him many more cows through working.”Another male caller argued child marriage was important as it helped South Sudan increase its population.“I told them there are a lot of cases of women dying in childbirth because their bodies were not prepared to give birth,” she recalls. \u0026nbspSlowly the team have noticed a change in attitudes of those calling into the show.Rhea Catada, who works for Oxfam in South Sudan, says that radio is an important medium in South Sudan, where literacy rates are very low.According to the UN’s latest statistics, 80 per cent of women in South Sudan cannot read or write, while 70 per cent of men are illiterate.“Radio is very influential, and the show is sparking important debates,” she tells The Independent.“It’s also important that this show is independent,” she adds.Radio is very influential, and the show is sparking important debatesMs Kiden says the show, giving women a voice, came at a crucial time.The government promised in the peace deal to ensure that 35 per cent of the country’s executive positions were filled by women – but that has yet to happen.\u0026nbsp“Women are behind everything in South Sudan and are the most affected by the conflict,” Ms Kiden says.“It is important for their voice to be heard so that lawmakers, officials, leaders can know the full impact of the conflict on our country and so how to put it back together again.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

But we are still asking the SMEs and all other parties to wait. Do the necessary export to your customers before 29 March,” he told Belgian business newspaper De Tijd.Mr Vanderwaeren said that larger industries “such as pharmaceutical companies and car manufacturers” had been storing stock in the UK for months to avoid having to get parts through after Brexit but that the vast majority of businesses were not well prepared with just weeks to go.Belgium’s main port of Zeebrugge is expected to have to deal with around a million additional import declarations and 4.5 million extra export declarations once the UK leave leaves the single market and customs union.Huge queues for Eurostar passengers after no-deal border checks trialThe warning follows chaos and hours of delays at Calais and the Eurostar terminal in Paris after French customs officers carried out a trial of the sort of checks they would have to impose under a no-deal Brexit.The customs chief also warned that many small businesses that dealt with the UK were simply not prepared to export and that it would be better for them to pause operations.“Our customs authority has written letters to some 20,000 companies that trade with the UK telling them they have to apply for an EORI number, which is necessary to be able to import and export,” he told the newspaper.“But today, three weeks before the Brexit, customs received only 4,700 positive answers. Customs has even set up a call centre that answers questions and calls companies to get them to register for customs licences.”France, the Netherlands, and Belgium have all hired hundreds of extra customs officers to deal with potential disruption caused by the UK’s decision.Unless Article 50 is extended or revoked, Britain is set to leave on 29 March, around three weeks. If Theresa May’s Brexit deal is approved by MPs the UK will enter a transition period and little will change immediately – but there are few signs the government has the numbers in the House of Commons to get it approved.If there is no extension of revocation and no transition period, the UK will crash out and the expected chaos at ports and airports will materialise.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentThe UK government unveiled plans last month to wave through EU imports under a no-deal Brexit in a bid to head off disruption.

I know, I know. It really could go either way, that one, couldn’t it  You might end up looking as toned as Joe Wicks — or more like Piers Morgan with an industrial air compressor up his rear.Fortunately, ITV and its diet expert Michael Mosley had gathered “six famous guinea pigs” to gorge themselves stupid and settle this debate for good: Nadine, Hayley Tamaddon off Coronation Street, Peter Andre, Made In Cha’s Hugo Taylor, “Chaser” Shaun Wallace and Tessa Sanderson, who all brought their own degree of hype and range of medical quirks to the experiment.Hayley, for instance, has irritable bowel syndrome, while Hugo suffers from a debilitating strain of irritable personality syndrome and is prone to quoting the Dalai Lama or grandly announcing: “I’m trying to do this for other people. It’s kind of, like, a selfless act.” Or it was, until Hugo decided he couldn’t be arsed and pulled out of the experiment at the end of Week One.The other five kept eating, eating, eating, though, until their bodies began to groan, fart and generally give up on their owners. Hayley and Tessa both had to be withdrawn from the process on health grounds, Shaun Wallace developed sleep apnoea and Nadine began passing “rubber pellets”.One other thing also became apparent during the opening few days of The Junk Food Experiment. Their innards could’ve been begging for mercy and Nadine might well have been on the verge of crapping a cc song, but they all looked exactly the same.It was no sort of spectacle at all, so they tried perking it up with all sorts of production stunts. Peter Andre went for a brain scan that revealed it’s  per cent McFlurry, Michael Mosley entered a competitive eating challenge and Shaun Wallace was sent to his local pub quiz, where he misidentied “the unwanted, loud screeching sounds you sometimes hear from a microphone or speaker” as “white noise” rather than the correct answer, Little Mix.On Day , Nadine also went for another dump — and I don’t know what she was thinking while she sat there, but my mind was wandering to the fact it’s now  years since ITV axed World In Action, a show that was sold around the world and conducted the investigation leading to the release of the Birmingham Six.Here we are now, two decades later, watching six self-publicists come to the the “no-s***, Sherlock” conclusion of the century — eating nothing but pizzas and fast food is bad for you.With the most damning fact of all being that ITV, at the very least, is sending mixed messages about the obesity crisis on its network Hub, where I watched The Junk Food Experiment and every other show received the same promo message.“Sponsored by Domino’s — the official food of unmissable entertainment.”Thanks for your concern, though, ITV. It’s overwhelming.Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In the northern hemisphere, the spring equinox always falls in what month ”Anne: “December.”Ben Shephard: “The Ace Of Spades was a UK Top Ten hit in  for which hard-rock band ”Ang: “N-Dubz.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “What McVitie’s chocolate biscuit is named after a flightless bird ”Andy: “Dodo.”Ben Shephard: “In the  film The Rocky Horror Picture Show, which British actor starred as Doctor Frank N Furter ”Tracey: “Sir Anthony Hopkins.”YOU think Theresa May’s got a job on her hands   Spare a thought for the staff on E’s Celebs Go Dating, where they’ve signed up Kerry Katona for the new series. ’Cos that really is the TV equivalent of trying to shove a boulder up Kilimanjaro.Hiring a woman who introduces herself to every potential suitor by announcing: “I’ve got five kids and three ex-husbands, but don’t let that put you off” and describes herself as a “blue-tick shag”, which I thought had wiped out nearly every sheep in West Glamorgan back in .In fairness to Kerry, it does also hint at a level of fame that’s way above the rest of the agency’s clients, who include the thoroughly obnoxious Che Healey, from Hollyoaks, Made In Cha manchild Sam Thompson, Pete Wicks off Towie and someone called David Potts, who could be Mark “The Beast” Labbett’s Chase stunt double, judging by the size of him.None of them, of course, will find anything approaching love on a show where they now boast an impressive  per cent failure rate across six series. What continues to stop it being the most pointless exercise in TV history, though, is the narrator Rob Beckett, who’s fantastically dismissive about everyone and everything involved with Celebs Go Dating.So when David finally reveals “I’m a club rep”, he mutters: “I was thinking either that or a jockey,” and when Kerry reminds yet another person, “I used to be in a girlband,” Rob adds: “Before realising her dream of flogging frozen prawn rings.”In the brutal and relentless process, he’s somehow turned this epic non-event into one of television’s funniest shows, and I just wish the industry could come up with a better reward for him than All Together Now.The Real Marigold On Tour, Paul Nicholas: “There is humour in everything.” See Martin Clunes’ sitcom Warren for proof there really isn’t.BEST news of the TV week is that Channel ’s admirably un-PC The Bachelor has ed to our screens after a seven-year hiatus.Prize this time is a civilian called Alex, who was “bullied at school” , found salvation in the gym and now spends his days running along beaches, like a right dobber.

I mean who, in their imaginations, wants to eliminate the human race It is worth looking at some data. Many of the kids, led by Greta herself, argue that governments are “doing nothing” to reduce carbon emissions.  Not that they are failing to do enough – which is a legitimate argument – but that they are doing nothing.Yet figures published on Monday show an astounding decline in Britain’s CO₂ output. According to statistics released by Carbon Brief,  saw the sixth consecutive fall in the carbon pumped by Britain into the atmosphereTotal emissions are down by  per cent since , a record unmatched by any other major country. With the exception of , the year of the General Strike, you have to go back to  to find a lower level of carbon output.Given the rise in our population in the meantime, that figure is even more impressive. In per capita terms, we have now reduced CO₂ emissions to the level of .You can of course argue that there is still more to do. But “doing nothing”  Seriously  Yet that is indeed the claim being made by eco-activists. They are asserting that governments, including ours, are deliberately wasting time for some reason that no one ever quite explains, but that vaguely has to do with “putting profits before people”.Listen to the way in which the London marchers explained their behaviour in a video put out by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. One after another, the young people claimed that they were protesting against people who were quite happy to wreck Planet Earth.“The government doesn’t really care about our future,” said the first demonstrator. “They’re just trying to waste time,” said the second. “I really care about it, because it’s gonna be my kids who wake up and the world’s in pieces,” said the third. “We’re the ones who have to live here,” said the fourth.And where do you suppose the rest of us will be living  I mean, I get that it is tempting to demonise your opponents, but not wanting their own kids to survive  That’s not exactly setting the bar high, is it To be fair, most of us see the world in black-and-white when we’re in our teens. Think back to what you used to read or watch at that age. Young adult literature doesn’t really go in for shades of grey, does it  J.K Rowling doesn’t try to explain what makes the Malfoys nasty. Their nastiness is a given.Some youngsters extend their Harry Potter view of the world into politics, ing the world, not into Leftists and Rightists, but into goodies and baddies. Why would someone want to poison the seas or burn the rainforests  Because – weren’t you listening  – they’re baddies.Most of us eventually learn that le is more complicated than that. For example, Britain has seen huge reductions in its CO₂ emissions because, under Margaret Thatcher, it stopped subsidising unprofitable coalmines. At that time, the sort of people who now march against climate change were marching against the closures.The reason that the United Statesis also seeing a sharp fall in its carbon output is that it is has taken up large-scale fracking – again, a technology that many of the marchers hate.But rehearsing these arguments means acknowledging that things aren’t always simple. It means understanding that there is a trade-off between opportunities for deprived communities and carbon output. It means grasping that most carbon emissions come from China and India. It means recognising the contradiction between “mining coal good” and “burning coal bad”.Most of the marchers will come to understand these things. But some will carry on telling themselves that people who disagree with them are, like the Malfoys, just evil. A few will never grow out of their teen certainties at all.

If Theresa May were to win such a vote for a second time then there is no ­obligation for the Government to follow mere motions of the Commons.Similarly, ­ministers who cannot support Government policy are entitled to leave the Government, as the honourable recent example of George Eustice shows.Naturally, the Government must prove that it is committed to the referendum result, for that is the authoritative ­constitutional voice.No responsible government ought to allow the constitution to be subverted because of its own weaknesses. The ­conventions are there for good ­reasons and,ignored, confidence in the system that has served well for ­centuries will be damaged — with ­consequences that could include the rise of extremist parties. Failure to deliver Brexit would be a gt to Tommy Robinson.Fortunately, it is in the power of the Government, and especially of Mrs May, to deliver Brexit.  Votes in the House of Commons cannot override the law.If they could we would have arbitrary government and the law says we leave at the end of this month.The Prime Minister could simply refuse to ask for an extension or to move the ­Statutory Instrument that is needed to change the date. Mrs May may choose to fulfil or to break her promises to the electorate and will be held to account accordingly.Eurosceptics must similarly be guided by the electorate — it is our duty and obligation to those who trusted that the vote in  would be decisive and would be implemented.This makes it necessary to vote against the current deal as well as efforts to move the date beyond March .The people have spoken.

It’s time for a new generation to take over and govern dferently”.Blasting today’s political leaders as “a profession of insincerity”, Mr Mercer will also insist all MPs must be more honest and upfront with voters to win back their trust.Turning on some older Tories, Mr Mercer - tipped as a future Tory leader – will go on: “I love many of my colleagues dearly, but we’ve selected too many of the wrong people over the last twenty years.“We must be courageous enough to hold a mirror up to ourselves”.Speaking at an event organised by the think tank Onward, Mr Mercer will also call for the Tories toto a more compassionate brand of One Nation politics after two years of bitter feuding over Brexit.Showing empathy is the key to reclaiming millions of centre ground voters who currently feel politically homeless, he will argue.The Plymouth Moor View MP will insist Tory MPs must “walk in people’s shoes, govern with compassion as well as fiscal competence, look for common ground, reject the extremes, and ditch the spin”.He will added: “There is a country out there, full of hope, full of optimism, desperately looking for something to vote for.“We are not a hard left country – people don’t want the socialism of Jeremy Corbyn. They want a modern, centre-right values led party.“If we do that, we’ll reach out to plenty of people who feel politically homeless. We’ll connect. We’ll build a movement, not a party.”Mr Mercer will also name-check a series of younger Tory MPs as the party’s future in his speech.He will champion two campaigners for causes from more ordinary backgrounds, AE nurse Maria Caulfield and former postman Scott Mann.And he also heaps praise on Tracey Crouch, who resigned as Sports Minister to force through curbs on fixed odds betting terminals, as well as Cabinet Office minister and ex-No aide Oliver Dowden.Mr Mercer’s broadside heaps yet more pressure on Mrs May to set her departure date for later this year once Brexit has taken place.The PM was forced to promise she would stand down before the  general election in December to fend off a bid by angry Brexiteer Tories to oust her.But despite her own MPs growing frustrations with her, Mrs May last week signalled she wants to stay on in No for some time yet to deliver on her domestic agenda.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

All forbidden under the new rules.The Farmdrop episode is an early sign that there is more to the crackdown on so-called “junk food” than we have been led to believe.Last year, the Government proposed a ban on junk food adverts on television before pm, a ban on junk food being displayed at the entrance of shops or at the end of supermarket aisles, and a ban on junk food being sold at a discount.But junk food has no legal definition. It is a pejorative term used by campaigners such as chef Jamie Oliver to push their nanny state agenda.In practice, the legislation will apply to all food or drink considered to be high in fat, salt or sugar— and that includes the kind of food your grandmother would have approved of, such as butter and jam.The official definition of HFSS was drawn up over a decade ago, when Tony Blair banned junk food advertising on children’s television.A system was devised in which food products were given a mark out of , with points added for “negative” nutrients — such as saturated fat, sugar and sodium — and points subtracted for “positive” nutrients such as fruit, vegetables, protein and fibre.Calories are also counted as negative nutrients. If a food gets more than four points, it is classed as HFSS and cannot be advertised on children’s TV.The system was never intended to be a measure of “junk food” or “unhealthy food”. It was only supposed to distinguish “less healthy” food from “more healthy” food for the purposes of encouraging children to eat better.Nevertheless, the system has since been adopted by the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, for his ban on junk food advertising on public transport.It could also soon be used to decide which products can be advertised before pm, which products can be included in discount deals and which products can be displayed in prominent areas of shops.In reality, the system sets the bar for “healthy food” so high that it condemns hundreds of everyday products as junk.Nearly all bacon, burgers, sweets, crisps, desserts and biscuits fail the test, but other products classied as HFSS include ketchup, mayonnaise , jam, honey, Marmite, soy sauce, mustard, gravy, stock cubes, butter and olive oil.I have never met anyone who thinks that raisins, sultanas, hummus, walnuts, pesto, olive bread, dressed salads and tomato soup are unhealthy, yet all would be covered by the Government’s proposed bans.So too would dried fruit, cereal bars, margarine, most tinned fruit, most yoghurts, nearly all cheese , many pasta sauces and one in four sandwiches.Asthis system were not puritanical enough, Public Health England is in the process of making it even harder for food and drink to be classed as “more healthy”.A new version will soon come into effect that will classy all yoghurt drinks, a quarter of pasta brands, a quarter of noodle brands, most high-fibre breakfast cereals,  per cent of coffee and  per cent of fruit juice and smoothies as HFSS.This will leave the Government in the absurd position of officially advising people to drink pure orange juice as one of their five a day while banning adverts for it because it is junk.Some snacks Public Health England recommends as part of its £.million ChangeLe campaign will be classied as HFSS, as will most of the soft drinks that have been reformulated with less sugar.Under pressure from the Government, and to the fury of many loyal customers, brands such as Irn-Bru and Lucozade have had their sugar content cut dramatically, and yet they will face severe restrictions on price and promotion under the Government’s plans.Looking at the range of food and drink products that are classied as HFSS, it becomes clear that what is being proposed is not so much a crackdown on junk food as a crackdown on food in general, with exemptions for raw ingredients and health food.Politicians and the public have been sold a pig in a poke by those who campaign against the meaningless category of “junk food”.When askedthey agree with a ban on junk food adverts that are targeted at children, most people say they do, but that is not what is being proposed.If they were asked whether they would support a ban on olive oil being advertised during the Channel  News, they might take a dferent view.We are sleep-walking into legislation that is far more extensive than most of us realise.Hysterical claims about junk food have been used as cover for tobacco-style regulation being rolled out across the food supply.The nation’s biggest and most important industry could soon be banned from advertising most of its products during daytime television, costing broadcasters tens of millions of pounds and lowering the quality of programming.The ban on HFSS products being positioned at the entrance, checkout and end of aisle will cause shopkeepers all kinds of headaches, and the ban on discounts, such as buy-one-get-one-free, could cost consumers hundreds of pounds a year.Surely a rethink is in order Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He has a heart. He has a soul.“He would not hurt anyone. The judge has made his decision.“My son is serving a prison sentence and so are we.“If people can’t work anyone out I think it is wrong to go and do something to them.”During his trial the ISIS disciple’s barrister Rebecca Trowler claimed that Ludlow’s autism and depression made him vulnerable to grooming but the judge, Nicholas Hilliard, QC, told him he was “nobody’s fool”.Ludlow’s mother continued: “He has a heart and soul – he knows right and wrong.“My son would not have done nothing.“If you want to go and talk to the police – they can make up loads of stories about him.“We know him. He knows what he is like and his legal team know him. That is why they have done all that they can. People can surmise but le is too short.”The former Royal Mail worker was filmed by cops breaking down as his footage he made was played to him.YouTube clips included Ludlow calling himself The Eagle and the Ghost as he pledged allegiance to ISIS.The footage shows him appearing upset before asking to take a break after the clip ends.Ludlow researched potential targets around the capital and bought a phone under a  name and wrote down his attack plans, which were later found ripped up in a bin.He identied Oxford Street as an ideal spot, writing: It is expected nearly  could be killed in the attack.Last year, he pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to plotting an attack in the UK and funding IS abroad.His attack plans also revealed plans to attack St Pauls Cathedral and a Shia temple in Romford.Ludlow, of Rochester, Kent, gave evidence that he was pressured into supporting Islamic State by an operative in the Philippines called Abu Yaqeen but had changed his mind just before his arrest.He admitted preparation and funding of terrorist acts but a further charge of attempting to travel to Islamic State was ordered to lie on file at a previous hearing.At his sentencing hearing at the Old Bailey today defence barrister Rebecca Trowler said he was vulnerable to pressure due to his autism and depression.But this was rejected by the Recorder of London who said he did not accept Ludlow had a change of heart.Judge Nicholas Hilliard QC said: I do not accept that these matters explain your participation in these offences. Your participation in these offences is explained by your adherence to violent jihad.I accept you were bullied at school and found it dficult to establish relationships. You may for example have joined your local mosque and found comfort there.Instead you attached yourself to those who promoted violent extremism.I do not regard you as suggestible or easily taken advantage of. You were well able to resist the Prevent Programme and did so.You are nobodys fool. You were no-ones unwilling instrument or tool.Theres nothing about the videos you made which remotely suggest to me you were. You were certainly acting in concert with Abu Yaqeen.I have seen no sign you are anything other than an enthusiastic participant in a joint plan.The court heard Ludlow set up a Paypal and Facebook account called Antique Collections as a front to send money to a man with IS-links called Abu Yaqeen.But he was stopped at Heathrow Airport in February last year as he tried to board a flight to the Philippines.He attended a demonstration led by radical preacher Anjem Choudary in  and was invited to engage with the Met Police Prevent programme.Jailing him for le with a minimum of  years, the judge said: Your extremism ran very deep and for some time.There could be no other explanation for anyone planning to kill innocent people in a van for ideological reasons.No other sentence other than le imprisonment will be appropriate.There is much work to be done and much of it is in your own hands. "},{"url":null,"title":"hermes delivery driver exposed himself trial","story":"Robert Jenner, who claims to be a naturist, also strolled around a shopping centre in see-through trousers.The -year-old is said to have showed off his privates to a teen schoolgirl and pregnant woman while working as a self-employed courier for parcel firm Hermes.The girl, who was then aged , said she was in her school unorm when she passed Jenner in an alleyway in February last year.She said: “He had his penis out of his trousers.

They’re more interested in being in office than actually doing the job.”Amber Rudd issued an apology within minutes of her gaffe – which came as she was talking to BBC Five Live about the abuse suffered by female MPs in Parliament.Speaking ahead of International Women’s Day, she told the BBC: “It definitely is worseyou’re a woman and it’s worst of allyou’re a coloured woman.“I know Diane Abbott gets a huge amount of abuse and I think that’s something we need to continue to call out.”As Labour MPs tore into the Tory leadership contender, Ms Rudd took to social media to say she was “mortied” at having used the outdated term.But Diane Abbott, Jeremy Corbyn’s Shadow Home Secretary, piled on the pressure by saying the “offensive” term was a “revealing use of words”.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell added: “It all seems to be some hark back to some distant past… is this somehow betraying her inner concerns, inner beliefs ”Ms Rudd was forced to quit the Home Office a year ago over the Windrush scandal – which saw Commonwealth-era immigrants deported or stripped of their benefits.Ms Leadsom had been speaking to MPs in the Commons. Labour’s Naz Shah was asking for the chance of a debate about Islamophobia.Ms Leadsom said she should “discuss a way forward with the Foreign Office”.Ms Shah said it “horrically alludes to British Muslims as foreigners”.A spokeswoman for the Commons Leader insisted Ms Leadsom thought the Labour MP was referring to a global definition of Islamaphobia.The spokeswoman said: Islamophobia is unacceptable wherever it takes place.It was thought the MP for Bradford West was referring to a global definition of Islamophobia. International efforts to combat Islamophobiaare lead by the PMs special envoy on freedom of religion or belief, Lord Ahmad, at the Foreign  Commonwealth Office.Of course, any form of Islamophobia in the UK would be dealt with swtly by the Home Office or Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government as appropriate.Labour said Karen Bradley should quit – as she no longer had the credibility to stay on as Northern Ireland Secretary.In September she admitted she hadn’t appreciated the sectarian voting patterns in the province.Ms Bradley said she was “profoundly sorry” as relatives of victims killed by the military demanded she go. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It will never fly with Member States.“He wants a legal fix to a political issue. If this is the game plan, I fear we’d better prepare for no deal.”In the Commons yesterday, Mr Cox also hit back at eurocrats’ attack that his proposals were too vague, insisting: “They are as clear as day”.Delivering his most blunt threat to the ERG yet, Philip Hammond suggested the PM would be prepared to rip up her deal to pursue a customs union with the EU instead,compelled by the Commons.The move would spark uproar among hard Brexiteers, who instead want her to defy Parliament to carry out a No Deal Brexit instead.The Sun has learned that Mrs May’s Chief of Staff Gavin Barwell confirmed the planned radical change of path to a softer Brexit during meetings with Tory MP ministers aides, telling them that the Government would face “some very dficult decisions”the Meaningful Vote on Tuesday is lost.Mr Hammond warned: “Those of my colleagues who feel very strongly need to think very, very hard about the implications of voting against the Prime Minister’s deal next Tuesday, because we will then be in unknown territory.“A consensus will have to be forged across the House of Commons, and that will inevitably mean compromises being made”.Labour’s Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer dubbed Mrs May’s plea “an admission of failure”, adding: “It’s becoming increasingly clear that Theresa May will not be able to deliver the changes she promised to her failed Brexit deal”.In a surprising move, DexEU’s Permanent Secretary Philip Rycroft announced he was retiring on the very date of the UK’s planned EU departure, despite no deal having yet been agreed.The top civil servant insisted he must fulfil a promise to his family in Scotland toto them.But pro-EU campaigners said the surprising decision revealed the Government to be “in chaos”.Brussels’ top official said negotiations could go right down to the wire on March .Commission secretary-general Martin Selmayr said EU deal making “often happens at the very last minute” and called for “patience” on both sides.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The group said , had been pushed into poverty by the first three years of the freeze, including around , children. JRF chief executive Campbell Robb said: As a society, we are failing in our duty to do everything we can to protect each other from poverty. Social security is meant to be a public service we can all rely on in hard times, however that support is being eroded.

And its holding back working parents who want to give their children a decent le. Its time to stop turning the screw. The Government must scrap the benefits freeze and create a social security system that works for everyone when they need it.  Liberal Democrat spokeswoman Christine Jardine said: The Spring Statement is the last chance to scrap the benefits freeze before the final year of the freeze kicks in. The Chancellor must end the misery. If he doesnt, he should be in no doubt that every le made harder and every child pushed into poverty will be on his watch.

The ex-Chancellor was unrepentant when asked by the Mirrorhis cuts to police, mental health and social care had fallen in the wrong places or gone too far. Instead he said there was no magic way to fund public services after the  financial crash. Extraordinarily, Mr Osborne claimed he was forced to wield the axe more harshly after U-turning on the pasty tax and a levy on charity donations. Claiming hed faced a straight choice between hiking tax or cutting services, he said: It was a lot harder raising taxes than it was cutting spending.Yet what the ex-Tory MP didnt mention was he alsocuttaxes by billions of pounds per year.  As Chancellor he slashed Corporation Tax from % to % by , raised the inheritance tax threshold to poundmillion for couples and axed the p top rate of income tax. Mr Osborne faced the question after giving the annual Cudlipp Lecture, sponsored by the Daily Mirror, on The Politics of Journalism. The now-Evening Standard editor said: Im not going to rehearse all the arguments about coming into office, there being no money left, having to take lots of dficult decisions to deal with that... But I will make this observation - it was a lot harder raising taxes than it was cutting spending. Almost all the big political problems I had came when I tried to increase peoples taxes.  Mr Osborne gave the example of the pasty tax - an extension of VAT to hot takeaway food - and the so-called charities tax, both of which were abandoned. You know what the charities tax was  Which I had to retreat on, was humiliated on  he said. It was that rich people should pay some income tax per year. Now rich people dont pay anything taxable because they give all the money to a charitable foundation, have done for decades, and then they live off the capital growth of their income. And I was forced into a humiliating retreat by the British press and lots of reputable charities. He added: So I found it really dficult to increase taxes.  And fundamentallyyou want things like more police, more money in social care and the like youve got to pay for it. You cant borrow that forever. Soyou want to make that argument to the people you have to raise taxes. And it has to be an honest argument to the people. dont pretend that some oligarch or some offshore tax haven is going to pay for it all. The real money the Treasury gets is from income tax, VAT, National Insurance. The harsh reality, he said, was that parties had to find a happy medium between tax hikes and spending cuts. I would love to have found some magic way to conjure up the money to police... but it wasnt there, he said. It came as Mr Osborne faced a wide-ranging QA after the annual lecture.He admitted theres clearly a problem with Islamophobia in the Tory party, but claimed it was not on the same scale as Labour anti-Semitism. He said he would not have joined the Independent Grouphe was still a Tory MP - though sympathised with Labour centrist MPs who had.

Massoud Esmaili, , who is originally from Iran said he believed prejudice in the party was at its height. He claimed a local councillor called him “a bloody foreigner” and told him to “go back to your own country”. It came after Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom was slammed for saying that foreign office ministers should examine Islamophobia in UK.The Leader of the House was answering calls from a Labour MP for a debate on the issue of Muslim hatred.  Naz Shah raised the issue because of the crisis that the Conservative party finds itself in over Islamophobia. Ms Leadsom replied: I am sure she will be pleased to see that the Conservative party is taking very strong action in any cases of Islamophobia that we identy. We have been extremely robust and urgent in our response to this. A spokeswoman for the Leaders Office said: Islamophobia is unacceptable wherever it takes place. It was thought the MP for Bradford West was referring to a global definition of Islamophobia. I encourage her to seek an Adjournment debate in the first instance so that she can discuss with Foreign Office Ministers whether that would be a useful way forward.   Both stories come just  hours after a former Tory minister said the Prime Minister was burying her head in the sand over institutional Islamophobia. Baroness Warsi made the comments after it was revealed that fourteen Conservative Party members have been suspended after posting Islamophobic or racist comments on social media. A Conservative Party spokesperson said: “We do not comment on ongoing disciplinary matters”.

They can change history, mobilise armies and start revolutions. The word feminist itself can hold power or take it away depending on whose lips it falls from. On International Womens Day we focus on striving for gender equality and celebrating womens accomplishments. But what is a feminist  There are plenty of horrid stereotypes of women burning bras, hating men and screaming to be heard, but thats not the case. To mark the occasion weve put together the best quotes and messages throughout history that show what being a feminist really means to women. From singers to actresses, activists to Nobel prize winners, they all have something to say - and they say it well. Here are our some of the est quotes for International Womens Day that show where were at and that the future is female. Malala Yousafzai, activist   Nobel prize winner  “We cannot all succeed when half of us are held back.” Gillian Anderson, actress and activist  Feminism isnt about making women stronger. Women are already strong. Its about changing the way the world perceives that strength. Annie Lennox, singer  political activist  “We all fight over what the label feminism means, but for me its about empowerment. Its not about being more powerful than men - its about having equal rights with protection, support, justice. Its about very basic things. Its not a badge like a fashion item.”  “When a man gives his opinion he’s a man. When a woman gives her opinion, she’s a bitch.” Virginia Woolf, writer  For most of history Anonymous was a woman. Madeleine Albright, politician  “There is a special place in hell for women who dont help other women.  Rebecca West, writer “I myself have never been able to find out precisely what feminism is: I only know that people call me a feminist whenever I express sentiments that dferentiate me from a doormat.” Hillary Clinton , politician  “I believe the rights of women and girls is the unfinished business of the st Century.” Beyonceacute, singer  “Who run the world  Girls.” Lupita Nyong’o  “I hope that my presence on your screen and my face in magazines may lead you, young girls, on a beautul journey. That you will feel the validation of your external beauty, but also, get to the deeper business of being beautul inside.” Yoko Ono, artist  “There’s many women now who think, ‘Surely we don’t need feminism anymore, we’re all liberated and society’s accepting us as we are.’ Which is all hogwash. It’s not true at all.”  “I’m a feminist. I’ve been a female for a long time now. It’d be stupid not to be on my own side.” Zaha Hadid, architect  “Women are always told, Youre not going to make it, it’s too dficult, you cant do that, dont enter this competition, youll never win it, - they need confidence in themselves and people around them to help them to get on.” Kate Nash, singer  “Feminism is not a dirty word. It does not mean you hate men, it does not mean you hate girls that have nice legs and a tan, and it does not mean you are a ‘bitch’ or ‘dyke’ it means you believe in equality.” Emma Watson, actor  activist  “It is time that we all see gender as a spectrum instead of two sets of opposing ideals. We should stop defining each other by what we are not and start defining ourselves by who we are.”  “We have to free half of the human race, the women, so that they can help to free the other half.” Caitlin Moran, writer  “Do you have a vagina  And do you want to be in charge of it  If you said ‘yes’ to both, then congratulations – you’re a feminist!” Ellen Page, actor  “Feminism always gets associated with being a radical movement – good. It should be.” Mary Shelley, writer  “I do not wish women to have power over men but over themselves.”  No country can ever truly flourishit stles the potential of its women and deprives itself of the contributions of half of its citizens. Taylor Swt, singer  “My hope for the future, not just in the music industry, but in every young girl I meet, is that they all realise their worth and ask for it.” Angelina Jolie, actor  activist  “Women are still treated as secondary issues. It is still far too easy and accepted for leaders to ignore uncomfortable truths… Women, we know, are the first to be affected by war, and the last to be taken into account when it ends.”  “It is only through my daughter that I have come to realise that a le without femininity – devoid of mystery, emotion, gentleness and the unerring power of a woman’s love – is no le at all.” J.K.

As we celebrate International Women’s Day on Friday, five female generations of them tell us their experiences of being women in . The Merseyside family welcomed their fth generation, adorable baby Aliyza Irvine, just last year, with proud great-great grandmother Christina Seddon a whole eight decades her senior. Christina was born in the s, while Aliyza is getting set to mark her first birthday next month. Incredibly, all the women still live within two miles of each other in the Bootle and Walton areas of Liverpool – but they have all had very dferent experiences of le in the th and st centuries. Christina Seddon,    I was born in December, , and le in post-war Liverpool for a young girl like me was brilliant. I have had a lovely le. I was one of nine children, and we had a really close, extended family. My first job was at the Williams Toffee factory and I worked in pubs and as a cleaner while raising my children. I got married when I was  and had nine children with my husband George, who worked at the Albert Docks. We had a lovely five-bedroom house. In the s, it was nice to have all these children. Every one of them was perfect. I loved being a mum. But, of course, it wasn’t all easy for women. We didn’t have a washing machine or a fridge and I would wash the clothes in the baby’s bath and peg them up in front of the fire. We got by. Sadly, George died  years ago, and I don’t go out as much as I used to. But I still love dancing and will still have a little dance at the pubI go out. Me and George used to like going dancing. I used to love wearing those s glamorous dresses and the swing skirts. I do feel like we live in a very dferent world today. There doesn’t seem to be as much innocence and the streets don’t seem like a safe place. I see my grandchildren all the time. It’s so nice to keep connected with the younger generations and keep busy, it keeps me young – along with the dancing. Christine Williams,    It was fantastic being a teenage girl in the s, the best time to be a teenager. I was born in  and, as the eldest of nine, I always had someone to play with. One of my memories is of dressing up my eldest brother, Tony, in girls’ clothes. I left school at , met the kids’ dad David at  – we orced in  – and was pregnant by the age of . It was the norm for me to follow that path, and I now have four children. I think women now handle things in a better way, and don’t automatically rush into having babies. They focus on their careers more. But I never look back. I have worked all my le and do part-time work as a barmaid at the moment. One of the amazing things about being in my s in  is I feel like I am in my s. I think women have outgrown men nowadays and have got a bit more of a voice – which can only be a good thing. Independence goes a long way. Sarah Irvine,  As a kid, we had a community club where we all went, and I’m still best friends with a girl who lived on my street because we all stayed in the same area. It’s not the same now. I don’t think there is that sense of community for younger girls. When I was  I used to be a dancer in clubs. My mum would look after Lois as I’d get back in around .am. We used to go out wearing hot pants and crop tops. I think I loved it so much because I was so active, my entire family are active. My grandma Christina never stops. After I finished the dancing I started caring for people, helping with their shopping and their medication. All I ever wanted was for Lois to come first and I think she feels the same way about Aliyza. People say to me: “I can’t believe you’re nearly .” But I think I’m in my prime. Women get better with age. Lois Irvine,   I love being part of a big family of women. My mum raised me on her own and she did her best for me. Without them, I wouldn’t be the person I am today. We all live very close to each other and I see them a lot. I look up to my great nan, Christina, because she’s always out shopping, she’s always busy – she’s a glam-ma. I wake up and enjoy being with my daughter and spending the day with her. I’ve always been working, in hotels, but then when I got pregnant I had to stop. But Aliyza is nearly one and she can go to part-time nursery soon. I love it that I can be independent and earn my own money. I want to raise my daughter the same way. I wouldn’t want my daughter to rely on anyone but me. I had her at , a similar age my mum had me and my grandma had her – but I think things are dferent for me. For one thing, my baby’s dad Jordan is still in the picture and helps me out with child care. For me, it was just me and my mum and my nan helped out. My mum always made me feel loved. It’s what I want to do for my daughter. Aliyza Irvine,  months  Mum Lois says: I want Aliyza’s le to be stable and good. We will be able to do more things in five years, I want to be able to take her on holiday and take her to places. I want to take her to Disneyland Paris – something I did as a child. It was the best experience, seeing the princesses. I think things are dferent now with social media and tablets. I won’t be giving her one of those until she’s a bit older. She’s got mates as well, she’s very social. I want her to have mates at school, I want her to have friends on the street like I did growing up. I’ll be happy with anything she does when she was my age – as long as she studies. I’d like her to go to university. I want to teach her to be independent and I want her to be herself, know who she is as a person and not rely on anyone. But, I don’t want her to be lonely, my friends have children and we see each other all the time. I’m hoping they will grow up and be best friends. I always felt loved and never bored growing up. That is something that I want for Aliyza. I always want her to feel like that.

Darren Bonner was killed by his employer, Richard Spottiswood, who left him to suffocate in the cruel attack. Darren, , posed for the image taken by Spottiswoods girlfriend during a weekend away in a rural caravan park. But shortly afterwards Spottiswood, , ambushed the young mechanic and placed him in a headlock before throttling him until he passed out. He then dumped him naked in a hole behind a dry stone wall and left him to suffocate under a mound of soil.  Darren was found by a passing hiker walking along a coastal path. He was pulled to the surface, but had already suffered severe brain damage and he died  days later in hospital. It emerged Spottiswood, of South Shields near Newcastle-upon-Tyne was running a drug trafficking racket and wrongly believed Darren had betrayed his operation to a rival dealer. This week the victims fiancee Donna Churchill spoke for the first time about the tragedy after Spottiswood was jailed for le for murder.  Spottiswoods girlfriend Lucy Burn, , was jailed for  months after admitting assisting an offender. She was cleared of murder. Miss Churchill, , of Sunderland said: The whole thing was heartbreaking but that chilling picture of them together almost killed me. I felt sick to my stomach at the sight of it. Darren looks absolutely tiny next to his hulking boss. My Darren didn’t stand a chance against him that night. I’d never liked the way Spotty treated Darren and never really understood why Darren stayed involved with him or continued working as a trainee mechanic at the garage Spotty owned.  All it took was a message from him to completely change Darren’s mood. He spoke to him like dirt and gave him all the awful jobs he didn’t want to do himself. I begged Darren to cut ties, but he wouldn’t. Shortly before he was murdered, we’d had a bit of an argument about it and I’d told him to leave because I didn’t want him around my kids. My heart ached but I couldn’t condone something illegal going on under my roof. He was brilliant with my children, which made my decision even harder. When I met Spotty I hated him instantly, so I asked Darren to come back to my house where I felt he belonged.  But Darren told me he couldn’t, and his eyes were filled with sadness. I knew he feared Spotty but couldn’t understand why. Something was holding him back.” Newcastle Crown Court was told the killing occurred in July  after Darren had joined Spottiswood and Burn for a weekend away at Cresswell Towers Caravan Park. A “heated argument” broke out during which Spottiswood choked Mr Bonner and then believing he was dead, loaded him into the back of a van before dumping him in the shallow grave he had dug nearby. Mr Bonner was found lying in the foetal position with a broad ligature mark around his neck and his body was covered with bruises, scratches and  blows from a ‘rod-shaped weapon’ on his back.  Miss Churchill said: Darren had tried to call me before he went away but I’d been with friends and missed it. I was sick of hearing about Spotty anyway, so I was partly glad I didn’t have to listen to anything more about it. Two days later though, I still hadn’t spoken to him and began to feel uneasy. Just then, I spotted two men walking across the car park towards me. One of them was carrying a folder and when I spotted the words ‘serious crimes unit’ and I had a gut feeling something was terribly wrong. I remember my mouth going dry as they walked in and watched as they approached my boss. Then, I was called over and taken into a back room where they told me they had bad news about Darren. As soon as they said it, I told them Spotty was responsible for whatever had happened. I just knew. I just cannot comprehend the circumstances in which he’d been discovered. It seemed so sick to imagine that he’d been buried alive. He was treated like an animal.  Spottiswood, who denied murder, told the court he had killed Darren in self-defence but ordering him to serve a minimum of  years in jail, Judge Stephen Ashurst told him: Mr Bonner died an untimely, violent and undignied death. He wanted to fit in and belong. He was much-loved and looking forward to the future but by your actions, he was deprived at such a young age of making something of his le. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Fairlamb of Northumbria Police, said: The fact that Darren was left in such a critical condition, barely breathing and lying in a shallow grave, absolutely shows how truly cold and despicable Spottiswood is.

It can revolutionise how a company works in so many areas, from more efficient front line production to improved data analysis. But with technological advances moving at a faster rate than human skills, it is vital for small and medium sized businesses to keep up. So to help, Yorkshire Bank’s Group Business Banking Director, Gavin Opperman, is here to answer your questions... Q How can small businesses reduce costs associated with new technology  A Every small business needs technology to support them to make their business more efficient. Technology is moving faster than human skills are, which is why it is necessary for small businesses to weigh up exactly what piece of technology they want to own, its longevity and whether its development can be outsourced. Q Is understanding the latest technology essential for all small businesses  A Most small businesses will need to adopt some level of technology to make their business run efficiently. However,small businesses get caught up in the technology race too much they can move away from their core business. Remember to find a balance between what is needed and how to make the businessoptimally. Q What technology should small businesses be looking out for  A Every small business is dferent. There’s a number of exhibitions that they can attend to see what technology is most suited to them. Small businesses should look for options that will give them long-term sustainability at an economical rate and ultimately make their business more efficient. Q Many small businesses are struggling with the complexity of new technology – how can they simply the concept  A At Yorkshire Bank, we strive to bring industry experts and like-minded people together. Many of the sectors or businesses are prepared to share their knowledge to others in the industry. It is about finding the right technology to fit your business, and one that is suitable over a long period. Q How can small businesses keep up to date with the latest products and services available  A When it comes to technology, Yorkshire Bank provides a relationship model. We as bankers aren’t there as technology experts, but what we can do is share best practice. We can introduce small businesses to experts in our portfolio who can advise on the latest products and services available. Q Many small businesses are hindered by time and internal resources – how can they still embrace new technology  A The biggest challenge Yorkshire Bank has identied with small businesses is the skills shortage, which puts pressure on internal resources. A lot of universities are developing skills in technology, but it’s how small businesses can retain the talent within that. The aim would be to keep the intellectual property within \u2028the region, so small businesses can embrace new technology without added time or training.Find out more about a business bank that works for you at YBonline business"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal over brexit mean","story":"NewsopinionNo deal over Brexit will mean UK learns same brutal truth our miners didMiners ed to work  years ago and without a deal they were picked off one by one before their industry faded awayShareByPaul Routledge:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsopinionMiners at a demonstration at Maerdy Lodge Colliery in Gwent \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt was  years ago this week that Britain’s coal miners went back to work after their epic -month strike for jobs. With brass bands playing, union banners aloft and families pushing buggies, they marched proudly to the pits with heads held high. Across Yorkshire, South Wales, Durham, Lancashire, Scotland and Kent, the stirring picture was the same. Nothing like it would ever be seen again. And nothing could disguise the brutal truth that they ed to work without a deal on the issue that provoked the dispute: pit closures. With no agreement, they were vulnerable to arbitrary decisions about their future. They were picked off one by one, and today their industry – which put the Great in Britain – has vanished.  The parallel is not exact, but the country faces a similar position in our orce from the European Union. Without a deal, we will be at the mercy of greater powers such as the USA – which insists that we eat chlorinated chicken – China and  unforgiving EU states. The stakes are as high for us today as they were for the miners in . It’s about survival, and Theresa May’s mantra – “no deal is better than a bad deal” – is self-defeating.  Any deal is better than no deal. As the countdown to Parliament’s meaningful vote on Brexit reaches its th hour, MPs should remember what happened to the miners, and not let it happen to us. If I were a Labour MPI would vote for the withdrawal agreement coming before the Commons any day now. It may not be perfect, it may be the shabby compromise that Vic Feather of the TUC always talked about. But it’s better than stepping, eyes closed, into the void.

The prince risks incurring the wrath of environmentalists not long after Meghan was criticised for catching a private plane from New York. Taking the flight would have saved the prince just under  minutes but the emissions are up to five-times higher.Alternatively, he could have caught the train using a first class ticket for just pound, reports The Sun .Harry and Meghan had previously caught a train to Bristol last month after snow caused them to cancel plans for another private flight.   Research by Eurostar has previously found that taking the train saves between  and % of carbon emissions compared to air travel. The news has emerged after Harry urged school kids to wake up to the prospect of climate change. He said at an event at Wembley: Climate change is a humanitarian issue and one where weve been far too slow in waking up to the issues and acting on the damaging impact our ways of living are having on the world. We now have the facts, the science, the technology and the ability to save not just our planet, but ourselves. Harry took the helicopter to Birmingham for a three-hour visit to a hospital and open a memorial for victims of the  Tunisia terror attack.   it is thought he used an AgustaWestland AS Grand Chopper, which comes with a custom interior and leather seats. Friends of the Earth had previously criticised the Duchess of Sussex for taking a private jet with Amal Clooney from New York. A spokesperson told the Mail Online: “Private air travel obviously comes with a huge carbon footprint. Perhaps for future trips the Duchess could consider less carbon-intensive modes of travel.” William and Kate routinely use helicopters for public visits, most recently to Blackpool on Wednesday. Kensington Palace told The Sun: “Travel decisions are based on a number of factors, including effective use of time, security and minimising the impact on others, while ensuring the full schedule can be delivered.” "},{"url":null,"title":"shoreham airshow pilot cleared over","story":"NewsShoreham Airshow pilot cleared over  deaths says Im truly sorry for my partAndrew Hill was today found not guilty of manslaughter following a trial at the Old BaileyShareCommentsByDave Burke:,  MAR NewsPilot Andrew Hill was today cleared of manslaughter \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe pilot cleared of manslaughter following the Shoreham Airshow disaster has said he is truly sorry following the deaths of  men.A jury today unanimously found Andrew Hill not guilty as family members of those who died wept.Hill, , was attempting a loop when his Hawker Hunter jet exploded into a fireball on the A. Maurice Abrahams,  Dylan Archer,  Tony Brightwell,  Matthew Grimstone,  Matt Jones,  Graham Mallinson,  Daniele Polito,  Mark Reeves,  Jacob Schilt,  Richard Smith,  and Mark Trussler, , were all killed. Incredibly Hill survived after being thrown clear from the burning wreckage. Speaking outside the Old Bailey following the verdict, Mr Hill read out the names of the  men who died in the crash and said: Im truly sorry for the part I played in their deaths.   Some of the victims were watching the display from a grass verge near the Shoreham Airport entrance on the A, while others were in cars travelling on the road or crossing it on foot, jurors had been told.

Prosecutors claim Patterson killed Jaymes parents - James and Denise - and abducted the schoolgirl from her family home on his third attempt. They allege he had abandoned two previous attempts to take the teen because he saw cars parked outside the familys home, and lights on. Patterson reportedly told police he target Jayme at random after seeing her board a school bus near her house.  He learned his alleged victims names in media coverage of a case, according to a criminal complaint filed against him. In the jailhouse letter, he went on to say he took issue with the police version of events, saying they had twisted his words. He claimed he had not planned the kidnapping as thoroughly as detectives had alleged, instead calling it a complicated decision, and an impulse. I dont think like a serial killer, the letter reportedly said.Asked by the reporter what he would have doneJayme had not escaped, Patterson reportedly wrote: Wont say. It was really stupid looking back.

A video from the app TikTok revealing the technique has gone viral on Twitter .The short clip shows a person munching away on some pineapple, but instead of cutting up the fruit, they merely pluck pieces off of it. A man named Lewis McCluskey shared the video on Twitter after discovering it. He wrote: Im sorry but what the actual f***.  His post went viral, garnering over , retweets and , likes.People were quick to share their shock. My mind blown at this point, said one person.

This irritating question dominates Twitter every year on  March. Luckily one man is actually doing more than his fair share to tackle it, and his efforts also help a very good cause. Comedian Richard Herring is once again spending International Women’s Day answering this eternal question with some polite trolling and raising money for Refuge. Here are some of his greatest hits so far this year...  Last year, he raised pound, for the charity and this year he is again asking his , followers on Twitter to support this act of polite trolling and raise more money for charity.People can donate to the campaignhere. International Men’s Day has in fact been around since , but has, alas, struggled to embed its way into the global consciousness in the same way as International Women’s Day. Still, its nothing a quick Google search cant sort out.   Since , there have been just over , tweets about International Women’s Day which is almost ten times the number of tweets about International Men’s Day.Last year, Herring’s Twitter followers raised over pound, for Refuge in support of his painstaking efforts to answer every single person asking this question on the social media .

Richard himself said in a statement: Last year, I was overwhelmed by the response to this piece of polite trolling and the amount of money raised, but having performed this service for the last few years, Im assuming that everyone will know when International Men’s Day is by now , so Im hoping to have a relatively quiet day tomorrow, though Ive been saying that for the last  years and it’s just got worseanything.

Janay, from Auckland, New Zealand, had been seemingly healthy before her death, with no signs that anything was wrong during her pregnancy.   A kind-hearted woman, she had volunteered for Heartfelt, a selfless group of professional photographers who capture photos of families in hospital.She would take pictures for parents whose babies were very sick, or had died, so they could have valuable keepsakes, the New Zealand Herald reports.Her family told the newspaper that her death this week was sudden. They said the expectant mother was laid back and independent, with her le revolving around aircraft technician Mark and three-year-old Tiare. It was a very long process to conceive Tiare and they had been accepted for IVF when Janay got pregnant with baby number two, her grieving sister-in-law, Lana Mitchell, told the Herald. It was a miracle. Janay, who had trained as a graphic artist, had been with Mark for  years - and married for seven - after they met in a nightclub as teenagers.She ran her own business, Tee-Jay Photography .

Working with the most precious little miracles, what more is there to love. As a mum I know how fast our babys grow, especially in their first year . My sons newborn baby portraits are priceless to me and I have them proudly displayed on my walls - I would love the opportunity to do this for you too.

He got the wire out of his finger last week.“He can start his comeback proper and he’s keeping Andrew Davies company at the moment – they’ve done a lot together on the bikes and they’re doing running on the training ground so it’s great to see them coming back.”Meanwhile, two bodies he’d like back sooner are nearing aand Jim is hoping he’ll have his striking options boosted for Saturday’s home clash with Hearts.Frontmen Andrew Nelson and Craig Curran missed the - defeat to Rangers last midweek but have a chance of athis week.“They are coming on, slow,” Jim said.“They aren’t back on the training ground yet but we’re hoping we’ll have at least one back training by the end of the week.“Craig had an injection in his stomach last week which has settled down nicely but it needs time.“Nelson is his heel which he picked up celebrating his goal at Livingston.“Again that is better but it’s not fully away yet.“What we don’t want to do is bring him back too early and there is a recurrence.“We’ve tried a couple of dferent things but he was tender last week and we had to back off.“It was better over the weekend so we’ll see what he’s like by the end of the week.”At Ibrox, Jim opted for on-loan forward Scott Wright to lead the line in an attempt to catch Steven Gerrard’s Rangers on the hop with pace and will have that option again. However, he’d welcome goalscorer Nelson and “focal point” Curran back.The Dens gaffer said: “Craig has been a focal point for us and brings a lot of people into play in terms of the work he puts in and how he doesn’t let defenders settle.“We went for pace against Rangers by putting Scott Wright up and pace on the sides with Jesse Curran and Andy Dales.“That wasn’t an easy decision because we had Kenny Miller’s experience there as well but we felt we could get down the sides of them when their full-backs went forward but we met them on a night when they were excellent.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/03/5c80edb034bbb0.74583040.jpg ","title":"businessman claims he has had to lay off staff because dundee council owe me 15k","story":"A businessman claims he has been forced to lay off staff due to an unpaid cleaning bill of £, from Dundee City Council.Graeme Thomson, owner of Bedazzled cleaning company, said he had been waiting two months for the local authority to settle the debt.He said his company had been cleaning the homes of council residents on behalf of the local authority’s social work department for the past five years, without any issues.But the payments stopped after Graeme switched his business’s status from a limited liability company to a sole trader, voluntarily putting his old company name into liquidation.Graeme, , said that despite producing all the documentation needed to prove he was still running a business, the council was yet to pay up.He said: “This is work the council appoints me to do on its behalf.“It is now due me £, for cleaning work I have done since last summer.“I have regularly invoiced the council for payment but it has not paid me this money despite repeated requests.”Graeme estimated that since January he had been in touch with the council at least  times asking for payment.He added: “They just keep delaying it.

Who knows, maybe one day I will partner John at the centre of defence for Scotland.“My aim is to try to get myself established in English football and then see what happens.”But Socceroos boss Graham Arnold, who is also in charge of the U  side, insists he’s delighted to have persuaded the former Tangerines and Ross County stopper to follow in the footsteps of Hibs winger Martin Boyle and pledge their future for Australia.The Aussies were alerted to Souttar’s availability by his Stoke City team-mate Adam Federici.Arnold said: “When you look at Harry and his size, he is a beast.

He has marshalled a slight upturn in fortunes in recent weeks which has only been offset by the improved form of their relegation rivals Hamilton Accies and St Mirren, also.However, for Macca, it won’t be job done until Dundee are mathematically safe.And that is a long way off, as they sit in the relegation play-off place, three points behind Accies and only one ahead of the Buddies.Tonight, the Tele takes a look at the Dark Blues’ run-in to the split to see where they can pick up much-needed points.Dundee v Hearts # Saturday, March One of Dundee’s four wins this season, and their only one against a team which currently occupies the top six, came at Tynecastle at the end of January.That - success in Gorgie, coupled with the Jambos’ recent struggles – they are without a win in their last four league outings – will give the Dark Blues confidence going into Saturday’s clash at Dens Park.However, the Dee have only won once at home all season and need that to changethey are to have any hopes of staying in the ision.It’s must-win, for me, and I think they will rise to the occasion.Verdict: Three points.Dundee v Celtic # Sunday, March A game in which Dundee will not be judged on come the end of the season but one,they keep it tight at the back, could see them sneak a valuable point.However, I fancy Celtic to go on a really good run as they look to wrap up eight titles in a row under new manager Neil Lennon.They’ll have too much.Verdict: No points.St Mirren v Dundee # Saturday, March One word. Ten letters. Hyphenated. Six-pointer.If the teams go into this one still practically neck and neck, which I expect they will, a win would be extremely valuable for both.However, I feel, with the enormity of the occasion, they will cancel each other out in Paisley.Verdict: One point.St Johnstone v Dundee # Wednesday, April The Dee and Saints have had some tasty encounters in recent seasons and this one should be no dferent with both teams likely to still have plenty to play for.St Johnstone may still be in the mix for the top six while Dundee’s situation is self-explanatory.I fancy the Dark Blues for this one, they play better on the road and have more to lose than the Perth men.Verdict: Three points.Dundee v Aberdeen # Saturday, April You have to go back to November  for the last time Dundee got a win of any sorts against the Dons.That’s a run of  games without a win, with  losses in a row.That run has to end at some point, so I’ll back the Dee for a hard-earned draw.Verdict: One point.Total points: Eight points.That would leave Dundee with  going into the split and, you would like to think, put them in a decent position to stay up. That is, depending on how Hamilton and St Mirren get on with their fixtures .Hamilton – Motherwell , Hearts , Kilmarnock , Livingston , St Mirren .Verdict: Five points.St Mirren – Kilmarnock , St Johnstone , Dundee , Celtic , Hamilton .Verdict: Eight points.That would leave Hamilton level and St Mirren a point behind Dundee."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/03/5c80eccb849c11.76417978.jpg ","title":"pals make meat loaf themed coffin to bid farewell to dundee entertainer marc","story":"Friends of a Meat Loaf-loving entertainer came together to make sure he was given a fitting final farewell.Marc Kingston died suddenly last month at the age of , having had cancer.Born in Peterborough, he had lived in Dundee for more than  years and was a well-loved performer and DJ known as Marc Meat Loaf, who hosted events in the city.This week his friends met at Dundee Crematorium to make sure the performer received a fitting send-off.Marc arrived in a custom- made coffin painted with Meat Loaf’s Bat Out Of Hell album cover and driven in a flame-effect hearse. vw, px\"   vw, px\"   vw, px\"  He was a huge fan of Meat Loaf, whose hits include I’d Do Anything For Love and Two Out of Three Ain’t Bad.The song Objects In The Rear View Mirror was played as guests left the service.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal.

The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder.

Documents such as rent records, estate census papers, military papers, letters, maps and legal documents can offer a glimpse into the lives of people who lived across Argyll.The two-year Written in the Landscape project is set to wind up in July this year and has entailed cataloguing and digitising the Argyll Estate and other records to make them more accessible to the public.As Hannah and Jen travel round Argyll on their tour, the intention is to offer a local flavour from the archives aimed at each venue.For the Lochgilphead workshop on February , Jen and Hannah presented such erse items as #registers of the poor# and burgh court rolls from Lochgilphead, th century wage books from Kilmory Estate alongside military commission documents from the th century and a  map of the proposed Crinan Canal, surveyed by John Rennie.Each record offers a dferent insight among a treasure trove of detail.The Lochgilphead presentation followed a similar event in Campbeltown in January.

Police sealed off the High Street to cars as the cortege arrived at the Kirk Port entrance to the Auld Kirk. The silence was broken only by the lament of a lone piper as Jock’s family filed their way into church. Jock’s coffin was carried into a packed service by men of the Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry. His coffin was draped in a union flag and on top were his cap, belt, his campaign medals and a wreath. A dozen colleagues in the firing party formed a guard of honour after the coffin had passed under the  lych gate. Jock, , lived in Dundonald with second we Gigliola, better known as Julie. And he ran a log and firewood business, as well as being a yeomanry reservist.

The father-of-two died six days after his armoured car overturned at the Catterick Garrison in Yorkshire on January . Among the mourners in the Auld Kirk was Colonel John Dalrymple Hamilton, who was representing Prince Charles. Provost Helen Moonie of South Ayrshire Council also attended the service. And there was military top brass from both regiments in which Jock served –the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards and the Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry. Other regiments represented included the Royal Engineers, the Royal Artillery, the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers and the Le Guards. Members of the Army Cadet Force were also present to pay their respects. Jock was  years in the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, rising to be a Challenger tank commander. He survived tours of duty in Iraq, Kuwait and Kosovo, only to die in a training exercise. Auld Kirk minister Rev David Gemmell described how John McKelvie ‘grabbed le by the throat’ from his earliest days. He wasn’t much of a scholar at Drongan Primary and Auchinleck Academy, but he knew every creature that ran, crawled, swam or flew in the countryside. And a love of the great outdoors was a huge part of his le – whether it was fishing, playing rugby, ski-ing or mountain biking.  He and we Julie were fond of dogs, and Julie taught her big action man how to ride a horse, said the minister. Major Richard Boyle of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards read the lesson - ‘To every thing there is a season’ from Ecclesiastes. There were hilarious army anecdotes from best buddy JR Ewing, telling how they had shot at each other - with paintballs. J R also mentioned how when Jock was rebuked by a French officer in Kosovo, the big man pointed to his Royal Scots Dragoon Guards cap badge – a French eagle with the word Waterloo underneath. J R, his voice breaking, concluded by saying: “He was the best soldier I ever served with and my best friend.” Former RSDG officer Will Galbraith highlighted Jock’s pride in his regiment, his family and his friends. He said: “He had a strong sense of honour, of right and wrong, and would always stand up for the underdog.” Will said: “He was a big man, with a big voice and a big heart – a big character. But when you really got to know him, he was a big softie – although you wouldn’t tell him that. You had to be aware of those big hands.” Army chaplain Rev Duncan Macpherson said there were bound to be feelings of frustration, anger and regret at the way John McKelvie died. He hoped these would be resolved, adding: “He was someone who was thoroughly tested, who rose to the challenge and who was a thoroughly professional soldier. He was passionate about vehicles and made sure his was ready for any task.” Lt Colonel Toby Gaddum, commanding officer of the Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry, led the congregation in the regimental prayer. Rev David Gemmell brought the church service to an end by poignantly reciting “We Let You Go’. The poem ends: “We love you, we miss you, we want you to be happy. Go safely, go dancing, go running home.” A collection at the end of the service raised vital cash for the Ayrshire Yeomanry Families Fund. Jock was laid to rest at Drongan Cemetery, where a guard of honour fired three volleys from their rles.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPrince CharlesRoyal Scots Dragoon GuardsSouth Ayrshire CouncilMiddle EastArmed forcesRoyal FamilyLove and romanceDundonaldAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr boxing king calvin mccord","story":"NewsAyr boxing king Calvin McCord crowned Scottish Lightweight Champion after thrilling bout at Trump TurnberryThe Ayr star won his first Scottish title in an exciting bout before a sell-out crowd in the Donald J Trump ballroom.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsCalvin McCord celebrates with his title\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRing king Calvin McCord told how he got off the canvas twice to land his first Scottish title.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"college staging wine fuelled feast","story":"NewsCollege staging wine-fuelled feast as job cuts loomLeaked emails tell of lavish bash at cash-strapped Ayrshire CollegeShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCollege bosses have defended holding a celebration to honour their success amid a climate of drastic job cuts and cash problems. Ayrshire College supremos and invited senior staff will stage a sit-down feast later this month to mark five years since its formation. The dinner for  will also include free wine after a sponsored deal by college chairman Willie Mackie. Leaked emails state the claim the college is “now regarded as one of the most successful colleges in Scotland.” But our inside source said: “It adds insult to injury that this celebration is being held less than one week before the final jobs structure is issued to staff. “It is in extremely poor taste given the circumstances of potential job losses due to lack of funds.” Evening classes are having to be cancelled so the event can be staged at the Kilmarnock campus on March . Retiring principal Heather Dunk is also to be honoured during the evening. Chairman Willie Mackie said: “She has made a signicant contribution to Ayrshire for over  years.” Ms Dunk retired on February , leaving an impending restructure which will cost jobs. A consultation ends tomorrowand it has emerged the Private Finance Initiative which built the Kilwinning campus is a huge drain on funds. An email which Ms Dunk sent to staff in January read: “We need to make signicant savings to be financially sustainable due to the costs associated with the PFI, unfunded national bargaining costs and the increasing costs of pensions, utilities and other services. I am very disappointed that an organisational review is necessary, it is not what I want to be focused on in my last weeks as principal. “However, we must manage within the financial allocation we receive in this very dficult fiscal climate.” Under the consultation, one of the four vice-principals would be axed, three directors culled, heads of learning cut from  to nine, and three marketing coms staff would go. Also at risk of the chop are two posts within estates as well as a shake-up of duties among departments. The board of management will approve the final structure and staff impacted will get a severance package. Ayrshire College acknowledged finance was a major challenge for all Scottish colleges but said the dinner costs were met by sponsorship. A spokeswoman said: “Our main financial challenge for the year ahead is to meet the costs associated with the Kilwinning PFI Campus, national bargaining costs and the increasing costs of pensions, utilities and services. “While the Scottish Funding Council has agreed to provide further strategic funds to help manage these rising costs, the college still requires to make signicant savings to secure its financial sustainability and jobs for the future. “We are, therefore, considering proposals for an organisational review. “All staff are aware of the challenges the college faces, and have contributed to a consultation regarding potential efficiencies and opportunities for income generation. “We have just passed our five-year anniversary as Ayrshire College, and have planned an event, ‘Celebrating Five Years of Success. It is important to recognise this milestone and celebrate success – for learners, staff, the college and the region. “We are mindful of the costs of holding such an event and so have secured full sponsorship.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnUniversities and CollegesAyr NewsAyrEducationKilmarnockSchoolsKilwinning"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"end line rnli ayr charity","story":"NewsEnd of the line for RNLI Ayr charity branchThe Royal National Leboat InstitutionAyr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.Share Ayr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _emp_ayp_rnliJPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\" Ayr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _emp_ayp_rnliJPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\" Ayr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _emp_ayp_rnliJPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\" Ayr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _emp_ayp_rnliJPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\" Ayr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _emp_ayp_rnliJPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\" Ayr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _emp_ayp_rnliJPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\" Ayr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _emp_ayp_rnliJPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"ByAbi Smillie:,  MAR NewsAlicia Watson , Robin Whiteand David Macpherson\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt’s the end of an era for a le-saving charity branch following failed attempts to gain members and volunteers. The Royal National Leboat InstitutionAyr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat. The branch, which has been around for over  years, issued an urgent appeal last November, appealing for a younger generation to pitch in to save the Ayr branch . Committee member and Secretary Robin White, said: “Sadly the number of volunteers helping to run the branch recently has been dwindling, to such an extent that so few are left the AGM came to the sad decision to close the branch down. However, a number of branch members have indicated they still wish to support the RNLI and will now do so via the Troon Branch. “This Branch is looking for new volunteers, soyou would like to help, please get in touch.” Ayr once had its own Leboat, stationed at Ayr Harbour in  under the management of Ayr Harbour Trust.   During the following  years a number of dferent Leboats were in service, one of which was built in Shadwell, London in  for just under pound. This was transported from London to Ayr Station by rail free of charge, by the London and North Western Railway Company. It was taken down Ayr High Street to Ayr Harbour and christened the ‘Janet Hoyle’, after the donor’s we. Eventually in  the RNLI Committee of Management decided to close the station as Troon had a motor Leboat where there was deemed a safer harbour entrance. There was then no RNLI presence in the town until the late ’s when a group of people decided to start a Fundraising Branch. This has been in existence ever since and has raised well over pound, in its time.

Now a row has broken out after it emerged one council department had not even bothered to speak to another. The unsightly corral cluster for five bins was secured in place near The Cross in Troon without any consultation. Troon Councillors have now become aware after a multitude of complaints. The cleansing department is claiming they contacted the planning department about the placing of the bins. But planners are denying any knowledge of a consultation. Troon SNP Councillor Craig Mackay is now leading the charge to find somewhere  for the bins to be situated, rather than outside the Jade Garden Chinese and Macintyre’s bar. He is asking for officials to meet councillors at the spot in Templehill to try and find a resolution. Councillor Mackay said: “We are trying to develop a coherent vision for our town centre. “I’m not convinced this is the best we can manage for such a high profile location. Cleansing regrettably installed these enclosures without any prior consultation. While it is arguably an operational matter that doesn’t require any such input,they had asked any of the councillors or the community council for comment then I am certain we would not have found ourselves in this situation. “The council’s Planning service disappointingly also appear not to have been consulted on the siting or design of this bin store within the conservation area. I don’t wish to play departments off against each other, but would seek to find a community consensus about what is appropriate for our public realm. “This will almost certainly involve an alternative solution for the bins.” A council spokesman confirmed they are investigating, saying: ““We introduced communal bins to keep the litter secure and away from gulls. The early indications are that this system is working well, however we are currently reviewing the location of the bins.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish National PartyTroonAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"look out sooty sweep heading","story":"NewsLook out, Sooty and Sweep are heading to AyrStage show insists laughs will come thick and fast at Ayr GaietyShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSooty is set to SWEEP into Ayr next month.

This was his first goal for the Pupils and just reward for his perseverance.It was good to see two teenagers making their mark for the club, with Ross Brown joining his academy teammate MacBrayne in a fine first half performance on opposite flanks of midfield.Nevertheless, the home side ‘stole’ into the lead in the st minute, a comic-cut situation that saw Ellis Robertson unbelievably penalised for stumbling over his own heels.The resultant free kick was delivered with venom and a headed deflection thundered into the net to restore the home side’s lead.The setback was short-lived as almost immediately the in-form Donald McCallum cut inside past two defenders to drive the ball high into the roof of the net for a superb equaliser.This heralded the Pupils# best spell of the match, with Ross Brown ending a great move with a volley that left the keeper rooted to the spot.But the goal, arguably the best of the match, was ruled out for offside.Ryan McConnachie was next to try his luck with an audacious overhead kick that just cleared the bar.Lady luck deserted the cause when the referee awarded a soft penalty kick to home club.The visitors were a goal behind despite dominating most of the second half.With  minutes remaining the league leaders looked to have sealed the points when a tactical long throw was forced home to give ‘the Port’ a two goal advantage.However, in an exciting end to another close fought match, Lee Allen scored a towering header from a Donald McCallum corner to make the score -.Despite a great effort in the closing minutes, the Pupils couldn’t score to get their just reward.Having played well and given everything, the visitors ed home with nothing to show for their efforts.TomorrowCampbeltown Pupilsto home action with another dficult match against third-placed Hillington at Kintyre Park with a pm kick off.  See social media and posters for confirmation of venue.Fraser MacBrayne in action earlier this season at Kintyre Park. _cpupils"},{"url":null,"title":"drama festivals farcical first night","story":"Accent Players# Grave Prospects, by Isabella C Rae, a mix of ghosts and the living, set in a contemporary graveyard, gave plenty of scope for laughs.Mission to Planet Bob, set in , staged by Dunaverty Players, cut the stage cast down to three suspended animation astronauts: Amy , Katieand Ed .Peninver Players# slapstick Melons at the Parsonage was the final Friday act with two plays within a third at an imaginary drama festival.At times Peninver#s action became confusing and caused adjudicator Jim Gibson to declare that he hoped he was not like its adjudicator Ted .Adjudicating at the end of the night, Mr Gibson said that the connection between all three plays was that they all ended in controlled lunacy.Speaking about Accent Players, Mr Gibson said: #There were very good dferent levels of set on the stage.#The make-up was nicely judged, particularly the ghosts, shades of grey but not .#I would have liked to have seen patchier lighting on stage, as it was fairly unorm, and perhaps some spots.#What was really nice was the fog coming on from stage left which reminded me of ectoplasm.#There was lots of good off-the-ball acting.

Such days are ones which have been borrowed from another month, and I think given the temperature and weather we have had recently the days have been borrowed from May.In , May will have borrowed Februaryrsquos days, so we can expect some unseasonal weather in that month as well, but in a dferent way.Sunday was a borrowed day for sure it was so mild and the later part sunny with a feeling of spring in the air. It was a perfect day for a discovery.We set off to find a place Irsquod only recently heard about. A friend had asked me what I knew about the lsquoKingrsquos Chairrsquo by Gullane. I had to admit that Irsquod never heard of it. He told me one of the holes at the golf course there has this name, but it seems it is named after a location nearby.This set me investigating. Sure enough, I found it marked on the map and searched for an image, which I found on a website called Ancient Stones: a large boulder, shaped like a throne, guarded by two other stones either side. It intrigued me and so our quest began.The starting point of our adventure was Gullane Beach car park. I knew roughly where to look but purposefully hadnrsquot brought the map so that we had a challenge to find the lsquochairrsquo. We knew what it looked like and that we needed to walk along the upper path, not the one that heads for the beach.We went the wrong way at first and got stuck in a mass of sea buckthorn, but on reflection that just added to the sense of adventure and achievement. We soon found our way and then suddenly there it was, up on Gullane Hill. The kids ran excitedly towards the stones, shouting: ldquoFound it, found it.I felt quite exhilarated at the discovery, and to be honest impressed by the sight of the Kingrsquos Chair. I can see how it got its name, as it looks something like a majestic reclining armchair. The two boulders on either side of it look like sentries keeping watch.The kids sat on it, of course, and I had to wait my turn after my we, who reckoned it could just as easily be a lsquoQueenrsquos Chairrsquo.When I finally got a chance to seat my majestic posterior on the chair, I realised the view was majestic as well, with Gullane Beach very visible in the near distance.I reflected on the fact we had recently visited Edinburgh Castle and seen the Stone of Destiny or Stone of Scone, along with the crown jewels. This rather uninspiring stone in Edinburgh Castle may be the coronation stone used for  years in England, but it is not, I am sure, the coronation stone used by ancient kings of Scotland, despite official claims that it is.I think itrsquos pretty clear that Edward I never got his hands on the real Stone of Destiny and I am convinced it has remained in Scotland, hidden somewhere, ever since. It occurred to me that this stone actually better fitted the early description of the original coronation stone at Scone than the one in Edinburgh Castle.ldquoImaginethis is the real Stone of Destiny and has been here all the time, I said fancully out loud. I know it isnrsquot, of course, but I have to saythis Kingrsquos Chair was on display at Edinburgh Castle it would certainly look more authentic.But sadly there seems to be no recorded tradition connected to this Kingrsquos Chair. I could find no story, or reference to the origin of its name. Perhaps some local people have some information on this There is an entry from the s that records the name, citing locals as the source, so there is some historic veracity in its title. But no suggestion is offered for the origin of the name, or any tradition associated with the stone. Its geology I could not say but it doesnrsquot seem to be a glacial erratic.And so we are left to wonder. We discussed how the stone got here and how it got its name. Maybe some children played here many generations ago and gave the boulder its title. Perhaps a Viking king who landed on Gullane Beach sat himself down on this natural throne to survey his warriors at their bloody work.Whatever the origin, the name, the location and the nature of the stone make this a worthwhile and fun discovery, even without a firm legend attached to it.And as I sat on the chair I watched smoke billowing from the coastline a little further to the west, close to the edge of Aberlady nature reserve. What caused the fire I didnrsquot know, but even from a distance it seemed destructive.It was a prophetic sight to witness from the Kingrsquos Chair. It looked like a burning coastline from a Viking raid. Thankfully the distant screech of fire engines told us help was on the way. The children wanted to go see the fire, but we kept our distance from the flames and let the firefighters do their job.So the trip to the Kingrsquos Chair had been an adventure in more ways than one. On our way back, the children advanced dferent theories about the origin of the name. It was universally agreed that a story must be made, but no agreement on the actual tale.ldquoPerhaps, I said, ldquowe should leave it to the imagination of those who search for and discover it, so they can sit and feel the power of the place and get ideas.My imagination was certainly ablaze. I saw the leader of the ancient Gododdin tribe, King Loth, sitting on the stone, looking out to the Firth as he watched his terried daughter in a small coracle being taken out to the open sea, his brutal punishment for her defiance of his authority.The story would fit as her journey began at Aberlady Bay, and so her small craft would have been seen from the Kingrsquos Chair as it passed by, being pulled out to sea by one of the kingrsquos boats.Itrsquos all a fancy of my imagination, of course, but thatrsquos my story.

Tell you that therersquos going to be a referendum on Brexit, that the ERG are back in their box, Jezza has finally come good, and Theresa May has been put in a secure unit. But I canrsquot in all honesty agree with commentators, like the blessed Polly Toynbee, who believe we are now on the road to redemption.Yes, Labour did repeat its promise to hold a referendumJeremy Corbynrsquos ldquoworkable plan of a permanent customs union is rejected ndash as it was in one of last weekrsquos many meaningless votes. Oh, and Labour will support a referendumthere is no General Election. Anda no deal Tory deal looks likely. If, , .ButLabour really wanted to eliminate the threat of no deal, it would have moved heaven and earth to deliver the SNPrsquos motion calling for precisely that.Looking back on this dismal week, the standout, surely, is the arrant insanity of Parliament ndash a rational body of elected representatives ndash failing to take the opportunity to rule out an event which would put the army on the streets, interrupt food and medicine supplies, and cause the loss of tens of thousands of jobs.Yes, the Yvette Cooper Oliver Letwin amendmentwas endorsed by Parliament overwhelmingly, after Theresa May gave it the nod. This means that there will be an extension to Article Parliament doesnrsquot support a deal by March . Well and good. If therersquos one thing the UK Parliament is supremely good at itrsquos failing to agree.It doesnrsquot like Mayrsquos botched deal, the Norway option, EFTA or any other solution that Brussels thinks acceptable. So that means an extension is inevitable. Except that the French president Emmanuel Macron and the Brussels negotiator, Michel Barnier, have made clear that the  countries of the EU , will only contemplate delaying Britainrsquos departure from the EUit is for ldquoa purpose. Holding more meaningless votes, staging more ministerial resignations and arguing on College Green outside Parliament do not, one suspects, constitute a legitimate purpose.Still, everyone seems convinced that an extension is in the bag. This led to largely unwarranted excitement on the Remain side. With Labour calling for a Peoplersquos Voteand Theresa Mayrsquos deadline finally breached, Twitter went into orbit. Lord Adonis all but declared victory in the Battle of Brexit. Europhiles were dancing in the streets, metaphorically at least, and jeering at the nasty Brexiters who had been defeated by the forces of good. It was like the last reel of Lord of the Rings.But such triumphalism was premature. Much as I wish it were the case, there is still no majority in Parliament for a referendum. Stephen K Bush, the political editor of the New Statesman, has been counting them out and counting them back in again and he is adamant that the Labour Brexit rebels will prevent any motion for a referendum passing through Parliament. He says at least  Labour MPs are opposed. Hersquos right.ldquoRebels here is something of a misnomer since there is widespread belief that Brexit is the outcome desired by their leader. Indeed, on one interpretation of last weekrsquos events, Jeremy Corbyn has managed to find a way to secure Brexit while also appearing to support a referendum. This is because what is called the Kyle Wilson amendment.This cross-party proposal, which Labour is minded to support on March , calls for MPs to agree to Theresa Mayrsquos deal , but only on the condition that there is a referendum to validate it. Bingo. Labour can tell all its working-class Brexit supporters in target marginals that, yes, it didnrsquot block Brexit. But Jeremy can also curry favour with the Remainiacs of Islington by appearing to support a Peoplersquos Vote.Itrsquos very clever, but to my mind somewhat bonkers. Why would Labour help pass Theresa Mayrsquos deal, which Jeremy Corbyn has said is worse than no deal, would lose thousands of jobs and would lock the UK into a backstop from which it cannot escape  At least this is what he has said repeatedly in the Commons.Surely, a vote is a vote. Theresa May could legitimately say that her deal has been endorsed by Parliament, and call on Labour to campaign for it in any referendum. Not that she has the slightest intention of calling a referendum.Theresa Mayrsquos strategy is the same as it ever was: not listening, nothing has changed, take it or leave it. It pains me to say it, but the Prime Minister at least has a strategy. It is to run down the clock, while allowing the ious tribes in Parliament and in her Cabinet, to fall out among themselves.Itrsquos working. Labour is moving ever more in the direction of her deal, however much they may deny it. Parliament canrsquot agree on anything.There are tears in Cabinet and more resignations ndash  from the Government so far. But whorsquos counting  The European Research Group ndash that comically misnamed faction of extreme Brexiters ndash has reportedly split over William Rees-Moggrsquos equivocation on the Irish backstop.And while all about is chaos and acrimony, so ticks away the clock until Brexit day. Twenty-eight days at the time of writing. Goodness me, is that really the time  Yes it is. As in the film of the same name, the zombies are stirring.I accept that is an offensive way to describe Nigel Faragersquos ldquoBrexit Betrayal march from Sunderland to London. But it could get nasty on the road.What do I think will happen in the end  As Irsquove been saying in this column since Christmas, I think Parliament will block a no-deal Brexit. There will be an extension of Article , and Labour will probably end up backing Mayrsquos deal, or abstaining on it which amounts to the same thing.If Labour, by some remote chance, continues to reject Mayrsquos deal or its iants, in the meaningful vote on the inglorious twelfth, then I think MPs would still reject a referendum. There is still no majority for one, and Labourrsquos die-hard Brexiters are not for turning.Which makes the most likely option ndash about the only one Theresa May can authorise as PM under her prerogative powers ndash would be to revoke Article . Pull the plug. End it.OK, so thatrsquos wishful thinking on my part. Her Government would fall and precipitate an election. But looking at the chaos that is Brexit, and the lack of time, it seems as good a shout as any, especiallyBrussels reject a meaningless extension.If Britain canrsquot decide how to leave the EU, an extension to Article  would be pointless. The sensible thing to do would be to cancel Brexit, go away, and think again."},{"url":null,"title":"state-of-scottish-labour-we-need-to-talk-about-richard","story":"His fourth press chief in  months, Ms McMath is said to be a good signing: experienced, likeable, an ideas woman. How is she at miracles, though  Any chance of her turning her hand to the political equivalent of changing water into wine  For that is what Scottish Labour needs as it staggers towards its spring conference in Dundee this weekend.With membership falling, donations down, and impact lessening by the day, the long, slow decline of Scottish Labour continues. The party has become the embarrassing relation of Scottish politics, the one that has to be invited to events because, well, the poor soul does not get out much. They are not doing any harm in the corner, nursing a drink and talking about the old days when vast swathes of Scotland were the colour of the peoplersquos flag.It is a cautionary tale every political party should heed. There is a long list of reasons for the condition Scottish Labour is in, from the partyrsquos arrogance-induced idleness to its inability to adapt to Scotlandrsquos changing political landscape. If we were to go through all the factors in detail we would be here till Christmas , and itrsquos Brexit OrsquoClock already and not a dish washed.Just as a patient at AE undergoes assessment, so the political doctor, spin or otherwise, must zero in on what action needs to be taken immediately, and what can wait. In short, we need to talk about Richard.Richard Leonard  Leader of Scottish Labour  Medium height, grey hair, Tetley tea folk accent, given to wearing red ties  Asks the third question at FMQs  Yes, thatrsquos the one.To appreciate the sorry state of Scottish Labour today one only has to have watched the first instalment of Paul Mitchellrsquos enthralling new documentary Yes No: Inside the Indyref, containing as it did interviews with Gordon Brown, Alistair Darling and Jim Murphy. It was like the famous graphic showing the evolutionary stages of man, from crouching to upright, but in reverse. Once, Scottish Labour produced future Prime Ministers and Chancellors of the Exchequer. Beginning with Jim Murphy, however, the calibre of leader has been less high office and more David Brent from The Office. No offence to Brent.On the eve of any party conference it is customary for grievances to be aired and tussles take place over the agenda. Conferences are one of the rare times when parties can more or less be guaranteed coverage, evenit is just a line in a radio bulletin. What better time to raise your voice Spin doctor number four for LeonardBut Mr Leonard is now embroiled in not one, not two, but three pre-conference fights. First, his inability to show the faintest leadership in tackling anti-Semitism within the party has been demonstrated, once again, by the rejection of a conference motion demanding ldquorobust disciplinary measures for such behaviour. The Eastwood branch that proposed the motion has been told to submit it to the party conference in September. Good luck with that. So an ideal opportunity to take a strong stand against the toxic racism that has swept up from down south has instead become another own goal for the party.Debating the matter in Dundee would have shown that Mr Leonard was his own man, ready to take steps to distance himself from London when necessary. This has been an unofficial part of the job description of Scottish Labour leader since Johann Lamont quit the post in frustration at London treating the party in Scotland as a ldquobranch office. Mr Leonard, however, seems to go out of his way to give the impression that he and Jeremy Corbyn are as close as two coats of paint, asthis is some kind of recommendation. Any other half-able UK Labour leader would have the party surging ahead of the Conservatives amid the chaos of Brexit. Instead, Labour has become a grisly sideshow, its dithering leader unable to form a position that he can communicate clearly, or get behind fully.Eve of conference bout number two involves Mr Leonard and Gary Smith, the head of Mr Leonardrsquos own trade union, GMB Scotland, for which he worked for more than  years. Mr Smith told The Herald on Sunday that the Scottish Labour leader had not done enough to tackle anti-Semitism, and had missed a chance to pick up on Remain sentiment in Scotland by backing a second EU referendum. Attacks by union leaders on Labour politicians are hardly novel , but this one hit home because it summed up general criticism of Mr Leonard.Union chief slates Labour leaderBout number three is the latest one, involving Mr Leonardrsquos predecessor, Kezia Dugdale. As reported by Tom Gordon, political editor of this parish, Ms Dugdale is furious at her partyrsquos leader, accusing him of airbrushing out of history, or rather the conference guide, a statement from former MEP Catherine Stihler supporting a second EU referendum.Ms Dugdale has now lodged a formal complaint about the man who gave her a written warning for running off to join the Irsquom A Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here circus instead of serving her constituents in parliament. That last sentence sums Scottish Labour up perfectly for the blend of low farce and mutual recrimination it has become.At this point it would be the done thing to suggest writing Mr Leonardrsquos leadership off as an interesting failure and naming possible replacements. Yet no-one of any serious merit wants the job, for to do so means throwing in their lot with the current leadership in London. What ails Scottish Labour cannot begin to be tackled until the rot stops in London, and it will take a General Election, or a very bad Brexit, to bring that to a head. The peoplersquos party is letting down those most in need of its help.

Last year Rebecca Weir became the first female apprentice at its Abercrombie Coppersmiths, while women hold posts from senior management through to distillery managers, engineers, master blenders and, now, in traditional crafts of coopering and coppersmith.Elsewhere, Stephanie Macleod of John Dewar and Sons and Rachel Barrie at Morrison Bowmore are among the few females to have broken into the role of master blenders.In many ways they are following in well-trod footsteps.

Someone I didnt know had written underneath, \"Who cares \"Wading in on social media is usually something one has to do with metaphorical sleeves rolled up and literal heart and stomach steeled for dispute. Politely, I responded, pointing out that women who have been raped or sexually assaulted might not want to share mixed toilets with men.Some women might not want to wash out personal items at sinks shared with men some women Id spoken to had experienced miscarriages in public toilets and wanted to be in a supportive female space.I braced myself for the reply. \"I hadnt thought of any of that,\" she wrote back, \"I see what you mean.\"Read more:Catriona Stewart: Do unisex toilets deserve all this fuss Thoughtfulness on social media  Theres a first, and how refreshing.While this was a positive outcome, it still bothered me and I couldnt entirely pinpoint why.But then it very slowly settled. Over the past  months or so, while the debate has raged over the confluence of trans rights and the rights of women and girls, it seems that we are having to re-emphasise our vulnerabilities in a way that feels hugely regressive.There comes a point where you think the argument won and the outcome unassailable. You just assume that everyone is on the same page. Women and girls have sex based rights because we have argued for and won the right to safety, privacy and dignity based on our lived experience.So, why are we having to give constant reminders of this fact  Theres some insight from Nicola Sturgeons comments last month, speaking on gender equality at the United Nations.\"As an ardent, passionate feminist, and have been all of my le,\" she said, \"I donrsquot see the greater recognition of transgender rights as a threat to me as a woman or to my feminism.\"Im alright, Jacqueline.Not everyone has this experience of feeling marginalised or unsafe. I almost never do. I feel perfectly safe walking about at night, I dont get spooked or intimidated. I wouldnt particularly mind sharing a public toilet with men. I feel on a par with my male colleagues and respected by my male bosses, despite having experience sexual harassment at work in the past.And harassment is still re. Just last month a new survey of Scotlands workplaces revealed that one-third of women have been sexually harassed. Emma Ritch, the spokeswoman for feminist organisation Engender, said the survey suggested sexual harassment in the workplace is \"a routine part of working le\" for women.Read more:Gillette is right: There must be other ways to be masculineSo, while I, like Ms Sturgeon, dont feel a personal sense of threat, it seems ludicrous to be able to reduce a collective movement to inidual experience. Other women feel threatened, other women are vulnerable, women are still badly harassed, women suffer gender-based violence, girls need protections.Its such a negative thing, to be repeatedly reminded that you are the more vulnerable sex. That night time is actually a night watch in case of attack that not all men are allies. That sex segregated spaces are not a solution but they are a solace, a small respite from a constant burden. Yet this is the truth and were being forced to constantly remind ourselves and others of it. Theres a real oxymoron there: assert vulnerability.Its interesting that those who would undermine the notion that women need physical safe spaces, are insisting that they are at risk from ideas that offend them. Asking for safe spaces for women leads the likes of feminist writers Julie Bindel or Germaine Greer to be no-ed - because even to discuss these ideas is claimed to be harmful.Perhaps certain feminists have wrongly assumed other people share their knowledge and these reminders are actually necessary.Have we come so far, made so many gains, that, in fact, the majority of women feel no threat and have forgotten the fight  While arguing over sex-neutral toilets in schools, are young girls looking at the women laying a case on their behalf and wondering what on earth were fussing about Age dferences do matter. Years ago I wrote a sex work positive column and was horried when an older colleague emailed to ask meI could be condoning paedophilia next. I was very young and deeply affronted but now, many years and much reflection later, can acknowledge the dferences in our generational experiences that might lead to such ying understandings of what a feminist stance on sex work might look like.Do girls still want sex segregated spaces or are we arguing for something we think they should want  Is that why many of the arguments are generational - older feminists rejected by younger It may be a small, small part of a much wider debate but I feel current discourse is frustratingly dragging us back over old ground.

I do get it that some workers are so short-sighted that they cannot appreciate the benefits already described that they enjoy, or do not know why they exist. Or maybe nobody has explained the situation to them. I can think of no other reason why so many seem to have voted to leave. But now Labour wants the Tory leader to give it a guarantee that,we leave with a deal, that deal will include acceptance of EU directives favouring workers rights. So tell me please, would it not be simpler just to oppose leaving in the first place Ken Johnson,Alves, West Gates Avenue,Lochwinnoch.THE bribes paid to ious areas in the UK , as well as the money paid to the DUP to buy support for Theresa Mays plans, are reminiscent of Margaret Thatcher buying Tory support by selling off social housing stock.

And on the eve of its spring conference, the last thing Scottish Labour needs is for Mr Leonard to be under attack left, right, and centre regarding his lack of leadership, including criticism from his own trade union leader, and the beating of jungle drums from former leader, Kezia Dugdale.I would point out to Ms Rowat when she writes that \"the Peoples Party is letting down those most in need of its help\", that Labour, as \"the peoples party\" has been letting people down for a very long time decades of lazily taking Scotland for granted resulted in staunch Labour voters deserting the party in droves and former Labour red heartlands turning to the SNP.

It is therefore unsurprising that barn owls in the north of Scotland have a hard time during the winter months, with peak mortality rates being between December and March due to starvation.As temperatures start to drop in winter, small mammals become less active, meaning a lot less food is available for barn owls, and they need to work extra-hard to find it. This often results in the owls being forced to feed during daylight, even though they are naturally nocturnal hunters.This lack of food is particularly dangerous for barn owls as they are poorly insulated and need more food in winter to provide them with enough energy to stay warm.The Barn Owl Trust estimates that between  and  barn owls are killed each year on UK roads.RSPB Scotland site manager Dave Jones recently sent a deceased barn owl to the Scottish Agricultural College in Thurso for autopsy, when some concerned neighbours reported it after finding it at the roadside.The results of the autopsy showed that the bird was fit and healthy, \"in good shape and hunting successfully\", and that the death followed trauma to its wing and abdomen ndash suggesting that the bird died as a result of being hit by a vehicle.Dave said: \"It is extremely sad to discover that a fit and healthy birds le ended in this way. The barn owls in Caithness really are at the edge of their natural comfort zone and are particularly vulnerable in winter, so it isnt an unusual result, unfortunately. Its not all doom and gloom, though. Although we still find some casualties in this way, our population of barn owls in Caithness has recovered from the particularly poor winters of   and  , and they are considered to be the most northerly population of barn owls in the world.\"While we cant control the weather, there are some things we can do to help. If putting up a nest box, please make sure it isnt placed close to any busy roads. If you see a road casualty and it is safe to do so, please stop and report the find to your local wildle officer and to the Barn Owl Trust. This is helpful in identying accident black spots and monitoring for environmental hazards and poisons, and potential wildle crime.\"Friday  Mar  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"Businesses in Thurso urged to work together to help develop tourism","story":"BUSINESSES must work together to help develop tourism in Thurso.That was the key message from a meeting attended by more than  people representing ious aspects of the industry, including accommodation, tours, transport and town centre shops.They met on Friday to discuss the Destination Thurso project which is being run by Thurso Community Development Trust .Last year, it conducted a community consultation which found development of tourism in the town was a priority need.The trust has since secured funding from Highland Leader and the Caithness and North Sutherland Fund to run its Destination Thurso project which employs a tourism development officer to oversee a project that will create a website, associated social media, workshops and a tourism development plan.Helen Allan, vice-chairperson of the trust, said: ldquoWe had a strong iety of dferent tourism businesses and organisations attending the meeting.ldquoI think sometimes it might be thought that tourism is only reliant on accommodation providers but that isnrsquot strictly true ndash visitors come into contact with a wide iety of services when coming to our town, from taxi drivers to town centre shops.

He questioned Minister for Public Finance, Kate Forbes MSP, in the Scottish Parliament earlier this afternoon, Wednesday, asking how this shortfall squares with the government’s commitment to the principle of fair funding for our leline internal ferry services.According to the Orkney MSP, the minister responded by saying that the government recognise the challenges in running these ferry services and that they have been clear in their budget that adequate funding is to be delivered.Commenting after the exchange, Mr McArthur said: “We now know that the Scottish Government has cut funding for Orkney’s internal ferry services by £, compared to last year.  This has left a £.m shortfall in the Council’s budget for delivering these leline services.#It is baffling how Ministers think this approach is consistent with their commitment to the principle of fair ferry funding.  It certainly flies in the face of the will of parliament, which voted for the government to deliver on its earlier promises.“Meantime, the island communities that rely on these leline services are left picking up the tab, including a three per cent increase in fares this year.  Ministers may ‘recognise’ the challenges of running these services, but they also must recognise their obligations genuinely to provide adequate funding.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

From isles patients attending hospital appointments to local businesses trying to remain competitive, these services are a genuine leline.“Even at this late stage, we would urge HIAL and the unions to get back round the table and resolve this dispute.  Ministers must also do everything possible to help broker a resolution and avoid the massive disruption any airport closures would inevitably cause.#Following Friday#s announcement from the Prospect union, that air traffic controllers under their membership had voted to undertake industrial action, HIAL said, as a government-sponsored agency, they had to follow the Scottish Government pay policy, and could not implement pay awards more than that directed by the government.A Scottish Government spokesman has since weighed in on the situation, saying: “HIAL has implemented a pay rise for all staff, which is a signicant improvement on previous years, as well as signicantly increasing their contribution to their pension scheme in order to maintain this benefit for employees. Staff also continue to receive generous annual leave, sick pay and other allowances.“In the face of the UK Government’s continued budget cuts, the Scottish Government delivered a distinctive and progressive Pay Policy for   — one which is fair, supports those on lower incomes and protects public sector jobs and services while delivering value for money for the people of Scotland.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It’s interesting because, no matter where I go, these are the three predominant issues, and they are all related.”There are around  EIS members in Orkney.On Monday, EIS members voted to reject a new pay offer.According to Mr Ramsey, the next step will be to hold a ballot on industrial action, although the union remains open to further negotiation.“Assuming that our members decide to vote for a strike, there will be two or three weeks before that goes through,” the vice-president explained.“We intend to continue to negotiate.

Over the last few weeks KPL staff have been busy ferrying equipment, supplies and crews out to it as part of the first such contract secured by the yard. During a visit, I expected to find a hive of activity the roar and clang of big machines.But on Thursday of last week I found the whole site surprisingly quiet. This, I am told, is because most of the activity is now taking place onboard what KPL directors refer to as the OGW.“The rig is crawling with insurance people and regulators right now,” says one of the directors, Simon Russell, as he shows me round. “They are all signing off their bits and pieces before the rig gets the final piece of paper that says it’s good to go.”Every weld is being stress tested. Every item of equipment is being put through its paces.Before the rig can face the punishing swells of the north Atlantic, such attention to detail is a matter of le and death.There are also inquisitive guests onboard, doing a little window shopping. They’ve been helicoptered straight on to the rig, the property of US firm Diamond Offshore. These VIPs are potential customers from major players such as Tarka Oil, here to see what the buzz is all about. While doing so, they may also be mightily impressed with Kishorn Port Ltd. That is the hope, anyway.As you are reading this, there is a good chance the Ocean GreatWhite, with a crew of  aboard, will be making its way back up the Minch. If the weather is favourable it may even be doing so under its own steam, without the need for a fleet of tugs to tow it to the Blackrock prospect, some  miles north west of Shetland.So advanced is the OGW that each corner-leg contains two enormous thrusters, powered by engines capable of generating , brake horse power of thrust. For non-petrol-heads that’s  Ferraris per engine. A top speed of eight knots is the result. Not bad for a structure that isn’t exactly designed to cut through the water. Stability is the name of game: even in the roughest seas the thrusters are meant to ensure that the rig doesn’t deviate by more than a metre from the drill point. West of Shetland, it may need every Newton of force those thrusters can provide. Once safely in place, the Ocean GreatWhite will be used by Siccar Point Energy and Shell UK to test for oil in an unexplored area of the seabed.“This is really cutting edge stuff,” enthuses Alasdair Ferguson, the other director in this   venture involving his own firm, Ferguson Transport and Shipping, and Simon’s LeithsLtd. “The rig can operate in , feet of water and drill a hole , feet deep.”In other words, that’s six miles into the earth’s crust. This is how far down we now have to go to get the black stuff. As the ‘Age of Oil’ wanes, rigs like the OGW could become the workhorses of the near future.However, the days of building giant concrete caissons to support them are long gone. Whatever finished products emerge from Kishorn in the next few years, another Ninian Central will not be among them. Deep water is where the action is – and that means floating oil rigs like the Ocean GreatWhite, a sixth-generation model designed specically to harvest the hard-to-reach hydrocarbons that now makes up much of what the UK still produces. Thankfully for Kishorn, that means west of Shetland.  According to Simon, this trend involves the “centre of gravity” shting away from Aberdeen and towards the west coast.KPL is ready and waiting for that trend to continue.“The same thing is happening with offshore wind,” says Simon. “If you look at the next round of Crown licenses you’ll see that most of them are here on the west coast.”“We want to create a multi-use facility,” adds Alasdair. “We want to build resilience into this facility so that it is not reliant on any one industry.”Offshore wind turbines need concrete caissons, albeit smaller than the Ninian Central’s. That’s another box ticked in favour of Kishorn.From about  metres away, the Ocean GreatWhite does indeed look like a floating hotel, to use Simon’s description. Unfortunately, this is as close as we are allowed to get. Obtaining insurance cover for non-crew is a minefield Diamond Offshore also doesn’t want any photographs taken of their cutting-edge equipment. So circling the rig aboard the ‘Infinity’ will have to do for us.Aside from ferrying crew to and from the Ocean GreatWhite, the ‘Infinity’ usually takes tourists out to St Kilda from the Stein jetty in Waternish. But that happens mostly in the summer.“We have been flat out doing this since the rig arrived,” says skipper Kenny Mackinnon.Regular work over the winter is good for those who don’t usually have it.In fact, the arrival of the OGW has been a boon for the area. Twelve locals have been taken on in ious positions. This is the direct benefit. There is a harder to quanty knock-on effect for local businesses in what Alasdair refers to as the “downstream supply chain”. Everything from additional bed nights to sandwiches bought in the nearest shops are covered by this concept. And there have been quite a few of those over the last six weeks.Food and lodgings for visiting crews and subcontracted workers might sound like small beer, however. But the temporary largesse created by the presence of the OGW could be the start of something much bigger.Nothing like the crazy days of the s and s, though, when a town of , people sprung up in accommodation blocks behind the dry dock. That kind of development, said Simon, will not happen again, partly because of the strain it would place on local infrastructure.  Instead, he envisions - people employed directly at the site.The prefabs of Kishorn’s heyday are long gone but the dry dock is still here, its original concrete floor as good as new, so I’m told. The faint imprint of the Ninian Central , once the biggest manmade object ever moved across the face of the Earth, is still visible a spectral impression of the past.KPL have more modest ambitions than trying to resurrect what was.Simon and Alasdair are building in small steps. They’re making progress, just at a slower pace than many would like to see.Further investment is required to speed things up. That, however, is based partly on more rigs using the yard. KPL have a few irons in the fire on that front, but nothing definite yet.“The revenue this will generate will enable us to extend one of the piers, out into the deeper water, so we can load and unload directly rather than having to ferry equipment and people back and forth,” says Alasdair.Just sixty metres from the shore Loch Kishorn reaches a depth of around  metres, easily enough to accommodate oil rigs which, it should be remembered, need taken apart when they’ve reached the end of their working lives. Decommissioning s is on the KPL menu too.If , jobs were a flash in the pan,  jobs might be the sustainable optimum. By definition, the slow build lasts longer than the quick buck.In this place of big numbers,  might be big enough."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1447107.jpg--.jpg?1550046202000\n","title":"2 800 donation for braid valley community first responders","story":"THE new Braid Valley Community First Responders Scheme enjoyed a great response to their Open Day with more than  people attending.This was an ideal opportunity for potential volunteers at NIAS Northern HQ, Ballee to find out more information and they showed a lot of interest in joining the scheme.

He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award.

Professor Maura McAdam, who is from Banbridge, will work with researchers from Norway, Israel, Sweden and Ireland on the three-year project entitled Overcoming the Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Gender Divide: A Cross-Cultural Perspective to provide an understanding of how gender is a decisive factor in women’s participation in entrepreneurship, with a focus on women in technology.It will generate new insights and knowledge whilst providing tools to visualise and challenge underlying gender imbalances that inhibit the process of innovation in entrepreneurship. It is hoped that a cross-cultural comparison between the four partner countries will help to explain iations and similarities with regard to gender in entrepreneurship ecosystems. The funding was awarded under Gender-Net Plus, an EU-funded initiative that aims to strengthen links between researchers in dferent countries, and support gender equality through institutional change.Professor Maura McAdam, Professor of Management and Director of Entrepreneurship at DCU’s Business School said: “There is an assumption that all entrepreneurs have equal access to resources, participation and support, as well as an equal chance of a successful outcome. However, my latest research shows that women are underrepresented in successful entrepreneurial ecosystems, and that a persistent gender bias continues to exist in entrepreneurship discourse and practice. I am delighted to take the lead on this project and look forward to working with all of my international colleagues to ultimately help attain gender equality in the entrepreneurship domain in particular and also within broader society.”Police investigating child arrest Facebook footageTen-year animal ban for man who kept dogs in ‘unsuitable’ state Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"special exhibition celebrating tech","story":"Southern Regional College is hosting a special exhibition event to celebrate the achievements which the Banbridge campus has made over the past  years.Building work on the new £ million state-of-the-art SRC Banbridge campus, scheduled to open in September , is already well under way and this unique event will give former students, staff, associates and members of the public a unique opportunity to say a final farewell to the ‘old’ campus on Castlewellan Road.A rear view of the old library and technical college following its extension in  which remains in existence today.The event, which is open to everyone, takes place on Tuesday, March  at pm and will incorporate a special exhibition to celebrate the Ccollege’s proud history, legacy and successes.

The little trawlers are impounded, their crews taken hostage. But why Captain Jamie Bryson was once the Royal Navy’s most decorated and respected nuclear sub commander. But now he’s living in semi-retirement in the sleepy backwater of Donaghadee, tending his garden by day, chairing the parish council by night. When the call comes from Whitehall for him to take to the conning tower for one last top-secret mission, Captain Jamie has to make a choice between his chrysanths and his country#“Action, romance, danger, flute music. This one has it all.” The Ballymena .“An explosive tale of international intrigue that gallops breathlessly from Glengormley to Dundalk and straight to the gates of hell.” Shankill Buy and Sell.“A really cracking holiday read and, believe me, I know what I’m talking about.” Ian Paisley Jnr.“But Sinn Féin.” Slugger O’Toole.Chapter oneCONTACT‘Up periscope!’Captain Jamie Bryson’s voice was tight with tension as he barked the order. He bent and took the handles, his knuckles whitening with the force of his grip. He welcomed the cold anger, it made him feel alive he channelled it, bent it to his will. Anger and training: the fighting man’s best friends – how well he remembered that from his first day at Submarine School Newtownards.The Astute class hunter-killer nuclear submarine sat sleek and silent  metres below the cold, dark Irish Sea. Captain Jamie’s eyes narrowed as he slowly scanned the still waters of Clogherhead harbour, past the pastel colours of the little trawler fleet until at last his crosshairs came to rest on the dull grey hull of the LÉ Orla. The battlecruiser lay squat and sinister in a corner of the harbour commanding a direct view of the two kidnapped Ulster fishing boats, the Amity and the Boy Joseph, two of its four .mm heavy machine-guns trained on the wheelhouses where captain and crew lay on the floor trussed up like pigs.Captain Jamie pushed the periscope handles into the closed position and took a step backward. “Battle stations,” he rasped, “make ready forward torpedo hatches”Executive Officer Willie Frazer’s face creased into a mask of doubt and uncertainty. “But Captain, we’re under strict orders to maintain a watching brief.”He’d served under Captain Jamie for close on  years and never questioned an order – no need to, for Captain Jamie was a Man of the Sea: confident, experienced, exuding an air of calm authority that brooked no dissent.“Mr Frazer, you have your orders.” Captain Jamie’s words were low, but there was no mistaking his deadly seriousness.“Yes, Captain.”A light wind ruffled the short sleeves of Captain Jamie’s immaculately-pressed white shirt and a weak winter sun glinted off the shiny black peak of his cap as he took his place on the conning tower. He fixed his binoculars on the brooding hulk of the LÉ Orla and stood fixed and resolute as a statue. At his shoulder, XO Frazer gripped the cold metal around him to stop his hands from shaking. Though he didn’t take his eyes from the glass, Captain Jamie sensed his number two’s unease.“Mr Frazer,” he said, his gaze still on the enemy ship. “If those trawlers aren’t released by noon, we open fire. Ulster demands it.”• The Clogherhead Convention.

It is not without irony that the words spoken at that event proved this week to be prescient.Law is meant to provide a moral compass for society, allow us a set of norms by which we agree to conduct society and protect the vulnerable. We live in streets where for decades law was either disregarded or used as a tool in a weaponry of oppression. Those reading this paper who were subjected to the ignominy of its abuse will all know too well what happens when law does not work. It incites and prolongs conflict, harm and pain. But most of all the corruption of law leads to despair. Where can we gowe do not have the protection of law The single most important achievement of the Good Friday Agreement was the review of criminal justice. It was a recognition that the corruption of law needed to be endedwe were to truly ensure our conflict never happened again.When the Supreme Court in London delivered its findings in the challenge by the Finucane family to the decision by the British government not to hold a public inquiry, it was a finding in law. It was not about Weston Park, nor about governmental promises, nor about changing economic environments. It was about what was right in law. And with its clear, non-political eye, saw that an inquiry was required into this pernicious example of state collusion in the killing of an officer of the courts.When last week there was an announcement that inquests would at last have appropriate structure and funding this was because of the domestic and international courts refusing any argument that the application of the rule of law could be subject to political favour or will. Legal compliance is not subject to negotiation.No matter who the citizen is, whatever their background, they should expect the law to defend them. No matter how big the power, whatever their political philosophy, they should expect the law to hold them to account. That is how it works. And it can remedy previous imbalance.Right now, the long arm of those who abused their position and the law in the RUC is reaching into the PSNI to undermine the courts addressing the crimes of the past. Alongside elements of the military and security services these vested interests are doing it because the law, through its courts and processes such as the Police Ombudsman, is holding previous members of state agencies and the narrative of the state as upholders of law and order to account.

During the piece I never mention death, I never mention anything being lost, in fact I say very little. The piece is very movement-based, it’s an interpretation of grief, because I wouldn’t be able to stand up and talk about it. I wouldn’t want to and I don’t think anyone would be really interested in listening to that either – not really.”Asked why she has chosen to take on something so raw and so close, Róisín tells me: “Well, it is something that keeps coming up in conversation. For me, it was a real compulsion to remember daddy, born out of a fear of forgetting him. I recorded him speaking when he was sick and those recordings have become the soundscape for this piece. His voice is very present in the piece. “I could just do this for myself and not show it to anyone. I could just write it all down and put it under my bed and that would be a part of my grief process. People can be in the same space and share what is a very universal, inevitable thing for every single human being.“I don’t think we as a society are really that great at dealing with grief. “There was a time I wanted to make myself a little badge saying, ‘I’m grieving, please be patient with me.’ Hopefully this piece is a good way for people to share and create conversation – some people might not want to talk and that’s fine. I think that the bottom line is about putting trust and faith in the universe, in nature and the hope and comfort that this is a cycle and we live on.I want people to feel comforted and feel hopeful in some way and I want them to see what I clung on to. Ultimately I want to do daddy justice.”• Natural Disaster is on at the MAC on March  and . Tickets for the play are priced at £.

The second half continued to be a feisty affair and a great spectacle for the neutral spectator.With the lowered sun in Ballynahinchrsquos eyes, Ballymena did the smart thing and constantly took the high router, creating numerous scoring opportunities for Ballymena.Unfortunately, for lsquoHinch, their lead didnrsquot last too long as Ballymena bounced back with another great counter-attacking goal to make it -.It was end-to-end stuff, like the first half, the best of the chances falling to Millar, McIlwaine and Campbell only to be denied by the hard-working Ballymena defence and lsquokeeper.Cards were shown to both sides with William Edgar, Andrew Mulholland and Tim Crean doing time on the sideline.Ballymena had decent short corner chances, but were closed down well by Ashley Brown, Rea Coffey and of course Aaron Donnell.lsquoHinch had a few shorts of their own, but couldnrsquot convert. With  minutes remaining on the clock, Ballynahinch patiently played the ball around the back, waiting for an opening.Ashley Brownrsquos pass then found the lurking Stuart Hunter in space. Hunter was able to pick out roaming right back Leslie Harrison, who pulled a perfect pass back into Millar and he made no mistake in finding the net.Ballynahinch could easily have sat back and closed up shop, but they pinned Ballymena into their own half with a series of concerted attacks.Congratulations to everyone involved with the Ballynahinch menrsquos team, especially the supporters who never miss a game.The celebrations were short-lived as Ballynahinch have a huge game this weekend when they face Portrush in Coleraine in the Irish Hockey Challenge semi-final at pm.Ballynahinch: Aaron Donnell, Rea Coffey, Andrew Mulholland , Ashley Brown, Leslie Harrison, Matthew Martin, Stuart Hunter, William Edgar,Tim Crean, Jason Campbell, Alex Millar, Andrew McIlwaine, Luke Curry, Micheal Carney, Josh Higginson, Steven Crean.Joint men of the match: Alex Millar and Rea Coffey.Ballynahinch Ballymena ULSTER INTER LEAGUE.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£2m tidal turbine providing energy spins in to action  ","story":"A poundm tidal turbine currently in Strangford Lough could provide electricity for between - homes, it has been revealed.The Scottish firm behind the innovative Subhub has said that energy produced from the fast-flowing lough could cost as low as p per kWH for local industrial load customers.However, the Subhub is not connected to the local electricity grid and is being tested for its environmental impact and maintenance needs.The distinctive yellow Subhub mdash which is roughly the size of of a bus mdash has been in Castleward Bay for the last six weeks.Easily seen from Portaferry, it was towed from Belfast Harbour and fixed into position within  hours on January .Jeremy Smith, managing director of QED Naval, said that Strangford Lough was chosen over the Orkneys for the Subhubrsquos final commissioning before being made available for the global market.Mr Smith explained: ldquoThe Subhub is a foundation structure for tidal turbines and provides a means of transporting and fixing tidal turbines to the sea bed.ldquoWe want to prove the environmental credentials of Subhub after developing it since .ldquoWe selected Strangford Lough as the commissioning site specically as it had the iants of conditions that Orkney hadnrsquot.

Lyng took the resultant penalty, but it was saved by a combination of Karen Haughey and then Sara-Louise Carr in the last action of the half.The second period followed a similar trend as Clonduff dominated the third quarter, Sara-Louise Carr banging over her third point and Gribben, who was picking up so much ball around the middle third, putting four between them once more from a placed ball.Gailltiacuter took over from then on, but will rue near-misses with shots for goal from Jackman, Carroll and Fitzgerald.The latter reduced the margin to the minimum with three scores, the third from play in the th minute after wonderful work by Kate Lynch, but crucially Gribben responded with a fantastic conversion of a free outside the  after a heavy challenge on Megan OrsquoReilly.Lyng made it a one-point game once more from a free, but Clonduff defended resolutely to hold out.Clonduff: K Haughey, N OrsquoHagan, J Boden, S Murphy, C McGilligan, E Rafferty, F Carr , B Fitzpatrick, C Cowan, C Fitzpatrick, SL Carr , P Gribben , O Gribben, K McGilligan.

In fact, the South Eastern Trust has been concentrating for some time on trying to find suitable day surgical services which could be delivered in Downpatrick.Miss Ritchie said it appears ldquovery short sighted to relocate services from the Downe to other hospitals, suggesting the bedding down of eye surgery will result in the increased requirement for theatre access for ENT and other services.She added: ldquoAs the Downe has high level computerised technology theatres, it is important that full use is made of them to ensure continued local accessibility to day surgery services at the point of delivery.ldquoI have already written to the Trust urging that ENT surgical clinics are retained in the Downe Hospital.Also this week, Miss Ritchie has issued a fresh call for a permanent MRI scanner to be installed in Downpatrick.She said that for a number of years the local community has been involved in trying to secure a permanent scanner which health chiefs agree is a necessity.She added: ldquoI understand that the permanent facility is subject to a business case which needs a Minister in place to approve. Whilst the devolved institutions remain in cold storage, the approval of such a facility will probably take some time.ldquoIn the meantime, a mobile scanner has been located at the Downe for a limited period to deal with a current overburdened service at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald. I hope this unit can remain in place until the business case for the permanent scanner has been approved.A South Eastern Trust spokeswoman has confirmed that there are no plans to reduce the number of ENT sessions delivered at the Downpatrick hospital.She added: ldquoThe Trust is planning to increase ENT clinics at the Downe and to relocate an ENT day surgery session from Downpatrick to the Lagan Valley Hospital to facilitate the cataract elective care centre prototype work..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Food firm to create 125 jobs with £17m investment  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK is in line for a major jobs boost.Finnebrogue Artisan has this week unveiled plans to create  new jobs as part of a poundm investment in an ultra-modern nitrite-free bacon facility.The news comes just weeks after the firm unveiled details of a poundm investment in a new vegan and vegetarian factory to support  jobs.Already one of the districtrsquos leading employers and widely regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos most innovative food producers, Finnebrogue Artisanrsquos latest investment is being supported by Invest NI.The new manufacturing facility is for the production of the companyrsquos nitrite-free bacon, hailed by many experts as a breakthrough in the food processing sector when it was unveiled to wide acclaim in January last year.The Naked Bacon range is now widely available in leading supermarkets across the UK, with Invest NI offering the Downpatrick company over pound.m of support towards the capital investment in the new nitrate-free bacon facility.The  new posts are expected to be created by , supporting  posts already in place at the ultra-modern plant outside Downpatrick.Finnebrogue chairman Denis Lynn says it has been known for decades that nitrites used in curing meat can cause cancer.ldquoThatrsquos why, despite being the UKrsquos leading top tier sausage maker, we refused to make a single rasher of bacon until we could figure out a way to make it better and safer, he continued.ldquoWe always set out to make food the best it can be, without being bound by the way it has always been done.

The development proposal includes plans for almost  parking spaces, eight of which are reserved for mountain rescue team members.A new pedestrian crossing at the Bryansford Road junction with Shimna Road forms part of the proposal and while planners have received  objections, they have also received five letters in support of the proposal.In papers submitted ahead of next weekrsquos meeting, planners confirm that none of the statutory consultees, including the Department for Infrastructure, Rivers Agency, Environment Agency and the local environmental health department, have lodged any objections to the redevelopment of the former school site.They confirm that roads officials are content that the proposed development will not have any ldquoadverse impact on the existing road infrastructure and is acceptable in terms of road safety.Planners are also insisting that the indicative designs of both the new store and mountain rescue centre would not be inappropriate in this part of the resort.They say it is acknowledged that there are ldquoobvious restrictions for the redevelopment of the existing Lidl store in Railway Street and there are no alternative vacant sites in the town centre which can accommodate the supermarketrsquos needs.ldquoA suitable brownfield site has become available at the edge of the town centre which could accommodate the proposal and has met the requirements of strategic planning policy, say planners.They also confirmed that a study of the impact of the new store on existing retailers shows the proposed investment will not have any ldquosignicant or unacceptable impact on Newcastle town centre.Environmental health officials say they have no objection in principle to the investment, provided conditions are attached restricting hours of business and deliveries, with planners concluding that the overall impact of the proposal, which is close to a number of homes, is not considered to be ldquosignicantly detrimental to warrant a refusal of the application.Lidl has confirmed it plans to develop a new , square metre supermarket, explaining it opted to redevelop the former primary school site as there are limited opportunities to redevelop the storersquos current base at Railway Street in the resort.Lidl says it has been looking for alternative premises in Newcastle town centre for over a decade without success and that while properties have become available, none were suitable because they were too small.It says the current sales area at its Railway Street base is is too small for the store to carry a full range of goods, pointing to narrow aisles with limited circulation space. The company says the car park is too small and fails to meet its requirements, with the general customer experience falling short of a modern food store.Planners say that having assessed the ious planning policies and having regard to all representations made, all consultees engaged and all other material considerations, it is found that the proposal is acceptable in planning terms and approval is recommended..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Newcastle’s pop up beach back on agenda of council  ","story":"A DECISION to reject a proposal for a pop-up beach in Newcastle has been overturned.Last month, a Newry, Mourne and Down Council Committee recommended not to proceed with the articial beach mdash similar to those in Paris and other parts of Europe ndash at the townrsquos promenade.However, the decision was overturned at Monday nightrsquos meeting of the full council when it was agreed to seek funding for the pop-up beach and develop a business case which could pave the way for its introduction.But not all councillors agreed, with Sinn Fein members rejecting it. They said there were health and safety concerns associated with the beach. They expressed support for transporting sand by road from Ballykinlar to Newcastle promenade and implementing an enhanced beach management plan.The radical suggestion to bring a touch of French summer flair to Newcastle was initially discussed last September when it was agreed to further explore the idea, with the initial focus on the cost of developing such a facility.The idea was suggested because of the lack of sand on Newcastle beach.Pop up beaches along the banks of the Seine and other cities and towns across Europe are hugely popular and some local politicians believe they can be a success in Newcastle.Council officials have confirmed that while Newcastle promenade is not suitable for pop-up beaches, two areas adjacent to the Downs Road car park would be suitable and that the cost over a nine-week period would be pound,.At last monthrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee, politicians rejected the pop-up proposal and agreed to seek a meeting with the Environment Agency to discuss securing a marine licence to transport sand from Ballykinlar to Newcastle.It was also suggested that groins would be placed along sections of beach to protect the sand and a programme of better beach management introduced.

However, it is not workable.ldquoI have been advised in no uncertain terms by a iety of coastal erosion experts that importing sand to Newcastle or removing stones from the beach simply wonrsquot work due to the movement of sediment and that permission to do this work would be denied by central government.ldquoAs a councillor for Newcastle, I want to improve our tourism product and the pop-up beach proposal is simply my suggestion to try and do something dferent. I also recognise that an articial beach would have to be properly managed and maintained.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoA pop-up beach could not just be created at the start of the summer and left. It would have to be adequately cleaned and looked after. As a mother, I would not want my child playing in dirty sand so the management and cleanliness of the pop up beach is essential.ldquoThis suggestion wonrsquot be without itrsquos issues, but surely as a council it is our job to try and make improvements and better our area where possible, expressing disappointment Sinn Fein opposed her proposal.Sinn Feinrsquos Willie Clarke argued that there was no appetite for a pop-up beach and that the suggestion to move sand from Ballykinlar to Newcastle was to replace the hundreds of tonnes which drt away on a seasonal basis.He continued: ldquoHow are you going to manage a pop-up beach that will be filled with stagnant sand  There is the potential for both dogs and young infants to foul the sand and other health and safety issues which need to be addressed.ldquoWill the sand be cleaned every day  What measures will be taken to prevent sand from blowing up Main Street  Local people and traders want to see a sandy beach, not a pop-up beach. I believe it is a no brainer that we try to secure Environment Agency agreement to place sand on the beach.Cllr Clarke said part of the pleasure of going to the beach was being able to go into the water and suggested that a pop-up beach could not provide such an experience.He added: ldquoWe need to look at anti-social behaviour issues associated with pop-up beaches which could contain broken glass.

Murray launched the ball high into orbit and wasnrsquot the least bit surprised when the wind took over and helped it on its way to the top right hand corner of the net with Ross clutching at thin air.Six minutes later at the other end Anton McGrattan struck yet another free kick from just outside the box past Ryan Walsh to bring the sides level.Olympic continued to see more of the ball, but Jones, when he did receive the ball out wide, was let down on a few occasions by a lack of support in the box and some wasteful finishing from Shane Murray.Kilmore were far from out of it and the bustling Joe McKinney was proving a handful and he almost gave the visitors a nd minute lead when he shot wide after a sizzling breakaway run from Anton McGrattan.Murray missed another good chance for Olympic after Jones carved out another opening before Kilmore seized the lead.Callum Dougan foraged deep and played a delightful through ball into the path of McKinney, who had beaten the offside trap. McKinney wasnrsquot for hanging around and after shrugging off Stevie McGoran, herounded lsquokeeper Walsh to make it -.The unrelenting wind and rain greeted both sets of players back for the second half and it was Kilmore who went on the offensive with Ryan Slavin being denied by Walsh.Two minutes later Kilmore shot themselves in the foot when Murray floated a free kick into the box and Jason Noade had all the time in the world to head the ball past Ross.Things became hot and heavy for a while with the tackles flying in, but clear cut chances at either end were hard to come by.Kilmore were now asking most of the questions, but a resolute Olympic rearguard refused to budge and Walsh had relatively little to do, apart from the odd shot from distance.Extra-time produced little of note, but Kilmore could have wrapped things up in the second period when McKinney crossed for Pete Casey, but, for once, he sliced his effort into no manrsquos land.Jones, Jason and Stevie Noadersquos first three penalties were perfect for Olympic, but they were matched by McGivern, McKinney and Larkin for Kilmore.Adam McLean nudged Olympic - ahead before Anton McGrattan fired his effort wide, advantage Olympic.Murrayrsquos first attempt was saved by Ross, but the referee made him retake the penalty as he insisted Ross had moved forward off his line. Murray was not about to look a gt horse in the mouth and drilled his second attempt to the net, much to the despair of a mightily aggrieved Kilmore side.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Aaron McClean, Jason Noade, Ryan Noade, Stevie McGoran, Stevie Noade, Ryan Molloy, Shane Murray, Niall Murray.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time. But now itrsquos established, wersquoll be back next year and ready for even more people to join in the fun! article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

council supports development consultation  ","story":"The Controlled Schools# Support Councilhas said it #is in support of the publication of a development proposal that Craigavon Senior High School will operate on a single site# in Portadown. Confirmation of their stance came in a letter leaked to the Lurgan Mail which said: “There is agreement and evidenced need for a change in provision on the Lurgan campus of Craigavon Senior High Schooland a recognition and need to make CSHS more coherent and educationally and financially viable. “CSSC welcomes the Education Authority’s assurance that the short term accommodation needs will be met in transferring to the single site and further welcomes the commitment to secure funding for major capital investment from the Department of Education in the next - years. “It is the view of CSSC that by addressing the educational, financial, and health and safety issues the school will be enabled to provide a safe educational setting, enhance the quality of educational provision, and move towards a more stable financial environment. “The recent appointment of a permanent principal along with a strong leadership and management team, and a Board of Governors which is committed to providing a quality educational experience, indicate that the school is well placed to manage any changes required. “CSSC is mindful of the strong community interest in this proposal and would request that all interests are given due consideration. “CSSC is of the opinion that the Education Authority, in identying its preferred option, has sought to: maintain the integrity of the Dickson Plan provide a Lurgan solution, had this been possible and secure a type of provision that is in the best interests of CSHS pupils.”“A strong desire was consistently expressed throughout the consultation process by all stakeholders that post- provision within CSHS is of critical importance in meeting the needs of the pupils who choose a non-selective pathway within the Dickson Plan and that the implementation of this should be accelerated. “In supporting the publication of a development proposal which would enable CSHS to operate on a single site, CSSC supports the need to accelerate the establishment of post- provision within the school. “Finally, CSSC would concur with the views of the vast majority of controlled schools in the area and acknowledges, should the proposal be approved, that: there is a clear need for suitable transport provision to be provided to ensure that the transfer of pupils to the new campus operates efficiently and effectively the appropriate accommodation is ready and fit for purpose when the transfer of pupils takes place any future development of a major capital programme will require careful consideration and appropriate consultation with regard to the site for a new school. “CSSC wishes to thank all of those involved in the controlled sector in the Craigavon area, for their participation and contributions to this complex process.” The CSSC was established in September  as an advocacy body for almost half of all schools in Northern Ireland. The body supports controlled schools, which are open to all faiths and none, in providing high quality education for children and young people to enable them to learn, develop and grow together, within the ethos of non-denominational Christian values and principles.Searches in Craigavon part of probe into dissident republican activity Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range. Typically, who are your clients or customers  Our customers would be both wholesale and retail to include restaurants all over Northern Ireland, as well as consumers who want to create some unique dishes in their home kitchens. Do you enjoy what you do, and what in particular  Yes, and in particular having just completed the new build we have enjoyed being involved in the day-to-day aspects, given the bespoke nature of the project, coupled with the hustle and bustle of the day to day challenges of satisfying our customer needs. What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

The proposal for the work to Broadcasting House on Ormeau Avenue in Belfast was approved last March by the BBC board, with the announcement made to staff by the BBCs director general Lord Tony Hall. Now, the plans – which include the redevelopment of the exisiting BBC Broadcasting House building, including the refurbishment and extension of the buildings – will be put to the public, as part of a necessary pre-application event before planning can be submitted. It includes a new extension to the rear, including a landscaped plaza opening onto Linenhall Street. A spokesman for BBC Northern Ireland told Ulster Business: \"As part of the pre-planning application process, public consultation events will take place this month before we can move on to the next phase. The investment to BBC Broadcasting House in Belfast, announced in March last year, will transform the iconic building, its technology and facilities, highlighting the BBC’s commitment to audiences in Northern Ireland. We will share more detail in due course.\" Money invested will go towards structural work on the -year-old building to ensure its long-term sustainability, addressing what the state broadcaster has said are \"critical deficiencies\". Before the announcement last year that the BBC was to stay put and develop its existing building, it was understood the broadcaster had been eyeing up other city centre locations, or could create a new media hub in the Titanic Quarter. The event will take place at the Clayton Hotel on March , between pm and pm, and March  between pm and .pm.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pin_1.jpg","title":"pinnacle given top sage accolade","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business IT firm Pinnacle has been awarded a top accolade for its Sage software and services in Ireland.The company, which has offices across the UK and Ireland including Belfast and Dublin, has been named by Sage Ireland as its ‘highest growth partner’ for sales of Sage cloud.Search Workshop Supplies, one of Ireland’s largest suppliers of garage and workshop equipment, is one of the latest firms which has partnered with Pinnacle.Olivia O’Dea of Search Workshop Supplies, said: “From our initial meeting with Pinnacle’s business development director Siobhan Marley, we were given a solid reassurance that Pinnacle fully understood the growing needs of our business.”Barry Murphy, managing director of Sage Ireland, said:“The team at Pinnacle are incredibly passionate in supporting their customers to thrive in an ever-evolving market.

Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Instead Paul built on the legacy of his predecessors and accelerated growth in new, technology solutions, while retaining the traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Today PwC remains the leading provider of advisory services to the region’s family-owned and owner-managed businesses and multinationals, but has also built an impressive portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, opened the door to signicant export markets and is tackling some of society’s most challenging issues. “We’ve grown in many new areas – blockchain, cyber, cloud-based accounting services – but the single biggest impact has come from developing our distinctive ‘Operate’ ision,” Paul says. ”Operate is our service delivery business, which supports and delivers technology and people solutions to large, often regulated organisations. So instead of just advising clients how to solve their problems, we now do the heavy lting for them.”Run by Ian McConnell, a partner who’s been with the firm for  years, Operate is already attracting global attention. “Clients increasingly don’t want a consulting firm just to tell them what to do: they want a problem-solving partnership.” he says. “In its first year of operation, Operate earned over £m, now has , people and is still growing.”Reinforcing Paul’s confidence to invest in Northern Ireland as a strategic location is a  forecast from TheCityUK that it could become the second fastest-growing financial services region outside London by , helping deliver £bn of additional gross value-addedto the UK economy. But that depends on the ability to recruit the right talent, and he says the challenge now is finding and retaining the skills.That’s an issue that particularly concerns Paul as he looks ahead at the economic picture with Brexit and lack of an Assembly to the fore.“The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.“However I do worry about the impact of political stalemate on our long term future. Failure to invest, particularly in education and skills, will impair our competitiveness and make this a less attractive place for business.The decreasing effectiveness of health, environment and infrastructure will mean that talented people will opt to make choices to live their lives where.“In my national role, I see other parts of the country fusing partnerships in innovative and exciting ways between business,education and government. Compared to that, we are already getting left behind. We should be moving forward.”Which brings us to Merchant Square, the £m, , sq ft office development which PwC takes over in . “We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.“That makes it important for Belfast too and not just because it’s the city’s biggest-ever private sector office deal. As we were making our decision, the whole Bank Buildings issue was at its height, and we wanted to show our support for the city and its future.” The Merchant Square relocation project is led by Kieragh Nelson, a director who joined the firm in . “We’ve got serious ambitions for Merchant Square,” she says. ”There’s a sense of ‘OK, we’ve just opened flagship offices in London, and Manchester – what more can we do in Belfast how can we make it even better ’ And the vast majority of decisions on how it will look, feel and work are made by the team here. Our goal is to create the most technologically-advanced, innovative and collaborative space for ourselves, our clients, and also for the communities around us.”Doing the right thing is a maxim often repeated in PwC, but it gets backed up. On the morning of our interview, a large group of people from the firm, including Paul, took part in one of their regular ‘Darkness Into Light’ walks to raise awareness of mental health. The firm’s commitment to social mobility has seen a number of employment programmes launched, notably the UK’s first technology degree apprenticeships, with Queen’s University one of five universities selected to run the programme. And it’s expanding its Hive Academy programme, which delivers free technology education to primary and secondary schools, to the Channel Islands.This year the firm challenged itself and created a unique charity partnership – the PwC Challenge – to create innovative suicide prevention programmes.“Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and it really does feature in how we look at what we do. We strive to celebrate and share our knowledge widely and unselfishly with our people and communities and not be afraid to take a stand and do the right thing. And we put it at the heart of what we do every day. “Take the PwC Challenge: more people in Northern Ireland have died by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement than from the violence in the years before. This is a crisis, and it’s one which affects our people, and our communities. So we asked local charities in north and west Belfast, the worst affected areas in the UK, to collaborate and devise really innovative approaches programmes to give opportunities to young people and their families through education, technology, sports, and mental health coaching.“As well as the clubs in PwC which fundraise every year for the challenge, our own people are volunteering every week in ious projects – particularly with our Hive Academy. We want to ensure that people, who are high achievers in many dferent fields, are supported to play their fullest part in society.” For Paul, it’s all about the people. Last year PwC invested around £m on staff development here, and this year, a number of people have begun the first Masters in Operation service delivery, run by Ulster University. “It’s important to support people to develop their careers in ways they mightn’t have considered when they joined. That’s a key building block of our purpose – it drives social mobility, equality and ersity.“It’s true thatsomeone decides they want to head off and join PwC Australia or New York, they can. That’s the beauty of working for a global firm – those opportunities are there. But what I really want to make sure is that you don’t have to leave:you want to live and work in Belfast, and have global clients, work with cutting-edge technology and be part of a firm that’s engaged in society, you can do that too.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/eopen_1.jpg","title":"the open its the biggest thing since sliced bread","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business With just  weeks until Northern Ireland hosts the biggest sporting event in its history, John Mulgrew speaks to the bosses tasked with organising the legendary Open Championship We’ve come a long way in just a short few years. Despite its huge golfing credentials, especially in the modern game, it had been more than  years since Northern Ireland played host to the Irish Open.That all changed in , when it ed north to Royal Portrush. And that, buoyed on a refreshed and renewed interest in both the tournament, and the sport itself.Now, in  weeks, that same links course will see more than , people flock to arguably the world’s greatest golf tournament and the largest sporting event ever hosted on these shores – The Open – transforming a small Co Antrim town for a handful of summer days.“There is a buzz with everyone at the RA,” Johnnie Cole-Hamilton tells Ulster Business. He’s executive director of championships at the RA – the ruling authority of golf throughout the world, aside from areas such as the US, and organisation responsible for organising The Open.“This will be my th Open Championship, and one reason I continue to be involved is that it’s a challenge every time.”It will see Irish golfing greats, including Open winners Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowelland Padraig Harrington – among others – join the biggest name in sport, Tiger Woods.“One of big drivers to ing to Royal Portrush was the success of the Northern Irish and Irish golfers. They have raised the profile of golf immeasurably. “We are absolutely delighted with the response so far – % of tickets sold in  hours, and sold out within a record-breaking eight weeks.”Johnnie says the decision to choose Portrush, bringing it back to the course after a  year hiatus, was the correct one – buoyed by the support from the community, agencies and organisations. The th Open will be held at Royal Portrush from July -.“In my career, we had a similar scenario, ing to Liverpool for the first time in  years, and we had a very similar response. It ed in , and now Royal Liverpool is firmly on the rota, and I hope that Royal Portrush is similar.”Of course, aside from the golf, both the short-term and long-term economic benefits will trickle down and benefit, not on the surrounding areas, but prop Northern Ireland up on yet another global .According to Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen that longer-term benefit could be worth up to £m for the wider economy.“There will be , tickets sold for championship days, and % of those sold to people out of state, outside Northern Ireland,” he tells Ulster Business.“It allows us to present an extremely positive image for Northern Ireland, and into key markets across the globe. We will never have experienced the opportunity to provide such a positive image of Northern Ireland. Despite what we might think, there are perception issues.“Northern Ireland has a normalised society and some of the most dramatic golf courses, scenery and landscape to see.“More specically, the fact that the Open will have been here, as one of the world’s top golf courses, will drive up the amount of spend, especially from golf tourism.”That alone makes up around % of Northern Ireland’s tourism intake. John says he wants that to grow to £m by . He says golfing visitors spend around four times that of an average tourist.Johnnie says all signs so far suggest that the Open in Portrush is “going to be an enormous” success. But the process hasn’t come without its challenges – namely theIrish Sea.“This is the first Open Championship we have hosted in my time, in which we have a body of water between our base and our contractor base. There’s getting things across water, and an enormous amount of work on the golf course – new holes, a new road system around the course and a tunnel for the players from one of the new greens to tee. You can’t do that without support from the golf club“The members have been hugely supportive, turning the course upside down, but maintaining integrity and enhancing .”He said, along with the blue light services, local authorities, council and tourism groups, the community in and around Portrush “understands that this will bring great benefits” to the area and Northern Ireland as a whole. “You can overcome dficulties with support,” he says.“Royal Portrush has never had more than , people drive to it, or get the train to it, at the same time. It’s a challenge to make sure we deliver a wonderful Open Championship and a spectator experience.”John McGrillen says the triumph in landing the Open itself was down to the success of the Irish Open in the last few years. “You had more than , people turning out at Portrush… visitor numbers had been dwindling.“That allows us to demonstrate that the course can deal with that many people. Everyoneworked very well, collectively, and that gave confidence to the RA that we would have the capacity to deliver it. The risk factors they had were eliminated because of the success of the Irish Open, and that was very critical.”As for boosting many of the hundreds of businesses in and around the area, John said: “It will do, as it’s showing off Northern Ireland… we have seen a big boost in the number of Americans playing golf. We don’t have to wait until after the event. “The visibility the Irish Open has given us. We have Royal County Down, Royal Portrush and Portstewart – that’s increased signicantly. It’s not just those courses which are benefiting – it’s being spread. People will typically stay in Belfast and travel around.”For John, the best outcome is, of course, an Irish winner. Oh, and clear skies. “A local winner would be phenomenal. It would be fantastic to see Rory win, or Tiger Woods.“If Tiger Woods won the Open in Portrush, that would remain in peoples’ memories forever. While we would love Rory or other locals to win, I would not be disappointed in Tiger winning it.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pwc_1221.jpg","title":"pwc ni to crack  staff by ","story":"Posted on Thursday March  by Ulster Business PwC is set crack the , staff mark by the end of next year as it moves into its new £m offices in the heart of Belfast city centre, Ulster Business can reveal.Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business here.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC.
