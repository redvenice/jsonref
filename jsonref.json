No figure in public life has a greater capacity for patience nor had that forbearance tested more often than the Queen       The Queen has always nobly strived — and succeeded — to be above politics. And, at the time of the referendum, Buckingham Palace was at great pains to stress that it was a matter for the Scottish people, not the monarch, who would accept the result whichever way it went.Privately, of course, the Queen, who has a very personal, life-long love of Scotland, as well as being the nation’s head of state, was deeply concerned at the possibility of a split in the union.It was while staying with the Queen at Balmoral less than two weeks before the independence vote that the Cameron plan to ask her to help took shape.Shaken by a Sunday Times poll putting the Yes campaign ahead, he says there was a ‘mounting sense of panic’, and urgent conversations began between advisers in Downing Street and at the Palace.He recalled ‘not asking for anything that would be in any way improper or unconstitutional, but just a raising of the eyebrow, even, you know, a quarter of an inch’.Seven days later, while speaking to a well-wisher outside Crathie Kirk — the Balmoral parish church — the Queen urged people to ‘think very carefully about the future’.         The Queen at her audience with Prime Minister David Cameron in her sitting room in BalmoralIt was four days before the vote and became one of the main talking points of the campaign.Reacting to David Cameron’s decision to bring it up now, royal sources say ‘it serves no one’s interests’ for conversations between a PM and the Queen to be made public. ‘It makes it very hard for the relationship to thrive,’ they added.In the inscrutable language of Court circles, this is about as close to screaming blue murder.The Queen, who is currently at Balmoral, has been closely following developments.The timing of Mr Cameron’s misguided disclosure is so crucial. It is an unwelcome distraction at a time when the monarch is already, controversially, at the centre of the bitter Supreme Court battle between Remainers and the Government over the proroguing of Parliament and whether Boris Johnson lied to the Queen about it.Nor was this the first time that Mr Cameron has been indiscreet.In the aftermath of the Scottish vote, he let slip how the Queen had ‘purred down the line’ when he phoned her with the result.On that occasion, she kept her feelings to herself.         David Cameron, son Arthur and daughter Nancy when they heard the results from the 2014 Scottish referendumIs it any wonder that, as someone who has herself stuck correctly to the conventions of absolute silence on conversations with her 14 different prime ministers, she is unnerved by the way these courtesies are no longer always observed?For decades, the Queen could rely on the diplomatic good sense of the holders of her kingdom’s most important political position. But the rot set in with Tony Blair, whose autobiography trampled over the protocol of omerta that normally applies to PM and monarch.He related conversations in detail, including the strained dealings that followed the death of Princess Diana.He also described at length his visits to Balmoral, an experience he described as a combination of the ‘intriguing, the surreal and the utterly freaky’.They were, he said, a ‘bit of a horror’ made bearable by the generous drinks poured before dinner that acted like ‘true rocket fuel’.He also said the Queen, on occasion, exhibited ‘hauteur’ — and he famously disclosed how, on his very first audience after the 1997 election, she had told him: ‘You are my tenth prime minister. The first was Winston. That was before you were born.’At the time, Mr Blair was accused of a gross discourtesy, particularly for ignoring the unwritten rule that formal audiences between premier and Queen are entirely private, with no note-taking.Boris Johnson breached protocol, too, following his first meeting with Her Majesty as Prime Minister.No sooner had he left the Palace than he was overheard telling Downing Street staff that she had amusingly told him she didn’t know why anyone would want to be Prime Minister.Although it undoubtedly demonstrated that the Queen has a dry sense of humour, Mr Johnson’s comment was a serious error.Of course, Brexit has meant problems, too.Three years ago, Michael Gove was named as the source of a red-top tabloid newspaper story that claimed the Queen backed Britain leaving the EU.It was based on an apparent conversation with MPs several years earlier in which she allegedly said: ‘I don’t understand Europe.’ It was reported that she spoke the words with ‘venom and emotion’.The same paper also reported an alleged exchange between the Queen and then Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg over lunch at Windsor Castle.It claimed she told the pro-Europe Clegg that the EU was heading in the wrong direction.Clegg denied the story, and the Palace made a formal complaint about the newspaper’s ‘misleading’ and ‘distorted’ headline, which was ruled to be inaccurate.Aides will pray that admonishing David Cameron will ensure that the normal diplomacy between Sovereign and Prime Minister can return.In the partisan and febrile atmosphere currently engulfing politics, however, that seems a forlorn hope."},{"url":null,"title":"U S expels two members Cubas U N delegation citing influence operations","story":"Share this article \u0027The expulsion ... has the aim of provoking a diplomatic spiral that would lead to the closure of bilateral embassies, further tightening of the (U.S.) blockade and creation of tensions between both countries,\u0027 he said.Ortagus said the movements of other members of the Cuban delegation would \u0027essentially\u0027 be limited to the island of Manhattan.\u0027We take any and all attempts against the national security of the United States seriously, and will continue to investigate any additional personnel who may be manipulating their privileges of residence.\u0027Under the 1947 U.N. \u0027headquarters agreement,\u0027 the United States is generally required to allow access to the United Nations for foreign diplomats.          Since coming into office, President Trump has rolled back much of Barack Obama\u0027s opening to Cuba.

This means that hundreds of thousands of young people are leaving education without the necessary qualifications to begin certain apprenticeships or start technical or academic courses.’The report by Commissioner Anne Longfield found that 6.6 per cent of 16 to 18-year-olds were classified as NEETs in 2015, those ‘not in education, employment or training’.By the end of 2018, this had fallen to 6.3 per cent.But the report found that 98,799 children, or 18 per cent of those who left school last year at the age of 18 in England, did not leave with five GCSEs at grades A* to C – the benchmark of Level Two qualifications expected of 15 and 16-year-olds.This marked a 24 per cent rise in two years. The findings also show that children from low income families – those who get free school meals – are especially likely to leave with no qualifications.         The report by Commissioner Anne Longfield found that 6.6 per cent of 16 to 18-year-olds were classified as NEETs in 2015, those ‘not in education, employment or training’More than one in three in this group – over 28,000 – left without qualifications at all. And nearly half of children with special educational needs do not reach the benchmark by the time they leave school.School leaving rules were changed in 2015 so that 16-year-olds could no longer leave school except to go into an apprenticeship or training, further education or to ide time between working or volunteering and education or training.Miss Longfield said the share of pupils leaving school without benchmark qualifications fell continuously from 2005 to 2015 before shooting up after the leaving age was raised.She said: ‘It is shameful that last year almost 100,000 children in England left education at 18 without proper qualifications.‘It is particularly unacceptable that children growing up in the poorest areas of the country and children with special educational needs are most likely to leave school without reaching basic levels of attainment.‘While we should celebrate the progress that is being made in raising standards for millions of children, it should never be an acceptable part of the education system for thousands of children to leave with next to nothing.’She added: ‘The Government must urgently investigate why the progress that has been made over recent years in closing the attainment gap has stalled and is now going backwards, and commit itself to halving over the next five years the number of children failing to gain a Level Two qualification by the age of 19.’"},{"url":null,"title":"13th century statue Jesus returned Yorkshire 200 years vanishing","story":"Share this article          The 16cm figure is believed to have been acquired from Limoges to furnish St Mary\u0027s AbbeyA label stuck to the back of the figurine states that it was found in the abbey\u0027s ruins in 1826, just before the Yorkshire Philosophical Society acquired the land to build the Yorkshire Museum.It is not known where it was between 1826 and 1920, when it became part of the collection of Franz Monheim of Aachen, and was feared lost to the public.It will now go on display in the museum, alongside other objects, including the York Helmet, the Gilling Sword and the Ormside Bowl.Lucy Creighton, curator of archaeology at the Yorkshire Museum, said: \u0027The figure of Christ is a stunning example of 13th century religious art - few examples survived in this country in such a complete state.

This year’s shortlist offers up a complex array of ideas, from rap as a form of therapy (Dave’s Psychodrama) and baroque deep es into sexuality (Anna Calvi’s Hunter), to woke punk (Idles’ Joy as an Act of Resistance), spaced out astro-soul (Nao’s Saturn) and, of course, a bit of lovely hip-hop informed jazz (SEED Ensemble’s Driftglass).In order to nail these disparate sounds, producers find themselves in a position almost as important as the artist. One such producer has sprinkled his studio magic over two of the 12 Albums of the Year. Working on debuts from both Fontaines DC and Black Midi, Dan Carey – who also runs independent record label Speedy Wunderground – used scare tactics on Dublin-based post-punks Fontaines DC’s Dogrel in order to capture the raw energy of their live shows. With the running order already decided, he broke the prospective album down into three sections of four songs. “Then I made this pact with the band that I’d record each of those parts in one take,” he says, freaking out the young group with such a stark proposition. “Usually you record multiple takes, but with this I said no matter where it went wrong we’d just wipe it and start again. So there was only ever one version in existence. It puts this amazing pressure on the band.” It paid off. The result is a frenetic, visceral thing that practically bounces off the walls.“When you’re trying to capture how something sounds live it’s not just the sonic aspect,” says Carey. “When you’re playing a gig you can’t stop and go back to the beginning. You’re committed to it as soon as you begin. I was trying to bring in a little bit of that.”Carey also wanted to shine a light on frontman Grian Chatten’s storytelling lyrics, so kept his vocal separate from the main thrust of instrumental noise, layering it on top and hardly mixing it into the band’s output. It’s a process Carey used when working on albums by spoken word artist and MC Kate Tempest, which were shortlisted in 2014 and again for the 2017 Hyundai Mercury Prize, but he’d never done it before on a guitar record. “I wanted it to sound like someone singing over something rather than someone singing inside it,” he says. “His lyrics warranted that.”When it came to the spiralling, complex album from south London experimental noise-makers Black Midi, Schlagenheim, a totally different approach was in order. The most unlikely musical group to emerge from Croydon’s Brit School so far according to Carey they offer up “the ultimate psychedelic music experience”.Again, capturing their live feel was a priority, but this was done by pulling their studio takes through crazed-scientist-style modular synths and firing them back at the band in real time. “They’d play a chord but everyone would hear it coming back into the room at a slightly different pitch or very finely looped.” Sure, you’re thinking: “But what does that actually do to the music?” “It emphasises the otherwordliness of it,” says Carey.“Seeing Black Midi live is so overwhelming. I lost my mind the first few times I saw them,” he adds. “But if you want to make a record sound like that – and you’re not in a loud, dark venue – you have to think of other ways of enhancing that.”This year a significant number of shortlisted artists have either produced or co-produced their own records – the 1975, Cate Le Bon and Foals included. Serving as her own executive producer, Nao was also keen to retain full ownership of her second album, Saturn, making sketches of songs on her laptop before taking them into the studio to be finessed by the album’s main producer, Grades. “It’s nice to be with the record from the very start to the very end of it,” she says. “No matter how many other people help you through, you don’t want to give the executive producer role to anybody else because you’re the one who’s going to put the most passion and love into it.”With occasional takes recorded in a cupboard in her bedroom, Saturn was a surprisingly low-tech production, despite its dreamy sound. Aside from a couple of tweaks, Nao left her airy vocals alone too. “I try and stay away from effects, because enough people think my voice is affected anyway,” she says. “People think I use Auto-Tune but that’s actually just the way I sing!”Composer and arranger Jason Yarde – who produced the Cassie Kinoshi-led SEED Ensemble’s sprawling Afro-jazz triumph Driftglass – also knows the importance of keeping things simple. “Jazz by its very nature is about experimentation and finding new things,” he says. “But as much as you can use studio tricks and add effects you might not have live, it’s also important to make sure the band sounds like the band. It’s also about knowing when to have a break and when to have some tea.”Watch the 2019 Hyundai Mercury Prize live on Thursday 19th September, BBC Four - 9pm.

Tom Thorogood explores how the prize continues to elevate the freshest of British and Irish talentThree years ago Skepta stood on the Eventim Apollo stage in Hammersmith to collect the Hyundai Mercury Prize for his landmark album Konnichiwa.At any other music awards ceremony an unsigned rapper beating 11 other artists, including Radiohead and the late David Bowie, to the top prize would be unprecedented. But the Hyundai Mercury Prize isn’t like any other showbiz award show, where the winner is picked months in advance and the decision often has more to do with insider politics than artistry.It’s also an award that’s highly prized by the artists who make the shortlist, regardless of genre. Last year, MC Novelist said he felt like he, “got an A*” for his album Novelist Guy, and indie star Nadine Shah, who bagged recognition for her record Holiday Destination, revealed she was a fan of the award: “If I was to go on Mastermind, it would be my specialist subject.”After making the shortlist with her fourth album, No Shame, pop star Lily Allen – used to making headlines for reasons other than her music – says: “The artist part of me gets lost a lot of the time – being nominated has helped with that immensely.”Tottenham MC and producer Skepta was hardly unknown in 2016 of course, he’d been a pioneering grime artist for more than a decade alongside Kano, Wiley and 2003’s own shock winner Dizzee Rascal (whose Boy In Da Corner also beat a Radiohead album).But Joseph Junior “Skepta” Adenuga was doing things his own way, without bowing to industry pressure or pop trends – he’d made the video for the first Konnichiwa single That’s Not Me for £80 before releasing the shout-along shock of Shutdown.On stage Jarvis Cocker announced his name, comparing Bowie’s Blackstar album to the “black star”, before Skepta spoke about his team and scene.“We’ve travelled the world – no record label, nothing,” he declared. “We just did this for us, but the love is very appreciated. We all won today!”His comments to friends, the industry and the TV audience, in the frenzied moments just after his win, with his parents standing next to him, have echoed through the three years since.UK rap and grime have had many highs and lows in the past 20 years. Since 2016, when Kano’s Made In The Manor also made the shortlist, the scene Skepta helped birth has flourished in the charts, on radio and at award shows, and spawned more innovative sub genres.Headie One, one of the leading UK drill MCs, recently made the top 10 with his single 18Hunna and has collaborated with Skepta on his current single Back to Basics. He’s also a Tottenham native who watched closely when the older MC released Konnichiwa and won the Hyundai Mercury Prize.“I first started noticing grime when I was at secondary school,” he says. “Everyone knew Skepta and Chip were from Tottenham like us. When he won the award I realised it was important for artists to get that recognition.“And now I’ve spent time with him I’ve learned a lot from his attitude and intelligence and the way he can adapt to different genres, the way he did on Konnichiwa.”Twelve months on from Skepta’s win there were four equally adventurous, genre-melding British MCs on the Hyundai Mercury Prize shortlist, all from the same city, yet sounding vastly different to each other.Loyle Carner showcased his introspective storytelling and disarmingly gentle flow on his first album Yesterday’s Gone, Kate Tempest took her poetry to new places on her concept record Let Them Eat Chaos and on his ambitious debut Common Sense, J Hus told his story in brutally honest detail.The fourth Londoner to make the 2017 shortlist was Stormzy with his own debut Gang Signs \u0026amp Prayer, a record that fused gospel, grime and pop influences and propelled him to a double Brits win and this year’s Glastonbury headline slot, where he impressed Worthy Farm with his political Banksy, BMX and Chris Martin-assisted Pyramid stage set.In a break between songs, topless and surrounded by the sunburnt crowd, he passed the baton on – reeling off a list of artists from his scene, and highlighting essential young British rappers to the field and the many millions watching from the sofa.Three of those names read out by Stormzy make the shortlist in 2019 – Little Simz, Slowthai and Dave, whose albums compete against Anna Calvi, Foals, Cate Le Bon, Nao, The 1975, Idles, Seed Ensemble, Black Midi and Fontaines DC. It’s a typically eclectic lineup and one that could produce a shock winner, to invoke the year drum’n’bass collective Roni Size \u0026amp Reprezent’s New Forms won at the height of Britpop.“I talked with Skepta about how he puts together his albums, and it’s hard,” says Headie One. “It’s a lot harder to put out a full album than a single or an EP, and it’s an achievement, a real body of work.”And three decades after the prize began, and just three years since Skepta’s Hyundai Mercury Prize win, this year’s shortlist shows that hard work and the resulting albums are as valued as ever.Watch the 2019 Hyundai Mercury Prize live on Thursday 19th September, BBC Four - 9pm.

She worked as a guitar teacher and a toy shop sales assistant before being signed by Domino Records in 2009. Brian Eno was an early champion, calling Calvi “the biggest thing since Patti Smith” and singing and playing on her debut album. She’s also collaborated with David Byrne, Marianne Faithfull and PJ Harvey producer Rob Ellis. Calvi’s guitar-driven art-rock sound is often described as dark and cinematic, so it’s not too surprising that she’s recently scored series five of Peaky Blinders.Influences: Black Midi’s name comes from an internet music genre the band learned of via YouTube, a video frontman Geordie Greep has said they “haven’t spent more than five minutes watching”. The four-piece experimental rock band initially bonded over a shared love of Talking Heads, Deerhoof and Danny Brown, but that doesn’t mean these acts are “influences” in the traditional sense. According to Greep, “there’s stuff we all like, but it’s not like we all like stuff that we based the band on sort of thing. We’ve tried to keep the band quite distinct from what we like.”Scene: Black Midi formed at the Brit School, the Croydon performing arts institution known for cultivating Adele, Amy Winehouse and Jessie J. They then honed their live skills at Brixton venue the Windmill, a bastion of the south London indie scene. Though they’re hardly typical Brit School alumni, the group acknowledge they owe a debt to their time there. “You do shows every term and stuff,” Greep has said. “So once you get out you’ve got a really good idea of how sound works. It meant we left school, could play at the Windmill and knew how to soundcheck straight away.”Influences: Growing up in Wales in the 90s, Cate Le Bon’s father would make her mixtapes introducing her to seminal artists such as Neil Young and the Velvet Underground. She was also drawn to California rockers Pavement and two leading Welsh bands of the era, Super Furry Animals and Gorky’s Zygotic Mynci. Her shortlisted album Reward grew from a year of “self-imposed isolation” in Cumbria where she spent her time woodworking by day and later, “playing the piano and singing into the night”.Scene: Born in Carmarthenshire, Le Bon’s roots lie in the Welsh indie scene. She first came to prominence opening for Super Furry Animals frontman Gruff Rhys on his 2007 solo tour, then singing on I Lust U, a standout track from Rhys’s electro-pop side project Neon Neon. She’s since released five albums, collaborated with John Cale and the Manic Street Preachers, and co-produced an album by American indie rockers Deerhunter. She’s revered by peers including St. Vincent and Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy, who earlier this year described Le Bon as “pretty much my favourite artist”, going on to say: “I’m mesmerised by her output over the last 10 years.”Scene: Dave is a leading light of the blossoming British hip-hop scene. Fellow London rappers Stormzy and Wiley supported him early on then Dave’s profile grew again when US superstar Drake jumped on a remix of his 2017 track Wanna Know. More recently, the 21-year-old has collaborated with several other London rappers including Headie One, J Hus and Fredo, who featured on Dave’s chart-topping single Funky Friday. This year, Dave has underlined his rising star status with a guest spot on Ed Sheeran’s No.6 Collaborations Project.Influences: Oxford band Foals have cited minimalist composer Steve Reich, indie icons Pixies and innovative dance producer Arthur Baker as influences. Frontman Yannis Philippakis has also said that a “general anxiety” caused by Trump, Brexit and climate change fed into their shortlisted album, Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 1. “I was listening to the tracks in the pub and I’d I look up and see a pub garden full of people and realise: ‘We’re all in this shitstorm together.’ I felt the songs should deal with that,” he said recently.Scene: Foals formed in Oxford’s indie scene in 2005. Two band members, frontman Yannis Philippakis and drummer Jack Bevan, were previously part of another band, math-rockers The Edmund Fitzgerald, who disbanded when things apparently became “too serious”. Since releasing their debut album Antidotes in 2008, Foals have been shortlisted for the Mercury Prize on three occasions and become seasoned festival headliners. A follow-up to their shortlisted album, the logically-titled Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 2, is due in October.Influences: Dublin post-punks Fontaines DC are influenced by the Strokes, the Libertines and the Velvet Underground they’ve called the latter “the base point of modern music”. Frontman Grian Chatten has also cited the Pogues’ 1984 debut album Red Roses for Me as a major touchstone for their own shortlisted debut, Dogrel, saying: “It sounds so raucous but at the same time so intelligent.” But the band’s most formative influence could be their hometown. “I think of Dublin and our music as one and the same, because it was written by people who were intensely absorbed by the city,” Chatten has said.Scene: Inspired by fellow Dubliners Girl Band, whom they credit with “modernising” Irish music, Fontaines DC are part of a new wave of Irish guitar bands making music with a strong social conscience. Discussing the scene earlier this year, Fontaines bassist Conor Deegan III said: “There’s so many things going on in Ireland, socially and politically, that for so long were not being talked about. It feels like there’s a coherent voice for our generation again.” Having toured with Shame and Idles, Fontaines DC also have close connections with the UK guitar music scene.Influences: While often described as a post-punk band, Idles frontman Joe Talbot has said they’re really “a product of different things we love”. The Bristol outfit’s shortlisted second album, Joy as an Act of Resistance, is influenced by the Sex Pistols, Interpol and Welsh post-hardcore group Mclusky, plus garage music, grime and jungle. It’s all funnelled into a righteous and rousing call-to-arms which takes on toxic masculinity, class conflict, immigration and Brexit. The end result isn’t anger, said Talbot, but music that’s “all about opening up and being vulnerable”.Influences: Little Simz said her shortlisted album Grey Area was inspired by “just coming into myself a lot more and being a young woman in my mid-20s and still learning about myself”. The north London artist, whose real name is Simbi Ajikawo, has said that listening to grime as a teenager influenced her writing style, but Grey Area also draws from other sources. Produced by her childhood friend Inflo, it incorporates jazz, funk, soul, rock and trip-hop, and includes collaborations with reggae artist Chronixx, folk-rock singer Michael Kiwanuka and electro-R\u0026ampB band Little Dragon.Scene: Little Simz said earlier this year that “people have struggled with finding where to place me”, adding: “And I think that’s also because I don’t even know where I fit.” This doesn’t mean the north London rapper lacks influential and high-profile fans. Two years ago, Kendrick Lamar said she “might be the illest doing it”, and she’s been tapped for collaborations by Gorillaz, Khalid and alt-j. Simz has even toured with Lauryn Hill, whose seminal album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill was part of her “day-to-day life” when she was growing up.Influences: Neo Jessica Joshua, better known as Nao, grew up in Hackney listening to R\u0026ampB, hip-hop and UK garage, as well as Donny Hathaway, Aretha Franklin and Prince. Conceptually, her shortlisted second album is inspired by astrology’s Saturn return. “It’s this idea that Saturn takes 29 years to orbit from when you’re born and it is the planet of blessings and growth. So by the time you’re around 29, between 27 and 32, something big happens in your life,” 31-year-old Nao says. “You start to rethink everything – old stuff that your parents taught you or ideas that you believed in. It’s like a complete shedding of skin and it can be painful.”Scene: Nao’s unique musical journey means she doesn’t slot neatly into any particular scene. After studying vocal jazz at Guildhall School of Music \u0026amp Drama, she joined all-female beatboxing troupe The Boxettes, who were popular on YouTube. She also put in stints as a backing singer for Kwabs and Jarvis Cocker. When she released her debut album For All We Know in 2016, she often described her sound as “wonky funk”, and she’s since collaborated with Nile Rodgers \u0026amp Chic and Disclosure.Influences: Led by alto saxophonist Cassie Kinoshi, SEED Ensemble is a 10-piece band “combining jazz with inner-city London, West African and Caribbean-influenced groove”. Kinoshi says she’s personally influenced by composers such as Maria Schneider, Duke Ellington and Charles Mingus, and named Driftglass after a collection of short stories by African-American author Samuel R Delany. “This record specifically focuses on interpreting … what driftglass is as an analogy for how improvised music changes and evolves over time depending on its environment,” she says. “Sci-fi, specifically space travel and Afrofuturist references to water and its connection to black history, were also important in its creation.”Influences: Northampton rapper Tyron Frampton, or Slowthai, has varied musical influences ranging from the Beatles to Basement Jaxx, and So Solid Crew to Elliot Smith. He namechecks the Prodigy on Nothing Great About Britain, the title track from his shortlisted debut album, saying: “I am a prodigy – they made me.” He’s also said he related to Radiohead’s Creep during his formative years. His album is an impassioned mix of hip-hop, grime, electronica and punk, so it’s fitting that it features collaborations with both grime icon Skepta and noisenik guitar duo Slaves.Scene: Tyron Frampton, the rapper better known as Slowthai, was born and raised in Northampton. “It’s always been a band town,” he said earlier this year. “There’s always been good music but never a strong scene to keep it going.” His own music mixes hip-hop grit with a scabrous punk energy, but he’s keen not to be pigeonholed, saying: “I want to play guitar, piano, drums, write songs for other people. I can do punk, I can do indie, but as long as it has my voice, it’ll always be my sound.”Scene: The four members of the 1975 met at Wilmslow High School and started making music at 15. At one point, they operated as a punk covers band, but they soon developed their own genre-splicing songwriting style inspired by everyone from Michael Jackson to My Bloody Valentine. Since signing to indie label Dirty Hit and breaking through with 2013’s self-titled debut, band members Matt Healy and George Daniel have co-written tracks for fellow Dirty Hit artists Pale Waves, The Japanese House and No Rome.Watch the 2019 Hyundai Mercury Prize live on Thursday 19th September, BBC Four - 9pm.

A forecast released by Airbus on Wednesday said the number of commercial aircraft in operation would double to 48,000 planes worldwide by 2038. It predicted urbanisation and an emerging middle class would fuel rapid growth, particularly in the Asia-Pacific.An Iata spokesman said: “It is true that because of demand from people in developing economies to enjoy the same benefits of flying as those in rich countries, aviation emissions growth is currently faster than our efficiency gains.“That is why from 2020 all growth in international aviation CO2 will be offset, reducing carbon by millions of tonnes a year. And by 2050 we aim to cut total emissions to half the 2005 level, using a combination of sustainable fuels and radical new technologies.”The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, called on the UK aviation industry to take the lead in introducing electric flight. In a speech at Cranfield University in Bedford on Thursday, he said: “We need to get to grips with commercial aviation greenhouse gas emissions for the sake of our children and our fragile environment.”He said aviation “supercharges our economy, drives prosperity, jobs and tourism and helps promote Britain’s interests globally … But with aviation set to grow significantly over the next three decades, largely driven by rising demand from emerging markets, particularly Asia, the Middle East and India, I want to pave the way for the transition towards commercial use of cleaner electric planes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99a32fbcdbb7f87acbd22e04b6afa4223e8527c3/0_406_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ebefcc4641d389c11ca74cce4946a84","title":"saga travel firm advertises cruise exclusively for brits","story":"Firm says statement in brochure was an error and that all nationalities are welcome Saga, the insurance and travel company for the over-50s, has apologised after customers were sent a brochure advertising a cruise “exclusively for Brits”.Twitter user Anthony Bale, who is a university professor, said his mother was “outraged” after being sent the magazine, outlining the characteristics of the cruise.He posted a photograph of the promotion, which read: “Exclusively for Brits. Exclusively adults only. Exclusively for over-50s.”Shortly after Bale posted a photograph of the brochure, the “Over 50s lifestyle” section of the Saga website went offline, followed by the entire website, reappearing later during the morning. It is unclear whether the website fault was related to the promotion.Saga subsequently apologised, insisting that people of all nationalities were welcome on its tours and cruises.“We are extremely sorry for the error in the promotional leaflet that was sent to the database of one of our cruise partners,” said a spokesperson.“Whilst inside the leaflet it mentions our cruises depart from UK ports only, the wording that was intended to highlight this key benefit on the front cover was interpreted incorrectly and was wholly inaccurate.“Saga Cruises have a proud heritage of welcoming anybody over the age of 50, of any nationality, onboard our cruises.

She had died from heart failure. It was later revealed that Sado had logged 159 hours and 37 minutes of overtime at work in the month before her death. Sado’s death was officially designated as a “death from overwork”.So common are cases of people dying from overwork in Japan that the country has a special term for it, karoshi. The first case of karoshi was recorded in 1969 according to government data, Japan had 190 deaths from overwork in 2017.Earlier this year the Japanese government introduced a law limiting legal overtime work to 45 hours a month, with an extension of up to 100 hours a month in busy periods for a maximum of six months a year. But many remain doubtful it will rein in Japan’s toxic overwork culture.“There remains considerable pressure on employees to prove themselves by long hours,” says Jeff Kingston, director of Asian Studies at Tokyo’s Temple University. “As long as this samurai work ethic prevails, it’s hard to be optimistic.”But as with the case of Japan and other cities, working long hours does not necessarily equate to high productivity. According to the UBS study, Mexico City is the world’s third-hardest working city, with the average worker clocking up 2,622 hours per year. However, Mexico is the least productive of 38 countries listed in data from OECD — managing $18.8 (£15) in GDP for every hour worked. Ireland, the most productive, creates $84 in GDP for every hour. And with an annual average of 1,856 hours, workers in Ireland’s capital, Dublin, work considerably fewer hours than their counterparts in Mexico City.But despite evidence to suggest working less hours can have a positive impact on productivity levels, overwork continues to plague many cities. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development surveyed 5,136 people as part of its 2019 UK Working Lives Study, and found that one in four workers overwork by at least 10 hours per week. The study also revealed that one in three workers say they have too much work to complete in their job and one in five do not have the time to do their job in their allocated hours.“Employers are often resistant to the overwhelming evidence that long working hours do not equate to good performance,” says Prof Gail Kinman, an occupational health psychologist from the University of Bedfordshire. “In fact, the opposite is true. The longer people work, the poorer their performance will be, resulting in poor concentration and memory, compromised problem-solving and creativity.”Kinman also warns that chronic, long working hours can have a major impact on mental and physical health because people’s resources are drained and not adequately replenished by rest.With job opportunities a common pull factor for people moving to urban areas, the problem of overwork can be particularly acute in cities. How can a better work-life balance be established?According to the Kisi study, Singapore has the highest percentage of people working more than 48 hours a week. “Singapore is overall thought to be a very liveable city, but the analysis showed that citizens have one of the highest stress scores,” says Bernhard Mehl, the company’s CEO.“After publishing this study we’ve had cities calling us to understand what they can do better, and it’s really about comparing yourself to the average to see where your deficits are that could drive a change-focused agenda.” In the case of Singapore, Mehl suggests that “offering more programmes around mental health and shaping the conversation around stress relief might be a good idea”.In more broad terms, Kinman says it is critical to set boundaries. “Switching off from work (physically and mentally) is essential to ensure mental and physical health and a happy and fulfilling personal life,” she says.“Plan holidays and short breaks through the year in advance use mindfulness to help you switch off practice self-compassion and prioritise self-care.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e012ecd4ed6d90775815f04c292b13d0d1fafe6d/0_192_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94721a7a37b4ce873428db7aeca902a0","title":"polls public opinion polling industry","story":"There is something authoritative and reassuring about a round number. But we shouldn’t pretend that a percentage can meaningfully represent the views of the publicPolling was once a specialised sector of market research. Now it is a niche area of the much bigger data industry, using the same Bayesian techniques of probabilistic analysis that stock markets employ in financial forecasting. Its customers include huge financial firms that can extract commercial advantage from the slightest margin of predictive accuracy.When it comes to prediction, the neoliberal economist Frank Knight made an important distinction between “risk” and “uncertainty”. The data revolution has helped capitalism manage risk, but it manages uncertainty far less effectively. One byproduct of this is that, although we have more data than ever before, political outcomes are no easier to predict: hence, the current crisis of polling.For pollsters, the risk of a “wrong” prediction is managed in their selection of who to interview, and how to weight the results. If young and poor voters didn’t turn out last time, they probably won’t this time. But in conditions of political uncertainty, these assumptions start to look like what they are: guesswork and ideology.By relying on past outcomes to guide their assumptions, pollsters made no room for political upsets. Since poll numbers are often used as a kind of democratic currency – a measure of “electability” – the effect of these methodological assumptions was to ratify the status quo. They reinforced the message: “There is no alternative.” Now that there are alternatives, polling firms are scrabbling to update their models.These researchers weren’t measuring opinion. They were producing it. This is what the polling industry does: that’s why it is an industry.The artifice of the phone interview, or online survey, resembles no real-life circumstance in which opinions are formed. It is an assembly line designed to produce quantifiable opinions: that is, to express sentiments, preferences. This may make sense in the context of market research to measure consumer preferences. But formulating a preference, or even purchasing an item, is quite unlike casting a vote. The latter is closer to a major life decision – often rooted in collective experiences like class and race – than to a brand choice.The methodology of polling implies that there exists a general will on any given issue – the sum of a quantity of inidual opinions of roughly equal weight. These can be totalled up into a magic percentage. But one reason voting intention polls must weight their results is that not all opinions are equally informed, committed or even meaningful. Most of us have ambivalent or downright contradictory views on some subjects, which is why small adjustments in polling questions can produce such varying results.So while polling, in conditions of political stability, can often accurately predict voting outcomes, its findings are less meaningful as a guide to “public opinion” on more complex issues. “Nothing is more inadequate,” wrote the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, “for representing the state of opinion than a percentage.” “Public opinion” is a mirage.There is, nonetheless, something authoritative about a round figure, which appears to brook no argument. Yet, the only test of polling is its predictive power. And predictions failed in 2015, 2016 and 2017. When this happens, there is a tendency in the media to explain by reference to misleading respondents: “shy Tories”, for example.Perhaps some people deliberately obscure their real intentions. But consider what happened in the 2010 general election, with “Cleggmania”. For weeks, the Liberal Democrats surged, sometimes to first place, gaining strongly among young voters. In the end, they lost five seats.Why did the polls not predict this outcome correctly? Most of us, if asked about an issue we aren’t sure of, or haven’t thought about, will cast our minds back to the news. Pollsters are measuring, as much as anything, the effects of recent news cycles. The media publishing them are reporting on the effects of their own coverage. They are short-term, however, and can recede by election day, by which time other assets such as street campaigning can make a significant difference. Cleggmania was precisely such a media phenomenon. The Lib Dems were not offering more to young voters in 2010 than in 2005: arguably, they offered less. But a surge of attention following Nick Clegg’s debate performances drove the party up the polls, only for most of the surge to burn out by election day.Yet, most of us believe in public opinion. If we didn’t, the polling industry wouldn’t have a market. Polling is clearly useful for capturing trends in party support, or aspects of emerging moods, however partial. But political professionals working behind closed doors rarely make the mistake of treating polls, whether on voting intentions or issues, as democratic verdicts. Rather, the data is raw material to be worked on and shaped – used to guide publicity or election campaigns.Because we believe in it, though, polling tends to become a self-fulfilling prophecy, particularly on social media – where each new poll is eagerly shared by supporters of whichever party appears to be surging this week. Like older forms of ination, the numbers give form to our desires and fears. They authorise our beliefs, legitimise our candidates and generate little waves of excitement. They allow us to blow attention bubbles around issues or parties, boosting the ratings further, and spawning yet another squee of excitement and feverish sharing of numbers. In moments of crisis, this can even allow small parties to game the system and generate attention and support as if from nowhere. If it weren’t for this, it is difficult to see how the Brexit party, a corporation with no members and a relatively small budget, could have won the European elections in May.At its worst, polling can subvert democratic debate. Even a slight polling plurality is enough for politicians and newspapers to assert that “the people” want whatever they’re selling, producing the illusion of a non-existent consensus in favour of policies that have little real support.We can no more dispense with political polling than capitalism can give up on data. For all its limits, the data usually “works” in the narrow sense that it quantifies an intention or sentiment, however fleeting or partial. The problem is the way the industry is supported by a belief in public opinion. If we can let go of that superstition, the numbers will have less power over us.• Richard Seymour is a political activist and author his latest book is The Twittering Machine"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3ff0386f39ed774ef7d97fc180b7246991ae9f2/0_0_1498_899/master/1498.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f71bcd11b88b58e8668eb2d8de6fd01","title":"the global climate strike dont say youre sorry we need people who can take action to take actual action","story":"Brenda the civil disobedience penguin gives some handy dos and don’ts for your civil disobedience "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08e133d4f9c561a3137dc9bf8550763ef706a583/0_0_2555_1533/master/2555.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=232cd78f41ed636c9aedeee6d62862be","title":"woman first swim channel sarah thomas wild swimming","story":"On Tuesday morning, 37-year-old Sarah Thomas from Colorado, US, became the first person to swim the Channel four times without stopping. In just over 54 hours of swimming, and 130 miles, she redefined what an endurance athlete could be for a generation: until this week, only four swimmers had ever managed to make the journey three times without stopping.At an age when most of us are thinking about how little exercise we can get away with, and only a year after going into remission from breast cancer, she completed the feat with minimal fuss, emerging to a treat of champagne and M\u0026ampM’s, with the comment, “I’m pretty tired right now.” Rather more tartly, her mother called her “a freak of nature”.But those of us who follow outdoor swimming will understand that it isn’t actually that surprising that it was a woman who accomplished something so dramatic. Because women have been quietly dominating outdoor endurance swimming for some time now. A combination of obvious and not-so obvious factors currently means that across average times of male and female Channel crossings, the average female time is faster than men’s.In general, women have a greater distribution of slow-twitch muscle fibres, which – while less useful for explosive sprints – mean the body is more resistant to fatigue, and better at coping with feats of endurance. Women also have a higher distribution of fat in their lower body than men, resulting in better buoyancy in the water. This is of particular importance on a competitive swim across the Channel, where wetsuits are not permitted. Swimming is also a sport where technique is everything: it doesn’t matter how much you can bench press or how fast you can run if you can’t glide through the water with minimal effort.And then there’s mental resilience, something that sports scientists are increasingly seeing women excel at in endurance events (anything over six hours). Thomas dedicated her swim to fellow cancer survivors, something that will surely have stilled her mind in moments of doubt. Her support team also referred to her swimming as having been a means of coping with treatment last year.Jenny Landreth, author of Swell, a “waterbiography” that tells her own swimming story alongside those of swimmers such as Gertrude Ederle, the first woman to swim the Channel, describes how those following Thomas on her swim became “a big cheering, emotional community in the end. It was a great big four-act drama with excitement and jeopardy and suspense and then a fantastically happy ending – and the most brilliant hero at the centre of it. There’ll be a lot of women, of all abilities, who will channel her (ho ho) when we next get in the water, even though we know we could never do what she did.”She certainly isn’t alone in being a woman who has sought solace in the water. In recent years there has been a rash of swimming memoirs (my own included) in which women navigate issues such as grief, alcoholism, infertility and heartbreak by plunging themselves into icy seas and lakes. There is an undeniable thrill to feeling the sting of cold water alert you to the fact that regardless of your pain, you are still alive and would quite like to stay that way. The necessary engagement with nature that outdoor swimming brings is an always-welcome balm to the soul. So it was particularly thrilling to follow one of our own as Thomas’s support boat tracked its steady course back and forth across the Channel, day after day.Some have criticised the recent flurry of nature writing – including swimming titles – as being little more than “white people go outside” books. But Channel 4’s Sink or Swim series was significantly more erse. A ramshackle group of reality stars trained for an attempt to swim the Channel in aid of Stand Up to Cancer. It featured Olympian Linford Christie and Coronation Street star Sair Khan talking about how black men and Muslims are often stereotyped as non-swimmers. The Last Leg star Alex Brooker, who was born with arm and hand deformities, and had a leg amputated as a baby, was also part of the team. Expectations were defied, tears were shed, and to almost everyone’s amazement, miles were swum.At a time when turning on the TV or glancing at your phone carries the significant risk of catching sight of the worst in human nature, it was a joy to see swimming provide two such positive narratives in one week. We can be great, even if we have to do it off dry land.• Alexandra Heminsley is the author of Leap In and Running Like a Girl"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88d4577af82eebe330b74d8707c7999f7f9aafa5/212_0_1925_1155/master/1925.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80ed3a8819fccdb3f1ccfbf83fc48d4a","title":"greta thunberg we are ignoring natural climate solutions","story":"Film by Swedish activist and  journalist George Monbiot says nature must be used to repair broken climateThe protection and restoration of living ecosystems such as forests, mangroves and seagrass meadows can repair the planet’s broken climate but are being overlooked, Greta Thunberg and George Monbiot have warned in a new short film.Their call to protect, restore and fund natural climate solutions comes ahead of a global climate strike led by young people on Friday and a UN climate action summit of world leaders in New York on Monday. The film will be shown to heads of state and the UN’s climate and bioersity chiefs in New York.“Right now, we are ignoring natural climate solutions,” said Thunberg. “We spend 1,000 times more on global fossil fuel subsidies than on nature-based solutions. This is your money, it is your taxes, and your savings.”“Nature is a tool we can use to repair our broken climate,” said Monbiot, an author and  journalist who founded a Natural Climate Solutions campaign earlier this year. “These solutions could make a massive difference, but only if we leave fossil fuels in the ground as well.”Shyla Raghav from Conservation International, which helped fund the film, said: “The fact is, we simply will not succeed in avoiding climate breakdown without nature.”Global carbon emissions must be halved in the next decade to avoid serious impacts from global heating, but they are still rising. It is therefore near certain that carbon dioxide will have to be removed from the atmosphere, and technology such as burying CO2 underground has not been demonstrated at scale.In the film, Monbiot says: “There is a magic machine that sucks carbon out of the air, costs very little, and builds itself. It’s called a tree.” A recent scientific analysis concluded that growing billions of trees across the world is the single biggest and cheapest way to tackle the climate crisis, though coal, oil and gas burning must also end.“We are living in the beginning of a mass extinction and our climate is breaking down,” says Thunberg in the film. “But we can still fix this – you can still fix this.”“It’s simple,” she says. “We need to protect, restore, and fund.” That means protecting tropical forests that are being cut down at the rate of 30 football pitches a minute, she said, restoring the large areas of the planet that have been damaged and stopping the funding of things that destroy nature and instead paying for activities that help it.The film’s producer, Tom Mustill of Gripping Films, said: “We tried to make the film have the tiniest environmental impact possible. We took trains to Sweden to interview Greta, charged our hybrid car at George’s house, used green energy to power the edit and recycled archive footage rather than shooting new.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/980839957e4d24e66569124c7ee1a1ff10a68601/0_300_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d40b88af88c35a912656fc6e6ee82f0f","title":"superbug hotspots emerging in farms across globe study","story":"Global outbreak of antibiotic-resistant superbugs linked to overconsumption of meatHotspots of antibiotic-resistant superbugs are springing up in farms around the world, the direct result of our overconsumption of meat, with potentially disastrous consequences for human health, a study has found.Areas in north-east India, north-east China and the Red River delta in Vietnam were identified as hotspots in Asia, with areas as widely separated as Mexico and Johannesburg also affected. But the hotspots are expanding quickly. The study found areas where resistance to antibiotics among farm animals was starting to emerge in Kenya, Morocco, Uruguay, southern Brazil, central India and southern China.The scientists, reporting on their work in the peer review journal Science, said there was a “window of opportunity” to limit the rise of resistant bacteria “by encouraging a transition to sustainable animal farming practices” around the world, particularly in the countries highlighted.This overuse leads to the development of superbugs that are resistant to key medicines, which is likely to spread from the hotspots already identified, with “potentially serious consequences for public health”, the study found.The rise of superbugs that are untreatable by even the strongest antibiotics is one of the greatest threats the world faces, according to the UK’s outgoing chief medical officer, Sally Davies, who warned of an “apocalyptic” threat and the end of modern medicine.Coilin Nunan, the scientific advisor to the Alliance to Save Our Antibiotics, said the study raised “serious concerns” about global meat consumption and the intensification of livestock farming.China and India are home to more than half the world’s pigs and chickens, but controls on antibiotic use in farming are lax. Nearly three-quarters of the antibiotic medicines used in total around the world are used on animals grown for food, and growing resistance to such medicines is breeding superbugs that can transfer to humans.Scientists have struggled to estimate the size of the problem due to a lack of data in most of the developing world. The study shows the proportion of pathogens infecting farmyard chicken and pigs that were “significantly resistant” to antibiotics rose between 2000 and 2018.Kristen Reyher, a reader in veterinary epidemiology at the University of Bristol, who was not involved in the study, said: “This highlights the importance of monitoring and surveillance of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens and antimicrobial use, in both human and animal populations. It is crucial to understand the reasons why these medicines are used in livestock systems, to address the drivers for use and transmission of antimicrobial resistance.”Although the study found hotspots concentrated in developing countries, the findings have implications for the UK post-Brexit, said Nunan. “If the government decides to cut tariffs on imported meat, there could be an increase in imports from countries where there are low animal-welfare standards and weak or non-existent regulations on farm antibiotic use.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cc6e0559c3491963694284793e1973e9ab1e70e/0_0_911_657/master/911.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39c7b38da973c49261dc9ac1515f840f","title":"nature conservancys global photo contest winners 2019","story":"The global conservation body Nature Conservancy, working in 72 countries to tackle climate change and to conserve lands, waters and oceans, has announced its latest photo winners, selected from more than 100,000 entries"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/487fd03a2e799413468e216e45bda53ceb167b3e/146_134_1756_1054/master/1756.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=daedb164d027505c066f661160869577","title":"circular hairstyles shrinking sliders fashion trends","story":"What’s hot and what’s not in fashion this weekFabric metamorphoses First tulle, now gingham, which Vogue says is “full of sassy promise”.Stylish seniors Instagram account @gramparents catalogues well-dressed older people: expect bucket hats and chinos.Circular hairstyles Timothée Chalamet, Celine Dion and Charlize Theron: it’s official, the bowl cut is back, back, back.

Here’s your 2019 updateLooking back, the late 20th century looks like an enviably straightforward place to live. There’s probably a touch of rose-tinted hindsight here, I suppose (imagine having to get around using only paper maps, and eating iceberg lettuce in every salad) but at least you knew where you were.Work, for instance. Work had a fixed geographical location and a time window. Work was desks and staplers and telephones and fountain pens. You had to spend all your time sitting still at the desk, so that the people at your work knew you were at work, and so that other people in their other workplaces could phone you, on the phone that didn’t move from your desk. And so you knew what to wear. A pencil skirt and court shoes were perfect when your longest journey was walking to the kettle point and back. There was little pressure to “refresh your work look” when your office surroundings, from colleagues to pot plants, remained largely the same from year to year.If we are confused and discombobulated about what to wear to work in 2019, it is because we don’t really know what work is supposed to look like any more. Freelancing, remote working, technology and office culture has fundamentally changed the way work looks and feels. Work is paper-free hotdesking and laptops in cafes and lunch al desko. Work is emails on your phone at bedtime and video meetings. It is office politics choreographed through social media rather than the watercooler. A pencil skirt does not work for walking meetings, nor is it your friend if you have to gather in “break-out areas” with low-level seating.And yet our iconography of workwear for women remains rooted in the 80s and 90s. It is Margaret Thatcher in Downing Street, and Melanie Griffith in Working Girl. It is stuck in the era when Tina Brown first ruled New York and Ally McBeal was an up-and-coming Boston lawyer. It is trouser suits and shoulder pads and handbags built to house a Filofax. None of which is appropriate any more, but we have nothing with which to replace it. The last major storyline in the narrative of what we wear to work was Dress Down Friday, which felt like progress, but was essentially just a shrug of tacit admission that no one has a clue what to put on any more.In many workplaces these days, anything goes. Which, of course, is the hardest dress code of them all, because it doesn’t actually mean that anything goes, – it means a minefield of unspoken rules to be navigated. If you wear, say, a brightly coloured trouser suit instead of institutionalised black, will people think you have a creative and original mind, or will they think you are a fundamentally unserious person? Because those judgments matter, whether you like it or not. If you wear trainers with your trouser suit will your colleagues admire your fashion sense, or wonder if you forgot to change your shoes in the ladies? And so on and so forth. When you are standing in front of your wardrobe in the morning with the clock ticking down on the departure board in your head and these questions running through your mind, anything goes is not helpful at all.So I’m not here to tell you that you should wear whatever you feel comfortable in, because (a) it’s not true and (b) it’s not useful. We don’t need rules, but we do need a plan. Right? Let’s go to work.High heels at work are a bit toxic these days, no? It goes without saying that no woman should be forced by her employer to wear high heels if she doesn’t want to, and that it is utterly ludicrous that we are still having this debate but here we are. Two years ago, the British government rejected calls to outlaw mandatory high-heel policy. Japan, where a heel policy is commonplace, is the latest battleground, with a vocal #KuToo campaign – a pun on kutsu, meaning shoe, kutsuu, meaning pain, and #MeToo. Once you recognise how high heels have been weaponised against women in the workplace it’s harder to see them in a purely benign light, as fun and empowering. I’ve worn high heels for decades and I don’t find them painful but these days I wear flats most of the time, because heels can look a bit out of touch.But here’s the thing – you’re not going to like this, but it’s true – knee-length hemlines rarely work with flat shoes, and nor do floor-scraping trousers. Those silhouettes were built on a mannequin in heels. There are exceptions, obviously. If you are Stella Tennant you can wear a knee-length kilt and a brogue and look amazing, but on most of us norms it is not an elegant silhouette. Flat shoes work best with midi-length skirts, or with trousers that end at the ankle bone or a bit higher.A flat shoe shouldn’t make you look unsophisticated, or as if you haven’t made an effort. So instead of plain ballet pumps, go for loafers, or flat Mary Janes, or flat pumps with a narrow front V which gives them a little more gravitas. Trainers need to be spotless (most can be machine washed, on cold). Black tights with flat black shoes can look a bit school uniform, so if it’s only your ankle showing, get some trainer-liner socks and show a few inches of skin instead.Many women equate dressing smartly with wearing tight-fitting clothes. Give a woman an intimidating meeting or presentation to dress for and her default will often be to vacuum-pack herself into a tight dress or suit. I suppose there are issues here about what women are valued for, stirred into a primal instinct of what to wear in order to hold an audience’s attention. Anyway, I think it’s worth recognising as a pitfall: if what you are wearing is so tight that the only male equivalent is midlife crisis cycling gear, then consider a rethink.I am not suggesting we waft around the office in kaftans. (I love kaftans with a passion and plan to spend my entire dotage in them but they are not workwear.) There is certainly something about a defined, clear silhouette that projects a crispness and clarity that feels right at work – it just doesn’t have to be a newsreader-esque hourglass dress. I am very into the trouser shape I’m calling a Mom-trouser: high-waisted, with a buttoned waistband and wide or tapered (but not sausage tight) legs. This works really well with a shirt or blouse tucked in. A loose or pleated midi skirt becomes very purposeful-looking if you wear it with a structured blazer.You can be taken seriously without being a joyless automaton. Looking too officey is very ageing, when younger people in the workplace tend to dress more casually. And anyway, we spend a lot of time working, and what you wear is one way to alter the mood of your day. Print and colour are your friends. This time of year, before we get mired in the practicalities of freezing temperatures and wet pavements, is a good time to bring some fun to what you wear. Now, while our getting-dressed time slot still happens in daylight in a civilised fashion, before darkness descends and we are groping inside wardrobes in the pitch black, is the moment to experiment. When you look at outfits in fashion shoots and ad campaigns, don’t look at the price in the credits stare at the outfit and think about what you’ve already got in your wardrobe that has a similar vibe. It might be the same silhouette in a different print, or vice versa – but if you get an idea, then try it out.There are lots of ways you can add fun to what you wear to work. Colour is fun. Leopard print is possibly a bit too fun for some workplaces, but stripes are great. Florals can be very work-friendly on black backgrounds, and florals on black backgrounds are to autumn what leopard-print skirts are to summer, in the modern fashion calendar, which is, everywhere. Jumpsuits and boilersuits put a spring in your step, mentally as well as physically – something about the mobility of a jumpsuit makes it seem like an upbeat thing to wear.Not all fashion is created equal, when it comes to workwear. Fashion this autumn, for instance, includes many trends, some of which are well suited to wearing to the office (70s bourgeois is a slam dunk, being both smart and slick but also fashiony), and others which are perhaps less so. Feathers, for instance. Bucket hats. “Ugly sister” shoulders. Microbags.Trends that will work this season include shirtdresses: try them over knee-length or ankle-length boots, or layered over a polo neck, if they feel too summery otherwise. Also, try a blazer with a belt over the top I am very much feeling this as an intermediary level before the time comes to wear an actual coat.I’m talking about your coat, and your tote bag. The image in your head of what you wear to work is the clothes you are wearing once you have taken off your coat and hung it up along with the bag with your snacks, your gym clothes, the returns parcel you’ve got to drop off at lunchtime. But for many people you encounter on your way in and out and to and from meetings and appointments, the only part of you they see is your coat and your tote bag.So, think about your coat, obviously, but also be aware that even though you can’t see it – you get it out of the cupboard and sling it over your shoulder and leave the house – if your tote bag bears a brand or slogan, then that is the headline emblazoned across your person. If you wouldn’t wear it on a slogan T-shirt, don’t wear it on a tote bag. People will judge you, fact.

Paul Merton talks about the legacy of his hero – and how comedy is too coarse todaySeven years before his suicide, Tony Hancock tried to became a movie star. The Rebel (1961) is a comedy about a clerk who quits his job and moves to Paris to become an artist, despite his total lack of talent. Scripted by Half Hour creators Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, it was a deluxe bespoke vehicle, designed to take Hancock across the Atlantic and turn him into the new Peter Sellers.Brits flocked. Homegrown critics raved. And Hollywood absolutely hated it. (“Stumbling … presumptuous … depressing … low,” reckoned the New York Times, comparing him unfavourably to Norman Wisdom.)It was the start of the end. The following year, after a final series of Hancock’s Half Hour minus Sid James – let go lest Hancock be defined only as part of a double act – Hancock fired Galton and Simpson, too. They then made Steptoe and Son (average audience: 28 million) Hancock made a second bid for international film stardom with a self-scripted feature about a Punch and Judy show in Bognor Regis.“It’s not a comedy,” grimaces Paul Merton. “Don’t expect any laughs. It’s very bitter.” Merton was six when he went to see it with his mother, who began flinching in the first scene, when Hancock swears at the Lord Mayor. By the time he had “taken an ornamental pig and shoved a bunch of flowers up its arse, really quite violently”, her fandom was substantially shaken.Now, those two films that kiboshed Hancock’s big-screen dreams – one wonderful, one sort of awful – have been restored and rereleased with the heave-ho of Merton, a longtime keeper of the Hancock flame. The Rebel, at least, is a revelation: snappy, surreal, full of satirical horsepower and starring a baby-faced, blue-eyed bon vivant. For those of us familiar only with the black-and-white grump, the effervescence is amazing.Tell Merton this, and delight knocks a decade off him. “Ray and Alan always said Hancock seemed to have been born at 40, but in The Rebel he does have the bloom of youth in those cheeks. I think it’s the smooth skin.” Nice clear eyes, too. “Yes, wonderful!” he beams.Yet he is still a far cry from 35-year-old leading men today, few of whom have white tufts and dialogue describing themselves as “stout”. “Well, yes,” says Merton. “But since the early days he was called “Tubs” and there was lots of talk about his terrible feet. Comics then were meant to look a bit funny.”Still, when he remade half a dozen Half Hours in 1996 (big ratings, iffy reviews), he says you would never have guessed he and Hancock were the same age at the time of shooting: “It was to do with the war and with nutrition.” Plus, this was the era of Sgt Pepper, when 64 was repellently elderly. “Now, it’s not considered anything! It’s the new 12!”At 62, Merton looks like a merry, greying, hippie-era John Lennon. He is having cappuccinos in a deserted Bloomsbury hotel, hair straggly, round specs thick and glinting. He wears a charcoal suit and enormously floral shirt presumably bought for TV. In fact, he could have strolled straight off it. Merton surpasses even your most hopeful expectations: funny, friendly, generous, easy.Yet, like his hero, there is a residual sense he is a bit dour and depressive, stemming perhaps from an inpatient episode at Maudsley psychiatric hospital around the time he broke through on Whose Line Is It Anyway?. Actually, he says, that was down to some dodgy malaria tablets – his stay extended because staff didn’t believe he actually was on telly every Friday.The smog that surrounds Hancock is harder to shift. “It’s an impossible story to ignore,” says Merton. “The clown with the tear in his eye the comedian who makes everybody else laugh but cannot find satisfaction himself.” An easy cliche is media catnip. Merton “loathed” Stan \u0026amp Ollie, last year’s Laurel and Hardy biopic, because “it tried to create drama where there was no real friction. If I’d seen it in a cinema, I’d have been asked to leave. Every 15 minutes, I was like: ‘Oh, for fuck’s sake!’”Galton and Simpson were, he reports, “just astonished” by the 1991 Hancock film starring Alfred Molina, which shows them smirking “like the Kray twins” in the back row at his ill-fated 1966 stage comeback. Years later, Galton met the writer at a party and punched him to the floor. “Good on him!” grins Merton. “The sheer anger! How dare you do that! Ray and Alan were always grateful and affectionate towards Tony. He’d split his fee with them 5050. He introduced them to France and wine. When they knew him there was little hint of what was to come. He was a bit of a worrier. But then a lot of comedians can be worriers, particularly if you’re not writing your own material.”Hancock’s legacy, he thinks, has suffered under a spotlight fixed on his grubbier troubles – and some unhelpful visuals. “That famous shot of him wearing the big coat and looking miserable over a cup of tea. That was from a programme called The Cold. He’s meant to be ill. Not to look desperately suicidal.”Yet even Merton can’t help having false hindsight. “There’s that line in The Rebel,” he says with a shiver. “‘You’ll be sorry when I’m dead.’ It does rather leap out at you.”Quite why the film was such a disaster across the pond is still a puzzle. After all, Ealing succeeded, despite – or perhaps because of – its amplified Englishness. Even the Carry Ons had cut through. But something about the bluster and camp indignation of Hancock’s delivery seems to have mistranslated. And there is something peculiarly parochial about the narrative of a frustrated fantasist crashing out of the rat race. There are echoes of Billy Liar in the office scenes groundwork for Reggie Perrin in the train commute, in which Hancock’s voiceover speculates about his fellow passengers (few Americans travel to work in the same way).When Merton first saw The Rebel in the late 70s, it was during his three-year stint at Tooting Bec employment office in south London. The sequence on the 8:32 to Waterloo struck a special chord. “Hancock goes: ‘Oh, there’s young Reginald. If this train’s still running in 1980, he’ll be on it.’” Merton shudders. “When I started at 19, they told me about the pension scheme. Going to the same place every day, doing the same job, filled me with horror.”This is another reason The Rebel might not have hit home in the land of the American dream. Even back in 1961, the notion of ditching a mundane job to try to make it big wasn’t so wild. It might also be what limits its contemporary appreciation, when it is taken as read you should seek artistic fulfilment (and jobs for life are the real pipe-dream).In the film, George Sanders’ art dealer is unsparing about Hancock’s lack of talent today, such harsh criticism is a no-no. Whether or not someone actually has any gifts “doesn’t seem to be important any more,” says Merton. There are too many channels and “not that much talent to go around to fill all this space”.He was watching something the other day, he says, that recapped the career highlights of a social media star, “which mostly seemed to be combing his hair. I mean, it’s a long way from Sammy Davis Jr! I know we all want to leave our mark, but now there’s millions of them, I’m not sure it’s any better than it used to be in terms of standing out from the crowd.”The Rebel is especially sharp on the fallacy of inidualism. An existentialists’ party sees them bemoaning the hegemony of office life, while dressed in matching black outfits with identical goatees. Plus ça change, laughs Merton. “I’m by no means an expert on women’s hair, but I have noticed in the last three or four months this fashion, which I think is great, for pink hair and yellow hair. Everyone’s inidual in their own way of doing it, but they’re all doing it.”Merton’s granny-ish lack of savvy is knowingly naive – and real. He delights in a luddite world (no mobile phone, no email, no idea what Instagram is) not so distant from that inhabited by his hero. Despite his day job, he says he doesn’t follow the news or care for politics. “Give me a story about a parrot that’s learned how to drive and I’m in seventh heaven.”Nor does he watch modern comedy (his most recent reference is The Royle Family), mostly because he’s got an “incredibly good memory for jokes” and worries about accidental plagiarism. When he does catch a bit, he’s rarely impressed. “Comedy has coarsened. It’s weak. It’s lazy. I don’t want to sound prudish, and some bodily function jokes can be good. But it’s a shame that if you say ‘fuck’ in front of an audience, they’ll probably laugh. It’s a shock thing. Any weak punchline can be bolstered by sticking that word in there.”Not that we should rose-tint comedy’s golden age. The Blood Donor contains uncomfortable lines about Hancock’s “undiluted British” blood and how it ought not to be mixed. The Two Ronnies had “quite a bit of blackface and antisemitism. Stuff which you’d have gone ‘Ooooh’ at even in 1977.”But Merton doesn’t really want to give anyone a kicking. Comedy is an underrated skill, he says, more so now than ever. It is overlooked for Oscars “because comedy undermines the pomposity of calling yourself something like The Academy of Motion Pictures and Science”. Yet it is harder than drama, because if that audience seems spellbound “they might just be thinking about tomorrow’s shopping. While with comedy, they’re either laughing or they’re not. You know exactly how it’s going.” He sighs. “In the 1920s, Chaplin was compared to Michelangelo and Leonardo Da Vinci, Beethoven and Shakespeare. He was considered a giant of his art.”Hancock’s aspirations were understandable. And in filming The Rebel – about a man desperate for artistic acclaim – he was making his own stab at what he saw as the ultimate immortality. It’s not so unusual, it turns out. As we’re packing up, I ask Merton if he ever fancied getting into film. “Yes, but the film didn’t want me getting into it.” He laughs. “But that was always my real big top ambition.”I hadn’t realised. Oh yes, he says. A couple of years ago, he wrote a script with his wife, Suki Webster. “We couldn’t even get meetings. Channel 4 never even replied.” I’m amazed. Why? He frets it might have felt like a vanity project that he should have got a director onboard first. “But I’ve got no reputation in that world. No credit, no credibility. Still, I think we were rather bemused by the complete lack of interest.”Merton smiles sadly. And, for a second, Hancock is back in the room.The Rebel and The Punch and Judy Man are on Blu-ray, DVD and Amazon Video from 30 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18700435854f9ee1dd72d53c72b57bc525a7926c/37_109_2794_1676/master/2794.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77e71dc8da9ac17d96c23d780e6cd7e6","title":"eintracht frankfurt arsenal europa league match report","story":"Sunday’s crisis is Thursday’s radiant beacon of hope. Arsenal had spent the week fending off the brickbats hurled following their shoddy collapse at Watford Eintracht Frankfurt had passed it feeling justifiably optimistic that their unbeaten home run in Europe, stretching 16 games and 13 years, would be extended. However they had prepared, nobody could have anticipated the way Unai Emery’s reshuffled team, driven on thrillingly by the youngsters Bukayo Saka and Joe Willock, put context aside and created an unforgettable night of their own.Is there a club in England that swings so wildly between poles of optimism and despair? Reasons for the former abounded here those seeking some sort of middle ground will caution that it was a minor miracle Arsenal kept a clean sheet in a game whose openness bordered on the comical. But it felt like confirmation that this generation of academy products is bold and bright enough to trouble top-level opponents regularly.Saka, in particular, was simply too lively for Eintracht to handle from his perch on the left and with Arsenal’s frontline options stretched it is hardly fanciful to envisage him being set upon Premier League defences soon.Saka had begun presenting the case for that within five minutes, clipping over a cross from which Lucas Torreira should have scored. Arsenal missed other chances before the winger, who turned 18 a fortnight ago, made his latest dart into space and passed to Willock, who is two years his senior. There was good fortune in Willock’s finish, which spun into the net via a deflection off David Abraham and a ricochet off the crossbar, but the away side earned their luck throughout.“Their performance tonight was good and they deserve it,” Emery said of his players, only four of whom remained from the starting lineup at Vicarage Road. The blend of youth and experience continued to pay idends in a second half during which it became almost impossible to keep up with the number of openings for each side.One driving run from Willock, showcasing the mixture of tenacity and composure that characterised an outstanding inidual performance, forced Martin Hinteregger into a last-ditch challenge on Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Willock and Saka were then both denied by Kevin Trapp, while a free-kick from Granit Xhaka swung beyond everybody and struck the bar.Eventually Saka’s sheer insistence caused Eintracht to collapse late on. First he drew a foul from Dominik Kohr, who had already been booked, and the home midfielder was sent off. Then, afforded a yard of space around the edge of the area, he set his sights and curled a slick left-foot effort into Trapp’s far corner quite some way to score a first senior goal. There were five minutes left but straightaway he played in Aubameyang, who presumably did not mind being burdened with another full 90 minutes when his youthful teammates were performing as joyfully as this, for a characteristically decisive finish.“With his goal, with his performance, but also taking confidence in the match, finishing really strongly physically,” Emery said when asked what had pleased him about Saka’s display. While hardly effusive, he also praised Willock and also made sure to talk up the 19-year-old Emile Smith Rowe, who did well on the right of the attack. It is no slight on his work that his teammates stole the show, and if he had beaten Trapp after being played through when the tie was goalless the conversation may conceivably have centred on his contribution.By contrast it was a night in which Eintracht had to fish around for positives. The forwards who propelled them to the semi-finals last season – Luka Jovic, Sébastien Haller and Ante Rebic – have all moved on and they were sorely missed. While David Luiz and Shkodran Mustafi, the latter back from the cold, both performed respectably nobody would pretend this was a stingy defensive effort from Arsenal. Bas Dost and André Silva, this season’s Eintracht strikers, both missed chances and the goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez was periodically called upon to impress.“It’s a bad defeat because the result and the performance do not fit each other,” their manager, Adi Hütter, said. If anyone wanted to burst Arsenal’s latest bubble they could fairly point out that was true. But the scares at one end were, on this occasion, worth it for the vibrancy shown at the other.“I want to create a big spirit, working tonight,” Emery said. “Sometimes we are going to have a plan and use different players.” What talents they are what a perplexing, maddening and utterly compelling proposition Arsenal continue to be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abbd5f4ddb8398d0b09df3b6a82d95057f3b1904/0_0_3364_2019/master/3364.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3ce5299266449a9bfaec98a8277e72f","title":"manchester united astana europa league match report","story":"Mason Greenwood came to Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s rescue just as the Manchester United manager’s faith in his promoted young players was beginning to look misplaced. On his first Old Trafford start, the 17-year-old earned United the points with a coolly struck winner.Solskjær had said he was an expert finisher and here he proved it with an important first United goal, though it was significant that by the 73rd minute he was the only teenager left on the field. “If you just get Mason in the box you know something is going to happen,” Solskjær said. “He might not play in the next game but he’ll be important for us this season. He’ll get his minutes.”Greenwood became United’s youngest ever European scorer, beating Marcus Rashford’s record set in 2016. Yet with three inexperienced youngsters in the side and nine changes from the last starting lineup, United had failed up to that point to take a grip on the game, leading to the conclusion that the present crop of youth products may not be quite as ready as the manager had hoped.Solskjær had stressed the importance of winning the home games in the group and, as the champions of Kazakhstan are probably the weakest side United will face, he will need to rethink his selection policy for future matches if he really wants to progress. It was notable that United were best served by old hands such as Nemanja Matic, Marcos Rojo and Rashford. The last is hardly old at 21, though he was a man among boys in this XI.United signalled their attacking intentions from the outset, with Fred hitting the bar with a thumping 30-yard drive after just three minutes. Remarkably the diminutive Brazilian was not the smallest home player on the pitch, thanks to Solskjær giving a full debut to the even tinier Angel Gomes. United should have taken the lead 12 minutes in when the 19‑year‑old’s corner rebounded invitingly off Axel Tuanzebe for Rashford, yet though the striker was onside and only a yard out, he found Nenad Eric in the Astana goal equal to his attempt to hook the ball over the line.Phil Jones, making his first start of the season, was caught out midway through the first half when Roman Murtazayev turned him neatly and set off towards goal, only to produce the tamest of shots straight at Sergio Romero.All the pre-match attention had been centred on Greenwood’s elevation to the United front line but, though he did produce one shot narrowly off-target, it was Rashford who caused the visiting defence most problems, especially when running through static defenders to reach Rojo’s lofted passes. The old man of the United attack should probably have done better when the left-back’s first invitation found him clear in the area, but his touch let him down when attempting to control the ball. The next time Rashford opted for a first-time volley, only to be denied again by Eric’s reactions on the line.Even such a callow United side were clearly superior to their Kazakh opponents – Astana found it increasingly difficult to cross the halfway line – yet the longer the game remained scoreless the more hesitant and laboured the home side appeared. For all their pressure they could count themselves lucky that Murtazayev is such a poor finisher, for after another Jones mistake had left Marin Tomasov in possession on halfway the Astana forward was given another shooting chance and again put a weak shot far too close to Romero.Rashford had another close-range chance at the end of the first half, again from Rojo, but this time via a deflection, when to the disappointment of the group of home fans in the “away” seats who kept up a barrage of noise throughout the game, he shot straight into the arms of the goalkeeper.Gomes almost created a goal at the start of the second half when he enabled Rojo to send a low cross right along the goalline, one that both Greenwood and Tahith Chong failed to reach for a tap-in at the far post. When Fred forced a save with a free-kick after an hour it seemed to illustrate United’s dearth of attacking options and Juan Mata and Jesse Lingard were sent on shortly afterwards.Both were tangentially involved in the buildup to the breakthrough goal, though it would be unfair to deny Greenwood the credit he deserves for dragging Dorin Rotariu the wrong way and applying a confident finish from an unpromising angle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cac15ac5020c4bd2af6f25485666aad71ca5b7b7/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b50d5e84bddac69aa184c00e171ca35","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Still looking for his first home win as Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard will do well to get off the mark against Liverpool at Stamford Bridge. While he and his coaching staff will have scrutinised Napoli’s midweek Champions League win over Jürgen Klopp’s side looking for weaknesses, they are unlikely to have learned much they didn’t know already. Diligently maintaining your shape, getting behind Liverpool’s advancing full-backs and hoping at least one of your central defenders can perform a passable imitation of Kalidou Koulibaly is all very well in theory, but a lot easier said than done. And while the prospect of Liverpool’s preposterously-talented front three drawing blanks again seems remote, Lampard can at least take heart from the fact Liverpool only beat one of their fellow top six teams on their travels last season. BGLast November Unai Emery left Mesut Özil out of a trip to Bournemouth because he foresaw “a very demanding match with physicality and intensity.” The Spaniard also expected last Sunday’s assignment at Vicarage Road to be a very demanding match with physicality and intensity – so he picked Özil for the first time this season, explaining that he wanted the player’s technique to be the antidote to Watford’s power. Over a year into the job, Emery is still grasping for hopeful solutions in a squad that remains inadequate. So, even though Özil was omitted for Thursday’s Europa League trip to Eintracht Frankfurt, it is hard to anticipate the make-up of Arsenal’s midfield for Sunday’s home match against Aston Villa. Except to say that Granit Xhaka will probably be in it because Emery clearly believes the captain is more dependable than any of his other options. PDThere can’t be many 37-year-old footballers who have spent their entire career playing for major clubs in a single country without ever once facing a former team. Phil Jagielka may end the weekend without that record having changed – he has played just a single minute of Premier League football so far this season, and was not even on the bench for either of Sheffield United’s last two matches – but sentimentalists will surely be united in hoping he gets a chance to soak up some 360-degree applause as his first and current team, Sheffield United, visit the club he represented for 12 years, Everton. “It will be a really strange feeling for me to go to Goodison,” he says. “To be at a club so long and go back will be quite strange and, I imagine, generate a mixture of emotions. I can’t tell you exactly what I expect.” SBSince winning at Crystal Palace way back in February Manchester United have taken three points from six Premier League away games, despite only one of them being against another top-six side (Arsenal, where they lost in March). Over that period only Tottenham, with two points, have a worse away record. Failure to win at West ham would extend to nine their run of away games without a win in all competitions, something that last happened to them five years ago. But it is a slightly rogue statistic: though there were certainly several poor performances last season they have dominated both of their top-flight trips in this campaign, would have beaten Wolves but for Paul Pogba’s penalty miss and had 21 shots at Southampton, with eight on target (the home side had two). The fixture computer has given them a lopsided season with only one away game against a top-six side before 2020 dawns. With that in mind, a imminent improvement to that record on their travels can be expected. SBManchester City’s 6-0 dismantling of Watford in May’s FA Cup final was the beginning of the end for Javi Gracia. And maybe the second half of last weekend’s match against Arsenal was the start of an upturn under Quique Sánchez Flores. The manager’s priority on his return was to make Watford more solid but against Arsenal they demonstrated how troublesome they can be to opposing defences, especially brittle ones who insist on trying to tip-toe their way out of their own box. Fernandinho looked comfortable alongside Nicolas Otamendi during City’s mid-week win but Watford, encouraged by their own display against Arsenal and the problems that Norwich caused the champions last weekend, could prosper if they aim for City’s most vulnerable spots. PDLeicester were the classier team for large parts of their matches at Chelsea and Manchester United earlier this season but a haul of one point from those games is not the sort of return that will nurture their hopes of breaking into the top six. They need to start beating the big teams. Sunday’s visit by Spurs is an opportunity to do just that, especially as Leicester have had the whole week to prepare while Mauricio Pochettino’s side were being given the run-around by Olympiakos. The comparison between the full-backs will be especially interesting, with Serge Aurier and Danny Rose likely to return to the Spurs team and attempt to keep the excellent Ricardo Pereira and Ben Chilwell on the back foot. Son Heung-min and Lucas Moura should start in support of Harry Kane, as both have looked sharp this season, unlike Dele Alli and Christian Eriksen, the latter being especially wan in his last outing. PDSouthampton have already played Liverpool and Manchester United, and after this match they play the remainder of last season’s top nine in seven consecutive league games, a testing run that concludes only when Watford visit on the last day of November, so they could probably do with getting some points here. Ralph Hasenhuttl demonstrated his flexibility in last week’s victory over Sheffield United, with another new shape – the fourth in five league games – but reshuffled with barely half an hour gone and his team on the back foot. The game duly ended with a third successive 1-0 away win in all competitions, ensuring they enter this weekend in full confidence. One thing that would improve their prospects would be if the otherwise impressive Che Adams located his shooting boots: the £15m summer arrival has taken 11 shots so far this season, four more than any other Southampton player, but nine of them have been off target and none have gone in. If Adams’s luck comes good, the Saints might not find their upcoming run of fixtures quite so daunting. SBLast season Wolves were significantly worse in the first half of matches than in the second, ‘winning’ just eight first halves. Had all games finished at the interval they would have come 15th, but happily ‘won’ 15 second halves, scoring nearly twice as many goals (30-17) after the break than they managed before it, and came seventh. Inevitably, their habit of starting poorly repeatedly forced them to battle back from adversity, something that to their credit they frequently achieved – they won 14 points from losing positions, worse only than Liverpool (16) and West Ham (15) and significantly more than this weekend’s opponents, Crystal Palace, who managed only five. Wolves’ damaging habit is one that has significantly worsened over the summer: only in their goalless draw at Leicester in August have they not been losing at the break, but so far no side has bettered them after it. The problem is, this season they are struggling, and sit 19th on three points. SBFollowing their heroics against Manchester City last weekend, Norwich travel to Burnley for a test of a very different kind. Sean Dyche has said he could make changes to his line-up, after Burnley were rather fortunate to take a point at Brighton, courtesy of a very late Jeff Hendrick strike. The Irish international has struggled to get a look in this season, but impressed last weekend along with his fellow substitutes Matej Vydra and Jay Rodriguez and could find himself in the starting line-up against Norwich. Fitness permitting, opposing sttrikers Ashley Barnes and Teemu Pukki are stonewall certainties to start, having scored 50 goals between them in the past calendar year. BGSince their promotion to the Premier League alongside Newcastle in 2017, there are only two teams that Brighton have played every season and not yet lost to: West Ham, with whom they drew their fifth top-flight meeting last month, and Newcastle. It is the continuation of a seagull-savoured trend: across the last 30 seasons the teams have met 12 times, with Brighton winning six, losing just twice (both in their promotion year) and drawing the rest. Last October Brighton won 1-0 at St James’ Park, pushing Newcastle to the bottom of the table in the process, and the home side may consider revenge overdue. “We need to be really pushing to get the three points,” says Jamaal Lascelles. “These games are six-pointers. At home to Brighton, we’ve definitely got to fancy ourselves. Anyone who is going to be in and around us, we’ve got to be taking points off them.” SB"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b97b8cf0a8bd1a0ff2a819eb024c7f669937136/335_0_1378_827/master/1378.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19f8c2a3b2345952dafe84c2c7cfadf9","title":"american airlines aairpass golden ticket","story":"My dad was one of the only people with a good-for-life, go-anywhere American Airlines pass. This is the true story of having – and losing – a superpowerby Caroline Rothstein with illustrations by Hokyoung Kim for NarrativelyOn 10 March 2009, a case was filed in the US circuit court for the northern district of Illinois, where I grew up. Rothstein v American Airlines, Inc starred my father, Plaintiff Steven Rothstein, and the defendant, then the world’s third-largest airline. With $23bn in annual revenue, American Airlines had nothing to lose. For my father, it was a last-ditch effort to save his life.Here’s how it all took off. In the early 1980s, American rolled out AAirpass, a prepaid membership program that let very frequent flyers purchase discounted tickets by locking in a certain number of annual miles they presumed they might fly in advance. My 30-something-year-old father, having been a frequent flyer for his entire life, purchased one. Then, a few years later, American introduced something straight out of an avid traveler’s fantasy: an unlimited ticket.In 1987, amid a lucrative year as a Bear Stearns stockbroker, my father became one of only a few dozen people on earth to purchase an unlimited, lifetime AAirpass. A quarter of a million dollars gave him access to fly first class anywhere in the world on American for the rest of his life. He flew so much it paid for itself. Often he’d leave in the morning for a business trip, fly back, and I hadn’t even known he’d left. Other times, I remember calling his office to find out what country he was in. He (and our whole family) was featured on NBC’s Today Show in 2003, and then on MSNBC in 2006. For 20 years, he was one of American’s top fliers, accumulating more than 30 million miles, which he acquired every time he flew, even with the AAirpass.Then, on 13 December 2008, American took the AAirpass away.For several years, the revenues department at American had been monitoring my father and other AAirpass holders to see how much their golden tickets were costing the airline in lost revenue. After 20 years, it seems, they’d decided the pass wasn’t such a good idea. My father was one of several lifetime, unlimited AAirpass holders American claimed had breached their contracts.A few months later, my father sued American for breaking their deal, and more importantly, taking away something integral to who he was. The legal fight went on for years without going to trial. The story became front-page news. The Los Angeles Times. The New York Post. Fox News. A slew of online outlets. It’s even a perennially popular conversation topic on Reddit.The obvious story is that my father was a decadent jet-setter who either screwed or got screwed by American depends on your take. The coverage is always sensational. And I think – as does my whole family, including my dad – that at the very least, it doesn’t quite land.Legend goes, upon bringing me to O’Hare Airport as a baby, my father said, “This is daddy’s playground.”Dad has loved to travel for his entire life. His father, Josh, was a navigator in the army air corps during the second world war and ran a company that manufactured paper and artificial flowers, traveling worldwide and telling stories about the places he went.“When I was nine,” Dad tells me, “we went to Denver. When he left in the morning to go on his business appointments, he said to me: stay at the pool, charge your lunch to the room, and I’ll see you at dinnertime. Make sure you have your tie on.”When he was 16, Dad’s parents took him on a three-and-a-half-week trip: New York–San Francisco–Honolulu–Kamuela–Tokyo–Nagoya–Osaka–Okinawa–Taipei–Hong Kong–Calcutta–Karachi–Tehran–Rome–Florence–Nice–London–New York.“I began to taste, directly, the fervor of foreign travel,” he tells me. “I felt as at home in Copenhagen or Paris as I did in New York … I was a child of the world.”He wrote his college application on a typewriter at a hotel beach in Hawaii and mailed it from a post office in Osaka. In college he worked for a travel agency helping students book standby flights at low fares, which he utilized himself. “I was on my own and could go anywhere at a moment’s notice,” he reminisces. He flew to Europe several times a year and went to live there after graduating in 1972.That December, he joined the wallet business – a company my grandfather had purchased – doing sales. He had an apartment in Manhattan on East 89th Street, but mostly, he was at the wallet factory in Oklahoma, or traveling, both for work and play. On the weekends, he’d rush to Houston, Dallas, Wichita Falls, Mexico City or Acapulco, then back to work on Monday.“Steven got on a plane like most people get on a bus,” says my mom, Nancy Rothstein, who was married to my father for 36 years.Transitioning to finance, Dad moved to Chicago in 1976 for a stint at Smith Barney and, according to him, became the second-highest-grossing stockbroker at Bear Stearns in 1979, where he worked for a decade. Later, he focused on investment banking, and also became the largest shareholder of the financial corporation Olympic Cascade, the holding company of a brokerage firm, National Securities. Through it all, he continued flying. Everywhere. Airports and airplanes – they were who Dad was.When American started the AAdvantage program, Dad and Uncle Shelly (Mom’s uncle and one of Dad’s best friends and business associates) began flying even more than they already did. Then, after a good year at Bear, the investment in an unlimited pass made sense.In September 1987, five months after my brother, Josh, was born, and three months after we moved from downtown Chicago into the north suburbs, Dad bought his unlimited lifetime AAirpass. The cost was $250,000, which the agreement stated was based on his age. My father was 37 years and four days old when he dated the check.Two years later, which was one year before my younger sister, Natalie, was born, he added a companion feature to his AAirpass, allowing him to bring another person along on any flight. The cost was $150,000, based on his being 39 years old. This changed the game, not only for him, but our entire family.Ernie Thurmond, a former American employee who handled Dad’s AAirpass contracts, helped with adding some special stipulations. My parents decided early on to take separate planes so that in the unlikely event of a crash, at least one of them would be alive for their three children. So the agreement amendment stated: “If spouse is the companion, the spouse will be allowed to travel separately from Holder, provided that the spouse travels on the flight immediately prior to or just after the flight taken by Holder.” My parents wouldn’t fly on the same plane for at least a decade after that.Major US and global hubs became Dad’s office American became his home. He knew every employee on his journey – from the curb, through security, to the gate, and on to the plane.In the early 1990s, Dad found his go-to agent at the American Airlines Platinum desk: Lorraine Cross from Raleigh, North Carolina. None of us has ever met her in person. But Lorraine was family, her southern lilt a speakerphone staple at the dinner table. While my father befriended dozens and dozens of American employees throughout his tenure as one of their top fliers, no one played a role quite like Lorraine.Lorraine and Dad became fast pals. Over the next decade-plus, he’d send Lorraine – and others at Platinum – postcards from Maine when he took us to sleepaway camp, menus from restaurants around the world, and magazines from foreign airport lounges. Lorraine loved receiving these she’s even kept the postcards after all these years.She says they shared inside jokes — a lot. “Every time I talked to your father, as we would close the conversation – I’m southern – I would always say, ‘Bye now.’ … That was my closing. He would say, ‘Pay later.’ Caroline, we used to laugh all the time.”Lorraine and the other Platinum desk employees weren’t his only pals. Recently, Dad described himself as being “like an adopted child”. American – and its employees – were his parents. He knew the skycaps at O’Hare, LaGuardia, JFK, Heathrow, LAX the people at the front desk at the Admirals Club pre-departure lounges flight attendants on hauls he frequently flew the gate attendants and the folks who drove the carts from security to the gate, like Aamil.Aamil – whose name I’ve changed to respect his privacy – was a refugee who fled the Bosnian genocide with his family. Dad met Aamil when he was in high school, driving a cart at O’Hare, and took him under his wing – errands and various paid-for-hire tasks. Ultimately, Aamil started coming over for dinner picked us up at school became Josh’s “big brother” ears for his dating rendezvous as he entered high school and was both an employee and a dear, dear friend.Dad “was gracious and kind in a way you don’t see in a lot of people”, Lorraine says, recollecting the time he helped fly some priests to Italy to see the Vatican, or when Mom called her from the local Gap to use miles to help a sales clerk visit her mother.Dad gifted the miles and upgrades he accumulated throughout his life – both before and during his AAirpass tenure – to dozens and dozens of people. Once he upgraded my cantor and his wife to first class from Amsterdam. He regularly let relatives and people in crisis come along in his extra seat. There was the time he took my brother’s best friend on his first airplane ever to see a football game the American Airlines employee he saw in India, crying because she might lose her job if she didn’t make it to Toronto his brother and sister-in-law for their honeymoon a guy from college and his wife who really wanted to go to Australia a man in the back office at National Securities, who wanted to visit his dying father (he got there just in time). “Your family’s heart is as big as the state of Texas,” Lorraine says. “It’s incredible how many lives they touched and how many lives touched them because they’re very sensitive and attuned to what goes on in the world.”I’m not saying Dad was a saint. Just that his AAirpass was about more than solipsistic travel. It allowed him to build relationships. And it allowed other people to access the world like he did. That’s what Dad’s AAirpass and ultra-elite flying status yielded for him: lifelong bonds.On 13 January 1998, the American Airlines CEO, Robert Crandall, wrote my father a letter after they’d seen each other on the Concorde (a transatlantic supersonic aircraft).At the end, Crandall wrote: I am delighted that you’ve enjoyed your AAirpass investment – you can count on us to keep the Company solid, and to honor the deal, far into the future.My friend Phil likes to say my father ran his life like a corporation and raised me in it. His underwear was pressed. UPS and FedEx came nightly to our driveway to drop things off, pick things up. He had packing down to a science – sets of clothes folded and fitted into plastic cases, cosmetics ready to go. We had a whole suitcase closet in the basement, and at some point, he turned the downstairs guest room into a staging area for packing.“They sort of broke the mold when they made him,” says Mom, who is a sleep consultant.He stored everything he collected while traveling in the basement – hotel soaps, shampoos, conditioners his thickened old passports towels shirts hairdryers and combs from around the world – in what we called his “Secret Room”, the key hidden in his office desk. A fun party trick was bringing people inside – his business associates, my siblings and my friends. Sometimes we used the items ourselves. Often, we gave things away. After Hurricane Katrina, Dad and I flew down to New Orleans with boxes of clothes and toiletries. When he went to India, he brought things along. Like travel, for Dad, the Secret Room was an extension of souvenir collecting as a kid.As a kid myself, I often complained about Dad’s excessive traveling. I used words like “abandonment” and “neglect”. In retrospect, that was wildly dramatic. But it’s how I felt.“No matter where Steven went, there wasn’t a day we didn’t talk,” Mom says. “Some men are home every night at 5.30 from the office, but they’re not really there. Steven Rothstein was there.” She emphasizes there with a deep, grinding grunt. “Whether he was in the house or out of the house, he was very involved. He was very much there. And always in touch. I mean, he used a phone … he was one of the first people with a cellphone.”She’s right. Most of my life, I focused on how Dad was always on a plane. When I think about it now, when he was home, he was there: sitting with me on my bedroom floor, or at the dinner table, or coming in to kiss me goodnight. He has a presence. Not only a loud voice, but also a boom of self. He arrives. He is both taking off and landing at once.“He never missed an opportunity to come home to the family,” Lorraine says. “I don’t care where he was going. I don’t care what he was doing. If there was a chance he could come home and stay with his family overnight, he preferred that to any hotel in the world.“I really valued and appreciated that from him,” she says. “His family meant the most. I would say, ‘That’s a long way to go, are you gonna overnight and come back the next day?’ He’d go, ‘No, I wanna sleep in my own bed. I wanna go home. I wanna be with my family.’”I laugh, tears in my eyes. I didn’t know this.“That was crucial to him, to be with his family,” Lorraine says. “He did some crazy stuff to make that happen over the years.”Dad was an airport celebrity, and when we traveled together, it embarrassed the shit out of me. Like riding a cart from security to the gate (because as a family, we ran late – Dad has a knack for rushed arrivals). I would bow my head so I couldn’t make eye contact with anyone we passed. Or walking into the Admirals Club locations and having the folks at the front desk know us by name.Or when, in second grade, he took me to Japan for the weekend because he wanted me to experience an inaugural flight (San Jose to Tokyo). We were in the bulkhead, the first row of any flight cabin. As we landed, there were reporters flooding the jet bridge to photograph the first person off the flight. Technically, based on his seat, that was Dad. But as he figured out what was happening, he insisted I go first so I could be the star. I stood there with my seven-year-old smile, bright-colored headband, and long V-neck Limited Too sweater hanging down to my thighs.I was mortified. But Dad wanted us to experience absolutely everything there was in life.He wanted to take me to all 50 states by the time I was 11. We put a big US map on the wall behind his home office desk. After each trip, I’d add a pin to the visited state another for the places I wanted to go. When we’d gone to 30-something states, I asked to stop I wanted to be able to have new adventures as an adult.“You grew up with a different lens than most people you knew,” Mom says. “I’m not saying … that other people didn’t travel all over the world. But I sort of doubt, for the most part, they had the kind of wanderlust and open-mindedness and fascination that your father had with the world, and still does, for that matter.“Yes,” I answer.“Not only framed you,” she adds, “but it helped with your, your tapestry. It was woven into your tapestry. Into the fabric of who you are, and how you look at other people and the world.”I understood the weight and privilege as a kid. I understood – we all did – that the AAirpass meant my father could travel and do business in unprecedented ways, and it allowed our entire family to travel in ways few people on earth could. We got the privileges, all of them, all of us.I ask my sister, Natalie, a psychotherapist living in Chicago, her earliest memories of traveling on an airplane: landing in Australia at age three, walking down the aisle as the plane was still moving, and someone grabbing her to keep her safe. “I think I remember that because it was really dramatic,” she says. “I have a lot of vivid memories from that trip, actually.”“Were you aware that we were in first class?” I ask.“I didn’t sit out of first class until I was 12 years old,” she says. “I don’t know if I was aware when I was three years old. But I was aware very early.”Wont to interrogate privilege – race, class and otherwise – I pry. Did she really get that first class was different than the rest of the plane?“For a long time, I really wanted to sit in coach,” she says, “because I felt uncomfortable being a kid in first class when it was clearly where all fancy adults were sitting. It was clear I was surrounded by mostly people who had a lot of money, and I was always one of the only kids in first class, and that felt weird and I always wanted to be with other kids in coach.”That trip to Australia (I was in fifth grade) was our first big international family vacation. The following year, Dad, on a whim, said to Mom: let’s go to Tokyo.“Japan!” she said. “Over Christmas? Are you kidding?”But we went.Mom can still perfectly picture us all at dusk in Tokyo: “Dad has on his camel coat. You and Josh are in all the black-and-white-check stuff. We’re walking through an aisle of stalls … going to yet another monastery or shrine and the flavors that we felt and saw and tasted … it was probably one of the best Christmas vacations we’d ever had because we were the only people in the hotel.” She starts chuckling. “And it was so much fun. It was so unusual to be Americans at Christmas in Tokyo.“It was about seeing the world … We wanted to connect to the people,” she says. As she recounts these stories, her tone is somewhere between euphoric and frenzied. She punctuates each story with an “oh my God” and transitions immediately into the next.“When we were in India … we got so friendly with our cab driver that we brought him for dinner to the hotel … For a while we were in touch … We would send him pictures and things. That was the kind of richness that this AAirpass, this sense of a family traveling anywhere we wanted to go in the world that American could take us – that’s what we did. People enriched us. Hopefully we enriched others.”She starts laughing as she recalls a time we visited the Holy Sepulchre in Israel and Dad got in trouble for lying down with his yoga strap, trying to stretch his back in front of the church. “I mean, there was so much color in what we did and where we went and how we did it. The travel was first class, the hotels were first class, but the experiences were very real and authentic.” And then without skipping a beat, she goes up an octave with: “Oh my God … so Josh was dead when we first went to India, right?”“Josh was dead both times we went to India,” I say.“Yeah,” she says. “But he was very much with us, I’m sure.”On 6 October 2002, Josh – 15 and a half – was hit by a car while walking down the sidewalk. The car had pulled an illegal U-turn. To avoid a collision, another driver accidentally accelerated, swerved up on to the sidewalk and flung Josh into the side of a building. His head hit the building. He was knocked unconscious. My uncle Jeffrey called me from Scarsdale and told me to get on a plane. It was my first month of college I rushed to the Philadelphia airport and bought a ticket home. I landed at O’Hare, descended to baggage claim, into more uncles’ arms. Their faces distraught: It doesn’t look good. It would be at least another 15 years before I could descend the American Airlines baggage claim escalator without going into a trauma shock.Josh died the next morning – our rabbi and the hospital chaplain reciting the end of life Hebrew blessings and prayers Dad, Natalie, our maternal grandmother, and me standing around the bed Mom’s own body draped alongside her dying son Natalie’s hand on his heart for his last beat.Over a thousand people attended his funeral. Lorraine helped get people on flights. I remember a family friend walking through the front door of our home after a flight from Australia, as if she’d taken a bus.To say Josh’s death broke Dad would be an understatement. Ernie from American says it was sad to watch Dad when they occasionally saw each other over the years. “He’s not the same person any more,” Ernie says.Josh was Dad’s little buddy. His only son. He’d already lost his father in 1989, and he would soon lose the companionship of Uncle Shelly, when Shelly had a stroke.“People react to tragedy in different ways,” Lorraine says. “He let Josh’s death take the best of him away … Outwardly, his strength was renowned. But I knew how much it impacted him … I know his children meant more to him than any business deal, than any situation in life that could come up.”Right after Josh died, Dad leaned on people like Lorraine, and other agents and employees, which I hadn’t known until writing this piece. I had asked Dad what the media tends to overlook when they cover this story.“When everyone was asleep in the house,” he tells me, “and I had nobody to talk to, and I was lonely about Josh’s death, I would telephone American Airlines reservations and speak to the agents about who knows what for an hour and then at the end, they’d ask me, oh, what reservation was I calling about to make, and I would say, ‘Oh yeah, I need to go to San Francisco next week.’ I really didn’t need to go to San Francisco. I was just very confused and very lonely and I was calling American Airlines because they were logical people for me to speak to. They knew me. I knew them. I knew their names. I knew their lives.”I tell Dad this makes sense, to lean on the community you know in a time of need.“I traveled all over the world,” he says. “Going from the front of American Airlines to the gate, I might see a dozen people, each of whom would say hello to me, and I would say hello to all of them.” Dad says that about 10 American Airlines employees came to Josh’s funeral. “That’s an extremely unusual relationship for a passenger to have with the airlines.”I talk to Natalie, who was still at home with a front row seat to his grief while I was away at college. She tells me about the shame Dad felt when people in our community often pitied him after Josh died – and still do – as if he were a broken man. But the airport and American were where he was still treated like a full, whole man.“His community at American treated him like a normal human, and walking through the airport, they didn’t treat him like he was broken, the way a lot of his other worlds did,” she says. “It was the only sense of normalcy that he still had.”Six years and two months later, Dad arrived at O’Hare with Aamil, who needed to go to Sarajevo but didn’t have the cash, so Dad offered to fly him to London on his AAirpass and then pay for his London hotel and airfare from there to Sarajevo.“ I went into the ticket counter. I checked in my luggage for London. I walked to the gate … and just as I was walking on the plane, they handed me a letter terminating the AAirpass,” Dad recounts. “Why did they let me go to the gate? Why didn’t they tell me up front, which would have been the nice thing to do?”Turns out a letter had been drafted to notify Dad that they were concerned with his behavior and use of the pass. But they decided not to send it. They didn’t want the bad press – what it might mean to terminate a lifetime AAirpass from a frequent flyer. So they terminated it without warning, at the airport – a punch right into Dad’s proverbial heart.Even Lorraine hadn’t been notified. “I walked in one day from work,” she said in a deposition, “and received notification that the AAirpass had been terminated. I was probably more shocked than anyone else.” No warning. No input sought, even though she had been regularly managing his and other top fliers’ bookings.Dad’s luggage went to London. They wouldn’t help him get it back. Aamil never made it to Sarajevo. In fact, that was one of the last times they ever spoke. Ultimately, Aamil disappeared from our lives.Dad doesn’t think Aamil understood the “shock and horror” of what had happened. Dad went home. Told Mom. Got in bed. And slept for the rest of the weekend, and arguably – at least figuratively – for a really long time after that. “I was in disbelief,” he recalls. “I was in shock. And I had no idea how I was going to live my life the way I lived it.”The AAirpass was Dad’s lifeline. His blood. Mom described his relationship with it as “sacrosanct”. There was a contract. Rules. It was his superpower. He didn’t ever want to do anything wrong.But American claimed he did.Dad was one of a few lifetime, unlimited AAirpass holders that American had been monitoring and claimed had breached their contracts. They claimed Dad made “speculative bookings” and a host of other things that they interpreted as objectionable based on a clause in the contract about “fraudulent usage”.“When I bought the AAirpass, in no uncertain terms, they told me that there was only one rule: I couldn’t give anybody the AAirpass,” Dad says. “And those were the days before they took identification from passengers.” A former colleague had once offered him five grand a week to use the AAirpass. Dad told the guy he was “crazy”.But now, after years of secret investigation, apparently Dad and others were costing American too much money. Though Dad had dealt with the reservations agents on an almost daily basis, it was the revenues department that got involved, interjected, and launched an investigation that brought the whole house down.On 10 March 2009, Dad sued American for breaking their deal, claiming $7m in damages. The dollar amount was based on the value of the lifetime unlimited AAirpass the last time it was sold for public consumption – though American had stopped selling them in 1994, a 2004 Neiman Marcus catalogue offered them for 3 million bucks. So it was the Neiman’s figure plus estimated costs for first-class travel for the rest of his life.A primary issue in the case was whether American properly terminated his AAirpass Agreement based on Section 12, which read:12. FRAUDULENT USAGE. If American determines that an AAirpass has been fraudulently used, American reserves the right to revoke the AAirpass and all privileges associated with it. Holder will thereupon forfeit all rights to the AAirpass, without refund, and will return the AAirpass card and this Agreement shall terminate.They claimed that his “fraudulent usage” included booking empty seats for his companion feature under “Bag Rothstein” or “Steven Rothstein Jr” (which they had for years condoned, and Mom says was not Dad’s idea), as well as “booking speculative reservations” – ie, flight reservations he was allegedly never planning to actually take.Dad believes there was someone at American who decided, “Oh, if these guys didn’t have these goddamn AAirpasses, it would be great.”According to Lorraine and the legal documents, a longtime American employee launched the investigation, looking into several other AAirpass holders, including Dad and Jacques Vroom, another lifetime unlimited customer, whose AAirpass termination also resulted in a lawsuit.(I reached out to American Airlines for comment on this article. Their media relations representative said: “We are pleased to continue to provide AirPass benefits to eligible cardholders when enjoyed in conjunction with the appropriate program conditions.” They said they did not have anything to add beyond what’s already in the court documents.)Truth is, AAirpass was – even in its earliest, earliest days – a failed program. It didn’t yield the revenue they’d hoped. In 2017, one writer listed the lifetime unlimited AAirpass as number one on the “7 Worst Marketing Disasters in human history”. In fact, when AAirpass started, according to Ernie, American thought they’d make “hundreds of millions of dollars” selling them, but they did not. “It became painful,” Ernie says. He says he tried several times to get them to shut it down they didn’t want to admit defeat.As for the case, American anticipated a resolution without a trial Dad anticipated a trial by jury. Instead, everything happened in legal offices, calls, motions and documents, judges’ chambers and depositions. They spent the summer of 2009 debating – back and forth – over the fraud clause, and whether it was ambiguous or clear.Then, American counterclaimed, saying Dad broke the contract by improperly using the companion feature. In early 2010, they claimed, “Rothstein had a history of making speculative, fictitious, impossible andor illogical reservations on behalf of companions.” They claimed these “companions” were people with whom he “had no intention of traveling”.The senior analyst who launched the investigation reviewed and analyzed Dad’s flight records, and claimed “that between December 2003 and April 2004, Steven Rothstein made companion reservations using ‘Steven Rothstein, Jr.’ using for his AAirpass companion feature for at least 41 flight segments”. But again, they had condoned his booking companion seats under fictitious names for years. In April 2004, an American employee had approached Dad and asked him to stop, as security measures around flying had clearly started to shift after September 11. So he stopped.But they continued investigating him, looking for a way to push him out.Another document shows that American contends that 14 incidents from August 2006 to November 2008 were considered “fraudulent” under their alleged terms – but Dad was never notified that they were considered fraudulent at the time they were made.In her deposition, Lorraine said she hadn’t received any written directions from American Airlines regarding what was and was not “acceptable practice for making reservations for the Executive Platinum customers”.Lorraine said, both in her deposition and our interview, that she didn’t suspect misuse of his AAirpass they were the ones handling all of his bookings. Yet, they – Lorraine, and anyone else in reservations – weren’t contacted at all once revenues began the investigations.Mom chuckles when she recalls sitting in the federal judge’s chambers with the attorneys in 2010 as American noted his making “fraudulent reservations”.“Steven never made a single reservation on his own on a computer,” she says. “Every single reservation he ever made was made with an American Airlines paid employee.” Dad didn’t use a computer. He was the first person I knew to have a cellphone, and then the first person I knew to get a BlackBerry (and remains one of the last to have one). To write letters, he’d use an electric typewriter or audio-record memos on his Dictaphone and mail mini cassette tapes to his secretary to type and then fax or mail accordingly. But a computer – never. Still doesn’t.Ernie says Dad found creative ways to use his AAirpass, even though Ernie knows of other cardholders who absolutely violated the terms of use – letting others use it, getting paid. “He would be at the airport waiting to board an airplane by himself,” Ernie says, “and he would meet somebody at, like, the Admirals Club and get into a conversation with them and they’re on the same flight he is and he said, ‘Well, why don’t we continue this conversation on the airplane? Let me go check and see if they’ve got any open seats in first class,’ and he would invite that person to join him.“It was not prohibited by the language of the contract,” Ernie says. “But it was not intended to be used like that … I don’t think Steve did anything that was directly or intentionally trying to do something that was … against the rules. Certainly it took some interpretation on American’s part to go after him.”Seven third-party witnesses connected to Dad – family members, friends and business associates – were interviewed during discovery. They were questioned by American around the “speculative bookings” that were deemed retroactively fraudulent.Sometimes Dad would spontaneously book a flight for him and a companion – say, taking my aunt to visit my cousin in Denver – planning to twist his loved one’s arm to travel at the drop of a hat. But that’s the challenge. Rarely could anyone else do that, even if they gave their word. Only Dad knew how to drop everything and fly. That was his superpower. He had wings. The family member, or colleague, or friend he hoped to take along couldn’t always go.Dad’s lawyer asked one of my uncles: “Do you have any reason to believe that Steven Rothstein made reservations in your name without actually intending to bring you along as his companion?”“Never,” he said.Maybe it seems normal to me because that’s how I was socialized, in the vortex realm of a father who treated an airplane like a bus. As a journalist, now, I can read the court documents and understand where – from American’s standpoint – this behavior was kind of absurd. Yet American Airlines agents condoned it for decades. And understanding that the legal terms of the contract and agreement stipulated that fraud meant giving someone else your pass to use, Dad’s quirky and hectic and allegedly “speculative” behavior seems reasonable within how he worked.There was discovery and depositions throughout 2010 there were seemingly endless motions and American kept extending discovery then a summary judgment in American’s favor on 30 June 2011. They had won.American dismissed “with prejudice” their remaining counterclaims then the case went into a holding pattern after American’s parent company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy that fall a joint stipulation of dismissal was filed on 21 September 2012, the day before Dad turned 62.But that wasn’t the end end. As mentioned, the judge issued a summary judgment. Then, the court of appeals affirmed. Dad had lost. The appeal stayed until American exited bankruptcy in December 2013. And the final chunks of paperwork were filed in 2014. But it never really quieted.I didn’t know the full details of the trial until I wrote this piece. That my mother, two uncles and an aunt all went in for depositions, or that hundreds of legal hours and thousands of dollars and documents unfolded. I didn’t quite get the magnitude until taking off my daughter hat and trading it in for my journalistic reporter lens.This spring, after gaining access to the court documents, and reading over 80 documents in full, I call Dad as I leave my writing space at 11.30pm and walk to the subway station at Union Square in Manhattan. I say this is clear: what American did to interpret fraud was out of line. But I say: “Dad, some of the bookings they cited for what they called speculative as evidence in the case were … well … shady.”I tell him I need to maintain my journalistic balance and integrity. I ask him point blank: “What’s the deal?”He goes on: “After they told me not to buy an empty seat they knew that I was in a huge depression in the actual MEDICAL SENSE. IT WAS A SERIOUS DEPRESSION. I was incoherent, crying several times daily, drinking liquor which I never did before and if I got in a seat I didn’t want to explain why I was crying to anyone.” So he wanted it empty. He wanted to be alone, just as had always been his booking practice on many airlines, even well before the AAirpass days. He liked his space. He liked access to bringing extra carry-on bags. He liked some privacy. The airplane was his home. It’s where he lived. It’s where he got to do work, or catch up on sleep, or regenerate. Then, once Josh died, it’s where he grieved. He was at home.People buy extra and empty seats all the time. Technically, that’s what he’d done with the companion feature. A permanent extra seat for life – whether another human was in it or not.In one sense, I understand how these could be interpreted as “speculative bookings”. Dad does admit he booked seats he wasn’t sure that he, or his companions, would ultimately use. But that’s not an uncommon practice, and he never understood it to be against the rules. His understanding was that fraudulent behavior was limited to giving the AAirpass to someone else – which he never did.“I never booked my own reservation on a computer,” he reminds me. “I never knew how to do this. So every single one of the reservations they didn’t like was booked andor changed by an American employee. Again. I didn’t know how to use a computer. I still have never ever ever booked any reservation online. I always use the phone. So their own agents never stopped me from anything. And I didn’t understand what American was asking me to do or not to do because my mind was torn apart from depression. Real depression.”The 7 April 2018, article in the Hustle by Zachary Crockett quoted my father saying: “I wish I’d never bought the thing.”Earlier this year, I speak to Dad, in India, where he’s traveling for work. He FaceTimes me from his hotel room (from an iPad, still no computer). He sits on a couch, a desk and bright lights trailing in the background.I ask if he’s accepted the loss – the AAirpass.“Probably, yeah,” he says. “Enough’s enough. I can’t worry about it all day long.”Twenty-six minutes and thirty seconds later, after he’s relived 13 December 2008, so I could recount it above, something shifts.“Why did they have to be mean?” he says. And later, he interrupts himself mid-story: “What American did was nasty.”It’s like there isn’t space for anything else in his mouth or head.“It took away my mobility. It took away my hobby. I thought that I could go to Sweden for the weekend in July and pick up flowers when I was 70.”“And now?” I ask.“I can’t do that, can I?”“But how do you feel about it all now?”“I’m angry,” he says. “Still. I’m less angry. But I’m still angry.“They stole my personality,” he continues. “They stole my love. They stole the very thing that caused me to give them a half a million dollars in the first place. And a half a million dollars is probably like 5 million dollars today. And they did it maliciously. If there had been a problem, the proper thing to do would have been to telephone me and tell me they’d like me to change the way I used the AAirpass.”I remind him that when we started talking, now 59 minutes ago, he said he had accepted it all.“I guess as I think about,” he says, “I’m angry. So maybe someplace in between. Or maybe my mind goes back and forth.”Grief and death don’t discriminate. Loss – human life, financial wealth, material goods – doesn’t discriminate either. It’s gut-wrenching no matter what. Of course, racial and class privilege, body ability, access to healthcare and support, and other privileges obviously play a massive role. But the inside spectacle of pain is traumatic across the board.“Your dad was so depressed as it was,” Mom says. “He was totally unglued after Josh died, and then he loses the one thing that gives him some freedom to run away from his grief.”The AAirpass “also wasn’t just a loss for him”, I say to Mom. “It was a loss for our family because it gave us access to experiences that were part of who we had become as a unit, and we’d already lost Josh, and so to have lost the AAirpass meant we could no longer travel.”“… Like we did,” she adds. “Because economically after Josh died, it was also a problem. Dad wasn’t able to work at the same pace, speed and everything else that he had. So it was a huge loss, and it was shitty timing because it gave our family an opportunity to still travel, to find the joy in travel. … It took away a big part of our lives, and we already had a big part of our lives taken away. … So, it was a family trauma.”We’ve done a remarkable job – at least in my opinion – of finding some way back to being a family unit after Josh died and my parents got orced (which, having separated in the years after Josh died, was formalized in 2014), and Natalie and I have built an unbreakable bond to manage the vacancy lingering between our age gap.I ask Natalie if she has any resentment or anger about the AAirpass.Dad still hasn’t gotten used to it. The AAirpass was “his pass to freedom”, Mom says. “The trauma of taking that away, it grounded him, literally.”“He seems to be, I don’t know, is he running from things?” Ernie adds. “I didn’t think of him as a settled person.” Ernie notes the places my dad has lived – or tried to live – since my parents sold the house and got orced. Berlin. Hong Kong. India. New York. Chicago. Australia. France.“It’s like if he stops moving,” Ernie says, “then he’s not him any more.”We inherit things from our kin. As much as I salivate over locking myself in a silent cave to write, I feel a wildly profound sense of purpose when I’m traveling. As an internationally touring poet, performer and educator, when I am on tour, I am alive. I know how to operate an airport or bus terminal or Amtrak station or rental car. Natalie does too. People have come to me about their hatred or fear of flying. It’s like a spa, I tell them. A certain amount of time in the sky that belongs only to you. Regardless of your seat.Of course, I recognize that because I was socialized to fly in first class, my feelings about travel are biased. Even though I fly economy now, even though my eyes can tell the difference, somehow my body does not. I am in the air. I am free above the world. I don’t need fancy seats or legroom. I’m just grateful to get a break from Earth.My best friend, Chloe, recently asked me what my favorite airline is, given all the travel I do. I said, even though they so deeply impacted my family’s life: American. I feel nostalgia. Loyalty. It’s like having a crush on that kid who chases you around the playground, or never letting go of your first true love.Mom still has skycaps’ numbers in her phone. She, Natalie and I all still fly American, even though it hurts (and I have exactly 384,475 American miles at the time of publishing this piece, so if that dwindles unexpectedly, we’ll all know why).When I talked to Lorraine, she told me she wanted to go to Fargo, North Dakota.I scream: “Lorraine! I’ve never been to North Dakota! Fargo is on my bucket list!” I’ve made it to 47 states by now Oregon and Alaska are still on the list, as well.“Oh my God, Caroline, I’ve got a feeling we may end up going to Fargo, North Dakota,” she says, “laughing our butts off and having a ball.”I am yelping at this point. Literally hitting my leg and chair audibly. Suddenly, I feel like Dad must have felt talking to her – laughing, joking, dreaming up trips. Some people inherit money. Or trauma. A host of other things. I’ve inherited plenty, but perhaps – more than anything – it’s the wanderlust and desire to meet people and go places around the world.After we scheme about Fargo, she sends her love to my mother and sister, and says she’d love Dad’s number she’d love to catch up. I thank her and wish her a beautiful day.“You as well, Caroline,” she says. “I still love ya, so you take care, sweetheart.”“Love you as well,” I say. “And what was it that you would say to my dad?”“And then ‘pay back’?”“He would say, ‘Pay later.’”I ask if we can try again.This story originally appeared on the digital storytelling platform Narratively.

Of course I would be able to help her with her shopping! Let’s get this shopping-helping show on the road, I wanted to shout. For I am an excellent person and enthusiastic assistant to those in need. Unfortunately, it turned out she didn’t mean shopping as a metonym for shopping bags, but shopping as in the verb. She had not yet been to the shop. This was not me lifting two Lidl bags and carrying them to the bus stop, as I had envisioned this was me going to Lidl.Forty-five minutes later, this wily elder of mine – who had also swindled me out of £3 by this point and made a fair few comments I would describe as racist –let me know that she lived on the top floor of a block of flats but, not to worry, because the block was only a mile or so away. Despite all this – “this” being the entire afternoon – I still feel contented that I helped this lady out, even if I have avoided her since.Good deeds are considered selfless, but they are often not. This is because a fair number of good deeds take minimal effort the effort is outweighed by the feeling of self-satisfaction. If anything, it is pure human profit, and as such perhaps not altruistic at all. (There are, of course, the times when we go above and beyond, when we inconvenience ourselves for others. I can summon up many occasions when friends, all over the world and in all seasons, have gone above and beyond for me.)But mostly it’s something that, for you, takes very little, but can make all the difference to another. The teenage girl frantic in a strange city who asks for directions, or to borrow your phone. Lifting someone’s suitcases down station stairs or grabbing one end of a frazzled mother’s pram, its inhabitant blotchy-faced and screaming. Tapping a rushed businessman on the shoulder to return his wallet. I truly believe the whole world would collapse without these interactions, or to use the American argot: the act of paying it forward. In fact, one doesn’t need to be the do-gooder or the recipient to be warmed by an act of kindness. Even reading about them can be a joy. Do a good deed today, then – even if it’s just holding a door open. And I will do one for someone in turn. As long as it’s not their entire weekly shop.

Technology encourages us to believe we can all have first-hand access to the ‘real’ facts – and now we can’t stop fighting about it. By  William DaviesWe live in a time of political fury and hardening cultural ides. But if there is one thing on which virtually everyone is agreed, it is that the news and information we receive is biased. Every second of every day, someone is complaining about bias, in everything from the latest movie reviews to sports commentary to the BBC’s coverage of Brexit. These complaints and controversies take up a growing share of public discussion.Much of the outrage that floods social media, occasionally leaking into opinion columns and broadcast interviews, is not simply a reaction to events themselves, but to the way in which they are reported and framed. The “mainstream media” is the principal focal point for this anger. Journalists and broadcasters who purport to be neutral are a constant object of scrutiny and derision, whenever they appear to let their personal views slip. The work of journalists involves an increasing amount of unscripted, real-time discussion, which provides an occasionally troubling window into their thinking.But this is not simply an anti-journalist sentiment. A similar fury can just as easily descend on a civil servant or independent expert whenever their veneer of neutrality seems to crack, apparently revealing prejudices underneath. Sometimes a report or claim is dismissed as biased or inaccurate for the simple reason that it is unwelcome: to a Brexiter, every bad economic forecast is just another case of the so-called project fear. A sense that the game is rigged now fuels public debate.This mentality now s the entire political spectrum and pervades societies around the world. A recent survey found that the majority of people globally believe their society is broken and their economy is rigged. Both the left and the right feel misrepresented and misunderstood by political institutions and the media, but the anger is shared by many in the liberal centre, who believe that populists have gamed the system to harvest more attention than they deserve. Outrage with “mainstream” institutions has become a mass sentiment.This spirit of indignation was once the natural property of the left, which has long resented the establishment bias of the press. But in the present culture war, the right points to universities, the BBC and civil service as institutions that twist our basic understanding of reality to their own ends. Everyone can point to evidence that justifies their outrage. This arms race in cultural analysis is unwinnable.This is not as simple as distrust. The appearance of digital platforms, smartphones and the ubiquitous surveillance they enable has ushered in a new public mood that is instinctively suspicious of anyone claiming to describe reality in a fair and objective fashion. It is a mindset that begins with legitimate curiosity about what motivates a given media story, but which ends in a Trumpian refusal to accept any mainstream or official account of the world. We can all probably locate ourselves somewhere on this spectrum, between the curiosity of the engaged citizen and the corrosive cynicism of the climate denier. The question is whether this mentality is doing us any good, either inidually or collectively.Public life has become like a play whose audience is unwilling to suspend disbelief. Any utterance by a public figure can be unpicked in search of its ulterior motive. As cynicism grows, even judges, the supposedly neutral upholders of the law, are publicly accused of personal bias. Once doubt descends on public life, people become increasingly dependent on their own experiences and their own beliefs about how the world really works. One effect of this is that facts no longer seem to matter (the phenomenon misleadingly dubbed “post-truth”). But the crisis of democracy and of truth are one and the same: iniduals are increasingly suspicious of the “official” stories they are being told, and expect to witness things for themselves.On one level, heightened scepticism towards the establishment is a welcome development. A more media-literate and critical citizenry ought to be less easy for the powerful to manipulate. It may even represent a victory for the type of cultural critique pioneered by intellectuals such as Pierre Bourdieu and Stuart Hall in the 1970s and 80s, revealing the injustices embedded in everyday cultural expressions and interactions.But it is possible to have too much scepticism. How exactly do we distinguish this critical mentality from that of the conspiracy theorist, who is convinced that they alone have seen through the official version of events? Or to turn the question around, how might it be possible to recognise the most flagrant cases of bias in the behaviour of reporters and experts, but nevertheless to accept that what they say is often a reasonable depiction of the world?It is tempting to blame the internet, populists or foreign trolls for flooding our otherwise rational society with lies. But this underestimates the scale of the technological and philosophical transformations that are under way. The single biggest change in our public sphere is that we now have an unimaginable excess of news and content, where once we had scarcity. Suddenly, the analogue channels and professions we depended on for our knowledge of the world have come to seem partial, slow and dispensable.And yet, contrary to initial hype surrounding big data, the explosion of information available to us is making it harder, not easier, to achieve consensus on truth. As the quantity of information increases, the need to pick out bite-size pieces of content rises accordingly. In this radically sceptical age, questions of where to look, what to focus on and who to trust are ones that we increasingly seek to answer for ourselves, without the help of intermediaries. This is a liberation of sorts, but it is also at the heart of our deteriorating confidence in public institutions.The current threat to democracy is often seen to emanate from new forms of propaganda, with the implication that lies are being deliberately fed to a naive and over-emotional public. The simultaneous rise of populist parties and digital platforms has triggered well-known anxieties regarding the fate of truth in democratic societies. Fake news and internet echo chambers are believed to manipulate and ghettoise certain communities, for shadowy ends. Key groups – millennials or the white working-class, say – are accused of being easily persuadable, thanks to their excessive sentimentality.This diagnosis exaggerates old-fashioned threats while overlooking new phenomena. Over-reliant on analogies to 20th century totalitarianism, it paints the present moment as a moral conflict between truth and lies, with an unthinking public passively consuming the results. But our relationship to information and news is now entirely different: it has become an active and critical one, that is deeply suspicious of the official line. Nowadays, everyone is engaged in spotting and rebutting propaganda of one kind or another, curating our news feeds, attacking the framing of the other side and consciously resisting manipulation. In some ways, we have become too concerned with truth, to the point where we can no longer agree on it. The very institutions that might once have brought controversies to an end are under constant fire for their compromises and biases.The threat of misinformation and propaganda should not be denied. As the scholars Yochai Benkler, Robert Faris and Hal Roberts have shown in their book Network Propaganda, there is now a self-sustaining information ecosystem on the American right through which conspiracy theories and untruths get recycled, between Breitbart, Fox News, talk radio and social media. Meanwhile, the anti-vaxx movement is becoming a serious public health problem across the world, aided by the online circulation of conspiracy theories and pseudo-science. This is a situation where simple misinformation poses a serious threat to society.Trust in the media is low, but this entrenched scepticism long predates the internet or contemporary populism. From the Sun’s lies about Hillsborough to the BBC’s failure to expose Jimmy Savile as early as they might, to the fevered enthusiasm for the Iraq war that gripped much of Fleet Street, the British public has had plenty of good reasons to distrust journalists. Even so, the number of people in the UK who trust journalists to tell the truth has actually risen slightly since the 1980s.What, then, has changed? The key thing is that the elites of government and the media have lost their monopoly over the provision of information, but retain their prominence in the public eye. They have become more like celebrities, anti-heroes or figures in a reality TV show. And digital platforms now provide a public space to identify and rake over the flaws, biases and falsehoods of mainstream institutions. The result is an increasingly sceptical citizenry, each seeking to manage their media diet, checking up on inidual journalists in order to resist the pernicious influence of the establishment.There are clear and obvious benefits to this, where it allows hateful and manipulative journalism to be called out. It is reassuring to discover the large swell of public sympathy for the likes of Ben Stokes and Gareth Thomas, and their families, who have been harassed by the tabloids in recent days. But this also generates a mood of outrage, which is far more focused on denouncing bad and biased reporting than with defending the alternative. Across the political spectrum, we are increasingly distracted and enraged by what our adversaries deem important and how they frame it. It is not typically the media’s lies that provoke the greatest fury online, but the discovery that an important event has been ignored or downplayed. While it is true that arguments rage over dodgy facts and figures (concerning climate change or the details of Britain’s trading relations), many of the most bitter controversies of our news cycle concern the framing and weighting of different issues and how they are reported, rather than the facts of what actually happened.The problem we face is not, then, that certain people are oblivious to the “mainstream media”, or are victims of fake news, but that we are all seeking to see through the veneer of facts and information provided to us by public institutions. Facts and official reports are no longer the end of the story. Such scepticism is healthy and, in many ways, the just deserts of an establishment that has been caught twisting the truth too many times. But political problems arise once we turn against all representations and framings of reality, on the basis that these are compromised and biased – as if some purer, unmediated access to the truth might be possible instead. This is a seductive, but misleading ideal.Every human culture throughout history has developed ways to record experiences and events, allowing them to endure. From early modern times, liberal societies have developed a wide range of institutions and professions whose work ensures that events do not simply pass without trace or public awareness. Newspapers and broadcasters share reports, photographs and footage of things that have happened in politics, business, society and culture. Court documents and the Hansard parliamentary reports provide records of what has been said in court and in parliament. Systems of accounting, audit and economics help to establish basic facts of what takes place in businesses and markets.Traditionally, it is through these systems, which are grounded in written testimonies and public statements, that we have learned what is going on in the world. But in the past 20 years, this patchwork of record-keeping has been supplemented and threatened by a radically different system, which is transforming the nature of empirical evidence and memory. One term for this is “big data”, which highlights the exponential growth in the quantity of data that societies create, thanks to digital technologies.The reason there is so much data today is that more and more of our social lives are mediated digitally. Internet browsers, smartphones, social media platforms, smart cards and every other smart interface record every move we make. Whether or not we are conscious of it, we are constantly leaving traces of our activities, no matter how trivial.But it is not the escalating quantity of data that constitutes the radical change. Something altogether new has occurred that distinguishes today’s society from previous epochs. In the past, recording devices were principally trained upon events that were already acknowledged as important. Journalists did not just report news, but determined what counted as newsworthy. TV crews turned up at events that were deemed of national significance. The rest of us kept our cameras for noteworthy occasions, such as holidays and parties.The ubiquity of digital technology has thrown all of this up in the air. Things no longer need to be judged “important” to be captured. Consciously, we photograph events and record experiences regardless of their importance. Unconsciously, we leave a trace of our behaviour every time we swipe a smart card, address Amazon’s Alexa or touch our phone. For the first time in human history, recording now happens by default, and the question of significance is addressed separately.This shift has prompted an unrealistic set of expectations regarding possibilities for human knowledge. As many of the original evangelists of big data liked to claim, when everything is being recorded, our knowledge of the world no longer needs to be mediated by professionals, experts, institutions and theories. Instead, they argued that the data can simply “speak for itself”. Patterns will emerge, traces will come to light. This holds out the prospect of some purer truth than the one presented to us by professional editors or trained experts. As the Australian surveillance scholar Mark Andrejevic has brilliantly articulated, this is a fantasy of a truth unpolluted by any deliberate human intervention – the ultimate in scientific objectivity.Andrejevic argues that the rise of this fantasy coincides with growing impatience with the efforts of reporters and experts to frame reality in meaningful ways. He writes that “we might describe the contemporary media moment – and its characteristic attitude of sceptical savviness regarding the contrivance of representation – as one that implicitly embraces the ideal of framelessness”. From this perspective, every controversy can in principle be settled thanks to the vast trove of data – CCTV, records of digital activity and so on – now available to us. Reality in its totality is being recorded, and reporters and officials look dismally compromised by comparison.One way in which seemingly frameless media has transformed public life over recent years is in the elevation of photography and video as arbiters of truth, as opposed to written testimony or numbers. “Pics or it didn’t happen” is a jokey barb sometimes thrown at social media users when they share some unlikely experience. It is often a single image that seems to capture the truth of an event, only now there are cameras everywhere. No matter how many times it is disproven, the notion that “the camera doesn’t lie” has a peculiar hold over our imaginations. In a society of blanket CCTV and smartphones, there are more cameras than people, and the torrent of data adds to the sense that the truth is somewhere amid the deluge, ignored by mainstream accounts. The central demand of this newly sceptical public is “so show me”.This transformation in our recording equipment is responsible for much of the outrage directed at those formerly tasked with describing the world. The rise of blanket surveillance technologies has paradoxical effects, raising expectations for objective knowledge to unrealistic levels, and then provoking fury when those in the public eye do not meet them.On the one hand, data science appears to make the question of objective truth easier to settle. Slow and imperfect institutions of social science and journalism can be circumvented, and we can get directly to reality itself, unpolluted by human bias. Surely, in this age of mass data capture, the truth will become undeniable.On the other hand, as the quantity of data becomes overwhelming – greater than human intelligence can comprehend – our ability to agree on the nature of reality seems to be declining. Once everything is, in principle, recordable, disputes heat up regarding what counts as significant in the first place. It turns out that the “frames” that journalists and experts use to reduce and organise information are indispensable to its coherence and meaning.What we are discovering is that, once the limitations on data capture are removed, there are escalating opportunities for conflict over the nature of reality. Every time a mainstream media agency reports the news, they can instantly be met with the retort: but what about this other event, in another time and another place, that you failed to report? What about the bits you left out? What about the other voters in the town you didn’t talk to? When editors judge the relative importance of stories, they now confront a panoply of alternative judgements. Where records are abundant, fights break out over relevance and meaning.Professional editors have always faced the challenge of reducing long interviews to short consumable chunks and discarding the majority of photos or text. Editing is largely a question of what to throw away. This necessitates value judgements, that readers and audiences once had little option but to trust. Now, however, the question of which image or sentence is truly significant opens irresolvable arguments. One person’s offcut is another person’s revealing nugget. Political agendas can be pursued this way, including cynical ones aimed at painting one’s opponents in the worst possible light. An absurd or extreme voice can be represented as typical of a political movement (known as “nutpicking”). Taking quotes out of context is one of the most disruptive of online ploys, which provokes far more fury than simple insults. Rather than deploying lies or “fake news”, it messes with the significance of data, taking the fact that someone did say or write something, but violating their intended meaning. No doubt professional journalists have always descended to such tactics from time to time, but now we are all at it, provoking a vicious circle of misrepresentation.Then consider the status of photography and video. It is not just that photographic evidence can be manipulated to mislead, but that questions will always survive regarding camera angle and context. What happened before or after a camera started rolling? What was outside the shot? These questions provoke suspicion, often with good reason.The most historic example of such a controversy predates digital media. The Zapruder film, which captured the assassination of John F Kennedy, became the most scrutinised piece of footage in history. The film helped spawn countless conspiracy theories, with inidual frames becoming the focus of controversies, with competing theories as to what they reveal. The difficulty of completely squaring any narrative with a photographic image is a philosophical one as much as anything, and the Zapruder film gave a glimpse of the sorts of media disputes that have become endemic now cameras are ubiquitous parts of our social lives and built environments.Today, minor gestures that would usually have passed without comment only a decade ago become pored over in search of their hidden message. What did Emily Maitlis mean when she rolled her eyes at Barry Gardiner on Newsnight? What was Jeremy Corbyn mouthing during Prime Minister’s Questions? Who took the photo of Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds sitting at a garden table in July, and why? This way madness lies.While we are now able to see evidence for ourselves, we all have conflicting ideas of what bit to attend to, and what it means. The camera may not lie, but that is because it does not speak at all. As we become more fixated on some ultimate gold-standard of objective truth, which exceeds the words of mere journalists or experts, so the number of interpretations applied to the evidence multiplies. As our faith in the idea of undeniable proof deepens, so our frustration with competing framings and official accounts rises. All too often, the charge of “bias” means “that’s not my perspective”. Our screen-based interactions with many institutions have become fuelled by anger that our experiences are not being better recognised, along with a new pleasure at being able to complain about it. As the writer and programmer Paul Ford wrote, back in 2011, “the fundamental question of the web” is: “Why wasn’t I consulted?”What we are witnessing is a collision between two conflicting ideals of truth: one that depends on trusted intermediaries (journalists and experts), and another that promises the illusion of direct access to reality itself. This has echoes of the populist challenge to liberal democracy, which pits direct expressions of the popular will against parliaments and judges, undermining the very possibility of compromise. The Brexit crisis exemplifies this as well as anything. Liberals and remainers adhere to the long-standing constitutional convention that the public speaks via the institutions of general elections and parliament. Adamant Brexiters believe that the people spoke for themselves in June 2016, and have been thwarted ever since by MPs and civil servants. It is this latter logic that paints suspending parliament as an act of democracy.This is the tension that many populist leaders exploit. Officials and elected politicians are painted as cynically self-interested, while the “will of the people” is both pure and obvious. Attacks on the mainstream media follow an identical script: the iniduals professionally tasked with informing the public, in this case journalists, are biased and fake. It is widely noted that leaders such as Donald Trump, Jair Bolsonaro and Matteo Salvini are enthusiastic users of Twitter, and Boris Johnson has recently begun to use Facebook Live to speak directly to “the people” from Downing Street. Whether it be parliaments or broadcasters, the analogue intermediaries of the public sphere are discredited and circumvented.What can professional editors and journalists do in response? One response is to shout even louder about their commitment to “truth”, as some American newspapers have profitably done in the face of Trump. But this escalates cultural conflict, and fails to account for how the media and informational landscape has changed in the past 20 years.What if, instead, we accepted the claim that all reports about the world are simply framings of one kind or another, which cannot but involve political and moral ideas about what counts as important? After all, reality becomes incoherent and overwhelming unless it is simplified and narrated in some way or other. And what if we accepted that journalists, editors and public figures will inevitably let cultural and personal biases slip from time to time? A shrug is often the more appropriate response than a howl. If we abandoned the search for some pure and unbiased truth, where might our critical energies be directed instead?If we recognise that reporting and editing is always a political act (at least in the sense that it asserts the importance of one story rather than another), then the key question is not whether it is biased, but whether it is independent of financial or political influence. The problem becomes a quasi-constitutional one, of what processes, networks and money determine how data gets turned into news, and how power gets distributed. On this front, the British media is looking worse and worse, with every year that passes.The relationship between the government and the press has been getting tighter since the 1980s. This is partly thanks to the overweening power of Rupert Murdoch, and the image management that developed in response. Spin doctors such as Alastair Campbell, Andy Coulson, Tom Baldwin, Robbie Gibb and Seumas Milne typically move from the media into party politics, weakening the ision between the two.Then there are those iniduals who shift backwards and forwards between senior political positions and the BBC, such as Gibb, Rona Fairhead and James Purnell. The press has taken a very bad turn over recent years, with ex-Chancellor George Osborne becoming editor of the Evening Standard, then the extraordinary recent behaviour of the Daily , which seeks to present whatever story or gloss is most supportive of their former star columnist in 10 Downing Street, and rubbishes his opponents. (The Opinion page of the  website proudly includes a “Best of Boris” section.)Since the financial crisis of 2008, there have been regular complaints about the revolving door between the financial sector and governmental institutions around the world, most importantly the White House. There has been far less criticism of the similar door that links the media and politics. The exception to this comes from populist leaders, who routinely denounce all “mainstream” democratic and media institutions as a single liberal elite, that acts against the will of the people. One of the reasons they are able to do this is because there is a grain of truth in what they say.The financial obstacles confronting critical, independent, investigative media are significant. If the Johnson administration takes a more sharply populist turn, the political obstacles could increase, too – Channel 4 is frequently held up as an enemy of Brexit, for example. But let us be clear that an independent, professional media is what we need to defend at the present moment, and abandon the misleading and destructive idea that – thanks to a combination of ubiquitous data capture and personal passions – the truth can be grasped directly, without anyone needing to report it.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3485364117929a01dd3d96605b58f93d14438e7/0_344_4785_2871/master/4785.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e32406fabf72cb3eac6e628f5c935bb","title":"homes for sale with blue plaques in pictures","story":"From London to Yorkshire, these historic properties all have illustrious former residents"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac6f60e4dd3694fb89f7a1a878cb278328cc24eb/0_505_2971_1781/master/2971.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23e2a41b999b23a02e4937add9f1430a","title":"dave wins mercury prize 2019 album psychodrama","story":"The south London artist wins the £25,000 prize for an album the  hailed as ‘fearless and incisive’Dave has won the 2019 Hyundai Mercury prize for his debut album, Psychodrama. Announcing the winner, judge Annie Mac said the album “showed remarkable levels of musicianship, true artistry, courage, honesty. And it is simply exceptional.”Dave hugged his mother before walking on stage to collect the award. Wearing a neon tracksuit, he covered his mouth with his hand and looked shocked. He told the room that he was lost for words and invited his mother up to stand next to him. He thanked the “exceptional musicians” who performed alongside him tonight, namechecking fellow nominees Little Simz, Slowthai and Nao.He continued by paying tribute to his brother Christopher, who is serving a life sentence for his involvement in the killing of Sofyen Belamouadden: “This is your story, and even though you can’t be here, I know you’re watching this bro, and I’m so grateful, thank you so much.”Speaking after the ceremony, he added: “This is surreal. It is a massive honour and I am glad that I’ve been able to repay the faith that a lot of people have put in me … I have good days and bad days, but you see the team around me, my friends, my family, they kept me strong through this process.”Dave was presented with the £25,000 prize at the Eventim Apollo in Hammersmith, London. His album Psychodrama is framed as a therapy session, and covers his brother’s incarceration, prison reform and the ersity of the black experience.Slowthai was the bookmakers’ favourite to win the prize, with odds of 94 in the hours leading up to the ceremony. He was followed by Idles and Dave (both at 41).The 28th edition of the award was hailed by critics as its most political in years. “It’s never seemed quite so engaged with and informed by current events,” wrote  music critic Alexis Petridis when the shortlist was announced in July.Slowthai performed wearing a T-shirt that read “Fuck Boris”, spelled out in letters made up of illustrations of the prime minister’s naked body. He repeated the phrase throughout his performance, which ended with him pulling a rubber model of Johnson’s decapitated head out of a rucksack and shouting: “Fuck Boris Johnson, fuck everything, and there’s nothing great about Britain.” By the end of his performance, the T-shirt design was available to buy through his website.Nominee Yannis Philippakis, of Oxford band Foals, told the  on the red carpet: “There’s a genuine thrust of more political music as a response to the current climate, whether it’s to do with British social issues or more of a general feeling that we’re entering into more of a dystopia.”Cassie Kinoshi, of 10-piece jazz group Seed Ensemble, said that she hoped the group’s debut album, Driftglass, highlighted the British political issues that she felt “needs to be continually discussed and highlighted. The track Wake is there to make sure that we continue to keep Grenfell at the forefront of people’s minds. And the first track on there, The Darkies, is about what it means to exist as a black British person in society where you’re treated as an other.”“I think there are lots of different types of politics in the shortlist,” Jeff Smith told the  earlier this week. The head of music for BBC Radio 2 and 6 Music has judged the awards for nine years. “There’s the politics of austerity, climate change, urban decay, the politics of the heart and the mind. It’s interesting to see how they reflect life for modern British people and the conditions they’ve found themselves in over this last year.”The prize is decided on the night by a panel of judges, which this year consisted of musicians Stormzy, Gaz Coombes of Supergrass, Jamie Cullum and Jorja Smith, broadcasters Annie Mac, Clara Amfo and Danielle Perry, radio directors Jeff Smith and Mike Walsh, and journalists Phil Alexander, Tshepo Mokoena and Will Hodgkinson.This year’s full list of nominees was: Anna Calvi (for her album Hunter) Black Midi (Schlagenheim) Cate Le Bon (Reward) Dave (Psychodrama) Foals (Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost Pt1) Fontaines DC (Dogrel) Idles (Joy As an Act of Resistance) Little Simz (Grey Area) Nao (Saturn) SEED Ensemble (Driftglass) Slowthai (Nothing Great About Britain) the 1975 (A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7664bad8621dced5c03af5ace13b19381816797/2_0_6247_3750/master/6247.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0257111508443bc58761adc61462b1f3","title":"pops need for speed you have to drop new stuff constantly","story":"Pop stars are under pressure to produce a continuous stream of new music, with many releasing two albums a year. What’s behind the explosive pace?The music industry in 2019, says Foals frontman Yannis Philippakis, could be compared to a Pez dispenser. He is not talking about big heads – rather, the seemingly endless, instantly gratifying stream of new songs that drop each week, like tiny pieces of Pez candy. “It certainly feels as if there’s more music out there,” he says. “By virtue of that, a record just feels older quicker it doesn’t have its place in the sun for long, because there’s new canopy growth. Everyone’s trying to get a bit of sunshine.”Philippakis is among a growing number of artists responding to this fast-moving dynamic by upping the pace of his releases. Foals will release their second album of 2019, Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost Part II, in October (Part I was released in March, and nominated for this year’s Mercury prize). The New York indie band Big Thief release Two Hands, their second LP of the year, this October. The 1975 are beginning to roll out their 2020 album Notes on a Conditional Form just eight months after releasing A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships.For many artists who release independently, whether they are rappers dropping mixtapes or punks with tape labels, fast-and-furious releases are nothing new. But even major-label pop stars are at it. Ariana Grande released her album Thank U, Next just six months after her previous LP, Sweetener within two months, she had moved on again, releasing the non-album single Monopoly, later followed by Boyfriend, and is now at No 1 with Don’t Call Me Angel, a collaboration with Miley Cyrus and Lana Del Rey. This month, before listeners had barely had a chance to hear all of Del Rey’s new album, Norman Fucking Rockwell!, she announced that her next record, White Hot Forever, will arrive as a surprise release within the next year.But today, the pace has “completely returned to a hit-driven model,” says Jamie Oborne, manager of the 1975 and head of their label, Dirty Hit Records. “We’ve returned to the days of the 50s or 60s, where people are just smashing out singles in the hope that one sticks. There is a lot of output that is just about building consumption.”This creates a different kind of pressure for artists: to produce enough material to get constantly playlisted and talked about, saving yourself from being kicked to the bottom of Spotify’s New Music Friday heap each week. This is especially gruelling for pure pop acts. Think of Charli XCX, who drip-feeds her audience with near-constant mixtapes and loosies, and neo-flamenco singer Rosalía, who has put out a two-song single, a standalone track and two high-profile collaborations since her last album, El Mal Querer, in late 2018.The German pop star Kim Petras is known for her prolificacy, a topic she discusses with plainspoken breeziness: “You just have to constantly drop new stuff.” Petras has independently released two EPs and earlier this year shared an album-length “project” titled Clarity, which she promoted by releasing a song every week for 10 weeks. “As new artists, it’s a really amazing way to gain a fanbase,” she says. “Releasing songs, almost like it’s a TV show, monthly or weekly.” She says this is her way of “staying on top of people’s minds … It’s a great way to make your fans feel really connected to you now that there are thousands of songs coming out every week.”But Oborne says there are more existential reasons behind the 1975’s decision to release two albums in quick succession. He says he and the band’s frontman Matt Healy have the feeling that “we’re kind of running out of time. I would put some of that down to the shape the world is in, how scary it is.” He says meeting and collaborating with the environmental activist Greta Thunberg and her family this year injected the band with a sense of urgency to move as quickly as possible to “use Matthew’s platform in a conscientious way”. If you’re writing about topical issues – Healy’s songs reference the climate crisis, politicians, even viral tweets – the material is best released quickly.Like Grande, 4AD-signed band Big Thief are so prolific that it is a relief for them to share what they have made quickly: they had written the whole of their 2017 album Capacity before they even released 2016’s Masterpiece. “You don’t want fresh stuff to feel like it’s getting stale,” says their drummer James Krivchenia. “By the time you’re recording it, you want to make sure that the thought and the emotion behind the song in the first place still exists in this person saying it, and they haven’t moved on to another phase of life.”The band’s two 2019 albums, UFOF and Two Hands, were created simultaneously, but always intended as separate bodies of work. A double album was out of the question. “A lot of the songs would get lost,” Krivchenia says. The band decided to record the albums in two “distinct, but similar processes”, making UFOF near Seattle, then heading into the desert a few days later for Two Hands, and recording each one on different kinds of tape.Even though they are naturally productive, Krivchenia says the industry has often demanded even more of the band. “We’ve had labels be like: ‘Do you want to put out the demos, or extra songs?’ There is a hunger for extra for the sake of extra – Spotify singles, or bonus tracks.” Where does that pressure come from? “I think it’s people worried that you’re going to be forgotten, that you’re going to get lost in the internet swarm of music after the album comes out. But it seems a bit ass-backwards to be worrying about – if you’re nervous about being forgotten, then I think you should try and make really good music. That’s where our focus is.”Foals’s Philippakis also believes there is a greater demand for artists to create as much as possible to fill streaming services, which is a direct reverse of the situation that Foals were in a decade ago. “There was a period when iTunes was the main gatekeeper,” he remembers, “and they would stop paying after a certain amount of tracks on a record. In general, labels were dissuading artists from making longer albums, because you didn’t get paid for the extra tracks. Streaming has totally dismantled that.” Had Foals ever approached their label with two albums’ worth of material in the past, he imagines, they would have been met with “raised eyebrows: ‘Is this your Use Your Illusion?’ Also: ‘There’s no point doing that, because financially it’s not going to make sense for the label.’”However, that is not why Foals decided to release a two-part album. Albums generally are “afforded oxygen in the world for a shorter space of time,” says Philippakis. “You spend two years making an album, and then you have the initial excitement and release obviously, hardcore fans will stay with it for longer, but in terms of general ability to be part of the cultural thread, I don’t feel that it lasts as long.”Perhaps the traditional album cycle is no longer suited to a world in which creators and consumers want everything to happen much more quickly. Is it any great loss? “We’ve been frustrated with the album cycle for a while,” Philippakis admits. “There’s something that is artistically not honest about putting out expressions of yourself every couple of years, and having all the scrutiny, and that being viewed as your definitive expression.”Ideally, they would move away from the album cycle model altogether. “What we’d like to do would be to go into the studio and record two or three tracks at a time, release them, tour those, then go back into the studio. For the whole process to be more nimble, rather than these huge, quite laborious periods where you tour to quite an extreme extent, and making an album is a two-year commitment where you have to summon all this creative energy in one go.”He compares making an album to writing a novel. “This big kind of pregnancy. There’s a scale to all of it that’s quite demanding. It doesn’t need to necessarily be like that.”Krivchenia also isn’t a fan of the traditional album cycle. “It’s a pretty random benchmark in the first place,” he says. Yet he thinks the format will last a long time. Striving to make something cohesive that’s 30 to 40 minutes long is a “nice, useful constraint”. While Philippakis wants to experiment with a more fluid releasing and touring process, he says Foals will definitely keep making albums. Oborne describes how his 12-year-old daughter, a streaming fanatic, recently got really into an album for the first time thanks to Billie Eilish – proof to him that even in a time of “instant-grat culture”, albums are “always going to be important”.And while Petras hasn’t announced an album yet, she sees it as the goal: “I’m trying to be a touring artist and an album artist, I want my fans to listen to my projects fully, from top to bottom.” She points to the R\u0026ampB singer the Weeknd as a hero of hers, who released three stellar mixtapes before putting out an LP. Like him, she says, she wants to be at her “pinnacle” when she gives fans her first album. “I’m building up to it. I’m not chasing a hit song I’m chasing a career.” The album, it appears, is still the thing to chase if you want to be a serious artist – you just have to be ready to run faster than ever."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c71c0ed93baaabd6dd5c721a337425890aca95b/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aeb7ce9e94dc20ba082b3bc74272fb83","title":"revoke and remain inside lib dem conference podcast","story":"With a new leader in Jo Swinson and the defection of six MPs to the party, Lib Dems are hoping for a resurgence.

They said their negotiating “red line” was that the party itself had to commit to campaigning to stay in the EU, and prepared for a battle with those who want Labour not to commit to either side.Corbyn has repeatedly declined to say which side he would campaign on, if any, at a potential second referendum, after pledging that as prime minister he would negotiate a better Brexit deal and put that to a public vote alongside the option of remain.Pro-remain activists have been seeking signs of a compromise from the leader’s office that could avoid a row at the upcoming autumn conference.However, groups involved in the push to make Labour an unequivocally pro-remain party said they were prepared to force the issue to a vote if no concessions emerged on or before Saturday night, when the text of a motion to be put to delegates would emerge.Michael Chessum, national organiser for Another Europe is Possible, said: “The iding line at this conference isn’t about whether Jeremy Corbyn is forced to campaign for remain – it’s about what happens with the party machine – the data, money and infrastructure that could prove vital in a referendum. We need to send a signal to members, and to our voters, that Labour as a party backs remain.”More than 80 similar pro-remain motions from local parties have been submitted to the conference, which will be subject to a “compositing” process to determine the text of a single motion to be put to delegates.If no text can be agreed, it is possible that two motions could result – one proposing Labour becomes a clearly pro-remain party and another closer to the leadership’s position of letting the public decide in a second referendum.The vote would then be likely to take place on Monday. However, the conference is not certain to vote in favour of a clear pro-remain position, despite an overwhelming majority of members in favour of staying in the EU, as most trade unions have taken the same position as the leadership.If it gets to a vote on the conference floor, many delegates could also be reluctant to undermine Corbyn’s stated position that he wants a second referendum with the public deciding between a Labour-negotiated leave and remain option.At 11pm UK time on 31 October the UK would, by default, become a “third country” in terms of relations with the EU, with no overarching post-Brexit plan in place and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the £39bn orce payment.The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports – making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO “most favoured nation” rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.WTO rules only cover goods – they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK’s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally – the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK’s trading relationship.The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azevêdo, has told Prospect magazine that “in simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none”.Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses – eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a “managed” no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.To avoid a damaging public split being aired at conference, one option is for the national executive committee (NEC) to step in on Sunday or Monday morning and table an overriding motion that is closer to Corbyn’s position.However, several shadow cabinet ministers would like the party itself to commit to campaigning to remain in the EU. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, and Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, have all stated they would campaign against Brexit in a second referendum.The majority of pro-remain motions have been drafted by leftwing groups Another Europe is Possible, Labour for a Socialist Europe and Open Labour, containing a commitment to “campaign energetically for a public vote and to remain”, alongside support for free movement, a radical domestic agenda and a vision to transform Europe.Chi Onwurah, Labour MP for Newcastle Central, said the party had to be alive to the threat of the Lib Dems, who have wooed some remain voters by taking a stance in favour of cancelling Brexit altogether.“In constituencies all over the country, leave seats as well as remain ones, we are in danger of losing because our voters are turning to the Lib Dems,” she said.“We need to reach out across the Brexit ide with our radical domestic programme, but we also need to send a clear signal to our remain voters that we understand them and are on their side.”Eloise Harris, a delegate from Bethnal Green and Bow Labour party, added: “Jeremy Corbyn appears committed to standing above the fray and playing honest broker in a future referendum on Brexit. That can work. But as we go into a general election, members need to know that the party itself is on our side.“Labour is a remain party – our members, unions and MPs are overwhelmingly in favour of staying in the EU. The public knows this already. We should move forward with energy and clarity and back remain, while giving full license to anyone who wants to campaign the other way. That is the only way to unite us and move the conversation on to our radical domestic offer.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31f6e4b9449aa920172848aac7baf1c0a6c6a622/70_1250_2847_1707/master/2847.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60644e2a5ee882efd26fc37de3250fcf","title":"scientists use fossilised finger bone dna to rebuild ancient denisovan human","story":"Unprecedented feat reveals little-known Denisovans resembled Neanderthals but had ‘super-wide’ skulls One of the most mysterious relatives in the human family has stepped out of the shadows after scientists used ancient DNA from a fossilised finger to reconstruct their appearance.The unprecedented feat, described as “exciting” and “extraordinary” by one leading researcher who was not involved in the work, shows that the Denisovans looked similar to the Neanderthals, but had wider heads and more protruding jaws.“We expected them to resemble Neanderthals more than modern humans and this is what we found,” said Liran Carmel, a researcher on the team at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. “But what fascinated us most is where the Denisovans differed from these other human groups.“This might shed light on many of the questions that people have about the Denisovans, including how they adapted to their environment, and how the genetic traces they’ve left in modern humans might have helped them adapt to theirs.”The Denisovans are thought to have lived across much of Asia tens of thousands of years ago, but until now almost nothing was known about their appearance.The population first came to light in 2010 when part of a fossilised finger bone was unearthed in the Denisova cave in Siberia’s Altai mountains. A few other remnants have been found since then, including three large teeth and lower jaw bone.Carmel and his colleague David Gokhman came up with an ingenious approach to infer what the Denisovans looked like. They began by analysing what is called DNA “methylation” in Denisovans, neanderthals and modern humans. Methylation is a natural process that tags genes with a chemical marker. The markers operate a bit like volume switches, turning a gene’s activity up or down.By comparing “methylation maps” of the three ancient human populations, the researchers worked out which Denisovan genes were as active as those in modern humans or Neanderthals, and crucially which were expressed very differently.Armed with the list of genes, the researchers next consulted a huge medical database that links human genetic disorders, including skeletal problems, to glitches in the activity of particular genes. From this they worked out how gene activity patterns in the Denisovans would affect their appearance.Gokhman and Carmel identified 56 parts of the Denisovan anatomy that differed from modern humans or Neanderthals, 34 of which affected the Denisovan skull. While the Denisovans had wide pelvises like the neanderthals, the analysis published in Cell shows they had wider skulls and longer dental arches, or jaws, making room for their larger teeth.“Perhaps most surprising was their super-wide skulls, wider than modern humans’ and neanderthals’, who already have wide skulls,” said Gokhman. The finding adds weight to suspicions that a mystery human skull recently unearthed in Xuchang, China, also belonged to a Denisovan.Highlighting what made the Denisovans unique will help scientists understand how they adapted to the conditions they lived in and what role their genes play in people alive today, said Gokhman.While the technique is not good enough to give scientists accurate new measurements for the Denisovans, that may become more possible in the future. “All of this information is in our DNA, we just need to learn how to read it, and given how fast genetics is evolving, I don’t think it’s going to take very long,” said Gokhman.David Reich, a Harvard geneticist who has worked extensively on ancient human DNA, said: “This is a highly original and exciting study, which is extraordinary not just with respect to the specific findings but also with respect to the entire approach.”Asked whether DNA might one day help police reconstruct the faces of wanted persons, Gokhman added: “It’s a very exciting direction, but we are way too far at this point. Our approach is a step in this direction, but just a step.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/daa1bed53e006fcf11119867224a1dac0c467643/0_351_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6d6c5eab5a22bc042ae6f12ec51da7b","title":"parliament apologises for photographing rough sleepers","story":"Contractor took photos of homeless people as they slept near palace of WestminsterParliament has apologised to a group of rough sleepers who bed down close to the palace of Westminster after taking inidual photos of them without their permission while they slept.About 20 people sleep rough in and around the tunnels connecting parliament to Westminster tube station. They woke last Friday to find a cleaning contractor employed by the parliamentary estate taking photographs of them.One man, a 45-year-old from Latvia who works on a building site, said he was astonished to be woken up by someone taking photographs.“A manager deliberately came and took photos of us while we were sleeping. There were about six of us sleeping upstairs and 12 of us downstairs,” he said. “We were so shocked about this. Downstairs in the tunnel leading to parliament is the best place in London for rough sleepers to sleep. It’s warm and it’s safe because there are lots of cameras around here. I don’t understand why pictures of us were being made. This was a proper mistake. We know they want to move us out and maybe that’s why they were taking our photos.”A House of Commons spokesperson said: “We apologise for any distress caused this should not have happened and has been immediately stopped.”The homeless people previously all slept in one tunnel but the parliamentary estate effectively evicted them last month by installing shutters to mark parliament’s new boundary following a transfer of land from Transport for London. The new shutters prevented the group from sleeping there, so they are now spread out in various areas nearby.The House of Commons spokesperson did not explain why its contractors had taken photos of inidual rough sleepers.“It’s a human rights breach to take photos of us while we’re sleeping,” said another member of the group of rough sleepers. “By moving us from the part of the tunnel we were sleeping in before, they’ve actually made the problem worse. Previously we were in one place now people are sleeping in different places close to parliament. They want to get rid of us but I don’t know where they expect us to go. Parliament is empty at the moment because it has been suspended. Maybe we can all move in there for a few weeks!”It is understood that the parliamentary estate has instructed its contractor to stop the practice of taking photos of inidual rough sleepers immediately and that all images of rough sleepers have been deleted after the  raised the issue.There is concern among the rough sleepers about possible police and immigration enforcement activity. Previously the homeless charity St Mungo’s has worked with Home Office immigration enforcement teams to identify non-British rough sleepers, who in some cases were subsequently deported.A spokesperson for the Public Interest Law Centre, which brought a successful legal challenge against the Home Office policy to round up migrant rough sleepers, said: “There is a long history of criminalisation and enforcement against homeless people in and around Westminster. This incident further shows how authorities treat homeless people with contempt, dehumanising their very existence in the process. This government has promoted austere and hostile policies which have caused an exponential rise in homelessness and an increase in enforcement measures.”A spokesperson for the Labour Homelessness Campaign said: “Working closely with the Westminster rough sleepers, I know this is just the latest step in a trend of parliament refusing to treat rough sleepers with the most basic respect as human beings. If even parliament, with the eyes of the country on it, won’t guarantee any fundamental rights of homeless members of our community, that’s a sign of how unequal our society is in every respect.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87ba59c282339dd1deb6b7a89144dba4dd4fd47e/255_23_5152_3091/master/5152.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c364439f671c1441404024981b1b0880","title":"lewis hamilton hard racing singapore grand prix","story":"Lewis Hamilton reiterated his intent to give no quarter when he returns to the track for the Singapore Grand Prix this weekend. The Briton was disappointed after Charles Leclerc was not penalised for squeezing him wide at the last round in Monza. Hamilton said afterwards that he would adjust his driving accordingly, a view he repeated at the Marina Bay circuit on Thursday.Leclerc was issued with a warning rather than penalty at the Italian Grand Prix, a decision in keeping with the recent stewards’ policy of allowing the drivers to race. Hamilton said he would adapt if that was how the rules were to be interpreted. “I look forward,” he said. “There’s nothing I can do about the past. I’m down for hard racing.”His views were echoed by several drivers including Renault’s Daniel Ricciardo and Red Bull’s Max Verstappen. The latter pushed Leclerc wide in Austria and did not receive a penalty, from which Leclerc drew conclusions on how far he believed he could go on track.“I don’t mind a few touches here and there throughout a grand prix,” said Verstappen. “Even if it’s not touches then you should be able to defend yourself. For me it’s fine and every driver knows this so we will all race the same.”Hamilton, who leads the world championship by 63 points from his Mercedes teammate, Valtteri Bottas, has four wins in Singapore, including the past two meetings, while Leclerc comes into the race on the back of two consecutive victories. Ferrari are expected to be on the back foot, however, their car at its weakest on tracks such as Marina Bay that demand high downforce.Robert Kubica announced he will be leaving Williams at the end of this season. The Pole made a remarkable comeback to return to F1 this season after suffering severe injuries in a crash while rallying in 2011. He has struggled, however, in the uncompetitive Williams, and been outpaced by his teammate, George Russell.With most seats for next season already confirmed, it is unlikely he will continue in F1. A move to DTM has been rumoured and Kubica said: “I am looking for different opportunities. In order to evaluate our opportunities, I have taken the decision that I will not continue more with Williams after this year, so I will stop at end of the year with the team and this opens up opportunities for me in the future in different scenarios.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f86d634297e6085c75dd500d1e5743793a4c935/0_249_5321_3193/master/5321.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=218a4282bf00bed494e6f038157a4c28","title":"rugby world cup fans previews predictions japan","story":"South Africa are confident. Scotland are hard to predict. Wales have high hopes. And Uruguay just want to win a gameWe hope to win it, but is that realistic? We will be competitive and we will trouble top teams, may even upset one if it all comes magically together. We have a decent draw if we can beat Wales. If we top our pool, we play France or Argentina in the quarter-finals and will be too strong for them. That gives us a semi-final, most probably against South Africa or New Zealand, maybe Ireland, at which time our tournament will end. If we are very lucky and face Ireland – who are a much more settled team but have shown some weaknesses recently – we might make a final. But I very much doubt it.We have a decent pack and lineout, but our No 6 is not a No 6. Michael Cheika will unbalance the pack and play the Michael Hooper and David Pockock combo, which does not work. Our bench players does not give us depth. We have brought an out-of-form and ageing Ashley Cooper instead of some of our best performers. One full-back can’t catch high balls and the other has no pace. At least one winger has no pace. And, crucially for a World Cup, we don’t have a consistent goal kicker. Still ... we can come together once in a while. Aiden Smith•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletterThe “glory days” of the 1990s, when Canada could be competitive against all but the very big boys, are long gone and there is a widespread acceptance that the standard of rugby here has slipped and with it a huge opportunity has gone. Couple that with being placed in a “pool of death” and expectations among Canadian rugby fans are very low. The Namibia game represents our final. If we win that and put up a creditable performance against Italy, most fans will be satisfied. Tim YobiloEngland are not favourites but we are one of the main contenders. This World Cup is one of the most open, so I expect to see a lot of surprises and new heroes emerging from all countries. Hopefully England can win it all!||Here in Greece the faithful few are organising ourselves to see the games where we can, all together, even though we support different countries! I personally, due to my Newcastle heritage, want to see Mark Wilson continuing his good performances, making the North proud. Anthony KiousopoulosI fear an elimination at the pool stage, especially taking into account recent results. Argentina are a strong team and England are above us by far. Although, if we beat Argentina, we could reach the semi-finals. Wales or Australia in the quarter-finals are both winnable games. The good thing is that for the first time in years, the French have had time to work as a unit, particularly on tactics. The enhanced management team also changed the defence, which worked well during warm-up games.It might be too early for some of the brand new players such as Romain Ntamack, Demba Bamba and Peato Mauvaka, but the exceptional gifts of some of the young guns like Antoine Dupont, Damian Penaud and Grégory Alldritt mixed with the rebirth of some old guns like Maxime Médard and Louis Picamoles could bring some good results. The problem is that the team isn’t rock-solid and it has some weaknesses better teams can exploit. Arnoud XavierSadly this year will almost certainly be a huge comedown for the Lelos after the highs of automatic qualification in 2015. After taking that step four years ago, the aim should be to, at least, finish third in the group again. However, Georgia were dealt a horrible hand in the draw, which could not have been worse.Georgia could have had the USA, Russia or Namibia as fourth seeds, which would almost certainly have guaranteed third place. Despite the poor build up, there would have perhaps been talk of “targeting” one of Australia or Wales for a last eight spot. Unfortunately, Georgia find themselves in a group with Fiji, who have a squad good enough to threaten Australia and third place seems far harder this time around than it was last time. Pool D is the only group with four teams in the top 12 of the World Rugby rankings.One should be positive, it isn’t a foregone conclusion. Georgia has as good a scrum as anybody and if the game against Fiji comes on a horrible rainy day, hopefully played on a recently ploughed field, parity could be secured. If it is an arm-wrestle, Georgia has a chance. And of course, that scrum could also turn over Wales and Australia’s. But the team has shown consistently over the last four seasons, against second-tier nations as well as the few opportunities they have against the big boys, that they struggle to finish opportunities off and without a huge change in that area there really is no chance of anything better than fourth. Adam HookerIt seems mad to be saying I’m nervous when my team is ranked as world No 1, but that’s the mad position I’m in as an Ireland fan. 2018 was a dream year. If the 2019 Six Nations felt lacklustre by comparison, then the thrashing by England was a real bodyblow for a fan’s confidence.Recent results against Wales steadied the ship and I hope we can recover the magic that saw us outclass the All Blacks. I’m flying out to Japan and praying we hit the ground running against Scotland. I’m an Ulster girl and want Rory Best to go out on a high. One of the friends I’m going with is Scottish and I’ll be pure sickened if they have bragging rights for the rest of our trip. Emma CassidyWe hope to win the first two games against Namibia and Canada, and then we’ll go in pilgrimage to the Vatican and pray for a miracle. Maybe we’ll defeat South Africa again like in 2017, or maybe we will face an already qualified and content All Blacks. But whatever happens I really hope that Sergio Parisse and Leo will have some glory in their last Rugby World Cup. Damiano MartignagoHistorically we have played 19 lost 19, so a victory would be sweet. Scoring a try against South Africa or New Zealand would be awesome. As the lowest ranked team in the finals and, probably, the fewest fans able to afford the trip, our fan strategy will be to get the Japanese to love us and support us. I know our team will play with strength and stubborn optimism. We love Namibia and the fact that we are on the world stage. We will be few, but we will sing our national anthem, Land of the Brave, with passion. Jeremy SilvesterAfter the heartbreak of 2007, the nervousness and joy of 2011, and the excitement of 2015, it’s hard to say if New Zealand will raise the trophy once more. Of course, Kiwis are dreaming of the legendary three wins in a row. However, we know that having an amazing team doesn’t make it a winning team. With 2007 in our memories, no New Zealander is going to assume we will always make it through the quarter-finals.Ardie Savea and Brodie Retellick are the two players I am looking forward to watching the most. I’m excited for Retallick’s return from injury and I hope Savea receives the international recognition his abilities deserve. We will be proud of our boys no matter what. Nikki CarterWe just want to give it a good lash. We probably won’t get out of the group, barring a miracle. KT O’ConnorAnything less than the quarter-finals would be a big disappointment anything more a big surprise. It’s hard to know what to expect from Scotland anymore, such is their inconsistency. They are capable of blistering brilliance one day (running in six tries in half an hour or so at Twickenham) and abject incompetence the next (the error-strewn performances at home to Ireland and away to France in this year’s Six Nations). I’m left with the impression that we’re going backwards under Gregor Townsend.Vern Cotter gave the side a more steely, competitive edge. Though, let’s face it, Scotland could hardly have been any less competitive in the years before he took over, whereas with Townsend it seems to be a case of boom or bust. That might be harsh on him and you could point to the home warm-up win over France as evidence of steeliness, but one minute I find myself thinking we could beat the Irish, top the group and give South Africa or New Zealand a serious run for their money in the last eight, and the next I’m contemplating the very real possibility of losing to Ireland and Japan and going home early. Much will depend on Finn Russell, possibly too much. I’m also hoping the Ireland players don’t complete a hat-trick of sneakymistimed hits on Stuart Hogg this year. James CalderI’m approach the tournament with building expectation and hope. The Boks are many people’s pick for the title. Their squad depth is unrivalled and their preparation under Rassie Erasmus has been meticulous. I expect their first game, against New Zealand, to be part one of a double header that will culminate in the final. South Africa have the forward power to generate both quick ball and field position for them to unleash their burgeoning back line.Handre Pollard is in the form of his life and will be one of the dominant players of the World Cup. At blindside flank Pieter-Steph Du Toit is already a candidate for world player of the year and can play a similar role to that of Juan Smith in the 2007 World Cup victory. Cheslin Kolbe has the potential to announce himself as a true superstar and be one of the stars of the World Cup. Fans across the world will be won over by his stepping ability and his huge courage. South Africa’s main weakness will be Faf De Klerk and Willie Le Roux, two players who waver from world class to dreadful. If either of them has an off day, it could cost the Boks hugely. Sam KantorowichI don’t have much hope really, but just want one positive result in our four games to show the amazing development rugby is having in Uruguay. I’m looking forward to watching Juan Cat, Santiago Civetta and Manuel Leindekar. Juan LaffitteOur hopes are simply to win one or two matches. Of our opponents in the pool – England, France, Argentina and Tonga – I realistically think we can beat Tonga and then produce another highlight, like we did in 2007 against South Africa. We can expect to come up against a second or third XV against England and maybe Argentina, but France will want to give their first team a run so we’ll have a hard time of it there. Tonga is the game we are setting our sights on. The boys are up for the challenge and won’t lack spirit. Brendan CareyThis year could be our year. I’m not reading too much into the warm-up games. Warren Gatland knows what he is doing to ensure we are in the best possible frame of mind for the start of the tournament. Losing Gareth Anscombe was a huge blow and, if Rhys Patchell misses out we’ll be very thin at No 10, but Dan Biggar knows how to play on the biggest stage and his kicking game is second to none. With Alun Wyn Jones leading from the front, George North on the wing, and a resurgent Jonathan Davies in the side, I expect us to beat all of the northern hemisphere sides. That just leads to the big three and, on our day, we are finally ready to dispatch them.

Joe Marler has also been selected despite missing the majority of England’s training session on Wednesday.It is only the second time since last June that Jones has opted to pair Ford and Farrell together, but both shone against Ireland. Jones will also be mindful that selecting two playmakers enables England to adopt more of a passing game in the face of the expected physical onslaught from Tonga.“The focus this week has been about getting right for Tonga,” said Jones. “We have had a good seven days in Japan where we have acclimatised really well, our sleep patterns are good and the physical conditioning of the players is outstanding. We have been able to add a bit more on our team togetherness and cohesion, too.”Ford and Farrell is also a tried and tested partnership at 10-12 for Jones, who played the two together for all but one game of the 18-match winning run to start his tenure. He largely continued with it thereafter but after England were defeated the first two matches of last summer’s tour of South Africa – extended their losing run to five Tests – Jones turned to Danny Cipriani for one match only before installing Farrell as his number one fly-half.Elsewhere, Elliot Daly is at full-back with Anthony Watson and Jonny May on the wings while Ben Youngs is chosen at scrum-half. Joining Marler in the front row is Jamie George and Kyle Sinckler while Itoje is Lawes’s second-row partner.In the back-row, Tom Curry and Sam Underhill - dubbed the “Kamikaze Kids” by Jones - play their second match together having dovetailed to impressive effect against Ireland. Billy Vunipola is at No8 against the country of his heritage while Lewis Ludlam is on the bench. Neither Mark Wilson nor Cokanasiga, who have both been carrying knee problems, are in the 23-man squad.Joining Ludlam among the replacements is Kruis as well as the front-row trio of Luke Cowan-Dickie, Ellis Genge and Dan Cole. Willi Heinz is the replacement scrum-half while Henry Slade and Jonathan Joseph are both also in the squad with the Exeter centre set for his first outing since 2 June having recovered from a knee injury.“Now it is about putting in a game plan against Tonga and it is important to be tactically right,” added Jones. “We know they are going to be ferocious and full of pride and passion. They are a side if they get a bit of momentum they can be very dangerous and are well coached by Toutai Kefu. They have a great World Cup record and we will need to be at our best on Sunday.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3f23474c2327ad6a013d051f757add9fe5a0194/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea2c4d253ce25ec83df17daaf26061fa","title":"rugby world cup japan wakes up to the arrival of rugby giants","story":"The stakes are high for the first Asian host of the Rugby World Cup, both on and off the pitchThe Rugby World Cup megastore in Tokyo’s Shinjuku district is doing a brisk business in official merchandise. Wallabies and All Blacks T-shirts have sold out, a shop assistant says, glancing down at two sets of empty shelves. Spotting the flag emblazoned on a miniature rugby ball in the ’s basket, she quickly adds: “The England shirts are selling really well, too.”The warm and sustained blast of omotenashi hospitality directed at visiting teams and their supporters this week in Japan has almost made it possible to forget that much of the tournament’s success will depend on the hosts, who begin their campaign in the opening fixture against Russia on Friday in front of a TV audience organisers say could reach 40 million – just under a third of the country’s population.The Welsh squad were serenaded with a rousing rendition of Land of My Fathers by 15,000 people at a training session the All Blacks have been treated to enough displays of the haka to sustain them during the next six weeks of rugby and an ear-splitting performance of taiko drumming should have blown away any post-flight cobwebs among the English contingent.As it prepares for the opening fixture, the stakes could hardly be higher for Japan, both as a team and host of the first World Cup to be held in Asia.World Rugby had already taken a gamble a decade ago when it awarded the 2019 event to Japan, whose long association with the sport has never been matched by its achievements in the international arena.Before the last tournament in 2015, hosted by England, the Brave Blossoms had only ever won one World Cup match, against Zimbabwe in 1991, and lost every other by an average of 48 points, including a crushing 145-17 defeat at the hands of the All Blacks in 1995.Japanese rugby didn’t properly announce its arrival as a serious international proposition until 2015 when Eddie Jones’s men became the first team in World Cup history to win three matches yet fail to advance to the knockout stages. Those victories included an astonishing 34-32 defeat of South Africa in Brighton. Four years on, it seems incredible to recall that the match wasn’t shown on terrestrial TV in Japan.What happened next should calm any 11th-hour nerves over how much domestic interest the 2019 incarnation will generate. Having been denied live coverage of the Springboks shock, Japanese TV viewers set a tournament record, with 25 million watching the team’s next match, a 26-5 win over Samoa.After years of struggling to emerge from the shadow of next summer’s Tokyo Olympics, the World Cup has finally penetrated the public consciousness. Almost all of the 1.8m tickets have been sold, with the organising committee president, Fujio Mitarai, confidently predicting that all 48 games will be played in packed stadiums.The 12 match venues have been shared among rugby heartlands in Kamaishi and Osaka, but also cities such as Kobe and Fukuroi, where the sport barely registered a couple of years ago.Officials say they are hoping two matches in Sapporo this weekend, including England v Tonga, generate 4.7bn yen ( £35m) in revenue, as 80,000 of an expected total of more than 400,000 overseas fans descend on the tournament’s northernmost venue.The World Rugby chairman, Bill Beaumont, believes a “flame has been lit” with the arrival of the World Cup in Japan. “Interest is phenomenal and more young people in Japan are getting into rugby than ever before,” he said on the eve of the tournament.Bu the groundswell of grassroots support for rugby – Japan’s third sport behind professional baseball and football – could easily give way to apathy if the host side’s performances fall short of rising public expectations.Few believe that Jamie Joseph’s men – Japanese sport’s latest challenge to the notion of a racially homogenous society – can do anything other than put Russia, currently ranked 20th in the world, to the sword at Tokyo Stadium on Friday.But if their tournament evaporates as quickly as beer fumes on a balmy autumn evening against Pool A opponents Ireland, Scotland and Samoa, the resulting drop-off in local interest will frustrate the vision of World Rugby officials – to spread the rugby gospel across Asia and tap into a potentially huge financial idends.According to the Nikkei Asian Review, World Rugby’s wish list for the 2019 legacy includes creating 40 million new rugby fans, adding 2 million new players across the region by the end of next year and seeing another Asian team qualify for the 2023 World Cup.Twenty-four hours before the opening match, supporters, organisers and, very possibly, a large number of neutrals, are clinging onto the hope that Japan will avoid becoming victims of their success in England and defy the predictions from uncooperative cephalopods.Recalling Japan’s exploits against South Africa, their popular captain, Michael Leitch, neatly summed up just how precarious rugby’s place in the Japanese sporting firmament has been.“When we left for England there were roughly 25 people waving us off at the airport,” Leitch said this week, according to Kyodo news agency. “When we came back there were 6,000.”There will be no need for a homecoming this time around, but a place in the quarterfinals – a feat that will require a big win over Russia and leaves little room for blunders against Ireland, Samoa or Scotland – should go some way towards realising Leitch’s vision for the sport in the country he has called home since the age of 15.Reflecting on his side’s 2015 post-Springboks loss to Scotland, Leitch added: “Although we lost, we inspired Japan and this time round, at a home World Cup, we have the opportunity to inspire Japan again.”We will soon know if the Brave Blossoms have it in them to seize their moment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4cdfac777dfc00d410d4cea774997744f035b63/0_12_3763_2259/master/3763.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03f345942cab76ca3a309603dcc7cd7c","title":"talking horses circus maximus reprieve raises disqualification issue","story":"Romanised may have won at Longchamp under old rules, but occasional controversy is better than denying worthy winnersThe question of what, exactly, a horse and rider must do to an opponent to be disqualified from first place raises itself again, following news from France on Thursday evening. The connections of Romanised, the narrow runner-up in the Prix du Moulin 12 days ago, have failed in their appeal against the decision to allow Circus Maximus to keep the race.Romanised, who is trained by Ken Condon in Ireland, took the Prix Jacques le Marois in August and appeared to be on the verge of a swift Group One double approaching the final furlong of the Moulin as he moved alongside Circus Maximus and Ryan Moore. Circus Maximus then started to drift to his left, carrying Romanised with him.Having been shifted several horse-widths across the course, Romanised was still just a nose behind Circus Maximus at the line – but the Longchamp stewards did not take further action. Condon also suggested this week that he felt Romanised had received a bump close to the line, forcing him to switch leads and lose more vital momentum.Until the end of 2017, Romanised would have been highly likely to get the win on the day in these circumstances. Until then, France was the last major racing nation which used a “Category 2” interpretation of interference. Under it, demotion for the horse causing the problems, to behind the runner it had impeded, was largely automatic.In 2018, however, France joined Britain, Ireland, Australia, Hong Kong and Japan in taking a “Category 1” approach. This means the stewards must be satisfied that a horse causing interference has improved its placing as a result before they will order the placings to be amended.Tips by Greg WoodCategory 1 tends to be seen as the more punter (and spectator) friendly way to proceed, as it reduces the number of amendments and helps to stop easy, worthy winners being disqualified for interference early in a race. These still crop up with some regularity in the US, where major jurisdictions retain a Category 2 approach.But it does not stop disqualifications altogether and the significant distance that Circus Maximus appeared to have carried Romanised across the course, allied to the extremely narrow margin of victory, looked like very strong grounds for a reversal of the placings to many observers on the day.The stewards decided that the two horses had drifted left largely independently and used footage from a camera inside the track to conclude that Circus Maximus was finishing faster at the line. As a result, they could not be satisfied that he would have finished second but for the interference in the closing stages. Thursday’s appeal, according to a press release from France Galop on Thursday evening, “was heard in a fair play atmosphere”, but added that their stewards, “after showing all the views of the incident and hearing both parties make their points in detail,” allowed the original result to stand.Tips by Greg Wood"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32986d40fc01ae9286f27d458213546e162d70e0/0_363_4483_2690/master/4483.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e85743849cfa4170e91cad4fdc39e635","title":"libratone track air review the noise cancelling airpods apple wont give you","story":"Great fit and sound, long battery, attractive design and pocketable case make for an excellent set of budsLibratone has given us the better fitting AirPods that Apple wouldn’t, with great sound and noise cancelling.The Danish audio firm’s Track Air+ are a set of true wireless earbuds, priced at £179, that follow the familiar design of earbud with stalk but no cable.Unlike the vast majority of AirPod-a-likes the Track Air+ actually look different, with triangular-shaped metallic stalks that almost look like an earring mounted on a pill-shaped lump with an earbud tip sticking out one end. Even in white you’re not going to confuse these with Apple’s earbuds, and that’s a good thing.The simple, attractive design is subtle enough to go fairly unnoticed in your ear, but different enough to be attractive, particularly in black and silver.The lump containing most of the workings fits beautifully in the concha of your ear, with the earbud tip slotted into a secure and comfortable position down your ear canal with a small twist. Even the stalks fit nicely in the gap between your lobe and tragus. At 5.6g each the earbuds are pretty small and light, and not once did they feel like they would fall out.Everyone’s ears are different, but the Track Air+ are some of the most comfortable earbuds of any size or shape I’ve worn.The Track Air+ magnetically slot into a charging case that’s one of the best in the business. It’s small enough to fit in the money pocket of a pair of jeans, making it one of only a handful of truly wireless earbuds that are that pocketable with the Samsung Galaxy Buds and Apple’s AirPods.The case charges via USB-C or wireless charging, which is handy, and will charge the earbuds up to three times. The Track Air+ lasted just shy of six hours with noise cancelling active, meaning you get about 24 hours of playback with trips in the case.The only slight niggles on the case are that, while the lid shuts securely with magnets, the hinge feels a little flimsy and will need a little bit of care in handling and the plastic body is easily marked.The Track Air+ support Bluetooth 5.0 and can be used inidually. They also support the standard Bluetooth audio format SBC and Qualcomm’s high-quality aptX, but strangely not AAC. While that’s not an issue for Android and Windows users, as aptX is built into both, Apple devices do not support aptX, with AAC their highest-quality supported Bluetooth audio codec, meaning the Track Air+ default to SBC.Most will not notice, but SBC has a higher latency, which means the Track Air+ suffered from a more noticeable audio delay with games on iOS than on Android. Lipsync issues were minimal with all major video apps on Android and there was only a minor delay noticeable with YouTube on an iPhone.Connectivity was rock solid with the majority of phones, including a OnePlus 7 Pro and iPhone XS, even in the most challenging of situations. Only once did I notice a momentary blip with a Google Pixel 3XL exiting the London underground at Liverpool Street.One of the weak points of the Libratone are the onboard controls. A double tap on either earbud can do one of the following: playpause, switch noise cancelling mode, skip track forward or activate your phone’s voice assistant. I set the left bud to skip track and the right bud to pause, but there’s no volume control, meaning it’s a trip to your phone to turn the music up or down.Removing both earbuds pauses the music and it resumes when you put one back in. A button in the case puts the buds into pairing mode, while the Libratone app takes care of settings. You can also check the battery of the earbuds and the case in the app.One of the best bits is how the Track Air+ sound, with a good amount of punchy bass and clarity rivalling some of the better sounding true wireless earbuds, while falling slightly shy of the big Sony WF-1000XM3 as the best. Feed them some aggressive rock or electronica and be richly rewarded, but they manage to do a good job of most genres.A basic EQ allows you to switch between neutral, extra bass or enhanced treble profiles, sounding best left in neutral. The silicone earbud tip, of which you get four sizes in the box, also does a good job of blocking out noise, but the Track Air+ also have noise cancelling built in. While it isn’t anywhere near as effective as that deployed by Sony’s new top earbuds or Bose, it dealt with the drone of plane engines well and managed to make a dent in most commuting noise too.You can adjust the noise cancelling through 30 levels, either manually or automatically based on your environment using the Libratone app on your phone. The earbuds sounded slightly less full in the mid-range with noise cancelling cranked up to maximum, but the trade-off seemed worth it in noisy environments.The Track Air+ struggled with wind noise with noise cancelling active. The ambient monitoring mode is excellent, sounding natural enough to hold a conversation fairly easy. I mainly used it to listen out for announcements.Call quality was pretty good too, with recipients saying I sounded fairly clear with only a little bit of loud background noise audible.The Libratone Track Air+ are some of the best true wireless earbuds available at the moment – very nearly the isolating, noise-cancelling AirPods Apple won’t give us.They have a stalk design but are attractive and don’t look like AirPod clones. They are some of the most comfortable earbuds I have ever worn: small and light enough you simply forget they’re in, but stay put and block out noise. The case is one of the best in the business too truly pocketable with USB-C and wireless charging, and you can check the battery level in an app.Connectivity was rock solid to both phones and tablets, with aptX for Android and Windows. Sound quality was really good, falling just shy of the very best true wireless earbuds available. And they have pretty effective noise cancelling.They are not quite perfect, but the only minus points are lack of volume control on the earbuds and the curious lack of AAC support, which is only a fairly small issue for iOS users.At £179 they’re not cheap, but undercut Apple’s AirPods with wireless charging case by £20 and Sony’s WF-1000XM3 by £40, making them pretty good value by comparison.If you want great-fitting, great-sounding true wireless earbuds that last a long time and fit into an excellently pocketable case then the Libratone Track Air+ tick every box, and have noise cancelling as the cherry on top.Pros: great sound, noise cancelling, super comfortable, brilliant case, aptX and Bluetooth 5, long battery life, solid connectivity, small and attractive.Cons: no AAC support, no volume control on buds, problem with wind noise, noise cancelling not the best.

It hasn’t worked.I used my phone for an average of 4 hours and 2 minutes a day last week, picking it up 103 times a day. That’s about once every 10 minutes while I am awake. And for what? Pokémon Go (yes, I am addicted), social networking and reading – in that order. And when I’m not on my phone, I am on my laptop.If this sounds familiar, and somewhat nauseating, meet the Light Phone.Launched this month after a wildly successful crowdfunding campaign, Light Phone is a credit card-sized phone that only lets you make calls and text. That’s it. The first version of Light Phone was calls only and proved too much for even the most hardened minimalist. The second version, to be released soon, will allow users to use maps or summon an Uber or Lyft but its creators, Joe Hollier and Kai Tang, say they will never add email or any social media.“Remember the old days when you sat down at your computer and you were connected, and then you stood up and you were disconnected. There was a clear separation,” says Hollier. “Now you’re connected 247. This isn’t what I wanted.”The point of the Light Phone is to let you leave your smartphone at home (or as Tang does, in his bag) and live more of your life in the – shudder – real world.My plan was to use it for a week, leave my iPhone at home or on my desk, only using it when I could as easily have used my laptop.It proved surprisingly hard – but not for the reasons I expected.Initially, panic came in waves. What if I missed that big email or an urgent message from family and friends? I had told the office and my significant others I was on phone or text only, but that didn’t stop me worrying.The extent of my dependency was manifest all week, and it’s little wonder – all this screen time is rewiring our brains. We now lose concentration quicker than a goldfish (eight seconds for us, nine for the goldfish, according to one study). To my horror, I find myself reaching for the Light Phone, even though I know it does nothing, like an ex-smoker patting his pockets for his lighter. As a post-work drink with colleagues turns from gossip to football, I automatically reach for it to distract myself from sport banter before realising I have to suffer in silence. Every quiet moment, I wanted to check my phone. What the hell do I do when I need a poo? Do I now need one of those “toilet books”?Often, cravings are about my “need” for information. Out for pizza with my boyfriend, Larry, we start discussing the 2020 elections and Florida. How many Puerto Ricans moved there after Hurricane Maria? Will they tip the balance? I want to check my phone. The conversation shifts to Brexit. Ditto. I want my phone. And when Larry goes to the bathroom, leaving me alone at the table, you guessed it – I want my phone. I am sensing a pattern. Even watching TV I miss my phone. When was the last time I watched something without the distraction of a second screen? We are watching the TV show Legion. Who plays Syd’s mum? I saw her in something recently and she was great. Google would have told me in seconds. The feeling passes.Later, Gen James Mattis is on promoting his no-tell memoir. His hair is cut high, tight and slicked to his head with martial precision. Does Mattis ask for “a Mattis” when he goes to the hairdresser? Is he conscious this is a style? Unable to type away on my phone, I draw a picture of Mattis and – for some reason – Mount Fuji in my notebook. I used to draw a lot. I am drawing again. A lot of Easter Island heads, people on the subway, flowers. They are rubbish but this feels better than my phone.By midweek, I’m also writing more. At least these thoughts and drawings, however scattered, are my own. Maybe a new me is emerging, or an old one. One that draws and thinks for himself rather than following Silicon Valley’s addictive maze.Of course, there are problems. Without a book, the subway is not great (but then, the subway never is). On my way to work, a man starts screaming at fellow passengers: “Get the fuck away from me. This is MY space. You wanna go to female jail? You wanna go to female jail?” The phone is the perfect defense against the forced intimacy of the subway. Sitting quietly and making sure not to make eye contact, I wait for my stop. Everyone else stares even more intently at their screens.I am better prepared for my trip to the department of motor vehicles (DMV). Everyone knows the DMV is one of the outer circles of hell, and only a fool would enter unprepared. The first problem is that I thought I knew where it was. I didn’t – and didn’t have access to Google Maps. Lost in Midtown, I am considering whether to scrap the whole thing or walk back to the office to check directions on my laptop when I have an idea: I could ask someone. I pop into Nordstrom and ask the security guard. He knows!Laughably, I have chosen a DMV “Express” to renew my license. When I arrive I am assigned ticket number R775. The board is up to R695 – 80 people ahead of me. There are no seats. Everyone is on their phone. I sit on the floor and bring out my secret weapon: Frank O’Hara’s Lunch Poems. Pocketable and lovely.“where does the evil of the year goand turns it into ozone stalagmitesdeposits of light”Has anyone been better on New York?After two hours, I admit I am bored. I miss emojis – the book doesn’t have them. And typing on the tiny screen is a bore. The screen is minuscule, I need my glasses, there are no emojis. I can’t be bothered to send or reply to messages. But am I more bored than I would be with my little iFriend? No, I don’t think so. Nor do I see anyone else really LOLing it up despite all their screen time.On the way home, I am treated to a spectacular sunset. Manhattan washed in red and gold. So many people are snapping pics for Instagram – they will all be crap – while I am enjoying the now and especially how stupid they all look. Oh the delicious sense of superiority!At the end of the week, I go to the launch party for the Light Phone in Soho. There are a lot of smartphones and a lot of people not feeling great about them. James Russo, a marketing exec, plans to ditch his smartphone entirely once he gets a Light. “I eliminated Facebook and Instagram but I still find ways to kill time on my phone. It’s such a time suck,” he says.Amina Sule, a textile designer, says she spends two or three hours a day on her phone and she wants the time back. “As much as I try to stop doing it, I just find it creeping back,” she says. “I need something like this to manage it.”Will they ever be able to turn back the clock and go Light? Probably not. They’ll be too busy meeting the needs of people who can drop $350 on a second phone. But for me, it’s a possibility, perhaps. Maybe I’ll use the Light Phone and carry the iPhone in my bag. It feels like cheating but I want options.At the party Tang asks me how my week has been. His has been great – they have 50,000 people on the waitlist. I tell him it feels a little like swimming nude. Fun, slightly naughty, not always appropriate, but something I will definitely do again. I may carry my swimming trunks, though. Just in case."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd64cb1d37686db9fdbfc239bb009add02bce0fc/0_0_5150_3090/master/5150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7ead0786011c267b9b36008549d0f89","title":"lizard peninsula cornwall walking food wildlife pubs","story":"Overtourism isn’t in evidence when we catch the last rays of summer at a new hotel well-placed for enjoying this peninsula’s quiet beaches, empty footpaths and welcoming pubsCornwall has been a popular holiday destination for well over a century, but in recent years it has become a victim of overtourism. Last summer, it was so deluged by visitors that roads were gridlocked and the tourist board stopped promoting its beaches. But despite all this, it has pockets that remain relatively quiet, with almost-deserted stretches of coastal path, uncrowded coves and peaceful pubs.Cornwall’s three most-visited destinations are on the north coast – Newquay, St Ives and Padstow – and the next most-popular places are Falmouth and Penzance, in the south. Jutting down between these last two towns is the Lizard peninsula, the southernmost part of mainland Britain, where far fewer tourists venture.My partner and I were prompted to make the journey by the reopening of a coastal hotel, the Polurrian on the Lizard (formerly the Polurrian Bay), just outside the village of Mullion. It has been revamped in a modern, relaxed style, but its USP is unchanged: the fabulous clifftop setting. Our room has spectacular sea views, especially at sunset, as do the terrace, bar, dining room and gardens, and it is a short walk to the nearest beach, Polurrian Cove. We arrived in time for a rich afternoon tea on the terrace – four desserts as well as sandwiches and scones – then set off on a much-needed walk.The next day, we set off on a driving tour of the Lizard’s highlights (many of them can also be reached on the L1 and L2 bus routes). The roads are narrow and winding, but we were untroubled by traffic jams – the only holdups were caused by the odd tractor. Our first port of call was the Cornish Seal Sanctuary in Gweek, which rescues, rehabilitates and releases about 70 seal pups a year. It also has some permanent residents, including grey and common seals, sea lions, otters and penguins, and a daily programme of talks and feeding times.Tearing ourselves away from Squidge, the baby penguin, we took in Helford, a picturesque riverside village with a ferry carrying passengers between pubs on either riverbank St Keverne, with its pretty village square and Coverack, a fishing village with a lovely little harbour and a rocky beach. Our final stop was Cadgwith, a picture-postcard fishing hamlet with a shingle beach, brightly painted boats and thatched cottages. We sampled the Curio gin – distilled in Mullion and flavoured with foraged rock samphire – at the Cadgwith Cove Inn, an old smugglers’ haunt where the Cadgwith Singers still perform sea shanties every Friday night.Dinner was at the hotel, in a glorious sunset. “Cornish tapas” starters (three for £15) included potted crab, and while the fish stew (£14) was underwhelming, the shellfish platter (£26) more than made up for it: a pile of crab claws, scallops, prawns and mussels, all caramelised in the wood-fired oven.On reaching Lizard Point, we couldn’t resist a Cornish pasty in Polpeor Cafe, “Britain’s most southerly cafe” – even if it was twice the price of one in nearby Lizard village. Visitors can climb Lizard Lighthouse, built in 1751, though not, strangely, on Fridays or Saturdays (adult £8.50, child £5.50, trinityhouse). We were tired after our four-hour walk, but thankfully there is a bus back to Mullion from Lizard village.Next we headed up the coast to Porthleven, a delightful fishing port near Helston, the only town on the Lizard. (Helston has seen better days, but is well worth stopping for a Spingo ale at the Blue Anchor Inn, where it has been brewed for 600 years.) Porthleven is a lively little place, but with a fraction of the crowds that flock to St Ives or Padstow. Like Padstow, it is a foodie destination, with several good places to eat, such as the Mussel Shoal, a laid-back new spot on the harbour head serving moules-frites, squid and chowder. There’s also a handful of pubs, including the 17th-century Ship Inn and a food festival each April. A controversial Rick Stein restaurant opened in late 2014 – apparently residents boycott it because he doesn’t buy the local fishermen’s catch. Porthleven is good for shopping, too: there is a craft market on the harbour (Tuesdays, Thursday and Sundays from Easter to October) and a great little gallery, the Customs House, showcasing Cornish artists such as Ben Taffinder.Our accommodation here was at Kota, a Michelin-listed restaurant with rooms. The 300-year-old harbourfront granary building has two bedrooms upstairs and a new one next door. We were in the bright new room, which has a mezzanine level for kids and a bathroom with a blissfully powerful shower. Dinner was the best meal of the trip: a seven-course tasting menu (£60pp) of Cornish produce with a subtle Asian twist – Kota’s chef, Jude Kereama, is half Maori, half Chinese (Kota means shellfish in Maori). One oyster was served with a zingy cucumber rice wine granita another came tempura-style with a wasabi tartare sauce. Scallops were paired with ginger and slivers of pork belly an oxtail raviolo was flavoured with star anise and fried shallots. The next morning, we breakfasted on home-smoked salmon at Kota Kai, Kota’s informal sister restaurant.• Accommodation and dinner were provided by the Polurrian on the Lizard (doubles from £119 B\u0026ampB), and Kota (doubles from £95 B\u0026ampB) This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Literally – anyone looking for a haggard face bespeaking untold sleepless nights at the national hell he unleashed will go away disappointed – and figuratively. Everything he says is still carefully measured. He becomes impassioned, when called for, to the precise degree warranted. The voice may rise in pitch, but never in volume. His entire mien reminds you of the Gertrude Stein comment on her by-then-demolished childhood home – there is no “there” there.In short, it turns out there is even less to miss about David Cameron than you thought. Nevertheless, he has a book to sell (by many accounts, the 752-page tome sure ain’t shifting on its own) and we are a nation of masochists, so the BBC has served up The Cameron Years (BBC One). This first of two parts covered just the last years of his premiership. But, y’know, they were busy ones.The basic story was largely told in captions you could still read as your head sank ever lower in despair. “Cameron leads the Conservatives to their first outright victory since 1992.” Renegotiations with the EU “are complicated by a growing migrant crisis”. “Cameron gathers allies for the fight ahead” in 2016 …(The whole hour was a linguist’s dream, by the way. Whoever was speaking, the slippage of pronouns, often in the same sentence, from “I” to “we” to “you” – as either truth or the desire to escape it crept closer – was remarkable, and the passive voice got a workout from which it will be recovering for months.)It was at this point that the programme’s fatal flaw began to make itself impossible to ignore. Which was: the politicians were being allowed to speak. What, really, is the point of that? We are still in the middle of the events whose origins, and the parts they played in those origins, they are describing. There is no distance or detachment here no honest or clear-eyed analysis nothing recollected in equanimity. Everyone still has much to lose. Everyone is still as engaged as they ever were in the game of self-serving multidimensional chess that is domestic politics.For anyone not already minutely informed about the events, personal relationships and professional powerplays at work, such a programme’s main effect is simply to allow a different layer of dishonesty to be overlaid on what has gone before. We are all just watching a palimpsest of lies grow.If the aim of The Cameron Years is education and illumination, it would have been better to stick with footage from the time and examine the lies (or truths, should they occur) the players told then rather than give airtime to fresh lies or reinterpretations of their actions and utterances back in the day. If that’s not the aim – if it is, as it seems to be, one of those shows given to people in Cameron’s position almost as of right, granting the viewer the thrill of seeing a slightly different version of the man we knew as prime minister, in return for him getting to try to mould his legacy into something more palatable – then it is time for a rethink. In an age of “fake news”, shifting sands and vanishing facts, we need to revisit the natural-seeming ways of many things. Former leaders burnishing their book sales via BBC showcases may need to be one thing that goes.In the closing minutes, Cameron was pressed, slightly. He said he was “sorry” about “some of the things that have happened” and that he does “feel regret for some of the decisions and choices that I made”. His interviewer asked: “Remorse as well?” A pause. “I feel regret about what happened, and there are things that, if you had your time again, you’d do differently.”And that’s the best we’re going to get, I’m afraid, in this crazy, mixed-up, pronoun-shifting world that we?

The opposition Conservative party – currently neck-and-neck with Trudeau’s Liberals – confirmed it had sent the video to Global News earlier in the week.A spokesman for the prime minister said he had spent the morning calling Liberal candidates and community leaders to fully apologize for what he did “knowing how racist and hurtful this type of thing was”.The scandal erupted late on Wednesday, when Time magazine published an image of Trudeau dressed as Aladdin – complete with dark skin makeup and a turban – at a 2001 function at a private school where he was then working as a 29-year-old teacher.Trudeau immediately apologized, and acknowledged that he had previously blacked up at a high school talent show, when he had sung Day-O, the traditional Jamaican song.“I apologise profoundly,” Trudeau told reporters aboard his campaign plane. “I didn’t think it was racist at the time, but now I see, it was a racist thing to do.“I’m pissed off at myself. I’m disappointed in myself,” he said.Opposition politicians reacted swiftly, saying the decades-old images called into question Trudeau’s judgment, his commitment to ersity – and his fitness to lead the country.“How do you look someone in the eye that has mocked the lived reality that I have lived – but, more importantly, what a lot of Canadians have lived,” said Jagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democratic party.The Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer – Trudeau’s main opponent – said he was “shocked and disappointed” and claimed the prime minister had “lied” in his apology to Canadians.But Scheer has also faced calls in recent weeks to eject members from within his own party for racist or homophobic statements. He told reporters he would stand by candidates who showed genuine remorse for previous actions – a standard he appeared unprepared to offer to Trudeau.The Green party leader, Elizabeth May, said she was “deeply shocked by the racism shown in this photograph of Justin Trudeau”, saying the prime minister must commit to learning better social justice leadership at “all levels of government”.A spokesman for Trudeau said that the prime minister had spent Thursday morning calling community leaders and Liberal politicians.Greg Fergus, a Liberal MP in Quebec and member of the federal Black Caucus, said he was “hopeful” the incident could help spur “nuanced” conversations about systemic racism in Canada.“I think the real measure of the man, and I think the thing we need to be talking about, is all the amazing things we have done for ersity,” Fergus said.“What Justin Trudeau did was wrong. He has apologized. I know it is not representative of the man he is,” Mitzie Hunter, a black member of Ontario’s Liberal party, tweeted. “This is a teachable moment for all of us. I accept his apology and I hope Canadians do too.”Others, were less forgiving of the prime minister’s previous actions.“The privilege continues. There is no excuse for this. Apology is a first step. You should be aware of the history of #blackface and racism in this country and others. Apparently #ersityisourstrength? Deeply disappointed,” tweeted former colleague Celina Caesar-Chavannes, who left the Liberal party in March 2019.After his landslide electoral victory in 2015, Trudeau was praised for his apparent commitment to ersity and inclusion, as well as polices which appeared to offer an explicit rebuke to those of Donald Trump: he quickly named a young and ethnically erse cabinet and initially welcome large numbers of Syrian refugees.But he is fighting for his second parliamentary majority against the backdrop of a protracted political scandal: earlier this year Canada’s ethics watchdog found that Trudeau broke the country’s conflict of interest law when he allegedly pressured his attorney general to halt the criminal prosecution of the Quebec-based engineering giant SNC Lavalin.Trudeau’s Liberal is effectively locked in a dead heat with rival Conservatives in terms of the popular vote, but they hold an edge when it comes to winning seats in parliament.It remains unclear how the images will affect the prime minister, whose political career has benefited as much from his carefully curated public persona as from his policies.When asked by reporters if he would eject a member of his own party for a similar image, he said he wouldn’t entertain “hypotheticals” and that each incident would be viewed on a “case-by-case basis”.Asked why he should stay on as leader, Trudeau responded: “I’m asking Canadians to forgive me for what I did.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0883f10a11ac5e81e0c143ee790b95a6be85f412/634_422_6073_3644/master/6073.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f95febd79c51c5b19c4a02b6289549e0","title":"netanyahu urges rival gantz join him unity government","story":"Blue and White leader rejects offer to serve under Likud after close-run Israeli electionBenjamin Netanyahu is furiously manoeuvring to cling to office after his rival Benny Gantz refused to serve under him in a government of national unity following an inconclusive election.Neither bloc has an obvious path to form a majority coalition, and Netanyahu called for them to join together in a unity government, hinting that he might be willing to accept a power-sharing arrangement with Gantz, a precedent found in the rotation of the prime minister’s office between Yitzhak Shamir and Shimon Peres in the mid-1980s.Gantz, a former military chief, said he should lead the next government because his alliance won the most seats.“The country has chosen unity. The country has chosen Israel first,” Gantz said on Thursday. “Blue and White, headed by me, has won the election … I am interested in and intend to form a broad and liberal unity government, under my leadership. A government that will convey the will of the people. A paralysed national government does not benefit the people.”Moshe Ya’alon, a senior Blue and White figure, was blunt, telling reporters: “We will not enter a coalition led by Netanyahu.”Netanyahu said he was “surprised and disappointed” by the rejection.Bolstering his opponents’ case that the election was a referendum on the prime minister, polling suggested that Netanyahu and Likud had lost support in its former strongholds.While the struggle to form coalition governments has long been a feature of Israel’s fractious politics, it has been further complicated by the presence of the deeply polarising figure of Netanyahu.In two weeks’ time he will face pre-trial hearings for three corruption cases against him. A majority in the 120-seat parliament could help grant the 69-year-old – who denies any wrongdoing – immunity from prosecution.The Israeli PM is embroiled in four cases involving allegations of bribery and misconduct. He denies wrongdoing in every instance.Case 1000\u0026nbspis an investigation into gifts received on a regular basis by Netanyahu and his family from two wealthy businessmen, including cigars and pink champagne.Case 2000\u0026nbspis examining whether Netanyahu behaved improperly during a taped conversation with a newspaper publisher in which he appeared to try to negotiate more sympathetic coverage in return for lowering the circulation of a rival paper.Case 3000\u0026nbspis an inquiry into alleged kickbacks in a deal to buy German submarines. Netanyahu is not a suspect, but he was closely involved in the deal and the case has ensnared members of his inner circle.\u0026nbspCase 4000, the most serious,\u0026nbspinvolves allegations that Netanyahu offered incentives to the Israeli telecoms company Bezeq in exchange for positive stories in an online news website it owns, Walla.Netanyahu has worked hard to make sure that blame for the failure of a deal with Gantz – which would raise the prospects of an unprecedented third round of elections – is apportioned to his rival.While weeks of negotiations to form a coalition government lay ahead, conditions set by the parties could hobble the task within the allotted time, prompting a third election.Neither side appeared to be able to form a government of at least 61 seats without the support of the election’s apparent kingmaker, Avigdor Lieberman of the Yisrael Beitenu party.His insistence on a secular government would force out Netanyahu’s traditional allies, the country’s two ultra-Orthodox parties and another nationalist-religious party.Reuven Rivlin, the country’s president, promised on Thursday to do everything in his power to prevent a third election.The deadlock follows the second Israeli elections this year, which were called because Netanyahu failed to cobble together a coalition after the April vote. Israelis endured a caustic campaign with a combative Netanyahu fighting for his political survival.This week’s vote was largely seen as a referendum on Netanyahu, who this summer surpassed Israel’s founding prime minister to become the country’s longest-serving leader. During the campaign, Netanyahu cast himself as a seasoned statesman who was the only candidate able to steer Israel through a sea of challenges.Gantz, a former army chief, tried to paint Netanyahu as isive and scandal-plagued, offering himself as a calming influence and honest alternative."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0275850a0d81da6ed375530b2fee13cdba9f73b/0_374_5611_3367/master/5611.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0245eba545d03cbe22fa8ac80e46b300","title":"friday briefing for the greta good students lead climate strike","story":"Millions to take part in rallies … Brexit set for centre stage at Labour conference … and does being a woman help you swim the Chanel?Good morning and welcome to this Friday briefing with Alison Rourke.Millions of students are expected to walk out of their classrooms today calling for action on the climate emergency.

Corbyn has repeatedly declined to say which side he would campaign on, if any, at a potential second referendum, after pledging that as prime minister he would negotiate a better Brexit deal and put that to a public vote alongside the option of remain. The conference will take place in the shadow of the expected supreme court decision – promised by the president of the court for early next week – on the legality parliament being prorogued. The final arguments in the court yesterday afternoon hinged on who has the power to bring parliament back. In his closing submissions, Lord Pannick QC, representing the legal campaigner and businesswoman Gina Miller, said that if the supreme court found that Johnson had acted unlawfully but he declined to end the suspension of parliament then “in those circumstances we believe it would be open to the Speaker and Lord Speaker to reassemble parliament … as soon as possible next week”.Trump whistleblower – Reports that the president made worrying promises to a foreign leader gathered momentum overnight as Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, offered conflicting answers to questions on whether he (Giuliani) had asked Ukraine to investigate the former vice-president, and 2020 presidential hopeful, Joe Biden. At one point Guiliani, in an interview on CNN, dismissed the claim as ridiculous before admitting it and saying he was proud of it. The reports of Trump’s alleged promises so troubled a US intelligence official that it prompted a whistleblower complaint. The intelligence community inspector general, Michael Atkinson, determined that the whistleblower’s complaint was credible and troubling enough to be considered a matter of “urgent concern”, a legal threshold that requires notification of congressional oversight committees.Reporting rape – Thousands of allegations have been inaccurately recorded by the police over the past three years and in some cases never appeared in official figures, the  has revealed. A review of audits of 34 police forces published between August 2016 and July 2019 showed only three of them were found to have accurately recorded complaints of rape. Of the more than 4,900 audited rape reports, 552 were found to be inaccurate. Complainants with mental health and addiction issues and victims of trafficking were particularly vulnerable to being struck from the record by a number of police forces.Hobbit insect – New Zealand researchers have named an insect after JRR Tolkien’s famous character Frodo Baggins. The insect is smaller than its relations and is found in the country’s South Island, where The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit were filmed.

Women have been dominating outdoor endurance swimming for some time, and a combination of obvious and not-so-obvious factors shows that the average Channel crossing time for women is faster than that for men.In general, women have a greater distribution of slow-twitch muscle fibres, which – while less useful for explosive sprints – mean the body is more resistant to fatigue, and better at coping with feats of endurance. Women also have a higher distribution of fat in their lower body than men, resulting in better buoyancy in the water. This is of particular importance on a competitive swim across the Channel, where wetsuits are not permitted. Swimming is also a sport where technique is everything: it doesn’t matter how much you can bench press or how fast you can run if you can’t glide through the water with minimal effort. Then there’s the mental resilience, something that that sports scientists are increasingly seeing women excel at in endurance events, with Thomas dedicating her swim to fellow cancer survivors.George Ford and Owen Farrell have been named together in England’s starting XV for their Rugby World Cup opener against Tonga, with coach Eddie Jones opting for a first-choice side.

Like the famous literary character, the insect is smaller than its relations and is found in New Zealand’s South Island, the location where the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit movies were filmed.The Psylla frodobagginsi was identified by Francesco Martoni and Karen Armstrong, who examined the psyllid insects during research for Martoni’s PhD, with the New Zealand’s Bio-Protection Research Centre.It is not the first time Kiwi insects have been named after hobbits.

There are in fact two different varieties of psyllid: the Psylla apicalis and the slightly smaller Psylla frodobagginsi.For his PhD research, Martoni examined psyllids collected from kōwhai trees in 21 South Island locations and described consistent differences between two types, which allowed them to be classified as two distinct species.“Psylla frodobagginsi can be identified most easily by its small dimension, light colours, and uniformly spotted wings,” the authors wrote in their paper outlining the research.“Psylla frodobagginsi is smaller than P. apicalis, with males as small as 1.24 mm, compared to the 1.65mm of P. apicalis, and females as small as 1.56 mm, against the 2.03 mm of P.

Wu also said Taiwan “rejects and strongly condemns” Kiribati for disregarding the long-standing relationship and aid provided by Taiwan, reported CNA.Taiwan made the announcement before the Kiribati government formally announced its decision to cut ties with Taiwan in a pre-emptive move, as it did ahead of the Solomon Islands announcing their switch.The move will be a “significant blow” to Taiwan, says Jonathan Pryke, director of the Lowy Institute’s Pacific Islands Program. Self-ruled Taiwan has lost seven allies since 2016 since the election of president, Tsai Ing-wen, who is seeking re-election in January amid rising tension with China.“Another one bites the dust in the Pacific,” said Pryke. “It’s certainly not a good week for Taiwan, losing two of your remaining 17 diplomatic allies in one week, and two with the largest populations in the Pacific.”Taiwan has been a de facto sovereign nation since the end of a civil war in 1949, but China still views the island as its territory and has vowed to bring it under central control. Taiwan is self-ruled, but China considers it a wayward province and will not have diplomatic relations with any country that recognises Taiwan as a state.Over the decades, dozens of countries, including the US and most western nations, have switched recognition to Beijing, leaving just a handful of countries loyal to Taiwan, largely in Latin America and the Pacific.The south Pacific has been a diplomatic stronghold for Taiwan, where, until this week, formal ties with six island nations made up more than a third of its total alliances.Kiribati (pronounced Kiribas), a country of 115,000 people in the south Pacific, was the largest of Taiwan’s Pacific allies in terms of population after the Solomon Islands, a country of about 600,000 people, cut ties with the country earlier this week.Kiribati’s decision leaves Taiwan with four remaining Pacific allies: Tuvalu, Nauru, Palau and Marshall Islands as well as allies in the Caribbean and Latin America.China’s concerted attempt to peel allies away from Taipei could be seen putting pressure on Tsai, who is pro-Taiwanese sovereignty, ahead of the upcoming election in Taiwan in January.After the Solomon Islands cut ties with Taiwan, the US said it would consider cutting aid to the Solomon Islands in retribution. Gloria Steele, acting assistant administrator of USAID’s Asia bureau, told a House budget hearing: “We are reassessing our assistance to the Solomon Islands at this point.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4024041.1568910154!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"less food ordered when calorie count present on menus","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThis was the first scientific study to track consumers’ eye movement using an infrared camera as they read the menu, according to the ESRI’s behavioural research unit.People order less and consume fewer calories when information on the calorie content of their food is included on menus, new Irish research has established.But the extent to which they cut their consumption depends on where the calorie information is shown, according to a study by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI).It found that consumers given a menu where the calorie information was displayed just to the right of the price, in the same font and size, ordered 19 per cent fewer calories and ate 37 per cent fewer calories.This was the first scientific study to track consumers’ eye movement using an infrared camera as they read the menu, according to the ESRI’s behavioural research unit.One-third of the 142 consumers in the study were given a menu with no calorie information, one-third saw a menu with calorie labels placed between the description of the food and the price, and for one-third this information was placed to the right, after the price. Everything else on the menus was identical. Consumers given a menu with calorie labels placed to the right looked more at the labels. When asked later, they were also more likely to know how many calories were in the lunch.Critics of calorie posting have suggested it might make diners less likely to enjoy their food, but the study found no evidence of this. Diners shown calorie information rated their satisfaction with lunch at least as highly as those not shown the calories.Consumer behaviour“Our results show not only that calorie posting changes behaviour, but also that seemingly small changes to the format influence how well people understand and respond to the information,” said lead researcher Dr Deirdre Robertson of the ESRI. “As nothing else differed, we can be confident that the differences we found in consumer behaviour are due to the position of the calorie information on the menu.”Experiments of this type can be used to pre-test policies before they are implemented, she said.In 2015, the then government decided to bring in legislation requiring calorie information on menus after a voluntary scheme was widely ignored by food businesses.

Long’s republican background is proudly revealed in his front room, with bookcases stacked from floor to ceiling with volumes on “the cause”.This week Long was introduced to a new generation, many born after the Troubles were said to have been ended by the Belfast Agreement, on BBC’s Spotlight on the Troubles: A Secret History.In the documentary, the Limerick man said he had sat across the table from Gerry Adams at IRA army council meetings, despite Adams’s denials that he was ever a member of the paramilitary organisation.Long is no longer involved in paramilitary actions, but he supports those who are.“I do. I’d be telling lies if I said I supported anything else. There’s been a number of operations in the past couple of weeks, so there are still people at it.“As long as there are British soldiers in Ireland there’ll be people who would oppose them militarily. You can’t just say ‘Please leave our country’ – that doesn’t work. I feel you wouldn’t be going any place without a military campaign,” he says.Forty years on, he insists the British cannot be trusted.“You can talk to the Brits until you are blue in the face,” he says. “They’ll keep you talking and going around in circles.”One can “talk”, he says, but, “don’t have a truce”.Twenty years on from the Belfast Agreement, in the run-up to Brexit, Long knows he is in a minority. He does not care.“Fight and talk. When people read this, they’ll think I’m mad,” he says, with a shrug of his shoulders.British army watchtowers, once a feature of the Northern Irish landscape during the Troubles, can return at any stage, he says.“They may not be parading around in the streets, but they are here. They can get plane-loads of them over in hours.”In 1969 Long and others split from the Official IRA, forming a provisional army council during a meeting at a house in Victor Fagg’s house in Athlone, Co Westmeath.For 17 years, he was general secretary of the IRA executive.“I must be the longest ever,” he says.Later he was on the ardchomhairle of Sinn Féin, and on the National H-Block Committee.He split from Sinn Féin and Gerry Adams in 1986 – opposed to the party leadership’s initial attempts to persuade the IRA to give up its guns – to join Republican Sinn Féin.However, he left this group, too, in 2000 after differences emerged.Adams denialsAdams\u0027s denials infuriate Long, who bangs the table with his fist to show his feelings.By denying IRA membership, Adams betrays every IRA volunteer who fought for a united Ireland, Long argues.\u0026nbspHe looks distressed when he produces a newspaper article from 2013, with the headline ‘Those killed by IRA were murdered, says Adams’.He hopes he will witness a united Ireland: “I’m hoping it will happen in my lifetime, although I’m pushing on now. I’ll be 80 next May, if I live that long, unless somebody . . . Nobody wants to die, but sure we all have to die eventually.”He does not know, he says, if a united Ireland will come.“I never thought it would be easy.”However, old beliefs will not be abandoned now. “I’ll be a republican until the day I die. Whether people want me or not is another thing.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4022671.1568826278!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"much heat but little light in pursuit of brexit deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Boris Johnson has been told by EU leaders proposals must achieve the same effect as the backstop contained in the withdrawal treaty. Photograph: GettyOn Friday it will be 30 days since German chancellor Angela Merkel told Boris Johnson during a Berlin news conference that a solution to the Brexit impasse could maybe be found within 30 days.Johnson, seizing on her remarks, welcomed the “blistering timetable” and declared “Wir schaffen das” (“We will manage”) a “Yes we can!” type phrase previously used by Merkel about the refugee crisis.And off he went. On that swing through European capitals, Johnson seemed to impress Merkel and later French president Emmanuel Macron with his desire to agree a new deal with the EU. Last week, he did the same with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.But what Merkel and Macron, Varadkar and Jean Claude Juncker (don’t mention Xavier Bettel) and every other EU leader to whom he has spoken have said to Johnson is that those proposals must achieve the same effect as the backstop contained in the withdrawal treaty.But 29 days on, there has been no sign of British proposals which do anything of the sort. As EU leaders note with increasing irritation, nothing concrete has been tabled by the British government which could serve as a basis for negotiations with the EU.Neither have the British tabled workable solutions in the technical discussions that continue between Downing Street officials and the European Commission – meetings that Johnson now wants to intensify so that they take place every day. While Brussels sources wonder for what? A series of British ministers – most recently new Northern Secretary Julian Smith – have floated various ideas to Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, as reported in Wednesday’s .But several senior Irish sources are clear as a whistle on these ideas and concepts: none of them go remotely far enough towards establishing a workable alternative to the backstop. In other words, not alone are there no negotiations on a new deal going on, we are quite a distance away from the starting point for such negotiations. Speculation as to whether Johnson is serious about wanting a deal comes and goes in Dublin and in Brussels. Some politicians and officials expect British proposals to replace the backstop to be tabled late in the day, with a frantic period of negotiating against the deadline of a no-deal Brexit looming. Others say this is all just part of a strategy to avoid the blame for no deal. What, if anything, is taking shape? Johnson has claimed the shape of a deal is becoming clearer. And despite protestations it appears that if there is to be a deal it will be a Northern Ireland-specific solution that involves treating the North differently from the rest of the UK, in some respects. There may be a role for Stormont to give it democratic legitimacy in Northern Ireland. It will include an all-Ireland food and agriculture zone (eliminating the requirement for animals to be checked on the Border) and a series of measures such as a trusted-trader scheme, checks on goods at a business level and other arrangements designed to reduce cross-Border friction.However, senior Irish sources familiar with Government deliberations say that even if the details of these measures were worked out – and they are not – they would be insufficient to replace the backstop.That is because the position of Theresa May’s government – that it would eliminate the need for a border – has been junked by Johnson and replaced with a commitment to try to make the Border as frictionless as possible. That is a very big difference. And it will make a deal very difficult to reach. The mood in Dublin is growing more pessimistic.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

File Photograph: Nick BradshawThe  Thousands of students took to the streets of Australia and other Asia-Pacific countries on Friday to kick off a global strike demanding world leaders gathering for a UN Climate Action Summit adopt urgent measures to stop an environmental catastrophe.“We didn’t light it, but we’re trying to fight it,” read one sign carried by a student in Sydney, as social media posts showed huge demonstrations around the country including outback towns like Alice Springs.“The oceans are rising and so are we,” read another sign held by a protester wearing school uniform in Melbourne.Similar protests, inspired by the 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, are planned in some 150 countries on Friday. The aim is for students and others from around the world to speak in one voice about the impending effects of climate change on the planet.The strike will culminate in New York when Ms Thunberg, who has been nominated for a Nobel prize for her climate activism, will spearhead a rally at home of the United Nations headquarters.Ms Thunberg noted the “huge crowd” in Sydney in a tweet, which she said would set the standard as the strikes moved across Asia, Europe and Africa.By early afternoon, the Sydney protesters were overflowing out of a 34-hectare (84-acre) open space in the city. Similar crowds were reported in Brisbane and other state capitals.Danielle Porepilliasana, a Sydney high school student, had a blunt message for politicians like Australian Finance Minister Mathias Cormann, who told parliament on Thursday that students should stay in class.“World leaders from everywhere are telling us that students need to be at school doing work,” she said, wearing anti-coal earrings.“I’d like to see them at their parliaments doing their jobs for once.”The UN summit brings together world leaders to discuss climate change mitigation strategies, such as transitioning to renewable energy sources from fossil fuels.Rising sea levelsThe issue is particularly pertinent to low-lying Pacific islands, which have repeatedly asked wealthier nations to do more to prevent rising sea levels.Children in the Solomon Islands protested on the shoreline wearing traditional grass skirts and carrying wooden shields in solidarity with the global movement.In Thailand, more than 200 young people stormed into the environment ministry and dropped to the ground feigning death as they demanded government action on climate change.“This is what will happen if we don’t stop climate change now,” said 21-year-old strike organiser Nanticha Ocharoenchai.No protests were authorised in China, the world’s biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions, but Zheng Xiaowen of the China Youth Climate Action Network said Chinese youth would take action one way or another.“Chinese youth have their own methods,” she said.“We also pay attention the climate and we are also thinking deeply, interacting, taking action, and so many people are very conscientious on this issue.”Global warming caused by heat-trapping greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels has already led to droughts and heatwaves, melting glaciers, rising sea levels and floods, scientists say.Carbon emissions climbed a record high last year, despite a warning from the UN-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in October that output of the gases must be slashed over the next 12 years to stabilise the climate.Organisers said demonstrations would take different forms around the world, but all aim to promote awareness of climate change and demand political action to curb contributing factors to climate change. –ReutersHow is mankind affecting the global climate and what can be done about it?"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4024677.1568960721!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit secretary to meet eu negotiator michael barnier","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s secretary of state for exiting the European Union (Brexit Minister). File Photograph: Pierre-Philippe Marcou AFPGetty Images Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay will meet with the EU’s chief negotiator, Michael Barnier, in Brussels after Jean-Claude Juncker insisted “we can have a deal” before the Halloween deadline.Mr Barclay will head to Brussels for talks with Michel Barnier on Friday following the European Commission president’s warm words, which will have buoyed hopes in Downing Street.Mr Juncker said his meeting with Boris Johnson in Luxembourg on Monday was “rather positive” as he assured he was “doing everything to have a deal” to prevent a “catastrophic” no-deal Brexit.Speaking to Sky News, Mr Juncker said “we can have a deal”, but was unable to put the chances at more than 5050 when pressed.Mr Juncker said that he has no “emotional relationship” with the Irish backstop, which aims to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland but has been a major sticking point to getting a deal through Parliament.“If the objectives are met – all of them – then we don’t need the backstop,” he added.Mr Barclay’s department said he will meet with Mr Barnier to “take stock” following discussions between the PM’s Europe adviser David Frost and Taskforce 50 – the EU unit dealing with the UK’s departure.A day earlier, Mr Barnier spoke with Labour MPs Caroline Flint and Stephen Kinnock, who are key in cross-party efforts to get a deal through parliament.Mr Kinnock told BBC’s Newsnight that they left feeling “relatively, cautiously optimistic” after the Brussels meeting because of mounting pressure on the PM.He said that the negotiator made it clear that a Northern Ireland-only backstop remained on the table.The EU’s original proposal, which was objected to by the DUP, would see Northern Ireland remaining in the EU’s single market and customs union, but give Great Britain the freedom to strike trade deals.Also in the interview, Mr Barnier confirmed that he had received documents from Mr Johnson outlining draft ideas for a fresh Withdrawal Agreement late on Wednesday night.Non-papersDowning Street had said the UK has shared a series of “confidential technical non-papers” which reflect the ideas being put forward.Previously documents had been shown to Brussels officials, but then taken back at the end of meetings out of fears they would be leaked.But a “non-paper” is not a formal Government position and falls far short of what has been demanded by Brussels.Mr Johnson was under pressure from Finnish prime minister Antti Rinne to formally outline his plans to the EU by the end of September.Mr Rinne told reporters after meeting French president Emmanuel Macron that they “agreed that it is now time for Boris Johnson to produce his own proposals in writing – if they exist”.The UK government insisted Mr Johnson will not be bound by an “artificial deadline” to produce formal written proposals to resolve the Brexit deadlock.Mr Johnson said progress was being made, but the extent of it should not be exaggerated.“You heard Jean-Claude Juncker yesterday say that he doesn’t have any emotional attachment to the backstop,” Mr Johnson said.“Now that is progress – they weren’t saying that a month ago.”But Tánaiste Simon Coveney said a “big gap” remains between the UK and the bloc.“And in order to close that gap we need to get credible proposals from the British government which we simply haven’t received yet,” he said.Ahead of Friday’s meeting, Mr Barclay warned the EU against a “rigid” approach and suggested the final details of an alternative to the Irish backstop may not need to be resolved until the end of 2020.Mr Barclay said the Mr Johnson had shown he was willing to be “creative and flexible” by considering an all-Ireland approach to plant and animal checks, and suggested that it was now for the European Commission to shift its stance. – PA"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons september 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter -

The aluminium came in several colours, including rose gold, while the stainless steel came in the natural silvery colour you’d expect, plus Space Black and Gold.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

These include a new metal finish: titanium. It is lighter than – and a little more expensive – than the stainless-steel options and is very attractive. Especially in the Space Black option.Then there’s a return to the ceramic finish not seen since Apple Watch Series 3. It looks sensational: gleaming white and almost glowing, it’s so shiny.But the case is not the real reason this Apple Watch looks so different. That’s down to the new display which gives rise to a new feature: an always-on screen.Unlike regular watches, smart watches tend to conserve battery by turning off the display when you’re not actually looking at it. It makes sense, right? So to wake the display, you must raise your arm. The Apple Watch has always done this raise-to-wake action perfectly, better than rivals, but it still leaves you with that occasional moment when flicking your wrist leaves the display dormant.Now, with the low-temperature poly-silicon and oxide display (abbreviated, thankfully, to LTPO), Apple has devised a way to keep the screen on all the time.iPhone 11 review reveals eye-catching upgrade for AppleSo, you can sneak a glance at the time in a dull meeting without having to twist your wrist revealingly, for instance. Or look at the Watch when it’s facing downwards, where it previously would have switched off.This sounds like such a small thing, but in practice I’ve found it to be a real game-changer.It takes a little getting used to because Apple has organised it so the display dims when you’re not looking at it, though is still entirely visible. It’s very cleverly crafted so it’s not just a matter of turning down the brightness: each Watch face has been optimised so certain elements fade out altogether in the less bright state, or change to a darker colour. Without moving your wrist, you can see the dimmed state raise your arm and it’s back to full brightness and full-on design.It’s the key feature on the new Watch and it works brilliantly.Edelson  AFP)There are new Watch faces to go with the new hardware, including some exclusive to the new Series 5.The other major new hardware in the Watch is a compass. I can hear you snorting in derision, but it’s actually plenty useful. That’s because it can be integrated into apps. For instance, when you’re looking for a restaurant on Yelp and you don’t know which way you should head on the street, take a look at the arrow on the Yelp Watch app. As you turn, the arrow turns with you, so the right direction to head in is unmistakable.It’s also useful in outdoors situations, or if you just fancy knowing your current elevation, longitude, latitude and incline. A bit geeky but quite cool.Much of the rest of the Watch is the same as Series 4. Why didn’t Apple upgrade the processor? Probably because the speed increase it got last time around was enough to last for a while or perhaps the power use optimisation needed for an always-on display may have made this the best configuration.There are new apps in the latest watchOS 6 software, such as a handy Noise app which warns you when the environment you’re in could be too loud for your ears to endure.The Watch has always been about health and fitness and other additions include menstrual cycle tracking for women and the ability to track trends in your activity over a longer period of time. Of course, the heart rate monitor and ECG capabilities of Series 4 are on board here, too.A word about Series 3. Although Series 4 has been retired, the excellent Series 3 first launched in 2017 has had a huge price cut and now starts at £199. This is phenomenal value for such a capable smartwatch. You don’t get the sumptuously big screen or ECG features of Series 5, for instance, but it’s a great first Apple Watch.The Series 5 Watch starts at £399 for the smaller, 40mm case in aluminium or £429 for the larger, 44mm case. Add £100 if you want cellular connectivity so you can make phone calls even when your iPhone is at home.One other thing worth mentioning: Apple is all about personalisation this year. Not only are there more case options than ever before – I didn’t even mention the special editions with Nike and Hermès – but it’s now possible to mix and match the Watch and band you prefer with much greater choice.The always-on feature is the marquee upgrade on this Watch and it’s tremendous. It doesn’t affect battery life, that’s still well over a day. Until last week, Series 4 was the best smartwatch on the market by a country mile. Series 5 puts Apple further ahead of its rivals.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He should announce a significant stimulus package of tax cuts and spending increases to support households in the face of a no-deal economic shock, as well as measures to help firms through the temporary turbulence many are likely to face.Tesla takes on Porsche\u0026nbspElon Musk\u0027s electric car company wants to take on the engineering might of Porsche by beating it in a time trial around Germany\u0027s fables Nuerburgring race track.\u0026nbspTesla\u0027s Model S recorded an unofficial time that was faster than Porsche\u0027s rival electric car, the Taycan, according to Germany\u0027s Auto Motor und Sport.\u0026nbspAn official record attempt for four-door electric cars is set for this Saturday.

Even so, the think tank warns the measures will inevitably fall far short of eliminating the economic damage of an abrupt exit.\u0026nbspThe scale of recommended spending is much larger than the amount the already-indebted government can borrow in the 2020-21 fiscal year without breaking its self-imposed borrowing limit.\u0026nbspHere\u0027s the full story from Olesya Dmitracova:\u0026nbspBrexit: Boris Johnson urged to spend £60bn to limit impact of no dealDiageo warns over global trade tensions\u0026nbspThe world\u0027s largest maker of alcoholic drinks has warned that it is not immune from changes to global trade policy.\u0026nbspDiageo, which owns hundreds of well-known brands such as Smirnoff, Guiness and Moet \u0026amp Chandon, said it would continue to closely monitor any movement in tariffs.\u0026nbspEuropean luxury goods including whisky, Champagne and wine, face new tariffs on exports to the US, after Donald Trump\u0027s latest trade salvo was deemed legal by the World Trade Organisation.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The reason for this discrepancy lies in the different inflation metrics used, the think tank says.When estimating GDP, or the value of national output, government statisticians adjust it for inflation, applying what is known as the GDP deflator. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says it is the broadest measure of inflation in the UK economy, reflecting changes in the price of all goods and services that make up GDP, whether or not they involve consumers.When fine-tuning GDP in its own analysis, the NEF used a narrower measure of inflation – one that tracks changes\u0026nbsponly in consumer prices, including the costs of owning and maintaining a home.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A surfer in action during sunrise at Tynemouth on the north east coastProtesters dressed as the Incredible Hulk and Robocop outside the Supreme Court in London where judges are due to consider legal challenges to Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u0027s decision to suspend Parliament.

Analysis of incomes of people born between 1920s and 1990s revealed that, up until those born in the 1970s, each generation has tended to be better-off than people born a decade earlier were at the same age.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Will consumers continue to be resilient in the face of Brexit uncertainty?\u0026nbspNext boss Lord Wolfson has told the PA news agency that he will cut prices by around 2 per cent if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.£60bn of government support needed to reduce damage of no-deal, says think tank\u0026nbspThe government should deliver a £40bn stimulus package of additional public spending and tax cuts to soften the blow of a no-deal Brexit, the Resolution Foundation has said.\u0026nbspAccording to the think tank, a further £20bn should be offered to help companies deal with trade disruption.\u0026nbspJames Smith, research director of the Resolution Foundation, said:\u0026nbspThe Government says it wants to leave the EU with a deal, but has also made it clear that it is prepared to leave without one.\u0026nbspThe Government and Bank of England therefore need to be ready to respond with a bold package of measures to limit the damage to households and firms of a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspUnlike in the past, the Chancellor will need to take the lead in this response. He should announce a significant stimulus package of tax cuts and spending increases to support households in the face of a no-deal economic shock, as well as measures to help firms through the temporary turbulence many are likely to face.Tesla takes on Porsche\u0026nbspElon Musk\u0027s electric car company wants to take on the engineering might of Porsche by beating it in a time trial around Germany\u0027s fables Nuerburgring race track.\u0026nbspTesla\u0027s Model S recorded an unofficial time that was faster than Porsche\u0027s rival electric car, the Taycan, according to Germany\u0027s Auto Motor und Sport.\u0026nbspAn official record attempt for four-door electric cars is set for this Saturday. Neurburgring records have frequently been used by\u0026nbspas a marketing tool by car makers who claim that they are a demonstration of technical superiority.\u0026nbspSuch bragging rights will\u0026nbspbe much-prized by Mr Musk, an early entrant into the electric car business who is now facing competition from the likes of Audi, Mercedes and BMW as they launch their own models.The OECD also says that Brexit will slash 3 per cent of UK GDP over the next three years.\u0026nbspBy contrast, the EU faces just a 0.6 per cent hit.\u0026nbsp“The best thing is to avoid a no-deal Brexit and to stay as closely aligned to the EU as possible,” says\u0026nbspLaurence Boone, the OECD’s chief economist.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0027Persistently low growth\u0027\u0026nbspThe OECD\u0027s assessment is pretty bleak, particularly about the impact of trade tensions surrounding Brexit and Donald Trump\u0027s tariff war.\u0026nbspThe economic outlook is deteriorating, for both advanced and emerging economies, and global growth may remain stuck at a persistently low level in the absence of strong policy measures.The exacerbation of trade conflicts is increasingly weighing on confidence and investment, which increases policy uncertainty, exacerbates capital market risks, and jeopardizes the already weak growth that is taking place. draws in perspective on a global scale.\u0026nbspDebenhams wins court battle against Mike Ashley\u0027s Sports Direct\u0026nbspDebenhams\u0027 programme of store closures will go ahead under a CVA insolvency process as planned after the department store chain won a case in the High Court brought by Sports Direct.\u0026nbspMike Ashley\u0027s firm and a number Debenhams\u0027 landlords had challenged the terms of the turnaround plan,\u0026nbspwhich saw rents on stores slashed and the value of Sports Direct\u0027s\u0026nbspstake in Debenhams wiped out.Bank of England interest rates decision\u0026nbspThe BoE\u0027s Monetary Policy Committee has left its benchmark rate on hold at 0.75 per cent, as expected.\u0026nbspThe MPC\u0027s nine members voted unanimously in favour of keeping rates where they were.Bank of England interest rates decision\u0026nbspThe BoE\u0027s Monetary Policy Committee has left its benchmark rate on hold at 0.75 per cent, as expected.\u0026nbspThe MPC\u0027s nine members voted unanimously in favour of keeping rates where they were.Interest rate reaction\u0026nbspThe BoE has a tricky balancing act on its hands when it comes to future interest rate decisions, says\u0026nbspPwC chief economist John Hawksworth.On the one hand, the tight labour market has pushed earnings growth up to around 4 per cent\u0026nbspat a time when productivity growth remains very subdued.\u0026nbspThe consequent increase in unit labour costs might normally cause the MPC to consider edging interest rates up to head off potential future inflationary pressures, even though current inflation is slightly below target.\u0026nbspBut offsetting this will be the dampening effect of Brexit-related uncertainty on UK business investment and the housing market.

Even so, the think tank warns the measures will inevitably fall far short of eliminating the economic damage of an abrupt exit.\u0026nbspThe scale of recommended spending is much larger than the amount the already-indebted government can borrow in the 2020-21 fiscal year without breaking its self-imposed borrowing limit.\u0026nbspHere\u0027s the full story from Olesya Dmitracova:\u0026nbspBrexit: Boris Johnson urged to spend £60bn to limit impact of no dealDiageo warns over global trade tensions\u0026nbspThe world\u0027s largest maker of alcoholic drinks has warned that it is not immune from changes to global trade policy.\u0026nbspDiageo, which owns hundreds of well-known brands such as Smirnoff, Guiness and Moet \u0026amp Chandon, said it would continue to closely monitor any movement in tariffs.\u0026nbspEuropean luxury goods including whisky, Champagne and wine, face new tariffs on exports to the US, after Donald Trump\u0027s latest trade salvo was deemed legal by the World Trade Organisation.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is particularly unacceptable that children growing up in the poorest areas of the country and children with special educational needs are most likely to leave school without reaching basic levels of attainment,” Anne Longfield, the children’s commissioner for England, said.The commissioner has written to the Department for Education and asked it to commit to halving the number of children failing to gain a Level 2 qualification by the age of 19 over the next five years.Climate change and mental illness among ‘biggest threats’ to childrenLast year, of the total 554,938 education leavers, 98,779 did not achieve this qualification by age 19.“The government must urgently investigate why the progress that has been made over recent years in closing the attainment gap has stalled and now going backwards,” Ms Longfield added.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The One with the Lesbian WeddingThe academic points to Schwimmer’s\u0026nbspbackground in theatre (which he studied at Northwestern University in Chicago), which she links to his awareness of the opportunities and challenges that present themselves when filming a multi-camera series such as\u0026nbspFriends, and his ability to manage them in front of a live audience.Friends creators reveal which storylines they regretFriends\u0027 Maggie Wheeler on Janice and Chandler\u0027s hypothetical childA look inside the highly anticipated Friends pop-up“This is particularly visible in Ross’s many slapstick moments in which Schwimmer’s strength of physicality, vocal delivery and comic timing are used particularly well,” she adds.Dr Knox points to the 11th episode of the show’s fifth season, “The One With All The Resolutions”, to illustrate Schwimmer’s comedic skills.In this episode, Ross wears a pair of leather trousers on a date but ends up feeling too hot. He goes to the bathroom, where he intends to take off the garment for just a moment – only to find out that it’s impossible for him to pull the trousers back up.What follows is a sequence of about three minutes that captures Ross’s frantic efforts to get back in his trousers (using a combination of powder and lotion), which fail miserably.\u0026nbspIn this moment, says Dr Knox, “Schwimmer realises the slapstick and heightened physical comedy through not only strong physical skills – embarrassment is often explicitly hinged around Ross’s physicality and the materiality of his being – but also nuanced acting choices grounded in realism and naturalism, asking his audience to relate to Ross’s only too human dilemmas, which works to support the programme’s strategy of intimacy.”Friends: A Reading of the Sitcom\u0026nbspwill be\u0026nbspreleased\u0026nbspon 7 October\u0026nbspthrough\u0026nbspPalgrave\u0026nbspMacmillan.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That includes new features like improved multi-tasking, a re-designed home screen and more.When the new iPhone update arrivesThis is the first year that Apple has split the operating systems for iPhone and iPad into separate releases, with the latter being referred to as iPadOS. That has presumably allowed the company to more easily stagger the different releases.And it will not be until 30 September that Apple TV gets its own software update, too. That update, named tvOS 13, will bring support for multiple users as well as the ability to use Xbox and PS4 controllers with Apple\u0027s set-top box.Apple presumably could not delay the release of iOS 13 for iPhones in the same way as the Apple TV and iPad because the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro will be released this week, and they needed a stable version of the new software to ship on them.The company did unveil a new iPad at its September event, when the new iPhones were shown off, but that device will not ship until 30 September.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The youngest was Dizzee Rascal, who received the award in 2003 aged 19, for his debut Boy in Da Corner.In his acceptance speech, Dave said: “I don’t know what to say. I want to thank god, I want to invite my mum up on stage. I want to thank everyone that made this happen, all the exceptional musicians that performed tonight.“I did not expect this... I wanna thank my brother Christopher who inspired this album, this is your story...

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 460 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.560 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1360 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1460 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1760 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2160 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2760 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2960 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3160 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3660 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4360 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. The record frequently switches in tone: Banks can be both formidable and vulnerable, accusatory or filled with regret. “Gimme” demands sex and refuses to be shamed for it “Contaminated” mourns a toxic relationship that can’t be saved and “Stroke” is a bitter riposte to a man emulating the Greek figure Narcissus – laid over a funk guitar riff.4560 Mini Mansions – Guy Walks into a BarMikey Shuman shares vocal duties with Tyler Parkford his voice falls somewhere between the sleazy drawl of his QOTSA bandmate Josh Homme and Alex Turner’s more adenoidal tone on opener “We Should Be Dancing”. With tracks that frequently dart from sprawling, psychedelic pop to scuzzy post-punk and rock references, the record has a superb dynamic that holds the listener’s attention, while the band navigate through a single, tumultuous relationship. By the end of all that, you feel like they deserve a pint. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Hackman’s debut album, 2015’s We Slept At Last, was a gentle, unprovocative affair –  though if you listened closely, the dark, sexual energy that convulses through her current sound was already there. Her second, I’m Not Your Man, was scuzzier and more explicitly queer – a road she continues down with Any Human Friend, a blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals.Frontman Corey Taylor, who had just emerged from a toxic relationship when recording this album, addresses feelings of belittlement and inadequacy with unflinching honesty and some of his best vocal work in years. Over the Celtic influences of “Solway Firth” (at one point, he seems to attempt some Cockney screamo) he issues a blistering riposte to the people he holds responsible for his negative mindset.There’s an increased anxiety, both corporeal and emotional, running through The Center Won’t Hold, a pent-up desire to break free from something – though they never seem quite sure what. “Disconnect me from my bones, so I can float, so I can roam,” sings Brownstein – her singular voice all yelps and creaks – on “Hurry On Home”. On “Reach Out”, Tucker begs, her voice a little sleeker than Brownstein’s but no less commanding, “Reach out and see me, I’m losing my head.” Quietly discordant piano ballad “Broken” pays tribute to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused supreme court judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault: “Me, me too, my body cried out when she spoke those lines.”The overarching sound, production and instrumentation on Eve are outstanding. Produced by Rapsody’s long-time collaborator and mentor 9th Wonder, the record samples cuts from Herbie Hancock’s “Watermelon Man” (“Whoopi”) and Phil Collins’s “In the Air Tonight” (“Cleo”), offers a smooth R\u0026ampB joint with “Aaliyah” featuring the late singer’s ghostly backing vocals, and includes an interlude that is “an ode to the black woman’s body”. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as closer “Afeni”, are pure soul.  Swift has a habit of putting her worst foot forward. The album’s lead single, “Me!”, is peppy and poppy in all the wrong ways, a rictus grin of a song that rings hollow. Thank goodness that the rest of the album is nothing like that. Perky opening track “Forgot That You Existed” is a syncopated snigger, on which Swift shrugs off old grudges and breathes a sigh of relief in doing so. “Something magical happened one night,” she sings. “I forgot that you existed. And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn’t.” The title track, meanwhile, is poignant and unfussy, a reminder of Swift’s ability to distil infatuation into something specific and universal. (Alexandra Pollard)One could argue that there’s too much eclecticism here – that if this really is Crow’s final LP, she perhaps could have gone for something with a more singular sound. But then it wouldn’t be a Sheryl Crow album. She sings about the fear of the unknown on “Flying Blind” – her steely determination on this record has you believing that she’ll take the leap regardless. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)There’s more of a soul influence here – “HER Love”, the counterpoint to his 1994 track “I Used to Love HER”,  benefits from the gospel-like vocals of Daniel Caesar and Dwele, while “Memories of Home” skitters over a muffled bass and Common’s recollections of his past – including an incident where he was molested by a family member.This is Del Rey at her most assertive – personally, if not politically. Those hoping for a barbed protest record in keeping with Del Rey’s newfound public activism (last year she called President Trump a “narcissist” who “believes it’s OK to grab a woman by the pussy just because he’s famous”) will be disappointed. But it is gratifying to hear her take control. Aside from “Happiness Is a Butterfly”, that is. “If he’s a serial killer, then what’s the worst that can happen to a girl who’s already hurt?” she asks. Crikey.Assisted by veteran producer John Congleton (St Vincent, John Grant), he channels the spirit of David Bowie and Iggy Pop. He screeches over distorted “ooh oohs” via The Rolling Stones’s “Sympathy for the Devil” on opener “Calm Down aka I Should Not Be Alone”. “Transition from Nowhere to Nowhere” is sung in a Ziggy Stardust croon, while “Rated R Crusaders” shows Furman exploring his Jewish identity in the era of the IsraelPalestine conflict.If Brothers, their brawny album from 2010, turned the pair into serious rock contenders, then 2011’s El Camino cemented their reputation. Yet neither can claim to be as fiendishly catchy as Let’s Rock, a record that can scarcely sit still. On opener “Shine a Light”, the riffs are big, the momentum irresistible, with frontmanguitarist Dan Auerbach layering scabrous licks over ACDC-like chords. Backing singers Leisa Hans and Ashley Wilcoxson add texture to the grooving “LoHi”, while the languid “Sit Around and Miss You” is Stealers Wheels by way of the Deep South. Listen to the melodic harmonies in “Tell Me Lies” and it’s not just the lyrics that’ll remind you of Fleetwood Mac. The tones here are stark and bleak, compared to the claustrophobia of 2014’s Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes. You can hear his paranoia in the stuttering techno opener “Traffic”, which channels the heady grooves and pulses of electronic artist Floating Points (who, with his neuroscience background, seems like an entirely fitting reference point).There are plenty of surprises, like Swizz Beats singing on “Who Are You” against elegant violins that recall a Kamasi Washington composition. “Adult Film” features a gorgeous piano riff the Pete Rock-produced “The Art of It” has a delicious funk vibe “It Never Ends” comes full circle via a bright piano loop. Where a full album produced by Kanye West (2018’s Nasir) didn’t pan out – perhaps because West’s perfectionism was a bad fit for Nas’s penchant for procrastination – “You Mean the World to Me” sounds like it would have been a standout on that record had it not been abandoned on the cutting-room floor. Now it’s a standout on this album. For all the album’s eccentricities, the vibe is earnest fairytale rather than tongue-in-cheek – save for the sound of a strangled feline mirroring the lyrics “when you stepped on your cat” on “How Many Times”. Epic highlight “Electric Fire” and celestial album-closer “How Can a Head” capture Coyne at his most wistful. The latter is a wide-eyed, strings-laden gem, its childlike, questing lyrics poignant whatever your age. 5960 Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsGiven our current preoccupation with the Eighties, you could argue that Lost Girls is hardly breaking new ground – and yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. Three of her past albums have been nominated for Mercurys expect this to make it four. (Patrick Smith)6060 MUNA – Saves the WorldMUNA might not be a household name yet, but their influence runs through the charts like a stick of rock these days. Listen to Katy Perry’s summer smash “Never Really Over”, or Taylor Swift’s feminist clap back “The Man”, and you’ll hear the same dense, sticky synths and brawny beats that the emo-pop trio have been honing for the past three years. Their debut album, 2017’s About U, was raw, poignant and just the ride side of melodramatic, queering the mainstream, one sad-pop anthem at a time.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 460 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.560 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1360 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1460 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1760 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2160 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2760 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2960 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3160 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released.

On “Reach Out”, Tucker begs, her voice a little sleeker than Brownstein’s but no less commanding, “Reach out and see me, I’m losing my head.” Quietly discordant piano ballad “Broken” pays tribute to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused supreme court judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault: “Me, me too, my body cried out when she spoke those lines.”The overarching sound, production and instrumentation on Eve are outstanding. Produced by Rapsody’s long-time collaborator and mentor 9th Wonder, the record samples cuts from Herbie Hancock’s “Watermelon Man” (“Whoopi”) and Phil Collins’s “In the Air Tonight” (“Cleo”), offers a smooth R\u0026ampB joint with “Aaliyah” featuring the late singer’s ghostly backing vocals, and includes an interlude that is “an ode to the black woman’s body”.

(Roisin O\u0027Connor)There’s more of a soul influence here – “HER Love”, the counterpoint to his 1994 track “I Used to Love HER”,  benefits from the gospel-like vocals of Daniel Caesar and Dwele, while “Memories of Home” skitters over a muffled bass and Common’s recollections of his past – including an incident where he was molested by a family member.This is Del Rey at her most assertive – personally, if not politically. Those hoping for a barbed protest record in keeping with Del Rey’s newfound public activism (last year she called President Trump a “narcissist” who “believes it’s OK to grab a woman by the pussy just because he’s famous”) will be disappointed. But it is gratifying to hear her take control. Aside from “Happiness Is a Butterfly”, that is. “If he’s a serial killer, then what’s the worst that can happen to a girl who’s already hurt?” she asks. Crikey.Assisted by veteran producer John Congleton (St Vincent, John Grant), he channels the spirit of David Bowie and Iggy Pop. He screeches over distorted “ooh oohs” via The Rolling Stones’s “Sympathy for the Devil” on opener “Calm Down aka I Should Not Be Alone”. “Transition from Nowhere to Nowhere” is sung in a Ziggy Stardust croon, while “Rated R Crusaders” shows Furman exploring his Jewish identity in the era of the IsraelPalestine conflict.If Brothers, their brawny album from 2010, turned the pair into serious rock contenders, then 2011’s El Camino cemented their reputation. Yet neither can claim to be as fiendishly catchy as Let’s Rock, a record that can scarcely sit still. On opener “Shine a Light”, the riffs are big, the momentum irresistible, with frontmanguitarist Dan Auerbach layering scabrous licks over ACDC-like chords. Backing singers Leisa Hans and Ashley Wilcoxson add texture to the grooving “LoHi”, while the languid “Sit Around and Miss You” is Stealers Wheels by way of the Deep South. Listen to the melodic harmonies in “Tell Me Lies” and it’s not just the lyrics that’ll remind you of Fleetwood Mac. The tones here are stark and bleak, compared to the claustrophobia of 2014’s Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes. You can hear his paranoia in the stuttering techno opener “Traffic”, which channels the heady grooves and pulses of electronic artist Floating Points (who, with his neuroscience background, seems like an entirely fitting reference point).There are plenty of surprises, like Swizz Beats singing on “Who Are You” against elegant violins that recall a Kamasi Washington composition. “Adult Film” features a gorgeous piano riff the Pete Rock-produced “The Art of It” has a delicious funk vibe “It Never Ends” comes full circle via a bright piano loop. Where a full album produced by Kanye West (2018’s Nasir) didn’t pan out – perhaps because West’s perfectionism was a bad fit for Nas’s penchant for procrastination – “You Mean the World to Me” sounds like it would have been a standout on that record had it not been abandoned on the cutting-room floor. Now it’s a standout on this album. For all the album’s eccentricities, the vibe is earnest fairytale rather than tongue-in-cheek – save for the sound of a strangled feline mirroring the lyrics “when you stepped on your cat” on “How Many Times”. Epic highlight “Electric Fire” and celestial album-closer “How Can a Head” capture Coyne at his most wistful. The latter is a wide-eyed, strings-laden gem, its childlike, questing lyrics poignant whatever your age. 5960 Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsGiven our current preoccupation with the Eighties, you could argue that Lost Girls is hardly breaking new ground – and yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. Three of her past albums have been nominated for Mercurys expect this to make it four. (Patrick Smith)6060 MUNA – Saves the WorldMUNA might not be a household name yet, but their influence runs through the charts like a stick of rock these days. Listen to Katy Perry’s summer smash “Never Really Over”, or Taylor Swift’s feminist clap back “The Man”, and you’ll hear the same dense, sticky synths and brawny beats that the emo-pop trio have been honing for the past three years. Their debut album, 2017’s About U, was raw, poignant and just the ride side of melodramatic, queering the mainstream, one sad-pop anthem at a time.In its five-star review of the album The Independent said: “A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity.“On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album.”Dave is the figurehead for a hopeful generation on his debut albumDave made his acting debut in the third series of Top Boy, which was released in September 2019 on Netflix. He appeared at Glastonbury Festival in June, performing with headliner Stormzy and also for his own set on the West Holts Stage.Albums by British and Irish artists with a UK release date between 21 July 2018 and 19 July 2019 were eligible for nomination, with more than 200 submitted.The judges for this year’s prize were: BBC Radio 1 DJ Annie Mac, Clara Amfo, Danielle Perry (broadcaster \u0026amp writer), Gaz Coombes, Jamie Cullum, Jeff Smith (head of music, 6 Music \u0026amp Radio 2), Jorja Smith, Mike Walsh (head of music, Radio X), Phil Alexander (creative director, Kerrang!contributing editor, Mojo), Stormzy, Tshepo Mokoena (editorial director, Vice), Will Hodgkinson (chief rock \u0026amp pop critic, The Times).

Analysis of a 74-year-old\u0026nbspA.\u0026nbspsligoi\u0026nbspspecimen that once lived at London Zoo revealed its distinct genetic code and it is this species that is thought to be the largest of the three.Sixteen other specimens collected in the early 20th century were also examined.“It’s amazing in this day and age that it took until now to work out what the world’s largest amphibian is,” the study’s lead author Samuel Turvey, a conservation scientist at ZSL, told National Geographic.Created with Sketch.Science news in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.120 Turtle embryos influence sex by shakingThe sex of the turtle is determined by the temperatures at which they are incubated.

Habitat loss and poaching also pose severe threats.‘Frozen Dragon of the North’: New species of flying creature foundWhile millions are now kept on farms, these appear to overwhelmingly be members of the most common species, while wild populations are at great risk of extinction.“These findings come at a time where urgent interventions are required to save Chinese giant salamanders in the wild,” said Melissa Marr, a PhD researcher at the Natural History Museum.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe new discoveries shed light on the possibility that previous conservation efforts to release farmed salamanders into the wild would have had a negative impact upon wild populations of the other species, increasing the risk of disease, competition and genetic hybridisation.\u0026nbsp“Our results indicate that tailored conservation measures should be put in place that preserve the genetic integrity of each distinct species,” Ms Marr said.In 2016, London Zoo welcomed four young giant salamanders seized by border police after someone tried to illegally import them into the UK.Three are still being cared for behind the scenes while one, named Professor Lew, can be seen by the public. Zookeepers hope to one day introduce another animal to Professor Lew as a mate.Scientists believe that in light of the recent study, published on Monday in Ecology and Evolution, future conservation efforts could\u0026nbspinvolve\u0026nbspscreening farmed giant salamanders to determine their species before encouraging them to mate and reintroducing\u0026nbspthem into the wild among their own species.Dr Turvey added:\u0026nbsp“We hope that this new understanding of their species ersity has arrived in time to support their successful conservation, but urgent measures are required to protect any viable giant salamander populations that might remain.”Additional reporting by PAShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” 334 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”“Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 534 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” 634 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”“You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” “West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” 934 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” 1434 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.1734 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.2034 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.2234 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.Joseph is almost never out of shot, whether seen from afar, contemplating a bottle of strong cider in a playground, or in visceral close-up, clutching his doner to his face. There are few actors you could trust with so much screen time, especially with such a pared back and naturalistic script. The fact any of it is remotely watchable is testament to Stephen Graham’s abilities. No man working in Britain today can drink a pint with more pathos.\u0027Good Omens is a hugely enjoyable, imaginative premiere, as close to Pratchett’s vision as anyone could have dared dream. And while the melancholy tone may not be for everyone, fans of the book will surely be sated.\u00272534 Years and YearsYears and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.As the series develops, it’s clearer than ever that Eve and Villanelle are more similar than they are different. Villanelle’s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle’s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-theywon’t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.Timely, bleak, intelligent and compelling, Chernobyl is a triumph of a disaster.Season three\u0027s knuckle-whitening finale is far less disappointing than the last.The writing is sharp and well observed, probing the fault lines between small talk and real problems.A touching tribute to a flawed reality TV star.Despite the strength of its ensemble cast, Succession is a feat of writing above all. Although it is ostensibly a business show, you won’t learn much about the minutiae of media deals by watching it. Its key dynamic, between father and children, means that it is limited in the amount that can actually happen without risking the magic. The writers, led by the creator Jesse Armstrong, who also gave us Peep Show, weave just-about-plausible and sympathetic characters from a web of insults and backstabbing, and tight editing and camerawork ratchets up tension from a slow-moving plot.In Kathy Burke’s All Women on Channel 4, the unapologetic, effing-and-blinding, salt-of-the-earth actor meets lots of different women – from nuns to reality stars – to understand what it means to be a member of the fairer sex, so to speak, in 2019.So here we have an intriguing, but rather flawed sort of Big Brother thriller set in our contemporary world of digital snooping, near constant surveillance and (a topical touch) widespread use of facial recognition technology.Top Boy can be bleak and violent, with dialogue so naturalistic that it verges on the impenetrable, but in telling stories that rarely get heard, it asks us to think differently about the city we live in.“As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” 234 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”. There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” 334 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”“Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 534 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” 634 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”“You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” “West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” 934 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” 1434 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.1734 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.2034 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.2234 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes.

The reason for this discrepancy lies in the different inflation metrics used, the think tank says.When estimating GDP, or the value of national output, government statisticians adjust it for inflation, applying what is known as the GDP deflator. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says it is the broadest measure of inflation in the UK economy, reflecting changes in the price of all goods and services that make up GDP, whether or not they involve consumers.When fine-tuning GDP in its own analysis, the NEF used a narrower measure of inflation – one that tracks changes\u0026nbsponly in consumer prices, including the costs of owning and maintaining a home.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A surfer in action during sunrise at Tynemouth on the north east coastProtesters dressed as the Incredible Hulk and Robocop outside the Supreme Court in London where judges are due to consider legal challenges to Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u0027s decision to suspend Parliament.

Analysis of incomes of people born between 1920s and 1990s revealed that, up until those born in the 1970s, each generation has tended to be better-off than people born a decade earlier were at the same age.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Friendship with the White HouseTrudeau\u0027s gender-balanced cabinet was the first of its kindMr Trudeau, 47, eldest son of the late prime minister Pierre Trudeau, and who was first elected premier in 2015, has been on the back foot since the first images emerged this week.

Asked how many incidents there may have been, he replied: “I’m wary of being definitive about this because the recent pictures that came out I had not remembered.”He said he had already shared “the moments I recollected”, adding:\u0026nbsp“But I recognise that it is something absolutely unacceptable to do.

The page, which encouraged people to see them aliens and suggested that enough people raid the base then they couldn\u0027t be stopped, is bringing an unknown number of people to Nevada to take part in the event.Local officials have already signed emergency declarations in response to the event, and local residents warned people not to come. But the event is still likely to prove popular, leading people to take precautions against whatever might happen.We are preparing for the worst, said Joerg Arnu, a Rachel resident who could see from his home a makeshift stage and cluster of portable toilets in a dusty area recently scraped of brush surrounding West\u0027s little motel and cafe.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month - August 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.When stars like the Sun grow advanced in age, they expand and glow red.

I am fully aware, however, how the right-on conspiracy theories play out here.That is, I’m only saying this because The Mash Report goes against my own political prejudicesand am part of a right-wing media group trying to destroy the working-class via Brexit.The same right-wing media group that broke the Yellowhammer No Deal crisis story, off which The Mash Report has been leeching material all series.Above and beyond my own obvious desire to enslave the proletariat, through dumb quiz show answers, though, I am also a comedy fan, and the remarkable thing about the Brexit circus is that not once, in more than three years, has The Mash Report, Have I Got News For You, The Last Leg or Frankie Boyle’s New World Order said anything so funny it’s worth repeating.Hardly surprising really when, rather than being part of the comedy process, all of those shows are such an entrenched and slanted part of the left-of-centre political process they’ve all removed deserving Labour targets, like Diane Abbott, John McDonnell and Emily Thornberry, from any sort of firing line.It’s natural BBC Channel  bias and stupidity that’s led them to that sorry pass, I think, not orders from above.But the chances of those two networks ever changing their tone and playing fair Take the exact number of angry rants Nish Kumar’s aimed at Labour’s anti-Semites, on The Mash Report, multiply it by the number of times he’s mentioned the actual result of the Brexit referendum and your answer’s still zero.THE height of optimism  Britain’s Got Talent: The Champions host Ant McPartlin announcing: “We’ll be back with the winners of Holland’s Got Talent . See you in a few minutes.”Remarkably, though, they did, and I quickly regretted the decision, as even Simon Cowell had lost patience with the process by then and was taking it all out on some Dutch dance troupe called Fire.“It lacked imagination and creativity. I’ve seen this a million times. You’ve wasted a massive opportunity, guys.”The miracle was he didn’t snap earlier and far more often, as there were plenty of other acts absolutely begging for the red buzzers.Prime targets included: Mrs screechy pants, from Spain, Christina Ramos, DJ Arch, who won South Africa’s Got Talent aged three, presumably beating a two-year-old ventriloquist, and those Lebanese caterpillar dancers, Mayyas, from Beirut, whose reception owed a lot more to good manners than entertainment value.Picking two winners was, by contrast, a much harder task. But David Walliams’ golden buzzer went to Nico And Paddy, an -year-old salsa dancer whose signature move is the unravelling toilet roll drop, while the overall Wembley Arena winner was correctly judged to be Canadian escapologist Darcy Oake, who now faces the usual BGT challenge of doing something “even more dangerous” for the final. A simple solution presents itself.Get the Lebanese dancers to handcuff you inside that box, then see how quickly you escape, smart-a**e.CALLING out around the world, are you ready for a cookery heat Summer’s here and the time is right for basting turkey meat.Apologies to Marvin Gaye, William “Mickey” Stevenson and Ivy Jo Hunter for the dreadful liberties just taken with their Motown classic, but it’s not every day a genuine music legend rocks up in the BBC Celebrity MasterChef kitchen.And as well as Kiss FM DJ Rickie Haywood-Williams, Grammy-nominated singer Martha Reeves was also present, marinading cod and being told off by Gregg Wallace for over-seasoning a turkey burger for her troubles.She seemed to enjoy the experience as well.I just hope Martha was paying proper attention to the health and safety lecture head chef at the Kricket restaurant, Will Bowlby, gave fellow team member Greg Rutherford at the tandoor oven.“It rises in temperature to between  and  degrees.“You do not want to look over it, ’cos . . . ”It’s like a heatwave.MEANWHILE, on EastEnders, Ade Edmondson has reappeared, on Jean’s cancer ward, in a characteristically happy-go-lucky mood as Daniel.“I’ve got absolutely nothing to live for. I can’t even get aroused when Fiona Bruce comes on telly.”And Jenner Saunders  No. Silly question.Kane Robinson and Ashley Walters’ mesmerising performances as Sully and Dushane, on Netflix’s Top Boy.Mark Wright’s genuinely fascinating Who Do You Think You Are  drawing a direct line between Towie and the Spanish inquisition.GMB’s hungover host Piers Morgan making such a perfect Brexit idiot of shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, on my favourite show, she did the left-wing equivalent of pressing the ejector seat button and yelped: “Food banks.”S Club ’s Paul Cattermole appearing at the First Dates Hotel, looking uncannily like Charlie Higson.And Goggleboxer Pete giving brilliant context to the claim the singer had been, “Beaten around by the industry”, by pointing out: “For £. an hour I had my arm shoulder deep in s***. And HE’S been ‘beaten around by the industry ’”Gemma Collins, Arg and all those other Z-list celebrities who think turning up late for everything is a charming personality quirk.Planner-knackering programmes that last exactly one hour . . . and five minutes.An advert for Britain’s smuggest and touchiest television network, Channel , maintaining, “complaints welcome”.First Dates maitre d’ Fred Sirieix being a little bit more in love with fame than is healthy.And Odd One Out, with Jesy Nelson of Little Mix, which really wasn’t the replacement for the Paul Daniels’ masterpiece I was hoping for or expecting.Well, fairly sure.DAVE, Wednesday, pm: Comedians Giving Lectures.THIS week’s winner is football pundit Danny Murphy and That Yellow B*stard from Sin City.Sent in by Dean Edmunds.

There is a huge lobbying operation to try to persuade us all to go cashless and use only electronic forms of payments.Already, some fashionable bars and restaurants advertise themselves as cashless.Sainsbury’s recently opened a store where the only way to pay was via a smartphone app — though it was rapidly forced to change its policy when confused shoppers jammed the helpdesk.Little known to most people, David Cameron nearly announced in his  Conservative Party conference speech that Britain would become the world’s first entirely cashless society by .He only pulled back when advisers warned that the public was not ready for such a move.Too right we are not ready to have cash snatched from our wallets and be forced to pay for everything with cards or smartphones. And I hope we never will be.I have nothing against electronic forms of payment, when we choose to use them.I do plenty of shopping online and often choose to pay by card in shops, too.But the right to use cash is a vital freedomwe are to avoid being exploited.I am sick of being told that going cashless is for my convenience. No, it isn’t.It is for the enrichment of some very powerful financial interests who have been furiously lobbying governments to abolish cash.In , investors worldwide put billioninto the financial technology — or fintech — industry.Why  In the expectation of huge rewards.According to the Boston Consulting Group, the industry currently earns trilliona year in revenue — such as fees when we use our credit card or download a payment app on to our phone.By , it expects that to DOUBLE.No prizes for guessing where that extra trillion is going to be coming from — you and me.It might be free for consumers to use a debit card now, but you can be sure it won’t bethe option of paying by cash is abolished.Another reason the industry wants to force us to go cashless is to sell data on our shopping habits.When we buy things with cash, we are anonymous. But when we spend on our cards, our spending can be tracked.Visa, Mastercard and ­American Express have already set up subsidiaries to monetise this data and flog it for marketing purposes.While some stand to make fortunes, the victims of an increasingly cashless economy are the poor and elderly, who find their lives made ever more dficult.Hard though it may be for some of us to believe, when a cashless London transport system was being discussed it emerged that ten per cent of the passengers do not have a bank account.It is not easy to open an accountyou do not have a fixed address and cannot produce things such as utility bills. How are such people supposed to cope in a cashless society There are some things — such as parking in certain towns — which can now only be done by smartphone app.That might make sense to young, educated policymakers in Whitehall and council officials who have grown up with the devices and find that using them is second nature.Yet surprising though it may seem to some, . per cent of the population has never used the internet.Four in five over-s do not own a smartphone, and with good reason.Even without arthritis or serious problems with my vision, I find the devices extremely fiddly to use.I struggle to read what is on the screen and I often find my phone battery has run down by the end of the day.I wouldn’t want to be without a phone, but even less would I want to be reliant on it as my electronic wallet.When the Cameron government was seriously considering turning Britain cashless, one of the reasons mentioned was that it would help tackle crime on the grounds it is supposedly harder for criminals to handle electronic money, as it can be traced.But try telling that to the many victims of online scams who lost a collective £.billion last year in Britain.Just because electronic transfers are theoretically traceable doesn’t mean anyone is actually doing the tracing.Online fraud simply isn’t being taken seriously enough by the police or any other authority.Until or unless it is, going cashless will expose more people to fraud as they are forced to open online accounts.What is wrong with having a iety of ways to pay and letting us choose Cash, cards and cheques have happily co-existed for decades and there is no reason why cash cannot continue to exist alongside payment apps and the like.Far from sneakily trying to abolish cash, the Government should be standing up for our right to use it — ensuring, for one thing, that there are enough free cashpoints for all of us to access our money.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

His new stance is even more laughable than last week’s, when he pledged to negotiate a “better” EU deal but campaign against it.Now he would put his deal to a second referendum but express no preference between that and remaining in the EU.He hasn’t a clue. He couldn’t say. It’s too hard. The Leader of the Opposition’s mind is a blank — not for the first time.He would merely “carry out whatever the people decide” . . . er, exactly as Boris Johnson would be doing NOWLabour wasn’t blocking him.Why does Corbyn, having failed to respect the first vote, imagine anyone trusts him to enact the result of a second The only certainty is that he WILL sell Leavers down the river, as The Sun predicted.Corbyn’s “Leave” deal would keep us in the EU’s customs union, handing it control of our economy while surrendering all our political influence.That’s the worst possible option. It’s not “leaving” at all. It’s Remain by another name. Corbyn is too dim to see it.His second referendum would thus be “Remain minus” vs Remain — a farce, absurdly biased and totally illegitimate.This coward, ditherer and fool could yet run the country, God help us.REMEMBER how our “broken” economy only works “for the few” Inflation is now just . per cent as pay leaps by . per cent, its fastest in  years.Everyone’s standard of living is rising.Remember Project Fear’s scares about the immediate catastrophe of voting Leave  A pack of lies.Unemployment is at a -year low, employment at an all-time high, thanks to new full-time jobs.Remember how the City would become a jobless wasteland  It is still easily the biggest global foreign exchange hub and pulling even further away from the competition.If this is how Britain shrugs off political mayhem, imagine what we will do once Brexit is done and uncertainty lts.VANESSA George’s crimes were wicked beyond belief.Some of the children she violated still suffer.

Her owner is known to police, but has gone on the run.There was no chip on the Panther, or registration documents associated with her, suggesting she was a black market animal who had been trafficked into France illegally, said the source.Detectives said they found an oversized dog basket and food which was clearly set out for the Panther in a nearby house.The Panther was today at the Protestant League of Lilleshelter in the city, where she spent the night in a blacked out cage aimed at reducing stress.Shes quite young, said an LPA spokesman. She’s like Labrador.The spokesman said there were signs that the animal’s claws had been illegally cut down, to avoid her hurting anyone.She would have dficulty feeding and climbing trees because of this, said the spokesman, adding: But she was otherwise healthy, with a good coat.The LPA has now contacted the zoo in nearby Maubeuge, in the hope that she can find a new home there.One local policeman told the Voix du Nord newspaper: In twenty years of working, I have never seen anything like it. A snake, yes.

Leadership requires more than remaining within a safety net.He added: We risk being trapped in a zero sum game, which will lead to zero outcomes, which I do not want.The EU risks continuing to insist on a test that the UK cannot meet and that the UK Parliament has rejected three times.What we need now is a genuine negotiation with creative and flexible solutions from both sides.A rigid approach now – at this point – is no way to progress a deal. The responsibility sits with both sides to find a solution.Mr Barclay also said the backstop is inconsistent with the Good Friday Agreement because it doesnt have the consent of both communities.Responding to the remarks, an EU Commission spokeswoman said Brussels would not be drawn into a blame game with Britain.She said: Our role is to be constructive, to move forward the negotiations and to make progress so as to allow reaching the joint aim of having a deal.Eurocrats also batted away Mr Barclays suggestion that they are not ready for No Deal, insisting EU states are fully prepared.Both the Commission and No  confirmed yesterday that Britain has tabled written proposals on replacing the backstop for the first time.The UK side yesterday put forward a series of informal discussion papers containing over its ideas to revamp the border fix.The dossier covers parts of Britains aim for a three tier replacement to the backstop which would involve some checks on the island of Ireland.It includes agreeing an all-island agri-food zone, under which Northern Ireland continues to follow EU rules on farming and food standards.This would be coupled by replacing alignment in other areas with alternative arrangements and agreeing a Stormont Lock for Northern Irish consent.Under the plan the whole of the UK would leave the EUs customs union and single market.Teams of officials from Brussels and Britain met yesterday and will get together again today to discuss the technical details of the proposal.The revelation came as two Labour MPs leading a cross-party group for a deal told Mr Barnier up to  of their colleagues are ready to rebel against Jeremy Corbyn.Stephen Kinnock and Caroline Flint were invited to Brussels by the EU chief negotiator so he could grill them on the latest parliamentary arithmetic.Some EU officials have expressed regret that they have focussed too much attention on hardline Remainers rather than moderates.Ms Flint said he had probed them on what pressure they could bring to bear on the two main parties and discussions surrounding the Benn bill.She insisted: There’s still a majority in parliament, cross-party, who would like to get a deal through.I think we better reflect the public. People want us to try and find a way through this.Mr Kinnock said the Frenchman told them he was not hung up on the language and the way in which absolute assurances are given the backstop wont be permanent.He said of his grouping: Dferent parts of the coalition are looking for dferent things but we really are now at the last roll of the dice.We made the point that the more the debate has radicalised and polarised, the closer you get to No Deal.Everybody that’s tried to reverse Brexit, to not accept anything that doesn’t pass ious purity tests, has played directly into the hands of the No Dealers.Irelands PM Leo Varadkar yesterday said the rhetoric and mood music surrounding the talks has improved and theres a lot of energy and a lot of positivity.But he warned: The dficulty is that when it comes to the substance of the issue that needs to be resolved, the gaps are still very wide.His deputy Simon Coveney, who met MPs from parliaments Brexit committee in Dublin yesterday, also warned the two sides are a long way apart.He said: “There is a signicant gap between what the British Government has been asking about in their approach, and what the EU is able to accept.Mr Coveney added that France and Finland agreeing a September  deadline for new UK plans showed the growing frustration and concern within the EU”.Asked about the ultimatum, the Commission said that every day counts and that the sooner we make progress the better.A French official said: If we dont get the proposals before the end of September, we will not have enough time to discuss them before the summit in October.Yesterday a report by the OECD warned Ireland is set to be the worst hit EU countrytheres No Deal - but Britain would suffer even more.The Paris-based think tank said the countrys economic growth would be cut by . per cent next year and in , compared with a % hit for the UK. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailEveryone suspects the Tories have a long-term plan to abolish the NHS. A new documentary film will lay bare the plot dating back decades, and within sight of success. Under The Kne charts the secret Conservative strategy to open up the health service to private sector companies as a prelude to total sell-off. The devastating documentary, made by Pam Kleinot and Susan Steinberg, draws on dozens of interviews with doctors, nurses, politicians and patients to track the steps towards today’s crisis.We told on Wednesday how a dad left Boris Johnson in no doubt about the perilous state of the NHS.The man told the PM at Whipps Cross Hosp­ital, in East London, his baby waited two hours for treatment on an overstretched ward, adding: “[She] nearly died. The NHS has been destroyed.”    Under The Kne tells how the NHS was almost strangled at birth by opposition from doctors and Tories. And while it offered the best health service in the western world for  years, the campaign to get rid of it never ended. Thatcher wanted to privatise, but a Cabinet riot stopped her. So she appointed Sainsbury’s boss Roy Grfiths to “reform” the NHS. He brought in a new managerial class dedicated to running the service like a business. This was the first step on the road. The health service was to be a “business operation” with management, not the patient, at its heart.    Dr James Le Fanu, a doctor at Whipps Cross Hospital, says in the film that Grfiths “introduced a new class in the health service, a management class that hadn’t existed before”. He adds: “Doctors were stripped of power... “They were told how to run wards. It was a serious blow.” Thatcher also listened to US economist Alain Enthoven, who believed the only way to meet patient demand was to bring in so-called market competition. Professor Allyson Pollock, an expert in the field, says: “When you bring in a market, instead of funds going into services and staff, it is erted away... As soon as the government brought in an internal market, the administration cost doubled overnight. “All the evidence shows that you can’t deliver universal healthcare through a market. Markets render the people who don’t get care – the poor, the old, the people with disabilities – invisible.” Marketisation also brought in management consultants to advise on NHS changes, charging exorbitant fees. When their advice proved wrong, they got even more money for advising how to put it right. Millions,not billions.   Tony Blair tells the film-makers: “There was no bigger challenge for the incoming Labour government of  than the NHS.”His first Health Secretary, Frank Dobson, agrees: “It was underfunded, understaffed and a lot of hospitals were very run down.”But because Chancellor Gordon Brown had promised not to borrow money, Labour vastly expanded the private finance initiative, introduced by the Tories in , to rebuild the hospitals.This was music to the ears of managers, because the private sector put up the buildings and future generations bear the cost. And handing over hospitals to the private sector is no panacea, as the failure of Hinchingbrooke hospital under management by Circle showed. The Tories’in  brought hard-liner Andrew Lansley as Health Secretary. He brought in the Health and Social Care Bill , seen by many as taking the NHS on to the final stretch to privatisation. He took away the Health Secretary’s ultimate responsibility to provide a national health service for all. “It really was the end of the national service,” says Prof Pollock. The Tories’ coalition partner, the Lib Dems, initially opposed the bill. “At its heart was privatisation,” Lady Shirley Williams admitted to the film-makers. But they caved in, and the  Act laid down that all NHS services should be subject to competitive tender, bringing private companies into the whole range of public healthcare. There was outcry from doctors and nurses, but behind the scenes lobbying firms working for private sector companies like Virgin and Circle had the ear of Lansley’s policy team.    They kept the Tories on the privatisation track. The next step was to transfer control of the NHS to new management. The service was ided into smaller regional systems, under private or public control, with powers to decide what services will be available and who will provide them. In , % of the total value of these contracts went to the private sector. Virgin won over a billion pounds worth of NHS business. Lord David Owen, a doctor and former Health Minister, claims the Lansley reforms are preparing the NHS “surreptitiously for the United States health care system”. In the US, around  million people go without health care.   Jeremy Hunt intensied the drive inherited from Lansley and crushed a revolt by junior doctors against his handling of the NHS.The legacy of the Tory years of creeping privatisation is a health service in dire straits. Dr Phil Hammond, physician and commentator, says: “We’re killing the people we ask to care for us. If we compare with an airline, the NHS takes off with unsafe staffing levels, with a hole in the fuselage and half a wing missing every day.” Lord Lansley said: “The  Act does not marketise the NHS. My motivation was to strengthen the independence of the NHS from frequent political interference, while making accountability to minister and Parliament more transparent.” But doctors and nurses totally disagree. Mr Johnson claims that in post-Brexit UK US trade talks the NHS “won’t be on the table”.

Mr Juncker said his meeting with Johnson on Monday in Luxembourg had been “rather positive”. In the interview with Sky News, he added: “We can have a deal.” And he said he was not wedded to the idea of a backstop to keep the Northern Ireland border open as long as the UK could demonstrate ‘alternative arrangements’ could do the same job. He said: “As far as the so-called alternative arrangements are concerned, allowing us and Britain to achieve the main objectives of the backstop ...the results are there, I don’t care about the instrument,” he said “If the objectives are met, all of them, then we don’t need the backstop.” But askedthe chances were more than  , he replied: I donapost know.

What is the Queenaposs speech   The Queen makes her speech at the State Opening of Parliament which is the formal start to the parliamentary session. The Queen makes a speech setting out what we can expect from her Government in a speech which is written for her by the Prime Minister and his team. When is the next Queenaposs Speech If Boris Johnson gets his way, it will be on October . The State Opening is usually one of the major events of the Parliamentary calendar. Or it used to be. It seems like more or less every day in Westminster is a major, earth-changing event these days. But what usually happens at the State Opening is this: The Queen arrives at the Houses of Parliament, through the Sovereign Entrance. She then puts on the Imperial State Crown and Robe of State, and leads a procession through the Royal Gallery into the chamber of the House of Lords. The members of the House of Commons then join the Lords in their chamber - but not until a House of Lords official, known as Black Rod is sent to summon them. Itaposs ceremony that the Commons slam the door in his face, to signy the separation of the Commons from the Lords. He then bangs on the door three times, they open it and follow him through. Then, the actual speech itself is delivered from the throne in the House of Lords. Although the Queen speaks it, being the Queens Speech, it is actually written by the Government. Then, the Queen leaves, a new parliamentary session starts and everyone gets back to work.  Nope. Last time round the State Opening was triggered by Theresa Mayaposs snap election in . The State Opening, with all its pomp and ceremony, takes months to plan. And in  it was eventually scheduled for just a few days after the trooping of the colour.

Because he is missing this enzyme his muscles arenapost working as well as they should be.    Jack said that they had an idea that something wasnapost quite right with Archie early on, and that his partner, Tamika, who has two children from a previous relationship, was particularly anxious about his symptoms. Jack, who has had to take time off from training to be a hairdresser, said: My partner struggled because she knew that something wasnapost right and doctors didnapost think it was anything to begin with. Doctors and midwes were saying they didnapost think it was anything to worry about. People werenapost really concerned which was horrible for us and for her, but once the tests have been done everything has been amazing. The problem is, doctors down here arenapost very familiar with Pompe disease and what it is, because it is very rare. But we saw one doctor who conducted micro-screening and thought it could be one of a few things and the diagnosis came back as Pompe disease.    Tamika and Jack, who live in Bodmin with their three children say there is no telling what the future holds for Archie, who hasnapost been able to start his treatment yet as his veins are not strong enough for the tansfusion. Jake said: He’s due to have an operation to have a port put in so that he can have an infusion every two weeks, which he will have for le. We donapost know as of yet whether he will lead a normal le as it depends on how his body reacts to that treatment. It should help his heart definitely and anything  doesnapost matter. If itaposs not picked up and a child has no treatment or the treatment doesnapost work it can be le threatening. He added: He could be in a wheelchair, he could be bed bound or he could be up and running about. He is a very determined little child and is a very happy and content baby.

It was the picture perfect moment as his proud daughter eagerly ran towards the classroom with her hair neatly plaited and her socks pulled up high. But tragically it was a bittersweet moment, because Laylaaposs mum Cheryl Hardy wasnapost there, after she died suddenly at their home in January . Ahead of the big day, devoted dad Fakir, known as aposZackapos, turned to YouTube so he could learn how to plait Layla’s hair to make sure everything was just right for her. Now Fakir, known as aposZackapos speaks for the first time to Mirror about how he is raising the five children they had together alone - with a little extra bit of help from YouTube. And he describes the heartbreaking moment that Layla asked him: aposWhen can mummy take me to school apos Another time, she worriedly asked: “You won’t leave us too, will you ”  Unable to answer the dficult questions, the grieving dad has instead tried to fill both roles of mother and father as best he can. Zack, , said: “Layla missed her presence every day. “But these are questions I cannot answer at the moment. “This might sound strange to some people, but I’ve not told any of my kids that their mum is not coming back. “I’ve never said it. At the moment, I don’t think the time is right given how young they are. “I don’t want them to get distracted and I’m waiting for the right time. “The time will come. Every time they mention mum, I just say she’s in a better place. “I don’t want them to get upset.”  The family had their hearts ripped out in January  as Cheryl, , passed away just seven weeks after giving birth to a baby boy. And as the last person to see her alive, Zack says he wishes he’d stayed with her after he woke up early and went downstairs. But he praises the support network of family, friends and neighbours who have helped anchor the family in their grief. Now he remains upbeat as he talks about how his family are continuing to thrive as they adapt to their new circumstances. Mum Cheryl, , was discovered unconscious by oldest daughter Rhiannah who immediately alerted Zack. But despite medics best efforts, she was declared dead  minutes after they arrived.  The circumstances were especially tragic as the mum, who hoped to become a midwe, had just given birth seven weeks earlier to a baby boy. And after Cheryl died, Zack pledged to raise the children they had together - Rhiannah, , Amirah, , Kameel, nine, Kesaar Mulla, seven, and Layla Mulla, five, - as a single dad. He said: “The biggest challenges are getting them what they need, rather than what they want. “And they go to three dferent schools so it’s all about handling that.” Before her death, Cheryl, who was training to be a midwe, had not been in good health following a trip to Disneyland Paris in December. And she had previously suffered a pulmonary embolism, which is when a clump of material like a blood clot, gets wedged into an artery in the lungs.  But devastated Zack says the death “came out of the blue” and was completely unexpected. He said: “I couldn’t speak to anyone for about two weeks after it happened. “I refused to eat, speak to anyone properly, I just wanted to turn my phone off and disappear for about two or three weeks. “I was a mess. But at the same time, I knew I couldn’t give in because of the kids. “I knew that they only had me and I had to make sure I had a brave face on. “I was married to her for ten years, it’s dficult, I’m still brokenhearted.  He added: In the first few days after Cheryl died, I cried a lot. That upset my kids. They would beg me, apossmile, Daddy, smileapos. So I decided to try to hide my sadness. But my kids seemed to know that I was really sad and on the verge of tears. I told them that even though they couldnapost make my sadness go away, they could do something important by comforting me with all their hugs. I think their hugs have helped them as much as they have helped me. Now Zack says he is determined to make his we proud and keep her memory alive. He said: “We look through memory books with all the photos of our trip to Disneyland Paris. “They go through that a lot, which is good.”  And he says he sends her messages of gratitude constantly. He said: “I thank her, I thank her all the time. I’ll always pay tribute to her and mention her on social media. “I wouldn’t be here without her, she blessed me with the children. “As far as I’m concerned, they’re her kids and I’m doing everything in my le for her to make sure they’re looked after and loved all the time. “She’ll never be forgotten ever. I’ll mention her everyday around the house.” But the grieving dad admits he feels guilt over her death - even though it was due to medical issues. And he wakes up every day at half five, as that was the last time he spoke to her. He said: “I apologise to her when I wake up in the morning and I apologise to her when I go to bed. “I blame myself, I think it was my fault that I spoke to her at half past five in the morning and I didn’t stay in bed when I should have done. “Two hours later, she was found like that.”  Now Zack says he is not interested in another relationship as he focuses his attention on raising his children. Ahead of Layla joining Year One at primary school, Zack watched tutorials on the social media channel before practicing on his daughter’s doll. He said: “She’s been asking me for a while but I told her I couldn’t do it. “I can just about put two bobbles around her hair. “But I watched a few YouTube tutorials and tried it on a dolly. “It’s not a fantastic job but I’m doing what I can do. She was pleased.” Zack says Cherylaposs unexpected death sent shockwaves across the community as she was a keen volunteer.

Builder Edward Putman, , is accused of fraud by  representation after allegedly claiming an outstanding jackpot of £. million with a fake ticket in . He came forward to collect the prize just before the six-month deadline. Putman, from Kings Langley, Hertfordshire, is accused of conspiring with friend Giles Knibbs - who worked in the securities department at Camelot between  and . He allegedly submitted a damaged fake ticket to take the top prize in September . The trial at St Albans Crown Court was told Mr Knibbs did not feel he had received his fair share of the jackpot, which was paid out to Putman, and they had a bitter argument.  Mr Knibbs killed himself later that year, the court was told, having been arrested for burglary, blackmail and criminal damage. At the start of the trial, Judge Philip Grey told the jury of  men and  women: The allegation is a fraud on the National Lottery. The prosecution say the defendant won a signicant sum of money by means of a forged lottery ticket. The defendant says the ticket was genuine and honest. Prosecutor James Keeley said the alleged fraud came to light after Giles Knibbs, from Bricket Wood, Herts committed suicide at Ivinghoe Beacon in Bucks on  October . Opening the case, Mr Keeley said: The fraud remained a secret until . Although Mr Knibbs received some of the proceeds of the lottery win from the defendant, Mr Knibbs did not feel that he had received his fair share and felt let down by him. On any view, Mr Knibbs felt that the defendant had treated him unjustly. It was this sense of injustice that came to a head in June . The genuine winning ticket, which was bought in Worcester, has never been found.

Millions more will joined in co-ordinated events around the world in what is being called the largest climate mobilisation in history.    The climate strikes are also being backed by unions, charities, businesses and politicians.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSome landmines in Angola shoot from the earth to chest height, spraying metal fragments that leave the vital organs in ribbons. Others set off a blast that forces dirt, stones, plastic and metal into the lower limbs, ripping apart bone and muscle. Many are picked up by mistake, mostly by children who think they’ve found toys. Minga was five when she spied a shiny object she thought might be a tin of tuna by the side of a road, and excitedly tapped it against a rock to remove the dirt so she could make her family’s day by bringing home dinner. She realised it wasn’t tuna but wasn’t sure what it was, so began to play with it. It exploded, robbing her of her sight and her right arm from below the elbow. Ten years later, all she remembers is a flash followed by silence.    Sapalo was  when a huge dung beetle fell out of a rubbish bag he was moving from his parents’ kitchen. On the table was a piece of metal his uncle had brought in the previous night. He used it to brush the beetle out of the house. It was a grenade, which exploded, taking both his legs and one eye. They’re just two of more than , ­Angolans maimed by the legacy of the -year civil war that left a million mines in the fields, villages and roads of one of the poorest countries on earth.Prince Harry will be there next week to honour the memory of his mother, who walked through an Angolan minefield months before her death in  to bring the cause to the world’s attention.Shortly after she died the Ottawa Treaty, outlawing the use and production of landmines, was signed by  nations. The issue has fallen down the global agenda, which is why Harry is there to push it back up, as part of the goal to make the world landmine-free by .    In Angola, with at least , areas still affected and international and national funding being decimated, that deadline looks beyond ambitious. Seeing the problem ­first-hand is beyond tragic... Seventeen years after the civil war ended there are more than  dferent types of mines, supplied by  nations, still active in the huge West African country. As well as taking lives and wrecking bodies, houses can’t be built, fields can’t be cultivated and villages can’t grow. It’s the closeness of ordinary le to such appalling twists of fate that shocks most. Women walk up to six miles to the nearest river to fetch water, often through areas they know are mined. Men cultivate contaminated fields, even when the de-miners are working in them, in the knowledge that any second a hoe could hit something that takes their limbs.    They have no choice. No water and no food equals no le. Every hour of the day is a deadly risk-assessment. Even for kids at play. The Manchester-based Mines ­Advisory Group, which in the past decade has cleared nine million square feet of Angolan minefields, is doing its best to rid the country of an evil weapon that shames the human race. Their teams cleared Lucusse village of mines but all around lie weapon parts. Kids clamber on to blown-up tanks that still have live rocket shells in them. As I watch, two men tell MAG workers they’ve found shells inside another tank. The previous day a boy chased a rat under a tank and found three explosives. In another part of the village boys play football using parts of tanks as ­goalposts.    Twenty yards away, in May, Emilia, nine, and Jamba, two, lit a grass fire. Underneath lay a live grenade. They died instantly. It’s scary going into minefields. I joined the de-miners at Luathamba, where  explosives,  of them huge anti-tank mines, were found in one field. Just putting on the body armour and protective visor gives you the chilling realisation that one mis-reading of the colour-coded sticks that indicate where mines have been cleared, could blow you apart. And I’m colour-blind. And two hours from the nearest hospital. In the village, MAG’s community team is giving the kids a mine awareness class. They’re shown dferent explosives and how to reactthey see any.    Two boys say that they’ve seen rockets in a field, then lead the team to the spot. Under a tree lies the deadly weapons. The de-miners bury them, wire them to a detonator, walk  yards away and let me press the button that produces a deafening bang and a plume of smoke seen for miles. It was a weird Dr ­Strangelove moment. There were  nations involved in the Angolan civil war, a proxy war between Communism and the West. Man is very good at starting bloodbaths but not too good at cleaning up the devastation they wreak. Due to international aid falling by % and Angolan public spending being slashed because of a collapse in the price of oil, it’s more important than ever for nations and inidual donors to step up. Only three of its  provinces are mine-free and there is an estimated  million square metres to clear.    MAG reckons £million is needed to stand a chance of making that  deadline in a country where it’s claimed one-in- of its  million people has stepped on a mine. But statistics can’t tell the story as well as a human face. A face like Minga’s whose left eye is closed, her right half-open and her skin scarred. She’s  now, and has made a proud effort to meet us. Her hair is freshly braided and her black shoes with a gold clasp match the leather bag she hangs from her shoulder at a place where her lower arm should be.

Highly unpopular baby names are often chosen by hipster parents as these mums and dads seek out a unique name which will make their child stand out in real le and increasingly online.    The trend could mean parents who recently chose the names Ada and Arthur from the hit show Peaky Blinders might see their picks fall out of fashion in the playground by the time their tots are teens. Among the most unpopular names for girls last year were Tammy, Justine and Tracy, with the names given to fewer than three babies each. The rise of the terror group also saw the end of the name Isis. Not a single baby was given the name in , despite it being the th most popular name in the UK in . There were also only three named Norma, and four Carols. For boys, the least popular names are Jeff and Geoff, Melvyn, Greg and Graeme, with no babies given these monikers last year. Also unloved by mums and dads are Ken and Clive, with just three parents picking the names respectively for their children. But the study also showed there is hope for some hated names, as nine in  parents are happy to consider a name which has fallen out of fashion in the hope of finding a hidden gem.

The first museum of its kind will open in Camden Market, London, on November  following a successful £, crowdfunding campaign. Its founders say the goal is to create an educational shrine to vaginas, vulvas and the broader gynaecological anatomy. Disco parties, comedy nights, school tours and art exhibitions may be unusual ways to help break the stigma associated with female genitals. But the founders hope that offering a fascinating museum featuring everything science and history to vulva cupcakes and aposvagacchinoapos coffees will make visitors feel more comfortable with the important topic.    Founder Florence Schecter decided to set up a museum dedicated to vaginas after learning in  about the existence of one dedicated to penises in Iceland. After discovering Icelandaposs Phallological Museum, which displays hundreds of penises from animals, Ms Schechter felt it was only fairthere was a physical building that spotlighted female genitals as well. Through workshops, talks and social events, she said she wanted to create a space that would bring people together - young and old - to address sensitive issues like female genital mutilation, rape, domestic abuse, and sexual health. Itaposs really important because itaposs a hugely stigmatised part of the body and that leads to some real world consequences, she said. Just anything and everything thataposs taboo with that part of the body is what weaposre going to be addressing.  She said some girls and women feel awkward about getting gynaecological check-ups, such as screenings for cervical cancer, or discussing their periods. About one in four women in Britain do not attend a cervical screening, according a January survey by charity Joaposs Cervical Cancer Trust, with nearly three-quarters of women saying they missed the test due to embarrassment. Menstruation is still taboo in many countries. In Nepal, women are banished from their homes during their periods - a centuries-old practice that is now illegal - and several have died of smoke inhalation after lighting fires to keep warm. Ms Schecter said the museum will also run child-friendly programmes and will offer an outreach programme to ensure children feel comfortable talking about female genitals from an early age. When theyaposre ashamed of their bodies, it becomes really dficult for them to talk about things, she said. Itaposs about de-stigmatising this part of the body and being honest about what it does.

Video shows the impressive cat prowling the roofs of the residential building in Armentières, near Lille, in northern France, on Wednesday. The majestic animal, at about the size of a small Labrador dog, walks along a second-floor ledge and goes in and out of an open window for nearly an hour. Witnesses told local media that the black panther would stop to watch a nearby train go by or to stare fixedly at a cat running down the street.    Eyewitnesses also snapped these pictures of the huge predator walking past the windows of their s brick houses.  Local media La Voix du Nord reported the panther had entered an apartment where a -year-old girl was present. She then fled upon seeing the animal walk into the room. Police responded to the scene and set up a cordon as soon as they received reports from nearby residents.    Fire services and a veterinarian were also called to trap the animal in one of the homes before tranquilising it with a dart. Kader Laghouati from the Animal Protection League organisation in Lille said the panther is about five or six months old and weighs about kg . He added that the animal had been domesticated by its owner and was not aggressive. Its claws were clipped and it was in good health in general. Once captured, the panther was put in a cage and handed over to animal protection organisation called The League for the Protection of Animals.

The wind took the money right out of my hands and it was blowing everywhere. I just yelled for help and within seconds everyone was rushing around gathering up the notes.“I couldn’t believe it when it was counted in the bank afterwards and every single penny was there.”Carnoustie seven-year-old Blake was born with MECP duplication syndrome – a rare genetic condition that means he can’t move or speak.A couple of years ago his mum, Jenny Howe, opened Blake’s Bargains thrt shop on the high street with the aim of raising money to find a cure for the condition and to help fund his care.Dad John, runs a similar shop in Arbroath. He had been helping Jenny out by depositing into the bank in Arbroath as there is no longer a branch in Carnoustie for her to use.Jenny said: “Dad had just stepped out of the car and the wind grabbed the money and scattered it everywhere.“His cries for help were answered straight away and the kind and honest people of Arbroath managed to retrieve it all for him.“When he took it into the bank he wasn’t sureit was all there but there was nothing missing.“We are so grateful to everyone who rushed to help.”Jenny has worked hard over the years to help improve the quality of le for her son.She said: “Some of the money from the thrt shop goes towards costs for Blake and some of it has been donated for research.”Blake has endured several hospital stays in his le, including one instance where he underwent le saving surgery at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh.Jenny said: “Sadly Blake hasn’t been doing too well recently. Having done so well for so long he has recently taken a turn for the worse.

It was a family issue and that comes ahead of anything  really so he had a couple of days off.“As long as he can get that family matter sorted then he will be back ready to go again.”After a decent start, Morton have suffered three defeats on the bounce, conceding nine and scoring just once.Despite that, James expects a testing time against David Hopkin’s men.The Dens gaffer said: “When he was at Livingston, I saw a lot of David’s teams.“At that time I was watching games for Neil McCann and they had a couple of players he was interested in. So I saw quite a bit of them.“They were really good and he did well to get them up.

I thought we worked our socks off and thoroughly deserved the victory.”McGhee added: “After the two defeats, everyone could have felt down but the dressing-room was positive and that was a big three points for us.“We know in-house how good we are and how good players we are. We all believe in the gaffer’s philosophy and we knew it would come good but we need to kick on now.“We knew it would turn around with the quality we have in the dressing-room. We bounced back against Alloa and showed our character – I’m delighted for the boys.”McGhee found the net four times last season for Falkirk as they battled unsuccessfully against relegation from the Championship.With the Bairns, however, McGhee was expected to get forward much more, often being used as a right full-back rather than a central defender.A change in position hasn’t changed his aspirations of “chipping in with goals” throughout the rest of the campaign for the Dark Blues, though, as he targets a much loftier ambition of promotion to the top flight at Dens Park.Against Alloa, the -year-old was in the right place at the right time to turn home winger Josh McPake’s centre in the th minute, finishing inside the six-yard box to give his new side victory.He added: “It was just a bit of striker’s instinct! I saw Josh going past the full-back so I just got across their centre-half and directed it in.“I was absolutely delighted. I got a few goals last season at Falkirk but you don’t get forward as much playing centre-back as you do at right-back.“I have always chipped in with goals over the seasons and, hopefully, I can do the same this year.”Last season with Falkirk proved just how dficult a league the Championship is with the Bairns’ shocking descent to League One after a dreadful campaign.After moving back to Scottish football following a spell with Middlesbrough, McGhee admits it was tough at Falkirk as they went from promotion nearly-men to the relegation trapdoor.He said: “I have played in the league for two years now and anyone can beat anyone.“It is a lot dferent from the Premiership where the big two are going to take points off everyone. But in the Championship everyone takes points off each other. It is just the fact that who maintains the performance levels and wins more games will win the league.”He added: “Itcan set you up for a fall sometimes. It can be dficult as you can get praised too much and then you end up with a defeat.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/06/5d0a1aeceb3cc1.83894608-e1560950829866.jpg ","title":"dundee united skipper reynolds says team have to bounce back after ayr defeat","story":"Dundee United skipper Mark Reynolds has issued a warning to his team-mates that they can#t get too down after Saturday’s - loss to Ayr United.United were poor in defeat at Somerset Park as a Daniel Harvie strike and Alan Forrest penalty spoiled their perfect start to the Championship season and brought the Honest Men level with the league-leading Terrors.Failing to stretch their advantage at the top of the table was a blow only compounded further by wins for challengers Inverness and Dundee.The Tangerines were feeling a little sorry for themselves at full-time in Ayr but Reynolds insists those are emotions they must temper as they aim to get back on track against Arbroath at Tannadice this weekend.“It was just one of those days but we’re absolutely gutted and I’m sure the fans are, too,” the -year-old said.“We’ve worked hard to get them back on side, we’ve won four games on the bounce in the league. That was good momentum but it’s also a reminder that it can so easily just be dashed.“We just need to keep going the course. We’ve always spoken about one game at a time and I think that works both ways – you don’t get too high when it’s going well and you don’t get too low when it’s going against you.“We’ve looked at it early this week and seen why we weren’t as good as we should have been.“As we have done with everything, we’ve looked at all the details to see what we can do better and to stop that happening again.“We’ll be looking for a reaction on Saturday.”United host the Red Lichties just a fortnight after Dick Campbell’s side dumped them out of the Tunnock’s Caramel Wafer Challenge Cup on penalties.Although United fielded a makesht team that day, defender Reynolds is wary of the quality Arbroath possess and has warned they must be on their game to see them off this time.“Arbroath are a good side, they’re going well and picking up results,” he added.“We saw that first hand in the cup – we still put out a decent enough team and we’ll need to be on our game.“If we turn up and play the way we did on Saturday, we’ll be in trouble. We’ll go away, look at the tapes from the cup game and see what we need to do to beat them.“We’ll re-group and go again. We said at the start, even after winning the first four games on the spin, it’s a long season and it’s a hard league.“People will drop points when you don’t expect it and there’ll be twists and turns. All we can do is focus on ourselves and we’ll focus on the Arbroath game on Saturday. That’s as far as we’ll look.”Former Aberdeen man Reynolds lined up alongside his third central-defensive partner of the league season last weekend as Troy Brown made his debut.And Reynolds admits he is hoping to find a settled relationship with Brown or Calum Butcher while Mark Connolly remains out injured.“You can see there’s a quality player there but, as with anyone that comes in, it’s going to take a bit of time to get used to the way we play and what the manager wants us to do.“I’m sure he’ll get there, he’s settled in well and the more game time he gets the better he will become.“It’s been dficult but, when Butch has come in, we’ve done well. Obviously Troy’s in there now and it’s about trying to get a relationship as quick as we can.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/oor-wullie-sturgeon.jpg ","title":"live the oor wullie big bucket trail auction in edinburgh can funds reach 1m","story":"The Oor Wullie BIG Bucket Trail auctions continue tonight, as statues of Scotland#s favourite son go up for sale in Edinburgh.With Dundee#s auction raising £, followed by Aberdeenshire and Inverness boosting the tally by £,, the total currently sits at £, for the Archie Foundation.This evening#s third auction is in aid of Edinburgh Children’s Hospital.With more than  statues for sale at the Prestonfield House Hotel, it’s possible that the total for the week might break through the £ million mark.mdash The Sunday PostSeptember , On Friday, the Glasgow-based sculptures go under the hammer at Kelvingrove Art Gallery, in aid of Glasgow Children’s Hospital.The Sunday Post will be sharing all the news and reaction as it happens tonight in Edinburgh."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/03/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-2-e1553252194766-940x564.jpg ","title":"shock as driver flips car in city street before fleeing the scene","story":"Residents of a city street say they are “amazed” no one was seriously injured after a car overturned in the early hours of yesterday.Police and fire crews closed off Fountainbleau Drive in Linlathen shortly after am to clear the scene and cut down a lamppost damaged in the smash.A police investigation has been launched in an effort to trace the driver who ditched the car.It is understood the vehicle may have been stolen from the Kirkton area before the crash.Neighbours said they saw three young men wearing dark clothing who fled the area shortly after the incident.An unnamed resident said the yellow Vauxhall came to a stop near the skate park before she contacted the fire service. vw, px\"  She said: “I’m amazed no one was seriously injured.“The car landed on its driver’s side and I contacted the fire brigade – I was worried the car might have gone up in flames.”Another neighbour confirmed she had witnessed a group flee the scene.She added: “I’m amazed they came out of that unscathed.”Another resident described hearing a “loud bang” and said he couldn’t understand how the car had ended up landing in that position, near the junction with Rowantree Crescent.He added: “There was no screeching to imply the car was out of control.“It was facing in the direction of Morrisons but it was on the wrong side of the road to be heading that way.“I can’t understand how it’s managed to end up like that.“There were at least  fire crew members on the scene before a lamppost was cut down.”The fire service confirmed two appliances from the Kingsway station attended the scene.Police have urged anyone who may be able to help their investigation to get in touch.A spokeswoman added: “Officers were called to Fountainbleau Drive in Dundee at around .am yesterday following a one-car collision.“The driver had left the scene prior to police arrival and inquiries are ongoing to trace them.“Anyone who witnessed the crash or has other information relevant to the investigation should contact police on .”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/KMil_Bee-005-846x564.jpg ","title":"the first thing i did in the morning was make myself a double vodka and water dundee man turns his life around with the help of community group","story":"“The first thing I did in the morning was make myself a double vodka and water,” said Ian Thomas, speaking of his -year alcohol addiction.“I’d have a few of those for my breakfast.“I would wake up and vomit, have diarrhoea.“I was delirious, tremors, no appetite.

firm has announced the closure of its Aberdeen depot with the potential loss of  jobs.Muller confirmed it will cease operations at its base in Altens and move to existing sites in the Central Belt.The move has been described as a “bitter blow” for staff and their families.It comes after a -day review was carried out by the company which concluded the city depot was no longer viable.The firm, which produces milk, cream, butter and yoghurts, said it had made the decision to be closer to customers.Trade union officials called the move “devastating” for workers.Muller recently completed a £ million upgrade at its dairy in Bellshill and said the change will result in  new jobs being created in the Central Belt.Employees from Aberdeen will be offered the chance to relocate.Ian Smith, CEO of Muller, said: “We fully understand the impact of this decision on our colleagues in Aberdeen and we will do everything we can to support those who don’t want to relocate, or for whom there are no roles.“Sadly, it is a reality that the distribution model for fresh milk has changed andwe’re going to operate a sustainable fresh milk business in the short and long term, benefitting the fresh milk sector as a whole, we must adapt.”A statement from the firm added: “We are fully aware and understanding that this decision potentially affects  employees and their families and we will do everything we can to support those who don’t wish to relocate to take up other roles within the business.”Aberdeen South MP Ross Thomson said he would support his constituents.He said: “I have made myself

Usdaw has interrogated the business case for the closure in a meaningful consultation process, but regrettably no viable alternative was found.”And SNP MSP Maureen Watt said she was disappointed, but not surprised.She said: “More widely, clearly the large powerful supermarkets dictate what they want from their suppliers and their drive to centralise distribution is, in my view, short-sighted. It doesn’t take into account issues such as climate change and the damage to the environment or the needs of local producers.“However, having talked to other employers in the Aberdeen area I am confident that along with the support of the Scottish Government’s PACE team who are engaged with the workforce at Muller, the skilled workforce will find work in the local area.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/09/5d81cacc759544.74596639-771x564.jpg ","title":"more than 34000 visitors make a splash at north east open air pool","story":"A north swimming pool is celebrating after welcoming more than , visitors to its premises in one season.Stonehaven’s Open Air Swimming Pool at Elizabeth Park is only in operation during the summer and welcomed , visitors from May  to September .The Olympic-sized pool is operated by Aberdeenshire Council’s sport and cultural services Live Le Aberdeenshire which owns, staffs and manages the venue.The Friends of the Pool charity publicises and promotes the clean filtered seawater pool, which is heated to C .Its highest capacity to date hit , last year and it won its sixth consecutive TripAdvisor Certicate.Chairman of the Friends of Stonehaven volunteer group Pete Hill said: “Last year was an amazing season for Stonehaven’s heated open-air pool with almost , customers passing through the turnstiles.“I knew I was being optimistic in hoping we’d get an equally good summer and even more visitors.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

It forms an integral part of the councilrsquos strategy to build on the investment already made in the Borders Railway, which currently terminates adjacent to the Lowood site in Tweedbank.ldquoThe council purchased the land following an appropriate investment appraisal process and the development of a detailed financial model, which followed the Treasuryrsquos lsquoGreen Bookrsquo best practice.ldquoCouncillors considered the business case in full and three specic reports in December , January  and May  prior to the purchase.ldquoThese reports included the necessary information on site valuations, now released publicly."},{"url":null,"title":"mp-lamont-join-cross-party-bid-get-eu-deal","story":"BORDERS MP John Lamont is joining a cross-party group set up to get a deal with the EU through Parliament.Around  Conservative, Labour and independent MPs launched lsquoMPs for a dealrsquo on Tuesday.And the memberfor Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk says he is signing up, in a bid to find an alternative to a no-deal Brexit.Explaining his decision, Mr Lamont said: ldquoI am a democrat, who was disappointed with the EU Referendum result.\"But I also think the result needs to be implemented and done so in a sensible way.\"Thatrsquos why Irsquom joining this cross-party group to get a deal approved by Parliament, get us out of the EU and move the country on.

This occurs when cats come in contact with chemicals such as fuels, lubricants and some solvents.Usually, self-grooming causes the cat to ingest the toxin, or in some cases they inhale it which can cause a severe pneumonia.The toxin can cause problems throughout the body and on the skin too.When Jonny had examined Tikka, he immediately sent her to our Tranent surgery for blood tests and intravenous fluids as she was dehydrated.Fortunately, Tikkarsquos blood tests were normal so she did not have kidney damage.She tolerated her fluid therapy well and was soon looking much happier however several areas of her skin had become red and she was losing hair especially on her front legs.Tikka did not want to eat or drink. She was given analgesics, antibiotics and soothing cream was applied to her skin.Our nursing staff ensured she was as comfortable as possible and as she was not eating by herself, they fed her via a feeding tube several times a day.Her skin became red and thickened and some areas sloughed off.She had to have cream applied frequently to the damaged skin, just asshe had suffered burns.Tikka was finally well enough to go home where Mrs Taylor continued to treat her skin. Tikka started eating well again and is improving daily. Her fur is regrowing and soon she will have her beautul coat again.Now Mrs Taylor was very vigilant and realised she had to do something to help Tikka immediately.If you suspect your cat may have had contact with petroleum-based substances, please contact your vet as soon as possible.Often the first sign you may have is your pet smells of petrol or diesel.There may be vomiting or diarrhoea. They may actually be dizzy or confused or showing other neurological problems such as staggering and trembling. There may be respiratory signs such as coughing or wheezingthey have inhaled the chemical.Do not try to make your pet vomit as this can exacerbate the toxicity.The first thing you should do is try to remove the chemical from the fur.In many cases, it is best to bring your pet straight to your vets as soon as possible. The nursing staff at veterinary practices are well trained in dealing with intoxication emergencies.With petroleum products there are three main areas where the body can be affected: l The internal organs especially the kidneys, so your vet will want to blood sample your pet to check for any damage to the kidneys or other organsl The respiratory system can be affected especiallythe toxin is inhaled. This often happensthe patient vomits then inhales some resulting in a very severe pneumonia. Your vet may wish to take x-rays to check for this.l The animalrsquos skin can also be affected. The petroleum products sit on the fur then soaks through to the skin where they are held in contact by the fur. This causes them to act as a caustic substance, damaging the skin and hair follicles. Often the first sign before the skin damage is seen is hair loss due to the follicle damage.The treatment for these causes is supportive at all times. There are no specic antidotes. Intravenous fluids are administered, this helps overcome dehydration and helps eliminate toxins from the body.Analgesics are given to help keep pain from damaged skin and internal organs to a minimum.Antibiotics are given, as damaged skin is very prone to secondary infection and they are always givenpneumonia is present. Skin treatment has to be intense to keep infection to a minimum and encourage damaged skin to recover.Thankfully Tikka has made an excellent recovery, thanks to Mrs Taylorrsquos quick thinking and the intense nursing care given by the nursing team at Dunedin Vets."},{"url":null,"title":"tim-39-s-tales-magic-real-39-s-around-us","story":"Of course, in stories magic is very real a frog or beast can transform into a prince, dragons and witches can fly, animals can talk, wishes can be granted by faeries and spells cast by wizards.

The organ was out of action for two years while all the conservation work at St Michaelrsquos was being done but has been played again since mid-July.During this time a digital organ, linked to the kirkrsquos sound system, was used as a temporary measure.Restoration work to the Lewis organ, which is situated in the church sanctuary, included some leathering work to the bellows and electrical and mechanical repairs carried out including replacement of the old electrical transformer unit.The instrument was originally made by Lewis and Company, founded by Thomas Christopher Lewis , one of the leading organ builders of late th century Britain.Mr Shaw said further restoration of the organ would be carried out in the futurefunding was obtained.

Yet while levels of abuse and discrimination are dramatically lower than before, in some quarters hoary old grievances and antediluvian attitudes continue to smoulder.You could argue that the answer is education: an ongoing challenging of closed minds that will eventually lead to a state where nobody cares what religion other people follow. It is Tom Woodrsquos contention, however, that in order to eradicate sectarianism we need to abolish Catholic schools. These, he believes, are the root of the problem.With some reluctance, I have to agree their time is up. This, despite knowing that endorsing this view would appear to be rejecting the liberal values that I consider essential for a fair and well-run country. If parents wish to send their children to a school whose principles are guided by the Catholic faith ndash or any other for that matter ndash surely they should be allowed that choice  By all accounts, the education students receive in Catholic schools is impressive, and in some cases so enviable that lapsed members of the church appear to have a Damascene reawakening in order to get their offspring into the classroom.Yet the existence of this archaic system of schooling is tangible evidence of a problem that refuses to wither. From early childhood, separate schools reinforce the idea of dference, segregation and distinction. Whatever side of that school fence you walk, you are made aware from Primary One onwards of the concept of Them and Us.Therersquos another distasteful aspect of segregated schools too. Richard Dawkinsrsquos new book, Outgrowing God, which is aimed at young readers, tries to help ldquobreak the cycle of indoctrination. That word will be offensive to those who think they are doing their best by their children in instructing them in their own religious beliefs and culture, be they Catholic, Protestant, Muslim or Jew. But, even when done with the best intentions, sending a child to a school affiliated to a church is a form of intellectual and emotional programming. It represents the opposite of liberal values.:Catholic schools are rated higher by inspectorsFor as long as it is possible to put a child through a denominational education, society is tacitly acknowledging the power of religion to define who people are. In an age when the state is increasingly non-religious in its decision-making, in order to maintain strict neutrality and equality, it makes no sense. When single-sex institutions are frowned upon as out-dated, when discrimination based on ethnicity, background or sexual orientation is considered abhorrent, it seems odd that this particular expression of dference is allowed to continue. Onlysectarianism were unheard of, rather than a persistent blight, would it ndash just about ndash be acceptable.Back in the real world, the existence of educational pigeon-holes like these means there is little hope of religious bigotry being eradicated. Those on either side of the school gates live in an environment that allows this shameful stain on our country to persist, and even flourish. Initiatives to raise awareness or to banish deep-rooted prejudices can never be wholly successful so long as the public statement of religious identity is allowed such a state-sanctioned .This is not to attack faith itself. What iniduals choose to believe, and the ways in which they introduce children to their religion or creed at home, is their business. Nor should schools cease to teach pupils about world religions, or to help them understand the huge cultural influence that Christianity, both Catholic and Protestant, has exerted on countless aspects of our lives, for good and ill.Complete integration, however, should be the goal. The building blocks of society must mirror the kind of world we want future generations to inherit. No matter how you look at it, denominational schools have become an anomaly. If sectarianism is to become a thing of the past, then so should they."},{"url":null,"title":"tv-review-papers-reveal-people-resolute-determination-journalism-matters","story":"The PapersBBCFour starsPaul EnglishLETrsquoS go for full disclosure.

The ocean liner had been built at Govans Fairfield shipyards, on the Clyde, and, in the aftermath of the Titanic sinking two years earlier, was well equipped with leboats. Still, , souls were lost.The news of that year, of course, was overshadowed by the assassination in the June of  of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and all that came after.It may be hardest for young people, having only ticked off one decade and a bit, but its no easy feat for anyone to imagine le more than  years ago.I though, as I boasted to the teenage pupils, knew someone who had experienced le across  decades, who was a teenager in the s before such things as teenagers had been invented.My Granny Porteous was born in the same month Archduke Ferdinand was shot and she died last week on September , .An astonishing  years old.Granny P would not have called herself astonishing. She would not have been so boastful. She was the kindest of women, never, ever to be heard saying a bad word about anyone.On reaching the grand milestone of  the sure question is \"Whats your secret \" Some centenarians will tell you they like a wee dram a day, others swear by clean living.Ever honest, on her th birthday May Porteous said she had no secret other than \"pure good luck.\" There was a caveat, though, \"walking everywhere and staying active\" was added to the mix.On her th birthday, Granny Porteous was put to work accompanying her family on the piano as they sang her Happy Birthday. That was another remarkable thing, that at  she was still playing the piano, all the music stored in her head and performed with apologies that her fingers were not what they were.Upwards of , its quite fine for knuckles to not behave themselves so well.Granny Porteous married Tom in , a union that lead to four grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.

When she was young she sang in the choir of Wellington Church, in Glasgows Hillhead, taking two trams - even during the blackouts - to make sure she attended.It was a good, decent, generous le full of love for her family.In the deep sadness at losing Granny P is the loss of that generation of our family, the last of our grandparents. My cousins will back me up on this, Im sure: our grans were the benchmark of classic grandmotherliness.On her th birthday, in these pages, I lamented that proper grannies are about to go extinct.At the loss of one more I reflected on that again. The grans I grew up with all, as a matter of course, had the skills we now reserve as kitsch or hipsterish. That my peers consider ironic to learn. My grans could knit, darn and sew .As standard, they could take a pattern and make a dress just as readily as going to the shops. Disposable fashion  No, not after all that effort and certainly not that level of waste - they lived through rationing, you know.Cooking for young women fell out of favour as anti-feminist but these grans could cook and bake, with recipes written on paper, and they would comfort you with food.Any time I visited Granny P the tea and biscuits would be on bone china and cups would rest on saucers. Will a generation of women ever have close cropped perms again  Will they wear pleated skirts, never slacks, on principle I can tell you now that people are very kind to crying strangers. I had hopped in a taxi, full of beans, only to be quietly snfling minutes later as the news of Granny Ps death came in by phone.\"Granny Porteous has died,\" I blubbered at the poor driver.

Her hope that people ldquothink very carefully about the future is sound advice about any subject at anytime. To infer from this some advantage to the pro-UK side of the debate is a strange thought for independence supporters to have given that suggests they are concerned that too much thinking about the future is not good for the cause of separation.Perhaps they are right, but either way, the Queenrsquos comment was fair and little dferent to saying ldquothink carefully and make your own mind up.

Nobody is suggesting perfection, but when Mr Bone writes about an \"SNP-dominated Scotland\" he should remember that the SNP is only dominant in Scotland because the voters have awarded it their trust, voting it into power for a third consecutive term at Holyrood and into first place at the EU elections last May.As for \"Scotlands sensible and stoic past\", I believe I am correct in remembering that in the late s when the very idea of a Scottish Parliament was ridiculed by most Unionists, that the amount of time Westminster devoted to purely Scottish affairs was  hours per year. With the SNP as the third-largest party at Westminster these days are in the past and in the past they must remain Scotland has come a long way with the SNP, and the winning post is in sight.Ruth Marr, Stirling.Read more: David Cameron secretly asked the Queen to back the Union in the  Scottish independence campaign"},{"url":null,"title":"ben-nevis-lit-keep-mountain-peak","story":"A record number of walkers and climbers scaled the UKrsquos highest mountain last year.Overall, an astonishing , people conquered the Ben in , according to figures from the charity which manages the ,ft Highland peak.On the busiest days, more than , hikers, runners and charity racers trekked to the summit ndash leading to ldquolong tailbacks at certain points on the main path.Now up to  walkers will scale the peak at night tomorrow to raise money for the Nevis Fund, which is administered by the Nevis Landscape Partnership, with music, poetry and light to add to the experience.: Ben Nevis tragedy climber: \"I wish we had not done that climb\"The Nevis Landscape Partnership is a collective of environmental organisations, local and national, working together to protect and enhance the land of and surrounding Ben Nevis.Among those benefiting will be Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team, who carry out around  rescues on the Ben each year.The event has been organised by well-known mountain guide Mike Pescod of Abacus Mountain Guides.Mr Pescod said that around pound, had been spent on repairing the bottom end of the path in recent years but that money had now come to an end.ldquoThere is no central regular fund for maintenance of the path and it is getting busier and busier.

None more so than in the ways by which news, whether domestic or international, is obtained and disseminated.The challenge facing the newspaper industry was brought home clearly in the programme with editors balancing print and digital output. The reliance on freelance contributors was a further indication of the reduction in the numbers of those employed directly in the industry and it was clear that the remaining permanent staff were skilled at performing many roles. It was a sign of the times that the Editor-in-chief, Donald Martin, was responsible for overseeing the production of three titles.While the time honoured expression ldquoHold the front page was not recorded, it was clear that the pressure to produce a topical front page in time to meet the production deadline is just as much to the fore as in times past.There seemed little scope for pursuing investigative journalism given the reduced level of funding, though it is possible that this aspect of journalism may be covered in the next episode.In a changing world, the programme provided a valuable insight into how the newspaper industry is, of necessity, adapting to the ways in which we communicate.It emphasised the responsibility which journalists have to maintain the high level of integrity in the industry in the face of others who would attempt to undermine the trust of readers through their attempts to spread ldquofake news.Malcolm Allan, BishopbriggsIrsquove signed up and subscribed to Herald Scotland this morning as a direct result of the first episode of The Papers documentary, which I thought was fantastic.I have been takingnews for free for years ndash but the programme made me clearly and deeply understand the importance of impartial newsand the thought of losing this vitally important voice and resource would be incredibly damaging.

Today people of all ages and all backgrounds are uniting against climate change, and itrsquos going to be a day of historic proportions.

The loss of forest, habitat and wildle is shocking to witness. In Scotland, as in the Amazon, a great forest has been here before but has now gone after centuries of use, depleted until the final old trees decline and fall. Across the Scottish Highlands, over many centuries, grazing by goats, sheep, cattle and wild deer along with felling for timber and farmland, has removed this precious woodland from the hills of Scotland. We need that great forest again ndash now more than ever. Capturing carbon, helping community resilience, reducing flooding risk, improving soils, nurturing bioersity and offering a wonderland for people to explore ndash these are some of the benefits that a rewilded Caledonian Forest can bring.While human activity has been the cause of the loss of so much forest in Scotland and around the world, people are vital to its future. Much of the work Trees for Le has done so far has been with the help of thousands of volunteers who have joined us toforest to remote mountains. As we work in more places at a bigger scale we know that landowners, local communities and businesses need to thrive alongside the wild forest. This means working together to strike the right balance between a forest that can take care of itself and humans being able to make a living from it. The Trees for Le vision is of a revitalised wild forest in the Scottish Highlands, providing space for wildle to flourish and communities to thrive.We welcome action that shines a light on the climate crisis. It is time for those who hold power, from landowners to Governments, to act on what the science has been telling us for decades. We believe that rewilding answers many of the urgent questions climate change is asking. We also recognise it is not the only solution. A mix of solutions is requiredwe are to reverse the effects of humankindrsquos damage to the environment.Scotland was the first country in the world to declare a climate emergency. As a nation leading this agenda we must recognise the time for discussion and debate is over. The solutions to reverse the effects of climate change are available now. Our children are asking for action now. We must respond with action now.bull Steve Micklewright is CEO of Trees for Le:CLAIRE MACKWith some of the planetrsquos most ambitious renewable energy and carbon targets, Scotland is already a world leader on climate action.The Scottish Renewable Energy Festival, which is underway right now , is highlighting our industryrsquos successes to date and our ambitious plans for the future.The announcement earlier this month that the UNrsquos th climate change conference is coming to Glasgow in  gives us a new opportunity, too.Itrsquos an opportunity to make Scotland one of the most climate-savvy nations on Earth.And thatrsquos an opportunity with energy at its heart.Globally, the energy industry is on a multi-trillion dollar journey to decarbonisation, but the production of energy is still one of the largest sources of the carbon emissions which are damaging our planet.Yes, Scotlandrsquos electricity sector no longer belches smoke skywards, and this is certainly something to be proud of.But heat makes up almost double the carbon emissions of electricity. We havenrsquot even scratched the surface of decarbonising it.Transport, too, is a huge issue, and one which can only be resolvedthe public changes the habits of a letime.Those of us who drive a petrol car know its emissions are an issue. But the excuses for choosing fossil fuel over an electric vehicle are all too easy to come up with.And itrsquos the same for heat. When your boiler breaks down, would you be willing to pay more in the short-term for a heat pump, or connect to a district heating network Again, the excuses are many: the short-term costs are too high. The long-term benefits of these choices are too distant. Itrsquos easier to stick our heads in the sand.But therersquos only so long we can ignore the truth: climate change is a threat multiplier.A poll this week found climate breakdown is viewed as the most important issue facing the world, ahead of migration, terrorism and the global economy.Therersquos no more important aspect of our lives to rethink than how we, personally, tackle it.Todayrsquosprotests are part of that story, but so too are the energy industryrsquos actions.The Scottish Renewable Energy Festival is an opportunity to look forward, past COP and medium-term targets, to a low-carbon energy system with renewables at its heart.Irsquom proud that my industry is doing so much to achieve that vision, and heartened that so many people share it.bull Claire Mack, is Chief Executive at Scottish Renewables: The full list of climate strikes taking place across ScotlandMARK RUSKELLThis week the figurehead of the climate strikers, Greta Thunberg, was in front of US Congress.ldquoI donrsquot want you to listen to me, I want you to listen to the scientists, she told US lawmakers.Instead of a written submission, the Swedish teenager handed over the landmark IPCC report, published last year, which gives governments only a decade to slow global warming.That stark warning, based on scientic evidence and which governments signed up to, is what our young people are articulating through direct action today.Thousands of Scottish children and young people share Gretarsquos message. They are telling us to look at the scientic evidence which tells us that the majority of fossil fuels must be left in the ground. They are telling us to plant more trees and save endangered species. They are telling us to get on with it, fast.The Scottish Government claim to be listening to them, butwe look at what our leaders are actually offering in , it seems to me that the message is just not getting through.For example, Nicola Sturgeon likes to talk about Scotlandrsquos lsquoworld-leading targetsrsquo to reduce emissions. But the timescale bares little resemblance to the ten years the IPCC gives us for meaningful change. By the time we meet the net-zero target of , the IPCCrsquos point of nowill be  years old. Greta Thunberg will be .I will be putting forward an amendment to the Scottish Governmentrsquos climate bill which will see an % reduction in emissions by the IPCCrsquos deadline, and I hope that every MSP will put our common future first and back it.But targets arenrsquot enough. Indeed, Scotland missed its existing emissions targets last year.Ultimately, itrsquos action that counts. Bold, ambitious action like a nation-wide programme of works to make every home in Scotland warm, efficient and low carbon, shting billions out of new motorways and into public transport up so people donrsquot need to rely on cars, and reforesting Scotland up to at least the European average.My fear is that this message has not got through to the majority of politicians in Holyrood and around the world. Rhetoric and eye-catching targets will not meet the demands of young people. Next weekrsquos vote on the climate bill must mark the beginning of transformative change.Like Greta told Congress, our young people are telling the UK and Scottish Governments: ldquoYoursquore not trying hard enough.bull Mark Ruskell is MSP for Mid Scotland and FeDR RICHARD DIXONWhen I met -year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg briefly at the climate summit in Katowice in Poland last year I thanked her for all she was doing to bring attention to the need for more climate action. At that point she had been holding her own personal climate strike outside the Swedish Parliament for five months. This had sparked a global movement of school children striking for the climate and, already on her meteoric rise to global prominence, she at the climate conference to give a speech in front of the UN Secretary General.Of course since then she has spoken at the World Economic Forum, in front of huge crowds in a number of languages and to EU leaders. And she has just sailed across an ocean so she can speak at the UN climate summit in New York next week. Politicians who care about climate change are queuing up to be seen with her and last week she was protesting outside the White House with thousands of US students.The movement she started has gone from strength to strength, becoming the largest youth-led movement ever. There have been school strikes across the world and a week of action starts today with millions of people ndash children and adults this time - expected to take part in thousands of marches, rallies and strikes in  countries.Today there will be climate strikes in at least  places in Scotland, including marches with thousands of people expected in Edinburgh and Glasgow.Irsquove been outside Parliament several times to see the climate strikes including the two very impressive big rallies, one where about , young people came and went over a number of hours. The children had organised all this themselves.Over the last decade Irsquove mostly found the speeches at rallies and marches rather dull ndash even when itrsquos me giving the speech! But the children outside Parliament gave speech after speech that was really worth listening to.Irsquoll be there again today because it is really inspiring and heart-warming to see young people and their supporters taking action in such huge numbers on climate change.

This is because four fths of Scotland’s carbon footprint is generated through the heat and energy required to grow, make, process, transport and provide materials that are often tossed aside at the end of their le.Only by considering how to make products with less reliance on raw materials, and by remaking items at the end of their original le into goods that can be used time and again, will businesses be able to signicantly reduce global emissions.Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, who launched the organisation’s corporate plan before an auduence of business leaders last week, said: “We must radically change the way we think about and consume our goods and materials, and we must do that now.” “Too many businesses assume that reducing the cost to the planet means increasing costs for them. “But as we have and will continue to make clear, the opportunities are plentul, with massive savings to be made. “The current way of working cannot continue in the years ahead and successfully adopting a circular economy approach is the only long-term option.”Everything has value and in a circular economy nothing should be wasted. In simple terms, it can be explained as ‘make, use, remake’ as opposed to ‘make, use, dispose’. The ultimate goal is to maintain and improve our quality of le, while simultaneously reducing our material consumption and, by extension, our impact on the planet.Mr Gulland added: “Many Scottish firms are already leading the way, with our help, changing how they design and trade goods to keep materials in use for as long as possible to maximise their value. “Successful circular economy enterprises range from refurbishing computers and upcycling furniture to producing sustainable animal feed using waste generated by our world-famous whisky industry.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.kincardineshireobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Felicitasis just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"   is just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"  Throw a Porridge Party for Mary’s MealsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.kincardineshireobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Left to right - Fiona Cooper, treasurer, Katrina Suer, chair, and Catherine Houston, vice-chair\"  Scouts plea for hut renovation support viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"KINC | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"KINC | Article Teaser\"Zero Waste Scotland estimates that the circular economy would save Scottish businesses collectively at least £ billion every year through benefits including the creation of longer-lasting relationships with customers, as firms switch from a model centred on simply selling products to providing products as services.

I look forward to the project progressing.”Led by ZeroAvia, developers of hydrogen fuel cell powertrain solutions, HyFlyer will demonstrate a phased approach from battery power to hydrogen power, integrating the new technology aboard a Piper M-class six-seater aircraft which will perform test flights out of Cranfield and Orkney.Project partners Intelligent Energy will optimise its high power fuel cell technology for application in aviation while EMEC Hydrogen, producers of green hydrogen from renewable energy, will supply the hydrogen required for flight tests and develop a mobile refuelling  compatible with the plane.The HyFlyer project will see conventional piston engines in propeller aircraft replaced by electric motors, hydrogen fuel cells and gas storage.If all goes well, ZeroAvia, based in Calornia, are aiming to supply the technology to commercial manufacturers by .Following this demonstration, the next goal then is to power an aircraft, carrying up to  passengers, to travel  miles.According to the Air Transport Action Group, aviation is responsible for  per cent of CO emissions from all transport sources and is one of the fastest growing sources of global emissions.Val Mtakhov, founder and CEO of ZeroAvia, said: “The substantial backing provided by the UK Government underlines the potential that hydrogen holds as a fuel source for commercial aviation and provides signicant validation of ZeroAvia’s approach to zero emission flight.“Our project goal of  NM is equivalent to the distance from London to Edinburgh and will prove that zero emission aviation, powered by hydrogen, can play a key role within the UK and other countries’ transport strategies — enabling net zero targets to be met and improving productivity and regional prosperity.”Richard Ainsworth, Hydrogen Project Specialist at EMEC Hydrogen, said: “HyFlyer is another key step in Orkney’s aim to decarbonise leline transport services for islanded communities.#Hydrogen has the potential to help meet our emission commitments where electrons and batteries can’t.#This project sees us one step closer to meeting our fuel and energy needs from abundant local renewable energy resources using green hydrogen.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

All energy consumers pay for the cost of investment in new network capacity so the regulator ensures that it obtains the best deal possible for them.Ofgem launched a consultation in December last year on proposed changes to SSEN’s plan in an effort to ensure value for money for consumers.Following consideration of consultation responses and further analysis, the regulator has decided to approve the plan subject to the conditions set out in its decision.Approval is conditional on a total of at least MW of new wind farm projects on Orkney either being awarded a Contract for Dferenceor being judged likely to be developed by December .Ofgem would expect to be satisfied that new wind farm projects are likely to be developed despite not being awarded a CfDan independent audit states that the project is financially viable, has signed a relevant grid connection agreement and has been granted planning permission.However, SSEN has stated disappointment that the regulator is maintaining its position that the MW of new renewable electricity generation needs to secure planning permission and demonstrate financial viability prior to granting approval for the construction of the link.Ofgem has extended the date in which developers need to meet these conditions from December  to December . SSEN has said this means, in turn, that the construction of the transmission link may be delayed for at least a two-year period,the full time is required to secure the MW target, or shorterthe need is met at an earlier stage.SSEN’s Transmission and Distribution businesses now intend to consult with Orkney developers and other stakeholders to help establish the optimal #whole system# solution in an effort to make the most of Orkney’s renewable potential.Talking about Ofgem#s decision, Rob McDonald, managing director for transmission with SSEN, said: “Whilst we are clearly disappointed with today’s decision, our commitment to work with Orkney developers and other stakeholders to unlock Orkney’s vast renewable potential has not changed.“With both the UK and Scottish Government committed to net zero emissions, we firmly believe Orkney and Scotland’s other two major island groups will have a key role to play in the fight to prevent the worst effects of climate change.“We now look forward to working with developers and other stakeholders on Orkney to collectively explore the best way forward to unlock Orkney’s renewable potential.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The expedition starts on the same day as global climate protests and ahead of a UN climate summit in New York next week.copy -. This site is part of Newsquests audited local newspaper network.

We do not think they are quite right for the city.“Initially, people were trying to steal the bikes to use them, but that changed to wanton destruction – they were hit with hammers and cones. It’s quite depressing.“It used to be localised but is now happening all over, including in the city centre.”Mr Graham said problems at virtual stations had also been caused by winds blowing bikes over, damaging brake levers.More stations will be sited in well-lit, busier areas that are covered by CCTV, with a total of  in operation so far.Mr Graham said the damage had cost thousands of pounds, but this was borne by Serco under its contract with TFE.But he said the rate had fallen signicantly since staff had started promptly picking up bikes not left properly secured after being rented.Mr Graham said he also expected many of the  missing bikes to turn up as they were often abandoned after suffering a puncture, with some in London being recovered after three years.Nextbike, which runs Glasgow’s -bike hire scheme, said vandalism had been “very minimal” and only a few bikes had gone missing.Ian Maxwell, of Spokes, the Lothian Cycle Campaign, said: “It is a great shame Just Eat has to take this move at a time when more and more bikes are being used properly, but using the docking stations should avoid this vandalism.”A spokesperson for official development body Cycling Scotland said: “It’s disappointing to hear this.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable.

Cardiac arrest is a case in point and while only three of patients have been in this specic condition, many more have been suffering from chest pain.Responders grow in experience and expertise, with the group aiming to have an experienced person at each incident to support them. The four committee members have ided this task between them.The more active members are learning fast, particularly through their exposure to NIAS crews and rapid response paramedics, who have been patient and helpful with them.The group held their second monthly members meeting and training event at the end of August and used this to reflect on their experiences, share what they had learned and build vital patient care competence.More members are needed and they are asking people to get in touchthey want to volunteer.

Gareth Bronte on This MorningIt was to be the first time the family had met Gareth and his we Kirsty in the flesh.It made for an emotional segment on the show as presenters Phil Scholfield and Holly Willoughby introduced the story which was captioned ‘A Random ‘Slice’ Of Birthday Kindness’. Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces. Their baby girl lost her brave fight for le after eight days in ICU.Gareth told the show: “In the lead up to what would have been Hannah’s birthday my we and I wanted to do something to mark it. Our little boy Caleb, who is four, came up with the idea of letting a helium balloon go so that it would make its way up to heaven.

Bangladesh finally won its freedom from East Pakistan in  after a bloody, -month war of independence which left up to three million dead.Of late the developing country has been in the headlines for providing shelter to , Rohingya who have fled persecution in neighbouring Myanmar.“Coláiste Feirste was honoured to welcome the Bangladeshi delegation,” said Seán Mistéil. “Minister Chowdhuryexplained the importance of mother languages to nation building and economic well-being. That resonated powerfully with our students.”Minister Chowdhury toured the site of the Gaeltacht Quarter’s next development project: a triangle of disused land which represents one of the last building sites fronting the Falls Road.“We have bold plans to transform this triangle of land into a Gaeltacht housing and tourism project,” added the Coláiste Feirste Chairman. “This vibrant and visionary social development initiative will promote the collective economic capacity of the wider Spórtlann na hÉireann and Coláiste Feirste site. We believe that maximising this hub of interdependent and unique elements is best achieved through a one site vision that connects all of its parts. We have this coordinating vision in place and it has enterprise and exchange at its heart. It is infused with environmental and economic promise and includes a wealth of cultural, sporting and human potential.”The visit of the Bangladeshi delegation was hosted by London-based Study Circle and facilitated by the growing Bangladeshi population of Belfast."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"bone man at key palestine hearing","story":"A BONE man is in the Hague this week as an international observer at a historic hearing on the Palestine-Israeli conflict.Eddie Whyte, who has lived in Norway for over thirty years, is also a member of the Palestine Justice Campaign.Eddie attended the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands as the case got underway yesterday .The case has been brought by Dutch citizen Ismail Ziada against the former Chief of General Staff of the Israeli Defence Force , Benny Gantz, and former Commander of the IDF Air Force, Amir Eshel, over the bombing of the Ziada family home in Gaza.The attack in July  killed six family members from three generations of the Ziada family, including Ismail’s -year-old mother, three brothers, his sister-in-law, a -year-old nephew and a visiting friend. Mr Ziada, who is of Palestinian origin, contends that the attack on the family home was a violation of international humanitarian law and constituted a gross violation of internationally recognised human rights principles.Mr Gantz and Mr Eshel claim immunity from the Dutch court and contend that Mr Ziada should have presented his claim in an Israeli court. Mr Gantz is running for office against Benjamin Netanyahu in the Israeli national elections this week.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Eddie said: “The case is historical in that it is the first time a Palestinian has been able to make use of civil litigation on the basis of universal jurisdiction to gain access to justice for war crimes.“The pursuance of the case has been made possible by an online crowdfunder which received widespread support in Ireland from iniduals, trade unions and human rights organisations and prominent people like Senator Frances Black, award-winning filmmaker Seán Murray and musician Mick Blake. Rock legend Roger Waters has been strongly involved in the campaign.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"hands off our gruffalo say families after colin glen vandalism","story":"PARENTS and day-care service providers say ongoing vandalism at Colin Glen Forest Park’s popular Gruffalo Trail is upsetting families who are coming to visit the attraction. Two of the sculptures from the popular Julia Donaldson-penned Gruffalo tale were completely destroyed after they were set ablaze while others were defaced. Colin Glen Forest Park is home to the unique Trail and has visitors and families from across the city visit daily to see the attraction. Mother-of-two Nicola Marley said that it is “upsetting” for her children when their “favourite character or activity is signicantly damaged or missing” along the Trail.“I participated in a project with the Princes Trust to create a small memorial garden for victims who have lost their lives as a result of mental health issues,” she said. “A lot of hard work and time went into it, many close friends and family of the victims use the garden as a peaceful space to sit and reflect. It is sad that this has now been destroyed too. The park would be a nicer and safer placethe constant vandalism stopped.”Another parent, Janine Belton, spoke of how the Gruffalo Trail “gives the children a wonderful experience and provides them with some learning within nature.” “However, the animal statues have been destroyed, leaving the children confused and sad as they believe that the animals were being ‘hurt’,” she said. Bernadette Devlin, from Colin Sure Start said that vandalism on the Gruffalo Trail was impacting the learning and development of children in the area.“We use that facility a few times a year to bring parents and our children from nought to four age range,” she said.“It promotes the kids’ speech and language, it promotes their social interaction, it helps them learn about their environment and, most of all, it allows them to have fun. It’s local and it’s free of charge, but they are unable to enjoy it as much because of the vandalism of the statues on the Gruffalo Trail. It’s a health and safety issue too because the children like to get their photos taken with the statues, but obviously they can’t do that now. There is one near the entrance and you wouldn’t even be able to identy what it is now.“We just want to make people aware of the impact it’s having on the families who are living in the community.“It’s resource that we’ve had many an enjoyable outing to, and we would like to continue to do that. It has so many benefits for community, butthis vandalism continues we’ll no be able to use it. The safety of the children is paramount to us. We would be very wary of bringing families there because of the vandalism.”Sinn Féin Councillor Séanna Walsh described those behind the destruction as “a handful of disgruntled vandals who are attacking their own community”.“Colin Glen Forest Park is a major asset for this area, the community, council and departments are investing heavily into it and we are looking at a £ million investment package for it,” he said. “The Glider has really opened up the opportunity for people and families to access the park and we have a handful of youngsters who are turning up to try and vandalise it.“The park is set to launch its latest attraction, the toboggan, soon and planning applications are in for zip lines and mountain bike trails. There are big projects planned for the park. We would ask those who behind this vandalism to stay out of it.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"it could pay to back the boks in japan","story":"World rankings are a funny thing. Apparently, Belgium are the top-rated team in world football, ahead of Brazil and the actual world champions France writes our rugby tipster Paddy Tierney.In golf, Englishman Justin Rose moved to world number one ahead of the US Masters despite his one and only major victory coming at the  US Open. With the Rugby World Cup taking centre stage over the coming weeks, it is worth pointing out that Ireland are back to being the top-rated team in the world. That’s Ireland, who are rated as   shots to lt the Webb Ellis Trophy.That’s Ireland who were obliterated - in last month’s warm-up game at Twickenham.It seems back-to-back wins over Wales at Cardf and then Dublin were enough to promote Joe Schmidt’s side back to number one. Yet, Ireland have a painful history at the Rugby World Cup and have failed to make it past the quarter-final stage in eight previous attempts. In , they topped Pool D, but were humbled - by a ravenous Argentina side in the quarters. Their pain was only lessened by the fact that hosts England failed to make it out of Pool A behind Australia and Wales. However, the  winners look a dferent proposition four years on and Eddie Jones’ side are a real threat. They are   to top a Pool C group containing France and Argentina and look set to take on either Wales or Australia, who should finish first and second in Pool D, in the quarters. Pool B looks a shoot-out between world champions New Zealand and South Africa, while Ireland’s opening game against Scotland on Sunday could well determine who tops Pool A. Hosts Japan might have something to say about that and neither side will take them for granted after they caused one of the biggest upsets in the history of the competition by beating South Africa in their opening game of the  World Cup when managed by the aforementioned Jones. Either way, Ireland will face an almighty challenge to better their horrendous World Cup record as they will face either New Zealand or South Africa in the last eight.I think both Ireland and the All Blacks will top their group meaning it will be Scotland versus New Zealand and Ireland against South Africa. While Ireland have proven that they can beat any team in the world on their day, I can’t help but feel like the World Cup arrives  months too late for Schmidt’s men, who seem to thrive when they are written off. The decision to leave Devin Toner at home has ided opinion, while captain Rory Best is now  and will retire after the World Cup. Fitness doubts continue to linger about Johnny Sextonand Keith Earls, while Robbie Henshaw has been ruled out of the Scotland game with a hamstring injury and Ireland look destined for another quarter-final exit with most firms going   on that outcome. Elsewhere, I like the look of Wales at   to top Pool D and I think they’ll end up playing France in the quarter-final. If my predictions are correct, that would leave Warren Gatland’s side taking on South Africa in the last four. Wales are one of the few teams who should match the brute force of the Springboks and I wouldn’t be surprised to see them reaching the decider.That being said, almost every betting preview I’ve read has tipped South Africa as the winner and as much as I hate hopping on the bandwagon, they looked to have assembled one hell of a squad. The other semi-final could be the game of the tournament with world champions New Zealand looking like they are on a collision course with England. Australia could throw a spanner in the works in the quarter-finals, but I’ve a gut feeling fear that England will go very close. Final Prediction Thankfully, their outright odds are   are far too skinny for me to consider the unthinkable, but they may well reach the decider with an England versus South Africa final priced at a tasty-looking  . Back in , the same countries contested the decider in France with South Africa winning - in a cagey affair at the Stade De France and I fancy a repeat of that result at the ,-capacity International Stadium in Yokohama.A certain Bryan Habana was the star of the World Cup  years ago, scoring eight tries and Cheslin Kolbe could be worth a wager in the top-tryscorer market at  . The -year-old winger scored two tries at the weekend as Rassie Erasmus’s side defeated hosts Japan in their final warm-up game -. When you consider that Ireland’s Jacob Stockdale is as low as  , Kolbe looks outstanding value while George North could also be worth an each-way punt at  . The Kolbe South Africa double is also available at  , while those looking a patriotic punt could do worse than back Iain Hendersonto score the first try for Ireland in Sunday’s opening game against Scotland with the Ulster ace available at  ."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"meabh set to sing the anthem at croke park","story":"AN Under- Lámh Dhearg footballer will perform Amhrán na bhFiann in front of thousands of GAA fans on Sunday ahead of the Dublin -Galway All-Ireland Senior Ladies Football Final. -year-old Méabh McNeill told Daily Belfast that she is “super excited” to be singing in front of up , fans at Croke Park ahead of the finale to the ladies football season. “When I was seven myself and my brother went to Scéim Samhraidh at our club, Lámh Dhearg,” she said. “One of the events was learning and singing the national anthem. Two of the leaders at the time Orla Nic Shíomóin and Orla Nig Fhearraigh thought I could sing and had a lovely voice. They approached my dad and askedit was okay for me to sing in the Scór na nÓg. I’ve been singing every year since.”Méabh spoke of how the club’s Cultural Officer, Ronan McHugh “asked me to come back last year to teach the kids how to sing the anthem”. “That is the thing about our club, the kids that attend the summer schemes, and there are now three running, end up coaching younger kids coming through which is fantastic,especially the U- girls.”“I then started singing the national anthem at club events such as juvenile and senior dinners. “Antrim Cultural Officer Bronagh Lennon asked my dadI could sing at some championship games and then onto County Antrim league games. Bronagh has been a great influence and mentor, not only to me but to other kids in the county with her encouragement.”Méabh’s extremely proud dad Joe said all the family will be travelling down to Dublin to support her on Sunday.“There is a big festival on at the club on Sunday and the game will be on in the club after that. We are just so proud.”The Blessed Trinity College student has always had a passion for the performing arts and has performed lead roles in New Lodge Arts High School Musical and Belfast Musical Drama Society’s Hairspray. Following her momentous pitch debut at the Jones’ Road stadium on Sunday, Méabh will be straight into rehearsals for her school’s production of Beauty and the Beast of which she will perform the role of Belle. “I sang the national anthem in front of the Artane Band at Clones, that was a huge honour and an amazing day so imagine what it was like when my dad broke the news to me that I had been invited to sing our national anthem in Croke Park in front of an estimated , people.

He attended Holy Cross Boys Primary School in the district and is also a past pupil of the old St Gabriel’s school.Leaving school at , Thomas admits that the academic world was not for him and he left home soon after to work in England.“School just wasn’t for me,” he explained.“I wasn’t academic but always fascinated by art and photos in newspapers and magazines such as The Observer and Sunday Times magazines.“I left home at  and went to England. There wasn’t much work here at the time and I just wanted to get away from Belfast with all the conflict going on.“I saw so much trouble and bloodshed on the streets. My community was under siege.“You couldn’t get in or out of Ardoyne without getting checked by British Army or RUC.“I was away for a year and worked in construction on building sites in London.

The very minimum enhancement of democratic participation we might have expected is that our , members would be facilitated to set up constituency organisations in the  Northern Ireland Westminster constituencies.\"Shepherded as we are into one Northern Ireland-wide CLP , our members are unable to formally organise in any way at local level. They cannot even open a bank account.\"Given the vast sums the Labour Party extracts from Northern Ireland members and affiliated trade unionists who pay the political levy, we might also have expected some financial assistance with organisation and political research and education.\"The report, which was distributed yesterday, follows an extensive NEC consultation with local Labour Party activists, along with SDLP, Irish Labour Party, and union members.In its conclusion, the document says: \"There is littleany evidence that the Labour Party would find Northern Ireland fertile electoral territory.\"Indeed, given the ongoing Brexit turmoil and the continued Stormont stalemate, it may be unwise to draw any conclusions from recent voting patterns in Northern Ireland which would inform the Partys long-term strategy.\"Given how fundamentally the impact of Brexit could impact politics in Northern Ireland over coming months and years, particularly how it could contribute to the unravelling of the Good Friday Agreement, it would not be a responsible position for the Labour Party to stand candidates at this time.\"The NEC says the Scottish and Welsh Labour parties had been held up as models of \"what an electorally active Northern Ireland Labour Party could look like\". But it notes that in competition with nationalist parties, both Scottish and Welsh Labour had adopted \"their respective national flags in their logos and branding\", with Welsh Labour campaigning bilingually.\"It would also be unsustainable for Labour Party candidates - and possibly elected representatives - to not take a view on contentious issues,\" the report states.\"This would make it exceedingly dficult to establish the Labour Party as the genuine cross-community party many participants want.\"Trade unions in Northern Ireland organise on both sides of the border and both sides of the sectarian ide. If the Labour Party was to stand candidates, andunions affiliated to the party were to support them, there is a signicant risk of causing conflict in the workplace and in union branches.\"The NEC report argues that by becoming \"an active participant in Northern Ireland politics\", a future Labour government couldnt retain its impartiality and neutrality.The document states that the SDLP is Labours sister party, and both are members of the Party of European Socialists. It insists it would not \"unilaterally terminate that relationship\".However, it notes that the SDLP-Fianna Fail partnership \"has the potential to lead to a realignment of politics\" here.It pledges to \"closely monitor how the partnership develops\" and says \"any response to subsequent developments should be made in close collaboration with the Irish Labour Party\" and Party of European Socialists.Mr Black said this gave him hope that the NEC could have a change of heart.He rejected the argument that it would be dficult to establish Labour as \"a genuinely cross-community party\" and said Alliances recent electoral success \"gives the lie to this counsel of negativity\". He denied that Labour candidates would cause sectarian tensions within trade unions and the workplace.\"The point of running Labour Party candidates is that they would take a neutral position on contentious issues and would therefore strengthen, not weaken, the trade unions role,\" he said.\"The argument that Labour candidates would threaten the peace process is just ridiculous. It is the suppression of Labour Party candidates that threatens the peace process by driving Northern Ireland voters further into sectarian politics.\""},{"url":null,"title":"my family is not to blame for barbaric kidnapping insists quinn","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

QIH said his departure was \"by mutual agreement\", but Mr Quinn says he was \"sacked\".Speaking on Shannonside Radio, Mr Quinn said: \"My reaction would be the same as anybody . It would be a sense of outrage.\"He continued: \"It would appear to me to be a fairly barbaric attack … Any proper inidual, anybody with any sense or any morals, would of course condemn that.\"That man has a we and kids. Of course you would condemn it totally.\"But the former billionaire questioned why the finger of blame was being pointed in the direction of his family.\"My family has been on and they are outraged as well. They have been on to me that we are going to take the flak for this and we have been blamed for this and that some people will look our direction at it,\" he said. Mr Quinn said he had \"no correspondence or no dealings, no arguments, no fights\" with QIH since his departure. \"I dont want to be seen as trying to push it off and only condemning it partially. I am condemning it totally and absolutely. There is no way around that. I am just saying it shouldnt still be linked that Sean Quinn is the man that has to condemn this,\" he said.Mr Quinn claimed there was \"an awful lot of conflict\" in relation to the company in recent times in the form of legal proceedings issued against \"former directors, managers, staff, neighbours and friends\".But he insisted he was not caught up in the conflict.QIH director John McCartin said any condemnation of the attack by Mr Quinn was of little comfort. \"What we need is not only those who directly perpetrate these crimes to be brought to heel, but whoever is instigating, procuring and paying for them also to be brought to heel,\" he said.Yesterday, two leading Northern Ireland trade bodies condemned the \"vicious\" attack on Mr Lunney. Gordon Best, regional director of the Mineral Products Association NI, said the attack had come as a \"real shock to us all\".\"Kevin is held in high regard right across the construction materials and manufacturing industry in Ireland and further afield,\" he added.\"In fact I met with Kevin just two weeks ago when Quinn Building Products hosted our health and safety committee in Derrylin. \"Our thoughts and prayers are with Kevin and his family at this dficult time and we wish him a speedy recovery.\"Stephen Kelly, CEO of Manufacturing NI, said: \"The unwarranted assault on Kevin is also an attack on the  employees at Quinns, the whole community in and around Derrylin where the company provides so many jobs and support the local economy, and the entire manufacturing industry across Ireland.\"Kevin and his family are very much in our thoughts and this time and I want to assure him of our best wishes,\" he added.Mr Best and Mr Kelly also said that they would be seeking a meeting with the PSNI Chief Constable, Simon Byrne, to discuss this \"vile\" attack on one of their members directors and to examine in what way their associations can assist the police on both sides of the border to stop the attacks and bring the perpetrators to justice."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38515921.ece/ca563/BINARY/courts%20gavel.jpg","title":"northern ireland bankers trades were astronomic trial is told","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

The expedition starts on the same day as global climate protests and ahead of a UN climate summit in New York next week."},{"url":null,"title":"70 year old marathon man dedicates last run memory","story":"A Derry man who has been running competitively for the past forty years will take part in his last full marathon next month in memory of former club member, Martin Gallagher.Harry McNulty is one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club and a familiar face in the local running circuit.At the age of  he has decided to bow out of full marathons but will continue to compete in shorter distances and will no doubt be seen sporting the famous purple colours of his club as he treks through the streets of Derry or tackles the back roads of Donegal.He grew up in Melmore Gardens, Creggan, and now resides in the Waterside area of the city.The -year-old has run  half marathons and will compete in his st, and final, full marathon on October  in Dublin.Harry comes from a family of seven, five boys and two girls, and his brothers Dessie and Brendan were considered the runners in the family. Tragically, Dessie was killed in a car crash in .“Dessie was the best of us. Him and Brendan were the two runners. Dessie was a great runner at school and then at Sparta where he was captain. He was a very popular fella.“As well as being a great runner he was a great captain. He looked after his charges very well.“Brendan and his we both ran for Northern Ireland and were both very good athletes. Dessie ran shorter distances whereas Brendan ran anything from km right through to the marathon.”Harry was somewhat of a late starter when it came to running, his brothers talked him into it at a time he was overweight in the early s. About a year later he competed in his first marathon in Dublin.He was one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club in . At the time they were told it wouldn’t survive six months, but  years later it now has approximately  members.It is an “all ability club” with dferent groups meeting weekly at Templemore Sports Complex and in the Waterside. “Anybody who wants to run will get the opportunity butyou don’t want to compete you can join to keep fit. We like people to compete but don’t put anyone under pressure to do so.”“I, to be perfectly frank, wasn’t brought in for my athletic expertise, I’m not saying I was useless but would’ve been average, but that fits into the ethos of the club.”Personal bestDespite his modesty, Harry has run impressive times over the years, recording a sub--hour marathon in Belfast. That is no mean feat, it requires dedicated training, and, on the day you have to run an average of around : per mile across the . mile course.Harry recalled his brother Dessie spurring him on as he neared the finish line that day, sadly, it would be the last time he saw him alive.“It was the st of May  and Dessie was killed ten days later on the th. I hadn’t enough long runs coming into it and at the latter stages I was absolutely out of it, really struggling.“Dessie was there at the  mile mark and, in Belfast I don’t know anybody, but I heard this voice shouting ‘Harry, get your head up out of your chest! You’ve come through  mile in : you can break  hours but you’re going to have to work for it’.“It just gave me enough encouragement to keep going. He came round to see me at the finish line. “He had just moved to Belfast and wanted me to see his new house but I had come with a crowd of boys on a train and said I’d be up in a couple of weeks to spend the weekend, to do a bit of running and play some snooker.“But he was killed ten days later.”Marty Gallaghergoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTwenty years later, Marty Gallagher, a young prodigy of Harry’s, was killed in similarly tragic circumstances.Next month fty members of Foyle Valley will take part in this year’s Dublin marathon in memory of Marty who died after being hit by a car on the Racecourse Road while ing home on Halloween night.Martin was -years-old and it will be his th anniversary this year.Reflecting, Harry said: “Marty Gallagher was a lovely young fella, very modest, unassuming, and comes from such a nice family.“He was a member of the club and would’ve been one of my prodigies when he first came into running, I would’ve nurtured him, but then he got to the stage where he was too quick for me and I couldn’t stay with him. I’d have needed a bike to keep up with him.”Harry has been fortunate to avoid serious injury over the years aside from breaking his ankle in . Doctors warned that without an operation he would have chronic arthritis and would never run again.“You learn to live with the fact that on the long runs you’re going to be in pain. I was lucky to get away with running the Derry marathon this year.”After a more recent x-ray, a doctor warned thathe continued at his present rate he would need a new ankle.“I wear an ankle support and patella support, but you’re not going to let stuff like that stop you,” he added.CamaraderieSpecial club memories include a time when members competed in the All Ireland Marathon Championship in Mallow Co. Cork, in . They won the senior marathon and veteran’s championships.As winners they had the honour of hosting the competition in Derry the following year. It was a very successful event which stands out as one of the clubs highlights.Harry finished second in the veterans team and his brother Brendan competed well in the senior team.Looking back at other fond memories, Harry cited the Walled City Marathon in , which was the first marathon to be held in Derry for many years.“I thoroughly enjoyed it, along with the London marathon, I’ve done four of them, and the Great North Run, which I’ve done twice.“But the club itself, the camaraderie is just unbelievable. It’s a social outlet more than anything . In terms of the people, not just at Foyle Valley but running in general, there are very few people I’ve met through running that I could say I didn’t like, they’re all good hearted, good natured people, and help you in any way they can. They’re gracious in defeat and generous in victory.“Foyle Valley has a great family atmosphere,someone is training for a marathon they will always train with you and help you through. That’s part of the ethos of the club.”Fitness has become an essential component of many people’s lives as experts regularly expound on the benefits to both physical and mental health.Therefore, the emergence of new clubs, and the introduction of couch to k runs, has been “one of the best” things to happen in the city in Harry’s view. “The people behind these clubs love their running and are so friendly. They got people out who never would’ve necessarily been interested in running, and now they’re doing half marathons and marathons - that’s fabulous.”"},{"url":null,"title":"department weighing medical school options","story":"The Department of Health is assessing the cost-effectiveness of locating a Medical School in Derry and said any final decision will require ministerial sign off.The Medical School forms part of Derry’s City Deal proposals and as such the local council is engaging with the UK government to see “ this project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.”The Ulster University has been for some time considering the development of a Graduate Entry Medical Schoolto be located in Derry and this project proposal features heavily in the Derry City  Strabane District Council’s economic regeneration plans for the region.With the support of the Local Council the University partners have been engaging with a number of NI Departments in an effort to progress this proposal.A spokesperson for UU confirmed that as part of its latest business case it aims to have its first academic year of enrolments for the GEMS in  .The Northern Ireland Department of Healthis acutely aware of the pressures on the medical workforce across Health and Social Careand its key role in leading the transformation of services set out in Delivering Together.Accordingly, DoH commissioned a Medical School Places Review, led by Professor Keith Gardiner, to determine the optimum number of medical school places that Northern Ireland requires per year. His report, published on  January , raises challenging, long-term, strategic and cross-cutting questions with major financial implications.Amongst other issues, it recommends expanding medical training places by at least  per year, potentially costing up to an additional £m per year when fully implemented. This report is a key consideration of UU in putting forward its proposal for a medical school in Derry.While DoH has been assisting UU in the development of its Outline Business Casefor a Graduate Entry Medical School at Magee Campus, this is separate from any decision on medical student expansion in Northern Ireland. Feedback was provided on  July  to the fourth iteration of the OBC.Any commissioning of additional medical places for Northern Ireland must address comprehensively the full range of available options, with a particular focus on the assessment of value for money and affordability for health and social care, the report says.“For example, rather than simply expanding medical student numbers, it will be important to explore lower-cost measures likely to increase the supply of medics over the short-term and which enhance and maximise the signicant investment currently being made in undergraduate medical education.“DoH is developing a business case to consider these matters. Given the cross-cutting nature and potential for signicant associated costs with the Medical School business case, the DoH Permanent Secretary has advised that any decision on this or other long-term options, must be considered by Northern Ireland Executive Ministers.”It added: “The provision of HE places in NI or the establishment of a medical school in Derry is a devolved matter, however, the Derry  Strabane City District Council is presently engaging with UKG to considerthis project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.“The medical school is one part of a wider package of proposals currently under consideration with other draft proposals included that could complement existing specialties at the Magee Campus.“The development of the Council’s final bids for a City Deal from the Inclusive Future Fund is still ongoing and as of August , there has been no official final bid submitted for either funding stream to UKG, including no formal bid to provide funding to a Derry medical school.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: projected image of what Magee will look likeexpanded with Graduate Entry Medical School by the riverfront."},{"url":null,"title":"derry homeowners left shaken burglary waterside area city","story":"Detectives are appealing for witnesses and information following the report of a burglary at a house in the Grovemount Court area of Altnagelvin, Derry, on Thursday  September.Detective Sergeant Boyd said: “It was reported that entry was gained to the property between am and pm on Thursday.

This is much too important an issue.The momentum is with the North West and with the campaign for an independent university."},{"url":null,"title":"government report casts doubt magee expansion","story":"A report published by the Secretary of State for NI has cast further doubt over expansion at Magee by raising a number of concernsThe report states that in , DfE received a joint proposal from Ulster Universityand Council for a scaled expansion of the University’s Magee Campus to , full-time students from its existing ,, as well as an additional  full time students delivered via the North West Regional College .The proposition was the delivery of an increased supply of skilled graduates, togetherwith regional benefits that could flow to the North West.Planned expansion of the university campus is largely dependent on City Deal funding.At a recent Council meeting, it was revealed that projects linked to Ulster University will receive £m, at least a third of the City Deal funding, which currently stands at £m but is projected to be £m-£m with the Council expected to contribute £m and other partners making up the shortfall.The UU projects include the Graduate Entry Medical School, whose financial viability has been cast into doubt by Head of the NI Civil Service David Sterling. Alongside that are centres of innovation and excellence in data analyticsand robotics and automationand a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence .Julian Smiths report says the proposals to expand Magee had signicant funding consequences from a capital infrastructure perspective, approximately £m, and from a resource funding perspective.The proposal would require Higher Education in NI to be placed on a sustainable footing, comparable with England, from which expansion would take place.According to the report, there would also be, as with any requested expansion or increase to student numbers, resource grant consequences of funding the proposed additional places at UU and NWRC, and associated student support costs, circa £m.\"The £m capital cost was highly indicative and based on an assumed cost per square metre per student.\"The Department for the Economyundertook initial work to determine how it would look at the case,there was an agreement on how the sector as a whole could be sustainably funded, as any expansion in student numbers would not make sense without this in place,\" it said.In February , DfE wrote to, and is awaiting a response from, UU requesting that an update be made to the case, according to the report.DfE asked for a more accurate assessment of capital need, which was \"very theoretical\" in the original proposal and created a signicant cost requirement. It wants a review of the number and subject level mix of additional students required to ensure an underpinning alignment with graduate postgraduate economic need in subject areas proposed.Furthermore, the department requested information around phasing of the project to assessthere are \"more suitable break points\" in the proposal and a potential to scale any expansion both in terms of student numbers and capital development.And sought the \"rationale\" for locating additional higher education places in the Magee Campus, as opposed to other geographical locations with further and more detailed explanation in relation to sub-regional economic benefits.This information will be critical to enabling a strategic approach to HE provision and in feeding into any final business case that might be put forward for this proposal, it concluded.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot

asked does UU have any update or response regarding the medical school and concerns raised by David Sterling around the need for ongoing funding which UU is not prepared to invest   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Following cross-party political and health and social care support in  for Ulster University’s Graduate Entry Medical School, the University has continued to proactively develop the project, working closely with the Department and other relevant partners. Our responses to any remaining clarications within the Graduate Entry Medical School business case were submitted

outlined within the updated business case is  .“As the Department of Health has previously confirmed that any decision on funding can only be made by Ministers, the University is not actively recruiting medical students as yet for  entry until that decision on funding can be reached.· If funding was confirmed, all other elements of the proposal for our medical undergraduate degree programme have been firmly on track including continued progress with the GMC, clinical placement opportunities and the development of a curriculum to meet the needs of healthcare locally.“We value the continued support of all those who share our vision for medical education and we continue to work with the General Medical Council, St George’s University of London and local clinicians and partners building on our existing leadership in medical and healthcare provision to take forward graduate entry medical education for Northern Ireland.\"What does UU say in response to local councillors representatives who have claimed that UU has neglected the Magee campus for decades and should not be given money as part of the City Deal but should instead invest its own money in Derry   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Ulster University continues to invest in the Magee campus, most recently with the state-of-the-art £m teaching block which signals our ambition for higher education in the city, already enhancing campus le and paving the way for enhanced future capacity at Magee.    This and other investment priorities for students have resulted in a very strong performance for the Magee campus across all elements of the  National Student Survey, reflecting the very positive reaction from our students to these recent investments in University le at Magee.  With all four faculties of the University represented on the Magee campus – across health sciences, arts and humanities, business and computing and engineering, we are pushing boundaries and breaking new ground in emerging sectors as a progressive university, shortlisted for the prestigious Times Higher Education University of the Year Award, .“Our contribution to the City Deal opportunity is a signicant step forward in our collective opportunity to realise the full ambitions of this vibrant university city.  Our City Deals proposal will see us apply our expertise to help maximize the city’s potential in this unparalleled opportunity to boost economic growth and prosperity.  In our continued collaboration with industry partners, we look forward to driving innovation in personalised medicine, cognitive analytics, robotics and automation, leading to both new research posts and learning opportunities for additional students.  The proposed riverfront innovation hub will build upon the expertise of our first data analytics Institute, opened in  and headquartered at Magee campus, and which cemented our reputation as a global leader in this field. Also integral to the City Deal remains our commitment to establishing a Graduate Entry Medical School in a bid to address the challenges of a healthcare system at breaking point.   City Deal recognises the crucial role our University can play as an economic engine in the North West and is a major boost to the collective ambitions of the city and region.  We look forward to the development of our projects in partnership with industry, civic and educational partners.\"How much money will be needed in total to fund the projects put forward as part of the City Deal A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"The funding contributions by project across City Deal and the Inclusive Futures Funds are indicative at this stage, based on the allocations provided by Council, and subject to adjustment as we go forward.  Our contribution of % University funding to the Magee projects within City Deal reflects our belief in the impact they will make, and our commitment to playing our part in the collective ambitions of City Deal.“City Deal enables us to build further on our academic strengths that are signicant for the region’s growth, and to make sure that this expertise across world class research and progressive student learning works hard for the benefit of all in the city region. The City Deal bid has education, innovation, job creation and skills development at its core and each of these priorities are also central to our work across both teaching and research.  We are therefore a natural fit and a committed partner in this ambitious bid.  A continued collaborative approach is essential as we prepare to take forward the projects through planning and design and development of the business cases.”"},{"url":null,"title":"food festival leaves newtown smiling","story":"Saxophone Sundae entertains festival goers at this years Newtown Food Festival. ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtPicture: Rob Davieslt spangtlt spangt\" Food festival leaves town smilingThree cyclist from Hafren Cycle Club who wil be competing in the Chrono des Natiltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtons in Les Herbiers ltspan classtruncate-full-screengtVendeacutee meet members from the twining association at this years Newtown Food Festival.

The upgrading of the pitch is certainly sustainable financially, given the amount of usage it would get.ldquoWe have lost  teams to other leagues in the past few years and they have all cited poor facilities as their main reason for moving to play in the the Lisburn or South Belfast Leagues, he added.Mr Torney said it was essential that proper facilities were put in place to enable the league to avoid weekly postponements of games.ldquoWe are left every year with a fixture congestion because of postponements and in order to arrest the haemorrhaging of clubs from the league we must address this issue immediately.The league are being supported by South Down MP Chris Hazzard, who has called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to ldquofinally deliver fit for purpose pitches for the local community in Downpatrick.He continued: ldquoThe current provision of sports pitches at Dunleath Park is nothing short of a disgrace.ldquoDunleath Park is used extensively by the Downpatrick Youth Football League with hundreds of young footballers playing each weekend, but yet againthis week, parts of the pitches have been closed to the public as raw sewage has come to the surface.ldquoIt is an absolute shame that in the shadow of our fantastic new leisure centre here in Downpatrick our local young people are expected to make do with substandard pitches that not only flood for most of the winter months, but are regularly polluted with raw sewage.Mr Hazzard believes that Downpatrick deserves much better treatment.ldquoAs the county town, Downpatrick deserves to have the very best in local sports provision, and that simply isnrsquot the case at the moment.ldquoIt is deeply disappointing that so many of our young footballers are left to travel to Lisburn and Belfast each weekend to play football. That must not be allowed to continue.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWhilst there is no getting away from the fact that Dunleath Park is in a flood plain area, I would have sympathy with local sports clubs that feel that this is too easily put up as a hurdle to any investment, and that the council should actively consider a range of solutions in order to deliver suitable facilities.ldquoI want to thank those local sports clubs and Downpatrick Youth League representatives who continue to work tirelessly in order to provide local sporting opportunities for our young people and I will now be making representation to senior council management in order to make all their voices heard..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan forest cycle in the park family event in aid of Knockevin Special School  ","story":"ALL roads lead to Castlewellan Forest Park this Sunday for a special event to raise money for Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick and celebrate the benefits of cycling for everyone.The lsquocycle in the parkrsquo event is being organised by the schoolrsquos Parent Staff Association to raise funds to help purchase new bikes for pupils to help them experience nature and the great outdoors.Sundayrsquos all ability event mdash which runs from am until pm ndash is being billed as a celebration of cycling and will have something for families and special needs adventurers, hard core mountain bikers, club riders, children and young people.The event is being hosted by the Kilmegan Velo Cycling Club with its chairman, Sean Warnock, inviting all cyclists to make their way to the forest park for the event.He said: ldquoThe aim is to get families and friends to experience cycling in a safe setting but full of adventure and we have events for all abilities.ldquoThere will be family trail quests, agility skills for kids, a full time-trial on the red trails, special needs bikes and a Sunday club fuel stop.

Title deeds, usually the easiest of documents to trace, have become impossible to track down.Three people are laying claim to the pier alone and a legal row is pending about whether a contract was broken over the sale of pier some time ago.Against this backcloth, Down council official have been trying to bring the harbour into public ownership since the publication of the Governmentrsquos cash-help promise in July . Before then they had already spent four years attempting to trace owners.This week councillors decided to end their six-year search and apply for vesting mdash a statutory power which enables a Government department to buy land compulsorily, despite the wishes of the owner.But they were warned by council administrative officer, Mr Owen OrsquoConnor, that it would be a dficult vesting order and he could not guarantee that the whole of the inner bay of Killough would be acquired before December.The last-ditch attempt to beat the deadline was sparked off by Downpatrick councillor, Mr John Ritchie, who has been trying to push the council into buying the harbour since .

A corporate body has almost been directed to include a political representative on its deputation. This will create tensions which this council and district can do without.Mr Sean Quinnthought it was ldquorather arrogant of the minister to make the suggestion and he believed that Mr Powell was like previous South Down MPs, who, he said, had not satisfactorily served the constituency.Official Unionist councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, said she would resent it as much as anybodyshe felt the councilrsquos powers were being usurped, but on this occasion she thought it was only natural that Mr Powell should join the deputation.She told councillors: ldquoMr Powell has worked consistently very hard for all sections of the community and nobody could accuse him of working for one party or another. He is one of the best constituency MPs at Westminster.A motion by Mrs Smyth to invite Mr Powell on the deputation was defeated by nine votes to seven mdash a defeat which did not go down well with Official Unionist, Mr William Finlay, who told the SDLP members: ldquoThat was just a political vote.

We appreciate that while this may only be the start of the process, we would call on the landowners to talk to us and the local council.Mr Gardiner added: ldquoOur door is open and we are happy to chat. We very much view ourselves as good neighbours. We hope that moving forward agreement can be reached.Since , work has progressed and a number of studies completed in an effort to advance the planned railway extension, including the completion of a revised business case, along a disused section of line.Council officials argue that the planned extension would help the local authority meet of one its key objectives in transforming the district into one of Irelandrsquos premier tourist destinations and help attract and promote economic investment, enhancing the visitor experience.In addition, council officials are confident that extending the heritage railway line would assist with the regeneration of a rural area.The local authority said attempts to negotiate a settlement with three landowners at the Ballydugan end of the railway line had not been successful.As a result, the local authorityrsquos lawyers are to be asked to proceed with a vesting application to allow heritage railway officials to progress discussions with prospective project funders.Downpatrick councillors Cadogan Enright and Dermot Curran have welcomed the proposal to vest the land.Cllr Enright mdash who formally proposed that the vesting process should commence mdash said the former Down Council earmarked finance to acquire the land to pave the way for the railwayrsquos extension.He said given the inability to persuade current owners of unused track bed toit to public ownership ldquovesting has become necessary.Cllr Enright added: ldquoWe have been trying to get this done voluntarily for the past  years and more and I am delighted that the Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee is backing the proposal to proceed with vesting.Cllr Curran said the local railway had been a ldquomajor success since it opened and had managed to secured hundreds of thousands of pounds in funding from a iety of sources to provide an attraction which is second to none.ldquoThe railway is one of the most popular attractions of its kind in Northern Ireland and has had ambitious expansion plans on the table for some time, he continued.ldquoThe local authority has put tourism at the top of its agenda and extending the railway, I believe, would be a major boost for the area. An extended railway would also be able to ferry punters to and from Downpatrick racecourse on race days.Cllr Curran said he hopes that the vesting process can be completed smoothly and relatively quickly with agreement between all the parties to allow the railwayrsquos extension plan to proceed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Safety.jpg","title":"Safety upgrade work begins at roundabout  ","story":"WORK has started on a major safety upgrade at one of the districtrsquos most busiest roads.Contractors moved on site at the Dundrum Rod roundabout in Newcastle on Monday to provide new puffin crossing points which will require traffic to come to a complete stop to allow people to cross the road.The new crossings are being provided at the Dundrum and Castlewellan road sides of the roundabout and will replace existing zebra crossings. The work is scheduled to last five weeks.Major concerns voiced by residents and local politicians about pedestrian safety at this part of the resort mdash where there have been countless near misses particularly at the Dundrum Road side of the roundabout mdash prompted roads officials to act. Some pedestrians have also been struck by vehicles.The provision of new puffin crossings will result in traffic lights being provided either side of the roundabout, with the move welcomed by Mournes councillor, Willie Clarke.He described the provision of the new crossings as a ldquolong overdue priority for pedestrian safety in Newcastle explaining that they will help reduce pedestrian collisions and near misses at a particularly busy part of the resort.ldquoAlong with other elected representatives, community and residentsrsquo groups, the local Policing and Community Safety Partnership and the public I have campaigned for the replacement of the zebra crossing with a controlled lights crossing, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoI have campaigned for this road safety measure for over a decade and am delighted work has started this week. I would also urge motorists to be patient and allow more time for their journeys over the next five weeks as the work progresses.Describing the new road safety measure as a lsquolong overdue priority, Cllr Clarke said the new crossings will be warmly welcomed.He said that also as part of the scheme, a new footpath will be created at the Castlewellan Road side of the roundabout linking the new puffin crossing at the Dundrum Road side.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoThe ongoing work will provide safe, controlled crossing facilities and will assist with reducing personal injury collisions recorded at the roundabout.News of work starting on the new crossings comes weeks after roads officials scrapped another proposal to address road safety and congestion issues at the roundabout.The Department of Infrastructure was planning to create a new dedicated filter lane at the Dundrum Road side of the roundabout, designed to enable drivers entering the resort from this direction, wishing to access the Castlewellan Road, to do so without causing major tailbacks.The scheme mdash which had not been fully costed mdash would have left two existing lanes for the exclusive use of traffic heading into the centre of Newcastle.Roads engineers were confident that the proposal would have signicantly reduced congestion, but it was recently confirmed at a special meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council that the plug had been pulled on the scheme.Local politicians were told that the project was not viable given the number of underground utilities at this part of the resort. However, roads officials confirmed that they are in the process of drawing up an alternative scheme, the detail of which they hope to unveil shortly..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Smyth.jpg","title":"Smyth first home at Finnebrogue Woods  ","story":"OVER  athletes took part in inaugural M B McGrady  Co Chartered Accountants Beer and Bubbles charity run at Finnebrogue Woods last Thursday night.Sunny weather made for perfect running conditions for the race that took place in Finnebrogue Woods, on the outskirts of Downpatrick.Prizes were awarded to fastest male, David Smyth and fastest female, Carissa McLister, who completed her first ever km race.

It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces.

He said thatthe arrangements change in the future then the Assembly should “have a say”..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button However, unless Stormont had a veto – something the EU has firmly opposed – then its views could simply be overridden. When askedthere should be a veto, Sir Jeffrey said: “If you want to expand cross-border cooperation, that has to be approved by both the Assembly and by the Irish parliament. That is what the agreement says.“Now,the objective of these new arrangements is to ‘protect the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement’ – and so say Dublin, so say the SDLP, Sinn Fein, the Alliance Party, et al –that is the objective, then why would you want to remove the role from the Assembly in deciding whether you change the nature of that cooperation ”Referring to future changes to EU regulations, he said: “If there are elected representatives from Northern Ireland who say we should have no say in that, then how do they propose we represent the people that elect them on matters that are important to all of us ”Lord Empey, one of the UUP negotiators of the agreement, said it was ironic that the DUP was now reliant on the deal it once derided. He said: “We have indeed come to a strange place when the DUP is now publicly defending an agreement which they sought to destroy and did all they could to wreck, having finally realised that the only protection we now have is the Belfast Agreement. Ulster Unionists will be particularly interested in the comments from Arlene Foster and Jeffrey Donaldson, given that they left the UUP, supposedly because of the Belfast Agreement.”Rates burden on Larne businesses is too high — enough is enough Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingElderly NI woman who dies after road traffic collision is namedN.I. heartbreak as promising young footballer dies suddenlyEx-GAA player apologises after shouting lsquovilersquo pro-IRA slogans at loyalist band things we could do in Northern Ireland in the s but cant do nowYoung woman assaulted at N.I. bus stop -

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jm_1.jpg","title":"how do you retain staff and keep them enjoying their job","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business With such intense competition for talent, the challenge for employers isn’t just finding prospective candidates, it’s also keeping them, writes John Moore, managing director of Hays NI Astonishingly, almost half of professionals surveyed in the Hays What Workers Want Report said that they left at least one new job within the first  months because it didn’t match expectations formed during the application process. A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/greggssss.jpg","title":"greggs to open new belfast city centre store","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Greggs looks set to open a new store in the heart of Belfast city centre, it can be revealed.
