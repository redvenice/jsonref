The same year, Congress passed the National Prohibition Act, which was known as the Volstead Act for the congressman who helped to pass it, to enforce Prohibition. President Woodrow Wilson vetoed the act, but Congress overrode it.The act took effect on January 16, 1920 – the start of Prohibition. The amendment enjoyed popular support, Rorabaugh wrote, and consumption of alcohol during the early 1920s ‘may have dropped by two-thirds.’However, gangsters and the mob took over the alcohol trade and were earning enormous sums of money - for instance, a 12-bottle case of Canadian liquor went for $250, six times the price before Prohibition - by the mid-1920s, according to the book.‘Gang violence turned many Americans against Prohibition,’ Rorabaugh wrote. On February 14, 1929, seven men were shot in the morning in Chicago  on what became known as the Saint Valentine’s Day Massacre. Reportedly, Al Capone ordered the hit on his rival George ‘Bugs’ Moran and his gang. Moran escaped death, Capone was the king of Chicago but the notorious crime shook the nation.      Above, the front page of the New York Daily Mirror, owned by William Randolph Hearst, on December 5, 1933 that touted the end of Prohibition. The start of Prohibition was January 16, 1920 and it took until the ratification of 21st Amendment on December 5, 1933 for it to end. The 21st Amendment repealed the 18th Amendment, which prohibited the ‘manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors’          The ladies and bartender were all smiles after the repeal of Prohibition on December 5, 1933. Known as Repeal Day, its 85th anniversary is this week. People still drank during Prohibition - they were discreet about it. Speakeasies and private clubs flourished during the time period. People also imbibed at ice cream stores, soft drink shops, beauty parlors, and funeral homes, and, of course, at their homes, according to W.J. Rorabaugh\u0027s recent book, ‘Prohibition: A Concise History’          During Prohibition, speakeasies lacked signs, had bouncers to screen customers, and in some instances only admitted those ‘who knew the correct code words or had printed passes,’ according to W.J. Rorabaugh\u0027s book, ‘Prohibition: A Concise History’. They also admitted women. Above, people celebrate at a repeal party on December 5, 1933 - the official end of Prohibition as the 21st Amendment repealed the 18th - at the Casino Bleu at the Hotel Baltimore in New York City          On December 5, 1933, the 21st Amendment was ratified and Prohibition officially ended. Above, one of the first legal sales of liquor at Bloomingdale\u0027s in New York City on December 5, 1933, which is known as Repeal Day, as other men waited in line for their chance to buy alcohol          Franklin Delano Roosevelt, then the governor of New York, ran for president in 1932 on the platform that he would repeal the 18th Amendment, thus ending Prohibition. He won the presidency and wasted no time after his inauguration on March 4, 1933, signing soon after the Beer and Wine Revenue Act, which allowed for the sale of beer that contained 3.2 percent alcohol. But most importantly, it levied a tax on all alcoholic beverages. The act went into effect on April 7, and the government started collecting taxes almost immediately. Above, people toasted with beer at a Chicago hotel on April 7          Some consider April 7, 1933 to be the end of Prohibition. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Beer and Wine Revenue Act, which allowed for the sale of beer, on March 22, and it took effect on April 7. In the image above, a crowd gathers on Broadway in New York City to celebrate that act and a beer keg is held aloft toward the bottom right near the subway sign          Prohibition began on on January 16, 1920 and made it illegal to manufacture, sell or transport alcohol in the United States. Dubbed the \u0027noble experiment,\u0027 it was the attempt to make the country \u0027dry\u0027 and get people to abstain from alcohol, which was from blamed for many societal issues, such as domestic violence, crime and child abuse. Above, men destroyed bottles of whiskey and beer on November 20, 1923          In the 1920s, infamous Chicago gangster Al Capone (left) made made around $100 million - around $1.3 billion in today\u0027s money - a year in the illicit trade and from other illegal activities. Capone reportedly ordered the hit on his rival George ‘Bugs’ Moran (right) and his gang on what became known as Saint Valentine’s Day Massacre on February 14, 1929. Seven men were shot in the morning in Chicago. Moran escaped death, Capone was the king of Chicago but the notorious crime shook the nation          The Saint Valentine’s Day Massacre on February 14, 1929 shocked the nation. Gangster Al Capone reportedly ordered the hit on his rival George ‘Bugs’ Moran and his gang. Seven men were shot that morning in Chicago. Above, the shop where it took place sometime in 1934          ‘Gang violence turned many Americans against Prohibition,’ W.J. Rorabaugh wrote in his recent book, ‘Prohibition: A Concise History.’ In the above image, onlookers watched as the victims of the Saint Valentine’s Day Massacre on February 14, 1929 in Chicago were taken away. Although he was never tried for the crime, Al Capone reportedly ordered the hit on his rival George ‘Bugs’ Moran and his gang that morning when seven men were shot and killed          The federal government tried to get illegal liquor off the street, and there is old film footage of agents busting open beer barrels and pouring the libation into sewers as well as bottle after bottle after bottle of hard spirits being emptied. In the image above, John A. Leach, New York City\u0027s deputy police commissioner (right), watched as agents pour liquor into sewer following a raid sometime in 1921          On Long Island, police raided and seized $20,000 worth of liquor in January 1930. During Prohibition, law enforcement tried to enforce the ban on the sale of alcohol, and bottles of liquor as well as barrels of beer were often poured out          From January 16, 1920 until December 5, 1933, it was illegal in the United States to ‘manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors,\u0027 and the country was supposedly \u0027dry.\u0027 But people still drank and an illicit trade in alcohol flourished. In the above image, contraband beer was emptied out onto the street sometime during Prohibition          There was less alcohol consumption during Prohibition, in part because it was so expensive to buy. For instance, a 12-bottle case of Canadian liquor went for $250, six times the price before the ban on ‘manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors.’ The above image shows a tower of barrels of alcohol sometime in 1930          Above, a woman next to a sign that supported the repeal of the 18th Amendment in 1927. The ratification of the 21st Amendment - which repealed the 18th Amendment - on December 5, 1933 marked the official end of Prohibition. While initially some supported Prohibition, gang violence stemming from the mob\u0027s and bootleggers\u0027 illicit alcohol trade turned some Americans against Prohibition           When the stock market crashed in 1929 and the country was plunged into the Great Depression, the push to repeal the 18th Amendment and end Prohibition intensified. In New York, workers, above, protested against Prohibition and carried signs stating \u0027We want beer\u0027 sometime in 1930          Franklin D. Roosevelt won the presidency in 1932 partly because he wanted to end Prohibition. One of his first acts in office was signing the Beer and Wine Revenue Act, which allowed for the sale of beer, on March 22, 1933 and it took effect on April 7. The act also gave the government the power to levy taxes on alcohol, bringing in much needed revenue during the Great Depression. Above, people protested Prohibition and called for the repeal of the 18th Amendment          Women were both a force for the Temperance Movement in the early 1820s as well as later fighting for the end of Prohibition, as shown in the above photo, taken on July 3, 1930 in Birmingham, Michigan          In the above image, a woman holds beer while on top of beer barrels in 1933. The sale of beer was allowed after President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Beer and Wine Revenue Act on March 22, 1933. It took effect on April 7. Prohibition officially ended on December 5, 1933 when the 21st Amendment, which repealed the 18th, was ratified          Above, workers unloaded crate of beer at a New York brewery after the official end of Prohibition on December 5, 1933. On that day, the 21st Amendment was ratified, which repealed the 18th Amendment.

It has already affected the lives of nearly three million girls and young women across sub-Saharan Africa.Its CEO, Lucy Lake, who was with the sixth in line to the throne in Zambia, revealed to the Mail that she had briefed his wife privately at Kensington Palace earlier this year about their work in the country, as well as Zimbabwe, Ghana, Tanzania and Malawi.The Duchess was also met with Zimbabwean-born Angeline Murimirwa, one of the first girls to go to secondary school with the organisation\u0027s support and is now its African executive director. She was named last year as one of the BBC\u0027s 100 most inspirational women.Lucy said: \u0027We had the opportunity to meet with the Duchess in the spring. As an organisation our team very much represents what we are working towards and that was why the Duchess was interested to meet with us and hear more about that.\u0027The way both she and her husband have spoken about these issues in such a thoughtful and discerning manner has really helped the wider movement. It\u0027s exciting times.\u0027We have been working for 25 years supporting girls through education and enabling those young women to make the transition in their communities into positions of leadership, to turn around and support the next generation.\u0027It\u0027s wonderful that the Royal Family is engaging with the issue in this way. For the young people in Zambia to feel that Prince Harry was on a level with them and genuinely interested in what they are doing, left them very inspired and motivated, as was he. That\u0027s a very powerful force. \u0027            It is understood that she and Harry (seen at their wedding on May 19) are keen to work together on the issue in their role as roving Commonwealth youth ambassadorsIt is hoped that the pregnant duchess will be able to travel out to Africa and see CAMFED\u0027s work for herself after she has had her baby next spring.Royal sources say the duchess has been having meetings with a number of organisations and is still finalising which areas to work in and what charities to support as she moves on with her public work.It is understood that she is particularly keen to support issues where she can work alongside her husband.Aides hope to make an announcement about her first patronages in the new year, eight months after she joined the Royal Family.Although it is considered quite a long time to wait before announcing her patronages, it is understood that Meghan wishes to \u0027really get to know\u0027 the organisations she wants to work with in order to make a \u0027real and lasting\u0027 difference.                           "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/12/04/19/054AB3B2000007D0-0-image-a-10_1543951528979.jpg","title":"PIERS MORGAN Ex friend Meghan Markle ruthless social climbing actress used getting way","story":"    I met Meghan online in 2015 when I became a fan of \u0027Suits\u0027, on which she costarred with, among others, Rick Hoffman, seen just to her left in this cast photo          Within minutes of me following her on Twitter, she sent me this Direct Message - and we started corresponding on a regular basis for the next yearWithin minutes, she sent me a private Direct Message: ‘Well hello there – thanks for the follow. Big fan of yours!’I replied, and for the next few months, we corresponded on a regular basis.We’d chat about everything from US gun violence (she shares my horror of it) to a charity trip she made for the United Nations to Rwanda, spinning classes, calligraphy, and our joint hatred of 4am filming call-times - hers for Suits and mine for Good Morning Britain in the UK.She even started sending me early preview episodes of her show so we could debate juicy storylines yet to air – which we did, at length.Meghan introduced me via cyberspace to another Suits cast member, Rick Hoffman - who played Louis Litt – and he and I also began to regularly correspond. He described their relationship to me as so close it felt like ‘brother and sister’.In February 2016, Rick came to London and at my invitation, he appeared on Good Morning Britain.Nobody really knew who he was here, nor Meghan for that matter, but we had a fun interview and I sent the photos to Meghan afterwards - who was thrilled by them.          When her co-star Hoffman was in London in early 2016, I had him on my show - even though no one knew who he was in the UK. They didn\u0027t know who Meghan was either thenMeghan and Harry set to stay with Kate and William at Anmer...\u0027She social climbed her way out of my orbit\u0027: Piers Morgan...Samantha Markle mocks sister Meghan over claims she wanted...Share this articleIn early June, 2016, she messaged me to say: ‘I’m in London for a week of meetings and Wimbledon. Would love to say hi!’I suggested my local pub, the Scarsdale Tavern in Kensington – ironically just a few hundred yards from where she now lives at Kensington Palace.‘Serena Williams sends her love,’ she texted on the day from Wimbledon, where she was watching her friend play in the annual tennis tournament. ‘You’re very popular as it turns out. Get you!’I don’t hear those words very often, so they made an impression…Then she turned up at the pub and we had a very enjoyable time for 90 minutes or so before I put her in a taxi to a dinner she was having with friends at 5 Hertford Street, a fashionable club in London’s Mayfair.She spoke very candidly about her family - there were some private, sensitive things she told me I would never repeat because they were said in confidence - Donald Trump (she’s not a fan), and of course, Suits.She asked me for advice on her career and the media, and if she could come on Good Morning Britain next time she was over, which I said I would arrange.From the cab, Meghan sent me a series of texts thanking me and saying she was looking forward to meeting up again next time we were in the same city.She even publicly tweeted about how nice it was to see her ‘friend’ – me – in London.So at this point, I was indeed labouring under the massive misapprehension that we were friends.I was wrong.She met Prince Harry at the dinner that night, went on a solo date with him the next night, and I never heard from her again.Not a word.I’d been ghosted.          She met Prince Harry at a dinner the night we met in person, went on a solo date with him the next night, and I never heard from her again. Or her costar. I\u0027d been used. They were just rudeAnd not just by her.At Meghan’s behest, Rick Hoffman ghosted me too.I didn’t hear from him again for 18 months, then he eventually crawled out of the woodwork after attending the big royal wedding last May.‘Piers! I am very sorry for not responding,’ he wrote in a lengthy message. ‘You must understand, once I heard the news, out of respect for Meghan, I couldn’t share a thing. Now I can share fun stuff! I would love to catch up at that favorite pub of yours. Hope to hear from you pal. Love you pal. Rick.’I didn’t reply, because no, I didn’t ‘understand’.A real ‘pal’ doesn’t ghost a friend for 18 months, right?That’s just rude.In fact, I found the behaviour of the pair of them damn rude.I’d been ‘played’ by a couple of B-list actors, who were clearly just using me to advance their careers.           From the moment I read that Harry barked ‘What Meghan wants, Meghan gets! at staff in the run-up to the wedding, my heart sankBut when someone more important and influential came along, in the shape of Prince Harry, I was instantly dumped like a sack of spuds (that’s what we call potatoes in the UK).Now, on a certain level, I grudgingly admire the work.And frankly, who am I, a former tabloid newspaper editor, to take a dim view of such ruthless antics?But on another level, the whole experience left me feeling suspicious and cynical about Ms Markle.And nothing in her behaviour since marrying Prince Harry has alleviated those concerns.From the moment I read that he barked ‘What Meghan wants, Meghan gets! at palace courtiers in the run-up to the wedding, my heart sank.Because I fear that’s exactly what she’s used to getting.And anyone or anything that may not give her what she wants or gets in the way of her social climbing self-advancement gets discarded.Her first husband? Ditched as her Suits career took off.Her dysfunctional family? Banned from the wedding – all of them.Her poor old ailing Dad? Cut off and disowned for struggling to cope with media attention about his daughter.Meghan’s swapped her dreary, problematic old real world for a thrilling new fantasy world of the Queen, Michelle Obama and the Clooneys.Only her mother Doria made the cut to Princess Meghan’s AAA-list new life.          Her first husband Trevor was ditched as her Suits career took off          She ditched her family, cut off her ailing father and and only mom Doria made the list to Princess Meghan’s AAA-list new lifeBut pieces of work never change their spots.Now, there is a steady flow of negative stories streaming from Palace ‘insiders’ about Meghan’s alleged a antics.She was said to have ‘displeased’ the Queen by demanding an emerald tiara for the wedding.There are rumours of a growing rift with the Duchess of Cambridge, who was reported to have burst into tears over Meghan’s hostile behaviour during a bridesmaid dress fitting for her daughter Princess Charlotte.Kate was also reported to have complained about Meghan being needlessly unpleasant to a royal member of staff.          Now, there is a steady flow of negative stories streaming from Palace ‘insiders’ about Meghan’s antics and rumors of a rift with the Duchess of Cambridge, who she reportedly made cry. Kate has also reportedly complained that Meghan is unpleasant to a member of staffMeghan’s personal assistant Melissa Toubati recently quit after just six months in the job after also being left in tears.Royal courtiers are said to be already ‘fed up’ with her domineering and dictatorial attitude that involves daily 5am email demands and even led to her apparently insisting on air fresheners to hide the ‘musty odour’ of St George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle.It was an absurd request that was very firmly denied.When Palace ‘insiders’ start leaking this amount of damaging mud, you can be certain that much of it is true.And given my unfortunate experience with her, I’m afraid I’m not remotely surprised.It’s got nothing to do with sexism or racism, as some ridiculous commentators have suggested.No, I think it’s far simpler than that: Meghan Markle is a self-obsessed professional actress who has landed the role of her life and is determined to milk it for all she’s worth.

It has already affected the lives of nearly three million girls and young women across sub-Saharan Africa.Its CEO, Lucy Lake, who was with the sixth in line to the throne in Zambia, revealed to the Mail that she had briefed his wife privately at Kensington Palace earlier this year about their work in the country, as well as Zimbabwe, Ghana, Tanzania and Malawi.The Duchess was also met with Zimbabwean-born Angeline Murimirwa, one of the first girls to go to secondary school with the organisation’s support and is now its African executive director. She was named last year as one of the BBC’s 100 most inspirational women.Lucy said: ‘We had the opportunity to meet with the Duchess in the spring.

For the young people in Zambia to feel that Prince Harry was on a level with them and genuinely interested in what they are doing, left them very inspired and motivated, as was he. That’s a very powerful force. ‘          It is understood that she and Harry (seen at their wedding on May 19) are keen to work together on the issue in their role as roving Commonwealth youth ambassadorsIt is hoped that the pregnant duchess will be able to travel out to Africa and see CAMFED’s work for herself after she has had her baby next spring.Royal sources say the duchess has been having meetings with a number of organisations and is still finalising which areas to work in and what charities to support as she moves on with her public work.It is understood that she is particularly keen to support issues where she can work alongside her husband.Aides hope to make an announcement about her first patronages in the new year, eight months after she joined the Royal Family.Although it is considered quite a long time to wait before announcing her patronages, it is understood that Meghan wishes to ‘really get to know’ the organisations she wants to work with in order to make a ‘real and lasting’ difference. "},{"url":null,"title":"Black Panther poised Oscars heavyweight","story":"All of this year\u0027s contenders have by now screened, and Oscar prognosticators generally have \u0027Black Panther\u0027 in, comfortably, as a best picture nominee As Hollywood\u0027s awards season properly gets under way, \u0027Black Panther\u0027 is poised to return to the Academy Awards, but this time as a nominee - and potentially a major one. Ryan Coogler\u0027s superhero sensation has already notched countless records, pulverized box-office myths and set new marks for inclusivity. And now, \u0027Black Panther\u0027 is in line to shatter Oscar norms, too.All of this year\u0027s contenders have by now screened, and Oscar prognosticators generally have \u0027Black Panther\u0027 in, comfortably, as a best picture nominee. Both the pundit survey \u0027Gurus of Gold\u0027 and Hollywood Reporter awards analyst Scott Feinberg place \u0027Black Panther\u0027 fifth, behind front-runners \u0027A Star Is Born,\u0027 \u0027\u0027Roma,\u0027 \u0027\u0027Green Book\u0027 and \u0027The Favourite.\u0027 Gold Derby slots \u0027Black Panther\u0027 in at No. 7, still easily within the category\u0027s range of up to 10 nominees.   It\u0027s also up for Ryan Coogler\u0027s direction, for Joe Robert Cole and Coogler\u0027s script, Kendrick Lamar\u0027s song \u0027All the Stars\u0027 and Michael B. Jordan\u0027s performanceMuch is still in flux in the Oscar race ahead of Thursday morning\u0027s Golden Globes nominations. But unless something drastic happens, \u0027Black Panther\u0027 will next month become the first comic book film to be nominated for best picture and easily Marvel Studios\u0027 most significant Oscar contender ever.That\u0027s very good news for ABC\u0027s Feb. 24 telecast which is coming off an all-time low of 26.5 million viewers. Some 55.2 million watched \u0027Titanic\u0027 sweep the 1997 Oscars, and producers have long harbored dreams of another big-tent blockbuster pulling viewers to a broadcast increasingly dominated by independent films like \u0027The Shape of Water,\u0027 \u0027\u0027Moonlight\u0027 and \u0027Spotlight.\u0027 Usually, bigger movies mean bigger ratings.For the makers of \u0027Black Panther,\u0027 it\u0027s a new chapter for a film - with more than $1.3 billion in ticket sales, the third-highest all-time domestic gross and the biggest box-office hit ever directed by a black man - that has already filled record books. What does Coogler think of \u0027Black Panther\u0027 as an Oscar movie?\u0027Fortunately, I don\u0027t have to think about it that much,\u0027 the 32-year-old filmmaker of \u0027Fruitvale Station\u0027 and \u0027Creed\u0027 said in an interview. \u0027I\u0027ve grown to have close relationships with my collaborators, so I care about the crafts people who work on the film and the actors who work on the film. Because of those relationships, I\u0027m happy when they\u0027re happy. It\u0027s always nice when people are recognized for their work. But beyond that, I really don\u0027t worry about it.\u0027 The film is also in the running for Ruth Carter\u0027s costume design, the cinematography of Rachel Morrison and Hannah Beachler\u0027s production designYet few films will be watched more closely through awards season than \u0027Black Panther,\u0027 which is also in the running for Ruth Carter\u0027s costume design, the cinematography of Rachel Morrison (who last year became the first woman ever nominated in the category), Hannah Beachler\u0027s production design, Coogler\u0027s direction, the script by Joe Robert Cole and Coogler, Kendrick Lamar\u0027s song \u0027All the Stars\u0027 and Michael B. Jordan\u0027s supporting performance.\u0027Black Panther\u0027 has already been at the center of the uproar over the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\u0027 short-lived plans to institute a \u0027best popular film\u0027 category. The academy\u0027s move was intended to rope in more box-office hits to the broadcast, but critics said such a category would potentially ghettoize films like \u0027Black Panther\u0027 from the prestigious honor of best picture. (Coogler declined to address the category\u0027s scuttling.)While superhero films have dominated multiplexes for the last decade, the Oscars have been famously resistant to them. Ten years ago, \u0027The Dark Knight\u0027 earned eight nominations but missed out on best picture, prompting the film academy to expand the category the following year.   Coogler had a sense he wasn\u0027t alone in wanting a connection to the film, that others felt a need for it, too. \u0027But,\u0027 he says, \u0027I could never imagine to the extent that it did\u0027          With more than $1.3 billion in ticket sales, the film has the third-highest all-time domestic grossMany of the academy\u0027s members resent how superheroes have come to dominate the industry, but there have been some signs lately that anti-Marvel sentiment is ebbing. Last year, while \u0027Wonder Woman\u0027 failed to earn a nod, the Wolverine sequel \u0027Logan\u0027 became the first superhero film nominated for best adapted screenplay . This year, best animated film may also be a superhero battle, with \u0027Incredibles 2\u0027 and \u0027Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\u0027 among the favorites.But the awards campaign for \u0027Black Panther\u0027 is predicated less on its superhero DNA than on its cultural impact and on its personal nature as, despite its budget, an auteur film by one of the most widely respected young filmmakers in Hollywood. \u0027Black Panther\u0027 last week for a day played for free in arthouse theaters nationwide in an event put on by Art House Convergence and Film Comment.George H.W. Bush\u0027s service dog Sully visits his casket in...Grateful George W. and Laura Bush make a surprise visit to...Share this articleFor Coogler, making \u0027Black Panther\u0027 couldn\u0027t be more personal. It was a journey in finding his own connection to Africa. While developing the script, he visited South Africa, Kenya and the Kingdom of Lesotho - a tiny nation that inspired Coogler\u0027s Wakanda.\u0027In simple terms, the film is what brought me to the continent,\u0027 says Coogler. \u0027It was kind of a lifelong thing just to get there and see it. The thing that I found was a sense of identity as an African person. I found in those trips and through that research a definition for myself of what it means to be African. That was a question I was seeking as a filmmaker.\u0027Coogler had a sense he wasn\u0027t alone in wanting that connection, that others felt a need for it, too. \u0027But,\u0027 he says, \u0027I could never imagine to the extent that it did.\u0027\u0027Black Panther\u0027 arrived to feverish enthusiasm and debuted in the most resplendent and regal Hollywood premiere of the decade. It has been called \u0027a defining moment for Black America,\u0027 pop-culture myth-making at its best and the best big-budget studio epic in ages. Parents took their kids and kids took their parents in a groundbreaking generational event. Theaters were rented out. It was the No. 1 film at the U.S. box office for five straight weeks.\u0027We always saw it as a film to watch with your loved ones, with your friends and with strangers, in communal settings,\u0027 says Coogler. \u0027People are still interested in doing that and it feels fortunate.\u0027In a year where Netflix has a formidable Oscar contender in Alfonso Cuaron\u0027s \u0027Roma,\u0027 and fears of the diminishing of the theatrical experience pervade the industry, that may be the most appealing reason for academy members to vote for \u0027Black Panther\u0027: It proved the still-vibrant, earth-shattering power of the movie theater.

One raid took place at an ice cream parlour in the city of Duisburg, western Germany this morning          In Germany the focus was on the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, which borders the Netherlands and Belgium, and Bavaria to the south.

Raids took place across Europe and Latin America as dozens of suspected mobsters were rounded up      In 2016, a suspected \u0027Ndrangheta boss, Ernesto Fazzalari (left), was arrested after two decades on the run, fleeing a life sentence for murder. A year later, another suspected boss of the crime clan, Santo Vottari (right), was detained in Calabria having been on the run for a decadeThe organisation\u0027s tight clan-based structure has made it hard to penetrate, but police have made some in roads in recent years. In 2015, 163 people were arrested in a major crackdown on the notorious mafia gang, which by that time had become the most powerful crime organisation in the country.In another sting that year, police snatched assets worth £1.4billion from the \u0027Ndrangheta, which included more than 1,500 betting shops, 82 online gambling sites and almost 60 companies.  In 2016, one of Italy\u0027s most wanted mafia bosses Ernesto Fazzalari was arrested after two decades on the run, fleeing a life sentence for murder. The \u0027Ndrangheta member was captured in an apartment in a remote part of the southern region of Calabria.On the run since 1996, he was convicted in absentia in 1999 of mafia association, kidnapping, illegal possession of weapons and a double homicide linked to a bloody 1989-91 feud which left 32 people dead in his home town of Taurianova.His arrest was hailed by the government as a significant victory for the state in its battle against the powerful mafia group.Last year, another suspected boss of the crime clan, Santo Vottari, was detained in Calabria having been on the run for a decade.He was arrested hiding behind a trap door of a bunker having gone to ground over a 2007 massacre in Germany.  Vottari was convicted in absentia in 2009 of being one of the heads of an \u0027Ndrangheta clan whose feud with local rivals culminated in the Duisburg killings.He was given a prison term of 10 years and eight months, two years after he went on the run.Vottari was one of 31 people sentenced to prison terms in 2009 in connection with the Duisburg killings, which happened after a vendetta between two clans based in the same village, San Luca, spiralled out of control.The feud between the Nirta-Strangio and Pelle-Vottari clans reportedly began with an egg-throwing prank in 1991. Reprisals escalated after the killing, on Christmas Day, 2006, of Maria Strangio, the wife of clan leader Giovanni Nirta.          A view of San Luca village in the southern region of Calabria - the Italian heartland of the \u0027Ndrangheta crime clanThe feud was blamed for at least 16 deaths in total, with the killings in Germany bringing it to international attention.Giovanni Strangio was convicted in 2011 of being the mastermind and one of the authors of the Duisburg killings.He was sentenced to life in prison. Seven others were given life sentences linked to the feud at the same trial.Notoriously ruthless, the \u0027Ndrangheta has surpassed Sicily\u0027s Cosa Nostra and the Naples-based Camorra in influence thanks to its control of Europe\u0027s cocaine trade.The organisation is made up of numerous village and family-based clans based in the rural, mountainous and under-developed \u0027toe\u0027 of Italy\u0027s boot.The name \u0027Ndrangheta comes from the Greek for courage or loyalty and the organisation\u0027s secretive culture and brutal enforcement of codes of silence have made it very difficult to penetrate.But authorities claimed a major breakthrough last year when they captured Ernesto Fazzalari, whom they described as the last senior \u0027Ndrangheta fugitive still at large.                                                    It has surpassed Sicily\u0027s Cosa Nostra and the Naples-based Camorra in influence thanks to its control of the cocaine trade, and is the sole mafia organisation to operate on all continents, according to anti-mafia prosecutors.Despite the raids today, Federico Cafiero De Raho, Italian anti-mafia and anti-terrorism national prosecutor, sounded a note of caution, saying that they only scratched the surface of the powerful group, whose tentacles and illicit activities spread all over the world.Speaking in The Hague, De Raho said the arrests \u0027are nothing for \u0027Ndrangheta. There are thousands of people who should be arrested and billions of euros that should be seized.\u0027Wednesday\u0027s operation came a day after Italian police arrested new Cosa Nostra boss Settimino Mineo and dozens of other suspects in Sicily in a major swoop.Jeweller Mineo, 80, was detained along with at least 45 others just before he was due to be appointed official heir to notorious mafia boss Toto Riina who died in prison last year. "},{"url":null,"title":"When London really swinging","story":"    For a time, London in the Swinging Sixties became the centre of the universe.

Before last night, this would have been a simple motion noting the statement that could not be amended.Now MPs will be able to try and re-write it with amendments.  \u0027Why don\u0027t you all grow a pair!\u0027 Piers Morgan calls Dominic...Share this articleWhat can the new amendments be about? Amendments to the motion could try to give instructions to the Government on what to do next instead of simply accepting or rejecting the plan shown to them.This could be taking measures to avoid no deal, backing a second referendum, calling a general election or setting out new negotiating red lines for further talks in Brussels.Brexit supporters could also use it to try and tell the Government to pursue no deal.To have any impact at all, the amendments will have to win a vote of MPs.  When will the new amendments be debated and voted on? The law says the Government must produce its next steps motion within 21 days of a defeat on its deal. This is over the Christmas recess so it is likely to be debated sooner than that, sometime between December 12 and the last day of term on December 20.Speaker John Bercow will choose which amendments are voted on at the end of the debate.            Tory rebels took a major step toward giving Parliament control over Brexit by inflicting a huge defeat on the Prime Minister (pictured yesterday in Downing Street) last nightWhat will it mean if any amendments pass? The amendments will not have any legal force but a majority vote by MPs on what to do will have a lot of political power.Even if the vote is not in favour of current Government policy, Ministers could use it to change course - scrapping the current red lines in the negotiation to adopt a Norway-style Brexit or passing new laws for a second referendum. What do Brexit supporters think about it? Brexiteer MPs insist because the amendments are not legally binding, they officially change nothing.

The museum argued that the statue was discovered in international waters and pointed out that it was acquired by the museum nine years after Italy’s top court concluded there was no evidence that the statue belonged to Italy.“The court has not offered any written explanation of the grounds for its decision, which is inconsistent with its holding 50 years ago that there was no evidence of Italian ownership,” Lisa Lapin, Getty’s vice-president of communications, said in a statement.“Moreover, the statue is not and has never been part of Italy’s cultural heritage. Accidental discovery by Italian citizens does not make the statue an Italian object. Found outside the territory of any modern state, and immersed in the sea for two millennia, the Bronze has only a fleeting and incidental connection with Italy.”Experts dispute this. The fishermen who found the artefact sold it in Fano, a town in Pesaro province, to Italian art dealer Giacomo Barbetti. Barbetti kept the statue in his father’s home before it was transferred to the Umbrian town of Gubbio in 1965, where it was eventually sold to an unidentified buyer from Milan. The statue then changed hands several times before being bought by the Getty.“Italy has made a very clear and compelling case that the Lysippos was smuggled into Italy, via Fano, and therefore was later smuggled out of Italy,” Noah Charney, an arts professor who teaches each summer on the Arca postgraduate program in art crime and cultural heritage protection in Italy, told the .“Where it was first discovered, whether in Italian or international waters, is therefore a moot point.”Tristano Tonnini, a lawyer for Le Cento Città, an association leading the fight for the statue’s return, said he was convinced that the Getty museum of “always knew it was buying a smuggled and illegally exported artefact”.The statue is among the most popular works at the Los Angeles museum, but its legal ownership has been in dispute ever since Getty bought it from German art dealer Herman Heinz Herzer in 1977.The sum paid was nearly 800 times the $5,600 that Italian art dealers gave to the fishermen who found it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4b1c99e2e9222f3465cbc68f9359bcd7e16e8c8/0_0_973_1302/master/973.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f325bed0f0c093914975c499e692535e 660w","title":"new yorks strand bookshop begs to avoid official landmarking","story":"Much-loved retailer boasting ‘18 miles of books’ says city’s plans to legally recognise its status would entail expenses that might kill the businessNew York City’s most celebrated bookshop, the Strand, is a cultural landmark for locals and tourists alike, promising “18 miles of books” to its customers since 1927. But now the shop is battling attempts to make its landmark status official, saying the designation could destroy it.Run by three generations of the Bass family since it opened, the shop at the corner of 12th Street and Broadway is the only survivor of what was once known as “Book Row”, home to 48 booksellers in the 1920s. New York City’s Landmarks Preservation Commission is keen to declare the Strand a city landmark, describing it as “a centre of literary life in Lower Manhattan” and “an internationally recognised bookstore and destination”. But at a public hearing on Tuesday, owner Nancy Bass Wyden begged the commission to reconsider.“The Strand is the last of the great bookstores that were a hallmark of business development south of Union Square. We’re the last for a reason,” she said. “Please do not destroy the Strand by adding more bureaucracy and unnecessary expenses and restrictions, slowing us down just when we need to be our most impactive. In an attempt to preserve history, you may very well end up destroying a piece of the city.”The Strand says it needs flexibility “to do future upgrades and change with the needs of the community”, and that the proposed status would mean every repair and upgrade “would have to go through the slow bureaucracy of the Landmarks Preservation Commission” and cost money.The Strand’s position has been backed by writers including Art Spiegelman and Gary Shteyngart, who spoke at Tuesday’s hearing in support of Wyden’s position.“Without the Strand I would never have become a writer. The Strand is where I came to worship literature, to learn from literature … Those books made me a writer,” said Shteyngart. “It is a peerless cultural resource for New York City. It is a sanctuary. But like all remaining bricks-and-mortar bookstores, it is living in a fragile environment. If it doesn’t survive, the entire cultural ecosystem for downtown New York will be in danger.”The commission will make its decision in early 2019, according to the New York Post. A spokesperson told the New York Times that while most landmark designations are approved, “it is not a given, and the public hearing, a critical part of the process, is an opportunity for the commission to hear other opinions”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd7628d73c10e82d65c4cf8df2d907832d0721d1/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7d5b42ab43d238d59c3562adf4673db","title":"kathmandu earthquake debt nepal","story":"Survivors of the 2015 quake that killed almost 9,000 people around Kathmandu now face another challenge they didn’t expectRatna Awale counts herself lucky. She and her husband, Prem, and their two sons survived the devastating 7.8-magnitude earthquake in Nepal on 25 April 2015 that killed almost 9,000 people.But her narrow four-storey home in Patan, a sprawling, historical city south of Kathmandu, was badly damaged. “There were big cracks from the back of the house to the front wall, and half the ground floor collapsed,” she says.The damage across the country cost Nepal an estimated $10bn (£7.8bn), cutting its already meagre economic output in half. The government subsequently offered hundreds of thousands of homeowners $3,000 (£2,300) each to rebuild their homes.The problem doesn’t stop with inidual homeowners. Durbar Square in Kathmandu is a stunning medley of Hindu and Buddhist temples, and a major draw for tourists. Many buildings, including the 18th-century Nautale Durbar palace, were badly damaged or destroyed.With the government heavily indebted, restoration in many cases is being provided for free by the Chinese and other countries. Though the Nepalese government has welcomed China’s help, Beijing’s influence over its small neighbour has risen dramatically. Some wonder whether it could lead to a so-called debt trap, as has happened in Sri Lanka, where the government has leased a key port to a Chinese company after struggling to repay it for building it.The challenges facing the authorities are enormous. Nepal is a mountainous country subject to chronic political upheaval, and only recently emerged from civil war. Repairing the damage from the earthquake is a monumental task and the $3,000 grants were never designed to fully cover the cost of rebuilding.“There are more than 820,000 houses eligible – the scale is massive,” says Siobhan Kennedy of HRRP. “It’s bigger than Pakistan in 2005 and Haiti in 2010 in terms of the number of houses that need to be rebuilt. In terms of scale, this is huge.”But just getting the money to those who need it can be difficult. “The biggest problem for us is that many people don’t officially own their own property,” says Rakesh Maharjan, an IT officer at the Earthquake Housing Reconstruction Project in Patan, which oversees the distribution of grants in the area. “They don’t have title deeds.”He says that in Lalitpur, the municipality that incorporates Patan, fewer than one-fifth of homeowners who applied for the government grant have received all three tranches.Authorities introduced deadlines that applicants had to meet to receive the payout. But that has led to unforeseen consequences: many homeowners are using the proceeds to hastily construct small, one-room buildings that are clearly unsuitable for families.For Santosh Maharjan, a 25-year-old student whose family began rebuilding their house in Patan last April, the biggest problem remains getting access to money.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08269dc241b0d12ab14b967388062d8955d7f6cb/0_574_4372_2623/master/4372.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51ab63e9e43cc4d37f4b8f6dadcdc0c1","title":"rios squatter communities turn derelict buildings into homes in pictures","story":"As the city’s homeless population has grown, squatting projects have become more organised in an attempt to secure abandoned houses as homes for the poor.

How will it finish up?Brexit is often sold by its most committed supporters on the right as a constitutional version of the economic doctrine of Thatcherism, a clean break with the failed policies of the past. These fanatics succeeded in convincing David Cameron, who was prone to flattery but supine in the face of aggression, that a popular vote in a referendum was a remedy for the unrepresentative nature of Westminster politics. Once they did away with Mr Cameron, they installed Theresa May and carried on with legislative manoeuvring to enable an irreversible transformation of society. The hard Brexiters are ruthless about the means, and in denial about the fall-out of their desires. Yet now the game is up.The evidence is that a departure from the European Union on WTO terms would blow up large parts of the British economy. There would be a lot of pain for some far-off gain. As it stands Mrs May’s Brexit plan will not get parliamentary approval. She warns this means we will crash out as the law states the United Kingdom will leave the EU on the 29 March at 11pm. But that can be changed if a minister proposes a new law erasing that time and date and parliament votes for it. The UK has options. It can unilaterally cancel its withdrawal from the EU. The majority of MPs in parliament accept hard Brexit utopias cannot be built. It is now a question of how, not when or if, they will move parliamentary motions to demonstrate their strength. Their aim will be to get ministers to defer or rescind Britain’s departure from the European club. Mrs May, if she is still prime minister, at this point could do the country a favour and stop her car crash of Brexit continuing. If ministers refuse to bow to such a motion then we will enter a constitutional crisis whose size will dwarf anything we have seen so far in the contempt arguments over the failure to publish ministers’ Brexit legal advice.This marks the end of a long spell of party government. In 2015 the Conservative party won the majority of parliamentary seats for the first time in 23 years. Mr Cameron became prime minister of a government which was responsible not to the parliament, but to Tory MPs who relied for their electoral success on the party organisation, which in turn controlled the parliamentary party. The 2017 election saw Mrs May lose her majority and MPs lose their instant allegiance to her and her machine. She ought to have dropped the hard Brexit rhetoric then and there. Instead she continued and attempted to rule through decree while pushing the biggest geopolitical shift this country has faced in decades. She factionalised her party, sharpening ideological isions between “Global Britain” and “Make Britain Great Again” Tories that have proved too wide to manage.The result is Mrs May ended up only passing bills that have complete support within her own party, which was in thrall to rightwing absolutists. The danger of this way of running Westminster is that it ends up being self-reinforcing, making for more extreme partisanship and deeper deadlock. Studies show barely two in 10 people now think the current system of governing Britain is good at performing any of its key functions. In parliamentary systems, gridlock is relatively rare. When prime ministers can no longer command legislative support, the impasse is resolved by a new election. If she attempted to do this anytime soon, Mrs May would surely be deposed. The prime minister has caught herself in a Brexit straitjacket that gets tighter the more she struggles. There is scope for a Houdini-like escape for Britain. But to achieve what seems the impossible requires a politician prepared to imagine it.•\u0026nbspThis article was amended on 5 December 2018 to more clearly express that Cameron became prime minister of a majority Tory government in 2015."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb1881742c94602ea9eadfa00453bbad982b30ec/0_0_3661_2198/master/3661.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3942ddc79cecbc960c7b88db59f8fbd","title":"parliament taking back control brexit may defeats commons coalition","story":"It’s coming home, it’s co-ming … politics is coming home. The seizure of initiative by parliament on Tuesday night is a repatriation of power worth cheering. For two years Brexit has been a performance of bluster and bluff in public. Theresa May hammered out the terms in private and in Brussels. Now the House of Commons, the home ground of British democracy, is taking back control. May’s fragile administration suffered three defeats, including a contempt motion, extracting the attorney general’s legal advice on the deal from between gritted ministerial teeth.That was the most historically resonant of Tuesday’s parliamentary dramas, but the more significant legislative event might prove to be the vote that followed. Dominic Grieve’s amendment sounded technical, but in the Commons, procedural obscurity can be a lethal weapon. Grieve, a former attorney general, now a leading pro-European Tory backbencher, won a concession asserting that – and bear with me here – the provisions of standing order 24B should not apply to any motion pursuant to section 13 of the 2018 European Union (withdrawal) Act. What the hell does that mean? In short, it beefs up the power of the Commons in the event that May’s deal is beaten and she or her replacement can’t get another deal through parliament. It reduces (but does not eliminate) the risk of Britain leaping off the Brexit cliff without a parachute.Previously, in an imminent no-deal scenario, the prime minister would have been obliged only to inform the House of her intentions. Grieve’s amendment, backed by Labour, opens that statement to amendment. In theory, the Commons could put on record its call for a much softer Brexit, or a referendum, or a request in Brussels to extend the article 50 negotiating window, or even a retraction of the article 50 notification. None of those things would have the force of law, so some (presumably deranged) prime minister could ignore them and run at the cliff edge anyway. But the balance of control has shifted. It has been said many times that there is no majority in parliament for an insane course of action, but no one has been able to say how a majority for sanity might constitutionally assert itself. Now a coalition of the reasonable is starting to take shape.The list of Tories who voted in favour of Grieve’s amendment includes former ministers and MPs who have tried to be loyal to May, or at least not be wantonly destructive in their ergence from her approach. One co-sponsor was Nick Boles, who is touting a back-up plan to steer the UK into Norwegian-style arrangements with the EU. Another is Oliver Letwin, once a fixture of David Cameron’s cabinets, who declared that he would vote for May’s deal next week and was acting only to provide insurance against no deal, which would be “a catastrophe for our country”.Those Tories who think the opposite, that no deal is just the bracing tonic that Britain needs to snap it out of a Europhiliac stupor, have been relatively quiet. Boris Johnson, who has found himself, largely by accident, at the head of the posse of unicorn-rustling ultra-Brexit cowboys, did not get a good reception. His speech was a rambling medley of Vote Leave myth-making and Daily  op-eds while parliament’s ears were tuned for historical gravity – an idiom Johnson only does as cod Churchillian pastiche.Conservative party members might still like that tune and the Jacob Rees-Mogg B-side, but the parliamentary party is tired of it. The failure of Rees-Mogg’s European Research Group to muster enough letters to trigger a no-confidence vote in the Tory leader has damaged that faction’s credibility. For months they were boasting about rebel numbers and it turns out they can’t count. They had a shot and they threw it away. They might get another one, but the pressure of the clock – the need to confront, in responsible terms, the consequences of what they are really proposing – works against them. Rees-Mogg’s smooth style has soured under scrutiny. No one can spray that amount of venom without eventually looking like a snake, and Conservative MPs are seeing the Slytherin side to the man in the Harry Potter-style glasses.It is too early to call the peak of ERG no-deal bravado, but it feels as if a fever is breaking. There is a wide spectrum of opinion in the Conservative party, and much of it has been unrepresented in the polarisation between Brexit extremists and die-hard remainers. There is a mulch of reluctant pro-EU Eurosceptics and undogmatic, get-on-with-it leavers in the middle who have lacked leadership.Crucially, also, there is the Tory tradition of dogged pragmatism that cares about stability, security and upholding the continuity of institutions. That school is instinctively suspicious of the ideological puritanism embodied by Rees-Mogg and friends. Mainstream Tory Euroscepticism was always rooted in the idea of parliamentary sovereignty and so not necessarily attracted by the quasi-Leninist revolutionary Brexitism that is being drummed up on the hard right. It isn’t yet clear how the balance will shift in the coming weeks, nor what that means for the prime minister and her deal. But it is surely significant that now, at the 11th hour, the Conservative party is finally becoming conservative again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e51d8bf5f912f11d828f5c5710910a7198cc403/11_375_6448_3869/master/6448.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=306b7701b85556799f2e64e78988a980","title":"an education arms race inside the ultra competitive world of private tutoring","story":"A growing number of parents and s are paying for children as young as four to receive additional tuition. What is fuelling this booming industry?As dusk falls in the Girlington district of Bradford, a trickle of cars begin to arrive in front of a small parade of shops. Parents who have just collected their children at the end of the school day are dropping them off at the Explore Learning tuition centre for extra maths and English coaching. The children sit at a cluster of computer terminals, where they log in to begin their evening studies. The atmosphere is relaxed and lighthearted. The children stay for an hour to work through their lessons, helped where necessary by a member of staff, with 15 minutes’ playtime at the end.Located next to a Domino’s and a Subway, the Bradford branch of Explore Learning is a tiny window into Britain’s booming private tuition sector, now worth an estimated £2bn. At one time, private tuition meant a weekly one-to-one session at home with a tutor, the preserve of the privileged few. It is still not cheap – Explore Learning’s standard membership costs £119 a month, plus a £50 registration fee – but it is now on offer on our high streets, in supermarkets and increasingly online, with tutors offering their services from as far afield as India and Sri Lanka. Tutees include children who are little older than toddlers, pupils at prestigious private schools and undergraduates struggling at university. All are caught up in an educational arms race, which experts say is exacerbating social inequality.The success of Explore Learning reflects some of these changes. The business was founded in 2001 by Bill Mills, a Cambridge maths graduate, and now has 139 centres around the country (plus five in Texas run by a sister company). They are located mainly in shopping centres, so busy parents can get on with their weekly shop while their offspring perfect their times tables, punctuation and grammar. Most of the children, who are aged four to 14, come at least a couple of times a week – the membership allows for up to nine sessions a month. Saturday and Sunday afternoons are the busiest times in the Bradford branch, which has 290 children on its books. The tutor-tutee ratio is one to six, but the tutors are not usually qualified teachers they may be students or mothers returning to the workplace. All are trained in the teaching materials and behaviour management.The families who use the centre come from various walks of life. Some parents have their own businesses others work at Bradford Royal Infirmary. There are families from Latvia, Poland and the Philippines. The parents talk about giving their children “an edge”, the “leg up” they never had. Among them are a shift worker, Malik Ijaz, and his wife, Ayesha, who have been bringing nine-year-old Abubakar and his seven-year-old sister, Amna, to the centre for nearly two years. It is a big expense for the family, but the children’s education is a priority. Ijaz works extra shifts to be able to afford it. A third child, four-year-old Ali, will come when he is older.“The world is very competitive and everybody is working very hard,” said Ijaz. “I know the school are doing very well, but there are 30 students in each class. It’s one teacher and support staff. They try their best to help, but I realise if I’m going to give my kids some extra help it’s going to be brilliant for their future. Anyone who does a bit extra always gets ahead.”He is ambitious for his children. “I warn my kids they should be top – or among the top five at least – in class. They are doing well. I don’t mind paying extra. I’m investing in their future. I know the importance of education. My kids love it.”Abubakar, a quiet, serious child, is planning to sit the 11-plus to win a place at grammar school. Sometimes he does not feel like starting work, “but when I’ve started I like to carry on”. Amna is a chatty livewire and wants to be a paleontologist. “I’m good at maths, but the thing I’m best at is history,” she chirps. “My brother does hard work. I’m doing the same now. I want to be the same as him.”Geoff Clayton, a retired garage worker, has been bringing his 10-year-old grandson, Brooklyn, to Explore Learning for about nine months. Brooklyn lives with his grandparents and likes football, Minecraft and maths. “He’s done really well,” says Clayton. “His reading has got a lot better, everything’s got better.” The membership takes a significant chunk out of his pension, but he is happy to pay it to give Brooklyn “a bit of a leg up”.“Nowadays, it’s all about exams and certificates and what you know,” he says. “When I left school, it was more: ‘Can you do the job?’ Brooklyn has done a heck of a lot better since coming here. Sometimes he moans, but he’s OK once he’s here. It does work if you’re prepared to put the time and effort in.”With tutoring commanding a fee of about £24 an hour, rising to £27 in London (although many tutors charge £60 or more), the trust is concerned that the private tuition market is putting children from poorer backgrounds at even greater disadvantage. To redress the balance, it would like to see the government introduce a means-tested voucher system, paid for through the pupil premium funding that schools receive to support disadvantaged pupils.“We are in an education arms race,” says Peter Lampl, the founder of the trust. “Parents are looking to get an edge for their kids and having private tuition gives them that edge. But if we are serious about social mobility, we need to make sure that the academic playing field is levelled outside the school gate.”Alexa Collins lives in Buckinghamshire, which operates a grammar school system. She could not afford tuition to prepare her daughter for the 11-plus despite being a top performer at primary, she failed the test, but has since thrived at her comprehensive, gaining nine GCSEs.Collins, who went to grammar school herself but received no coaching, says she is ideologically opposed to tutoring because it is unfair to those who cannot afford it. Although she can see the case for short-term tutoring on a specific subject when a child is struggling, she adds: “I think it’s awful, that idea of tutoring kids from seven to push them through this exam. How can you possibly put that pressure on them?”Another parent, who wishes to remain anonymous but lives in Kent, which operates grammar schools, says her son tackled the 11-plus without a tutor. “It felt morally wrong to claim an advantage by paying cash. It’s so unfair.” As she tried to coach her son, she felt at huge disadvantage. “So much depends on a parent’s skills to teach. A tutor would know the best way to teach the 11-plus concepts. I was terrible at maths at school, so I was really stuck.”“The government claims that expanding grammars will boost social mobility,” said Jerrim, a professor of education and social statistics at UCL, when the research was published. “But our research shows that private tuition used by high-income families gives them a big advantage in getting in.” One of the factors behind the increase in tuition, he says now, is the pressure exerted by school league tables and growing accountability measures. “Those schools might well be passing pressure on to parents,” he says. “It’s not a negative reflection on schools and the job that they are doing it’s more a reflection of the pressure they are under to achieve results.”A callout asking  readers about their experiences of tuition drew hundreds of responses from tutors, parents and school teachers. One tutor told of being approached by parents of children as young as three or four another had been hired to provide extra coaching for pupils whose parents were already paying for all of the privileges of private schools, including Marlborough and Eton. “We pay thousands of pounds a year on school fees,” said one parent. “If he needs a little help with certain subjects, why wouldn’t you help him?” There also appears to be a trend for university students to buy extra tuition. Most are already paying £9,250 a year in tuition fees, so why not spend a little more to ensure they get the best possible degree?The Profs, which launched in 2014, specialises in degree-level and professional-qualification tutoring. According to its website, an undergraduate teacher with a master’s in the required subject costs upwards of £70 an hour (plus a £50 placement fee) tutors specialising in applications to Oxbridge and Ivy League universities start at £120 an hour, plus a £250 consultation fee. According to Leo Evans, one of the founders of The Profs, university lecturers can struggle to address inidual learning difficulties. “Catching stragglers and helping them get on top of their studies is a useful social function. Also, for students with disabilities and impairments, it’s essential.”Other responses to our callout came from parents who were worried about schools’ increasingly limited resources due to budget cuts. Much of the additional support that was once available in classrooms is disappearing and some specialist teachers are in short supply. These parents see tutoring as a way of patching the gaps in their children’s education. “It’s only one hour a week, but the practice crammed into that time is like a full week of lessons at school,” said one parent, who is a teacher. “The ability to check every week how well the information is being retained is great. It also provides ‘real-time’ feedback that we don’t get from schools.”Some parents buy extra tuition to support children with special educational needs such as dyslexia, which mainstream schools are increasingly unable to meet. The new, tougher GCSE exams are also a factor, with some parents hiring private tutors to help children who are struggling to secure the level 4 or above required in English and maths.One mother from Nigeria said she sought extra support for her child as a practical response to racial discrimination: “Any child from a minority has to be many times better than their white counterparts to be able to get into the top schools and universities.” Another parent told of a daughter with cancer who missed a year of formal education, but got through with the help of a tutor. Another respondent claimed the shadow tutoring workforce “props up” some “outstanding” schools – private, grammar and state.Not everyone was positive about the impact of tuition. “It can cause students to not work in lessons,” said one teacher. Another said: “The need for tutoring frightens me. Schools should be able to offer students the support they need in class sizes that are manageable.” While one parent said: “I resent it when having a tutor is seen as a class crime,” another acknowledged the unfairness at the heart of the system: “I feel uncomfortable that we can afford to pay for this privilege.”The callout also revealed the appeal of private tuition for teachers, whose salaries have been depressed for years while the demands upon them have grown. Some said they did private tutoring to boost their income others, tired of the one-size-fits-all approach in schools, have quit their jobs to do it full time.Asked about the boom in private tuition, the Department for Education responded that standards are rising in schools and that the attainment gap between rich and poor pupils is shrinking. “While we believe families shouldn’t have to pay for private tuition, it has always been part of the system and parents have freedom to do this,” a spokesman said.“Tutoring is huge, it’s getting bigger and it’s not going away,” says the Sutton Trust’s Lampl. “You can’t stop people from doing it. What we’ve got to do is make it more accessible for parents who currently can’t afford it.”Clayton, the retired garage worker from Bradford, is not a rich man, but he wants to invest what he has in his grandson’s future. His hopes for Brooklyn are modest and honourable and shared by parents and grandparents everywhere. “I want Brooklyn to have a good start in life … Nobody gave me a leg up. I’m trying to do something for him that I never got. I hope he ends up being a decent person when he grows up and gets a decent job and doesn’t have to struggle.”Additional reporting by Matthew Holmes"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb7536adf76b6e7bfb5f29f69dace7270251bd40/0_207_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ee8b1618176d55f5432e420a9d70ed7","title":"how do you spend your time when youre stuck at home in winter","story":"With long nights and wet weather we’d like to hear how you stop yourself from going stir-crazy when you’re stuck at homeFrom Almaty to Zagreb, from London (England) to London (Ontario), the days are getting colder, the nights are getting longer and the clouds are getting lower.How do you cope when you can’t face the gloom, the rain, the wind or the snow, yet have already spent far too many hours at home?

Eighty-seven years later, the house she founded still travels in style.On Tuesday the politan Museum of Art rolled out the red carpet for Chanel and hosted its first fashion show in three decades, turning the Temple of Dendur in the Sackler Wing into a catwalk for Karl Lagerfeld’s Metiers d’Art collection.Chanel aligns itself with icons wherever it goes. When Lagerfeld is in New York, the city’s grandest museum becomes a catwalk, and the show is advertised all over the city posters depict Coco as the Statue of Liberty, sporting a spiked crown with her little tweed suit, flaming torch aloft.The Chanel brand lays claim to a mass culture bandwidth – as big as Disney, as bold as Coca Cola – while retaining a high culture price tag.This week the brand became the latest fashion giant to ban the use of exotic skin and fur. “It has become increasingly difficult to source exotic skins that match our ethical standards,” said Bruno Pavlovsky, Chanel’s president of fashion. “Meanwhile we are investing a lot in research and development, and the innovations in alternative materials that are happening in our ateliers are phenomenal.”What looked like crocodile on the catwalk at the Met was in fact mock croc what looked like lizard was vegan pineapple leather. Metiers d’art is a fashion genre unique to Chanel, devised to showcase the craftmanship of the 26 specialist ateliers owned by Chanel, from embroidery and featherwork to glovemaking and pleating.The clothes are demi-couture: intensively hand-worked but sold on the shop floor rather than made to order in the pure tradition of haute couture. The messaging of Metiers d’Art is to remind the world of the sophistication and savoir-faire of Chanel.The power play of staging a blow-the-budget fashion show in a landmark museum is blunt. But Lagerfeld’s genius is in adding sufficient nuance to make a blockbuster interesting, and finding visual synergies that make his collections uniquely satisfying to watch – the fashion equivalent of a pop song with an earworm of a chorus.In this show, staged in a treasure of Ancient Egypt now housed a few blocks from the art deco skyscrapers, he sent out slender metallic columns whose burnished dazzle and geometric angles called to mind both the treasures of Tutankhamun and the Chrysler building.The classic Chanel suit came with an extra wide, round collar and a side order of heavy eyeliner, for a look that nodded to power dressing both in its Wall Street incarnation and in the heavily ornamented collars worn by the Ancient Egyptian elite.Mixed in with scarab-beetle handbags and pyramid embroidery, graffitied dresses designed in collaboration with the artist Cyril Kongo paid homage to New York street culture and to hieroglyphics. It would be glib, if it wasn’t so fiendishly cleverly done. “Only Karl can do this,” said Pavlovsky. “We are very lucky, because we have the best designer ever.”Two-thirds of the New York show audience was made up of Chanel’s best US customers. “Our American customer base is growing. In the last two years, the number of American clients placing orders for haute couture has increased,” said Pavlovsky.London, where Chanel’s global headquarters are based, remained an important market also, he noted. “But, of course, with Brexit there is a big question mark over 2019.”For luxury powerhouses with money to spend on standalone fashion spectaculars, New York City is now the place to be. Emmanuel Macron’s charm offensive to the fashion industry seemed to be paying idends earlier this year, with a series of high profile shows staged in France. Christian Dior staged a rodeo outside Paris, Louis Vuitton commandeered a storied gallery in Provence and Gucci travelled from Milan to Arles. But with buzz building about next spring’s Met Gala with its eye-catching theme of Camp, and Macron embattled – the Chanel boutique in Rue Cambon was attacked in last weekend’s unrest – Manhattan is back in the spotlight.Chanel arrived hot on the heels of Versace, who showed at the New York stock exchange on Sunday. Both Louis Vuitton and Prada have already announced plans to stage major shows in New York in spring."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1a70f298acaf3f9c09e4d03125a25ee6aace8d9/0_21_4645_2787/master/4645.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce1b393751630d71179a5408f0df5107","title":"a christmas less ordinary","story":"From the scorned vegetarian to the competitive card-maker, four writers reflect on their favourite bygone Christmases and unconventional traditionsOlia HerculesGrowing up in secular Soviet Union, south of Ukraine, Christmas was forbidden. My family never celebrated it. We put up our tree and opened our presents on New Year’s Eve, instead.But, when I was 10, in post-Soviet 1994, for Christmas, my family decided to take a pilgrimage to the tradition-laden Western Ukraine, a thousand kilometres away. We took a 16-hour train to get there, to discover our roots.We arrived to visit friends of friends on Christmas Eve. We were dropped off at a train station, in an outlandish location of dreams. For the first time, I saw a hill covered with a forest of Christmas trees with sparkling snow crystals.It was the mountainous area of the Carpathian Mountains.The friend of friends met us at the train station and said: “It’s not a long walk to the house, but there are no buses to take us there.” We said: “OK,” thinking it would take 10 minutes.Wrong. Little did we know, people who live in the Carpathians were used to walking or skiing everywhere. The “short walk” took an hour and a half in heavy snow.Exhausted, we finally arrived at a huge wooden house by a gushing brook, the sound of wolves howling in the distance. Inside, we were rewarded with a real traditional Ukrainian Christmas, full of colour. Guests wore beautifully made goat masks, violins were played and people were singing. The house was warm and cosy, with a roaring fire we stayed up by late into the night. We ate a traditional pescatarian feast: a mushroom borscht with wild mushroom-filled dumplings varenyky filled with potatoes and curd cheese local trout soft, yeasty buns called pyrizhky, filled with cabbage and prunes, and sweet ones filled with sweet poppyseed paste. It ended up being the most memorable Christmas of my life, and I long to recreate it.Stevie MartinWhile in most homes the giving and receiving of Christmas cards is a declining tradition, in our house – for my sister and I at least – it has evolved into a furiously fought competition. After the presents have been pored over while sat on my parents’ bed (I’m 30, my sister is 27, and we refuse to do it any other way), we give out Christmas cards. The rules are you can’t buy it from a shop, you have to make it yourself – and the loser has to make an extravagant breakfast.Gina, my sister, is an incredible artist. One year, she painted a picture of my parents. Another, she sketched an incredibly lifelike Father Christmas. Years ago, I figured out that I could win by making my parents laugh, seeing how little I could get away with. An A4 sheet of paper with a pine needle stuck on it using Sellotape above the words “HAPPY PINE-MAS”. Another year, I dribbled some gravy, drew a smiley face on it and dubbed the mess: “the gravy nativity”. Last year was blank, to represent the Holy Spirit.The only issue with this – apart from the fact that my cards get more traction than Gina’s, despite hers taking hours to create and mine taking roughly three minutes – is that I don’t know where to go after 2017’s blank card. It feels like I’ve reached the pinnacle of not caring. Do I give them no card? The world’s tiniest card? I suppose the only thing to do is go the other way – hire an artist and create an A0 canvas. Please pray for me – I’m terrible at making breakfast.Tom DugginsAs a vegetarian, Christmas sometimes feels like I’m under siege from otherwise well-intentioned friends and family who want to sneak meat into my food. If it’s not the yearly cry of “hang on, which gravy did we put the meat juices into?” (this tends to come mere seconds after covering my plate in the stuff), then there’s always the pleasure of arguing with my mum about whether the roast potatoes have to be cooked in goose fat or not. (No surprises on my position: olive oil and spuds go together like being vegetarian and only having one thing you can order on a menu.)That’s why, come 25 December, I like to focus on those parts of the traditional Christmas lunch that we can all get behind. Once the main course and pudding are all done with, there’s the vegetarian haven of the cheeseboard to look forward to.It’s like a culinary after-party taking place on your very own kitchen table. No one’s sneaking any sausage meat into the chutney or injecting pork grease into the soft cheeses and there’s no awkward discussion about who can have what, it’s just gorge time at the table and everyone’s invited.Christmas lunch tends to stress people out – getting the timings right is tough and there’s a lot of pressure overall. But with the cheese course, you’re ready to go in about five minutes: minimal effort for maximum satisfaction.Hayley CampbellAs far as I can tell, our only family Christmas tradition is pushing our oversized heads into too-small Christmas cracker hats until they split. We never wanted this tradition it was never planned. We have tried everything to get rid of it, short of having our skulls shrunk in questionable science experiments – such as balancing the hat on top of our spherical skulls and just not moving for the rest of the dinner, turning very slowly to address others at the table, the top of our bodies moving like Batman locked into his batsuit. But nothing works. The hats still split in two, or they topple into the gravy. It is an inevitability that we have given up dreading and merely succumbed to. If it’s just family at the table, we will turn the hats until the split is obvious, like a badge of big-headed honour. But we collectively fear work Christmas parties and being invited to Christmas dinner at other people’s houses. What if they make us put on the hats?Combining a creamy crumbly texture and mouth-watering garlic and herbs, Boursin is a welcome addition to any festive buffet – and a versatile soft cheese for your party season cooking, too.

But the venerable Odeon Leicester Square, back in action after an extensive and expensive refurbishment – which, crucially, shrank the number of seats in its main auditorium – has taken bold new steps in testing cinemagoers’ moth-like attraction to the city lights.Twitter erupted on Monday as a slew of comments pointed out that a single ticket to the swanky cinema’s top festive draw, Mary Poppins Returns, could set you back as much as £40.75. With a fair wind and a favourable Ryanair deal, you could pay less to pop over to Barcelona and see the film there. Advance critical word for Mary Poppins Returns suggests it is a splendid family jaunt – but are you excited enough to splash out £200 on taking the kids to see it?Stung into action by this iffy publicity for its flagship venue, Odeon was quick to point out that the tweets don’t tell the whole story: £40 merely represents the top end of a pricing system that varies depending on the day, the date, and the type and location of seat. Settle for a less plush seat (the “Luxe Classic” as opposed to the “Luxe Recliner” – everything’s luxe at Odeon, you see) in the back row for a matinee show and you can experience souped-up sound and vision for a mere £10.75 not exactly a bargain relative to the cheap-and-cheerful Prince Charles Cinema around the corner, but less likely to raise eyebrows.Either way, Odeon argues, “it offers fantastic value compared to tickets for other popular destinations like the theatre, concerts or live sports”. Which is all very well, you might say, save for the fact that projecting a film on to a screen isn’t quite equivalent to live entertainment either as a unique experience or as a feat of human labour, however comfy the seat. At a time when Odeons and Vues are battling the alluringly cheap, convenient likes of Netflix to retain their audiences, is treating cinema as theatre the way forward? Is any film worth £40?Cinema is no less valuable an art form than theatre or live music. I’ve paid upwards of £40 to see some very forgettable plays in my time, and a comparative pittance for cinema experiences that will stay with me for ever, from Alfonso Cuarón’s dizzily space-shifting Gravity in 3D to a lustrously restored Lawrence of Arabia at the BFI Southbank. Would I retrospectively swap those investments round, in terms of how they rewarded me in turn? Probably. And if you’re confident that Mary Poppins Returns (or Aquaman, or even the upcoming Transformers spinoff Bumblebee) will blow your mind to that extent, then go forth and recline. But let’s not pretend the luxury cinema movement – and Odeon is far from the first chain to hike its prices, pad its chairs and fancy up its bar menu to promote a better-than-home experience – has been forged to advance the art of cinema. Truly great films change your life at any price."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/903878df4d4f0e49ce409f1172959c6fc2e6c428/0_74_3800_2280/master/3800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d09202c6e25afc3601fd162938eb0b09","title":"kevin hart oscars host","story":"The comedian is hosting next year’s Academy Awards thanks partly to its ersity drive, but his close-to-the-bone style has potential for gaffes social media will leap onSo the curiously flavoured chalice passes to stadium-filling, movie-starring, controversy-provoking comedian Kevin Hart, the star of Jumanji and many other films and specials, who has confirmed that he will be hosting the 2019 Oscar ceremony. In some ways, it is a surprise that he hasn’t done this gig before now. Hart’s is one of the most dizzying rises to the top in modern showbusiness history so spectacular that fellow comedian Dave Chappelle has a pretty mordant bit about he feels about this staggeringly upward career. Hart has claimed on his Instagram feed that this job has been “a goal on my list for a long time”, and of course it is a sign that you have arrived.But Hart must be aware that Oscar hosts present themselves as non-Oscar-winners almost by definition, and that the host is dangerously exposed as never before, over a long evening, fronting a telecast with declining ratings and disrespectful social media coverage. A slip, a fluff, a miscalculated gag, a cutaway to someone frowning in the audience, will metastasise into a gif. The chances are high that he is going to be thought to have done the job badly, unfunnily or offensively. The touchstone of awfulness is Seth MacFarlane in 2013 with his We Saw Your Boobs number, whose ironic context was not considered sufficient to explain an abysmally toe-curling routine.He later explained that this was an essentially comic dramatisation of his own anxieties and insecurities – a self-satire. Many were not entirely happy with that gloss. Yet the point is that unlike, say, former host Jimmy Kimmel, who comes from the more emollient background of talk-show host, Hart is a comedian: his job is to hilariously overstep his bounds and tread on toes for laughs.It is a minefield. Perhaps no one has ever done the job better than Tina Fey and Amy Poehler hosting the Golden Globes, especially in 2015, when they launched fearlessly into material about Bill Cosby sexually assaulting young women. Only they could have got away with it, at that point in time, and at the Globes, with those awards’ notably more relaxed – and enjoyable – atmosphere.As for Hart, he is, or can be, a very funny comic. The Oscars will not get the best out of him: they never do. My personal choice would have been Michelle Wolf, the standup who got into trouble for her speech at White House Correspondents’ Dinner.

Now Tom Cruise has set his sights on ‘motion smoothing’ – the TV effect that makes films look like soap operas – it’s only a matter of time before you tweak the settingsThis has been a landmark year for Tom Cruise. In Mission: Impossible – Fallout he made the action film of his career. He’s currently filming a sequel to one of his most beloved films, Top Gun. And it’s been rumoured that he has plans to make history by literally filming Mission: Impossible 7 in space.How on earth could Tom Cruise manage to top all this? Simple. He’s made a video urging you to switch off motion smoothing on your TV. For this, he deserves everything. Welcome back, Tom. We’ve missed you.At 9:46 last night, Tom tweeted an 87-second video in which he and his go-to director Christopher McQuarrie explained the concept of video interpolation and why it is the death of all good things. Video interpolation, they explained, is a digital video effect used to improve the quality of high-definition sport. “The unfortunate effect is that it makes most movies look like they were shot on high-speed video rather than film,” said Cruise. “This is sometimes referred to as the ‘soap-opera effect’.” They explained that most HD televisions come with video interpolation switched on by default, they explained how to switch it off, and then they both nodded with total sincerity.Now, it’s worth noting that Tom Cruise is by no means the first film-maker to rail against motion smoothing. Back when he was still the s of the Galaxy director, James Gunn tweeted that he, Edgar Wright, Rian Johnson and Matt Reeves were also peeved about the default nature of video interpolation, to which Reed Morano replied that she started a petition to fix the issue a number of years ago, to little avail.Why did it fail? Possibly because none of these people are Tom Cruise. Because Tom Cruise has made a career of total commitment. Take him to a premiere and he’ll spend hours on the red carpet, shaking every single hand until everyone’s happy. Put him in a movie with helicopters in it and he’ll teach himself to fly a helicopter to the level of a veteran stunt coordinator. Break his ankle on the side of a building, and he’ll stagger out of frame on his ruined legs rather than blow a shot.So you’d better believe that, if Tom Cruise wants you to turn off motion smoothing on your television, you will turn off motion smoothing on your television. This video is just the start. The next stage will be visiting your house personally and asking you nicely. After that he’ll visit your house and verbally threaten you. If you still haven’t switched off motion smoothing by then, Tom Cruise will force himself through your TV screen using willpower alone, like the girl from The Ring, grab the remote out of your dumb cow hands and turn off motion smoothing himself. He will do whatever it takes.The thing is, he has a point. Video smoothing is the worst. It’s too sharp and too cheap-looking, and undoes all the millions of dollars that go into making a film look nice. My younger brother Pete has a TV the size of his living-room wall, and he still hasn’t switched off motion smoothing. He invited me around his house not so long ago, to watch the Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson film San Andreas. And it was legitimately unwatchable. With video interpolation turned on, the whole film looked awful, like a kaleidoscope made of different types of migraine. Tom Cruise is doing a good thing here. He deserves our respect.Plus, you know, it’s just nice to see a Tom Cruise video appear online that isn’t somehow about Xenu. If nothing else, that has to count for something."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a9b845205e88eabf1f5ba97078bee8a18c780f2/0_1086_4480_2687/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=011f264772ea32a8b5777e8a8129646d","title":"vox lux natalie portman brady corbet analysis","story":"While the Oscar-buzzed remake of A Star is Born stuck to its romantically old-fashioned roots, the Natalie Portman-starring drama offers a toxic alternative Who’d be a pop star, eh? If there’s one thing we’ve learned from cinema in 2018 – A Star is Born, Vox Lux, even the PG-rated neutering of Freddie Mercury’s legend in Bohemian Rhapsody – it’s that the gleaming lights of the music industry can emit a pretty harsh glow when you’re under them, that the warm embrace of a crowd can turn to a stranglehold in the blink of a heavily made-up eye. That fame comes at a price is, admittedly, not the hottest of takes: in the movies, it goes back at least as, well, 1932’s What Price Hollywood?, the film that directly bore one of this year’s grit-amid-the-glitter case studies.In Bradley Cooper’s fourth official iteration of A Star is Born, an earthy, working-class nightclub chanteuse played by Lady Gaga is made over, more or less, into Lady Gaga: the mononymous Ally, a metallically polished, millions-selling pop a whose heart is broken and whose soul is compromised en route to true, unfettered artistry. By the time she croons, with a pained tremor in her Whitney-style pipes, the weepy ballad I’ll Never Love Again in the film’s finale – to a raptly sympathetic audience mindful of what she has lost along the way – the film aligns itself with the age-old view that great art is born of suffering, and that the best singers channel their life’s pain into their voices.That moral hinges on the film’s own rather conservative musical preferences: we’re invited to see I’ll Never Love Again, a supremely well-shaped slab of pop melodrama that any belter from Barbra Streisand to Celine Dion would have similarly nailed in decades past, as a richer, more satisfying artistic statement than any of the sassier R\u0026ampB-inflected cuts that saw her scale the charts. (“Why’d you come around me with an ass like that?” she snaps on one, in a bumping, grinding Saturday Night Live performance intended to signal her lowest creative ebb.)Some have accused Cooper’s film of an anti-pop sensibility: not necessarily true, given the film’s own expert populist construction, but its view of emotional catharsis and artistic redemption – all tied up in a stripped-back love song – is romantically old-fashioned. The new A Star is Born takes place in a world where bluesy country rockers enthrall Coachella masses and drag-bar patrons alike, where strings-soaked power ballads relaunch careers, and where social media seems not to exist: it may prove the enduring emotional effectiveness of its oft-told story, but as a snapshot of pop culture in 2018, it feels about as lived-in as Gaga’s stick-on eyebrows.It’s a world that leaves Ally bruised but not broken, head held high at her final curtain call. Whether she would so stoically survive the contemporary music industry that engulfs Celeste, the prickly heroine of Brady Corbet’s Vox Lux, is another matter. Jaggedly cynical, stripped of any semblance of romance, and painted in tones of dull silver where A Star is Born favours California gold, Corbet’s film is effectively the wicked sister of Cooper’s: both portray a gifted young female singer wounded and jaded by the commercial demands of the pop machine, emerging as a different animal in the process.Yet where celebrity leaves Ally sadder but wiser, truer than before to her scarred heart, Celeste buries her pain in its sparkly privileges. Played as an adult by an astonishing Natalie Portman – hard-faced, high-haired and snappish as a Venus flytrap – she’s a human tabloid headline, all affected attitude and high-maintenance artifice. She speaks in cryptic soundbites to family members and magazine journalists alike she seems loosest and least mannered when kite-high on drugs supplied by her loyal but toxic manager (a perfectly skeevy Jude Law). When we learn, in a grimly topical shock far from A Star is Born’s frame of reference, that one of her music videos has inspired a massacre by copycat-styled killers in eastern Europe, she seems less freaked out than her coterie of advisers: Celeste’s reality is already so foggily suspended that art-life boundaries count for little.Where celebrity creates Ally’s trauma, however, it exploits and exacerbates Celeste’s: she rises to fame in her teenage years as the sole survivor of a Columbine-style school shooting, as the earnest, moving song of mourning she writes and performs at a memorial service becomes a national anthem of healing. A record deal follows, but her minders know that tragedy doesn’t shifts units the precocious victim is swiftly moulded into a slinky pop starlet, the inspirational empowerment sentiments of her songwriting sexed up with slick synthetic beats (Sia composed all Celeste’s originals) and feline choreography.Vox Lux doesn’t show the complete transformation: rather, it zooms nearly 20 years forward to the acid-spitting final product. 2018-edition Celeste is still topping the charts with upbeat dance-pop, performed with an impressively robotic proficiency that belies the jangle of nerves, neuroses and addictions this one-time America’s sweetheart has become. “I’m a private girl in a public world,” she sings in one of her samey-sounding hits, and it’s one of her few lyrics – otherwise awash with canned self-help mantras – she seems able to express with conviction. Vox Lux, like A Star is Born, climaxes with a comeback concert: a full, seamless, blaring half-hour set that Portman barks and dances through with jaw-dropping elan. There are no teary confessionals or admissions of lessons learned here, however: Celeste tumbles directly into it from a day of catastrophic PR blunders and substance abuse, her onstage composure an odd lapse of professional responsibility before, inevitable, she falls apart again once the lights are off.Both films, then, conclude that the show must go on, though the implications of that moral are far bleaker in Corbet’s film than in Cooper’s: Ally continues because she is bound to her art, Celeste because she is bound to her industry. Is either film an apt portrait of the modern pop machine? Maybe not, if we believe what is likely to be this year’s most enduring pop artefact: Ariana Grande’s video for Thank U, Next, an airily autobiographical earworm in which the pint-size powerhouse sings through past heartbreaks – and even the death of one former lover – with blithe, unsentimental acceptance, and one steely eye fixed on the future.A cheekily self-reflexive work made to be pored over and memed into oblivion by a celebrity-fixated internet, it demonstrates a sense of humour neither Ally nor Celeste can muster – an awareness that her post-celebrity life will never be quite her own, so she will lead with packaging it and satirising it for us. The pop industry may well be as taxing and as damaging as both A Star is Born and Vox Lux suggest, but perhaps Generation Grande, cannily reared on selfies and social media, has found savvier ways to survive it. That film has yet to be made."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f01f4bb5820b31f018a270a70901d7ec4661344/389_3512_6734_4040/master/6734.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a31708e7c309acffd971e3af237f012","title":"gingerbread biscuits decorations recipe felicity cloake","story":"Gingerbread men are always a festive treat, for the tree and tummy alike, but why not mix things up this Christmas with stars, trees – or even a dinosaur?Forget glittery aubergines and hand-tied wreaths: the best decoration is an edible decoration, preferably homemade.

Add the sugar and beat again until there are no lumps and the mixture is well combined – you can use a wooden spoon for this if you’re feeling strong, or the beating tool on a food mixer, which will be quicker and easier.Break the egg into a cup or jug and beat with a fork to mix the yolk and white. Very gradually beat the egg into the butter and sugar mixture, a little at a time so it doesn’t curdle. If it does start to look grainy, don’t worry – just add a little flour to bring it back together.Put the flour, baking powder, salt and spices in a separate bowl and whisk to mix and help break up any lumps. Now stir them into the butter and sugar until the mixture comes together into a dough. Stir the finely chopped crystallised ginger or dried apricots into the dough as well.Spread a large rectangle of clingfilm on a work surface and put the gingerbread dough on top. Cover it with another large rectangle of clingfilm, then gently roll out with a rolling pin until the dough is about 3mm thick.

Remove the top layer of clingfilm, cut out the biscuits using cookie cutters of whatever shape you like, then arrange on the baking sheets, leaving a couple of centimetres between each one, so they have room to spread out while they bake.Bake for 10 minutes. Make sure you have a skewer or cocktail stick ready and, as soon as you take the biscuits out of the oven, poke holes big enough to thread a ribbon through in the top – it’s important to do this when the biscuits are still warm, because if you wait until they cool, they will break.Very gently transfer the biscuits to a wire rack (they will still be soft, but don’t worry – they’ll crisp up as they cool) and leave to cool completely before you begin to ice them. If you put the icing on when they’re too warm, it will just run off.If you want to ice the biscuits, sift the icing sugar into a wide bowl to get rid of any lumps. Stir in just enough boiling water to make a smooth paste, then dip one face of each biscuit in the icing. Sprinkle with hundreds and thousands, if using, then put back on the rack to set.Alternatively, decorate the biscuits with writing icing or melt some chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of boiling water (or in the microwave) and drizzle over the cooled biscuits.

A few months into the reign of Unai Emery, the first post-Wenger season already looks like offering a more flattering reflection of Arsenal’s longest‑serving manager than the shared angst of his later years.Not that Wenger has been there to see it. It is a notable feature of his departure that this really has been a full stop. Wenger has been a ghost, an absence, spending his time being lionised in various exotic locales, doing TV work, and generally staying away from the reconditioned club he helped conceive, design and deliver.With encouraging results so far. If Sunday afternoon was the most energising experience at the Emirates for this new-build Emery team, Wednesday at Old Trafford represents the stiffest away trip yet, at a place where Arsenal haven’t won in the league since 2006. It is the next step in a daunting set of fixtures. As of last Sunday Arsenal have set off on a run of 11 league games to the start of February, five of which are Spurs at home, United away, Liverpool away, Chelsea at home and Manchester City away.Old Trafford is a huge occasion in that context, as it is in other, less tangible ways. Already there has been a shift here. Throughout the dog days of the Wenger years Arsenal were so often the fall guys in these heavyweight fixtures, extras in someone else’s narrative. But for the first time in a decade it is instead Arsenal who are the more fertile story here.There isn’t a great deal of interest left in this deathly Manchester United, beyond the exact detail and timing of what seems an inevitable exit for José Mourinho. This has felt for some time like another dead end, a process of entropy that has been in train ever since the departure of United’s own long-serving colossus.Talking of which, here’s an interesting idea. Perhaps Wenger left Arsenal in better shape than some may have wanted to see. It is a widespread mistake to assume Emery’s early success with this team reflects poorly on his predecessor, just as the agonies of David Moyes should reflect well on Ferguson.In reality there is a case that Wenger’s lack of pot-hunting sense, his obsession with processes and financial caution, indeed many of the things that brought such frustration towards the end, may have been perfect for succession planning, the ideal gift to his successor.If it has been easy for Emery to pull the loose threads and produce a team who are, with a little luck, unbeaten in 19 games then this is in part because he inherited an environment where the basics were already in place. The facts might not tally with the idea of Wenger running Arsenal into the ground. In reality he left the club with a strong squad of players, a fine and profitable stadium, an excellent training ground, sound recruitment structure (not all his doing) and good spirit with an absence of destructive egos. Plus, of course, no strings to bind his successor, no looming presence in the stands, just room to breathe and build from a sound base.Wenger gave a first-team debut to 10 of the 13 outfield players who beat Spurs on Sunday. He signed the league’s top scorer, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, whose movement was a striking contrast with that of Harry Kane in his current mode, which involves spending a lot of time walking backwards, reaching out with his hands for someone to grapple and spin off, like a man in search of the bathroom light switch late at night.Wenger also left some decent defenders and a good spread of age ranges, not to mention enough depth in midfield to allow Emery to become increasingly brusque with Mesut Özil. When Özil was awarded his new deal Wenger suggested this was the “cheapest” way of having a player of Özil’s type at the club. Which does overlook the option of hiring a handsomely groomed mannequin to sit on the bench or just not having a player of Özil’s type at all, which appears to be Emery’s favoured path.To his credit Emery saw instantly that this team needed a proper defensive shield. He is clearly a far better judge of that kind of player: Lucas Torreira has been a revelation, a different level of footballer to Mohamed Elneny, Francis Coquelin and other token Wenger-era midfield bolts.Emery has of course been helped in this by Sven Mislintat. The appointment of a head of recruitment may have irked Wenger at times but Mislintat is clearly an expert in talent ID, his presence making a strong contrast with United, where Ed Woodward and AN Other have presided over an increasingly scattergun process of spend and hope.These are the earliest of early days. But it does seem possible Arsenal might just avoid the angst-fuelled contortions of the immediate post-Fergie years, when the only really lasting gifts to the future were Moyes and a misleading final league title for an ageing, middling team. United are still strong enough to win on Wednesday night and ignite their own run through autumn into winter. But for Arsenal the progress made under Emery is still significant and a tribute to the structures already in place. Those more disgruntled supporters may well have “got back” their club but it still bears the stamp and shape of a manager who stayed too long, who became a little worn by the end, but whose departure has left hope rather than confusion in his place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc29cf1d32f4552486193ce7e6a33a783327ff72/104_670_2947_1768/master/2947.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c30a703bdc5714f687851ff6cbb3b2f","title":"woman in charge mens team football arlesey town natasha orchard smith","story":"Arlesey Town started the season with manager Natasha Orchard-Smith and want others to follow suitYou see men going into women’s football the door should be open for women to come into men’s. It sounds sort of obvious. So why is it so rare?Two former semi-pro players, Matt Endersby and James Hatch, took charge of the Bedfordshire club Arlesey Town, in the ninth tier of English football, at the start of June. Following relegation there were no players, they had no coaching staff and they had very little time to settle in. The first thing they needed to do was find a head coach and they phoned Natasha Orchard-Smith.For them it was obvious. They knew Orchard-Smith. “When I was coaching at Barton she was stood behind the dugout one day,” says Endersby. “I was listening to everything she was saying and I was like: ‘Who is this woman? This information she’s coming out with is spot on.’“We sat down and thought it would be brilliant. Men’s football goes one way completely. Men’s football: male coaches. Nah, let’s forget this. Natasha is intelligent, she’s detailed, she’s technical. I played semi-pro for 20-plus years and she’s got to be one of the best coaches I’ve come across. We said: ‘Let’s do this. Let’s bring a female in.’”They knew it was unusual. They just did not realise how unusual. The FA has confirmed that Orchard-Smith is the only female head coach from the National League down.“There’s no reasons why anyone couldn’t do it,” says Orchard-Smith. “You’ve just got to be given the opportunity.”Now they know how rare their decision was, they are hoping it will help others take the same step. “We’re hoping that other managers in non-league and maybe pro look at it and go: ‘They hired a female coach, what’s wrong with that? Why can’t we do it?’” says Endersby. “Some of these women coaches coming through are so good and they just need to be given a chance.”Has it changed the club? “The dynamic has changed, the crowd is different, the management in the other dugout don’t know what to do. There’s more respect. The players here have absolutely warmed to her, they’ve got respect for her. What she says goes. No one ever questions it and, to be honest, if they did, they aren’t the right player for my and James’ team.”Orchard-Smith is a remarkably experienced coach. As a player “not playing at a very high level” she was encouraged to do her FA Level 1 badge by a friend.“I did it and then didn’t really do anything with it,” she says. “But when my lad got to about seven and started to show an interest in football I took him to a local club and then kind of became part of the club. They needed a manager, under-eights, and because I had done my Level 1 they were like: ‘Yep, bang, thank you, we’ll have you.’ I did that for 10 years, under-eights to under-18s.”She completed her Level 2 and Uefa B licences, her goalkeeping Level 2, has worked as an FA skills coach in Bedfordshire, has her own coaching business, a degree in coaching for performance from Anglia Ruskin and is currently undertaking her goalkeeping Uefa B.But when her son reached 18 and shifted his focus from football, she thought she would have a step back and reclaim her evenings and weekends. Then Arsenal approached her and she started working with their under-10 girls in their Regional Talent Centre. She had been there for 14 months and was lined up to be there this season – but then Endersby called to offer a bit of an alien project.“I wasn’t sure because I hadn’t worked in the men’s game before, I’d mainly worked 5-11s and youthgrassroots. Which is completely different to semi-pro,” says Orchard-Smith. “I went in and I’ve never really looked back. It’s very different but I’ve loved every minute of it. I think I’ve been very lucky, the lads have taken to me from the moment I came in. Ones that moved from other clubs, they knew I was already there. They’ve been very receptive.”It was a big learning curve. Having always been in development, switching to success-reliant football took time to adjust, but to say she has flourished is an understatement. The team are fourth in the Spartan South Midlands League Premier Division with 12 wins from 17 and sit six points off the top.“I’m ecstatic because sometimes it takes two to three years for a team to build. We are doing really, really well,” says Endersby.But success on the pitch is not the be all and end all for Endersby and Hatch. “We can see the long-term goal. What this can do for female footballers and women in football. There are probably 10 other Natasha’s sitting round the country going, ‘You know what, if she can do it, I can do it.’“It takes one person to break the mould. I think it’s great for women’s football and I think it’s great for men’s football. We’ve landed on gold. She’s Uefa B. We want to go higher in the game, me and James, and we’ve always said we’d like to bring her with us. We now joke that it’ll be us trying to go up with her.”• Uefa have announced that the Football Association has been successful in its bid to host the 2021 European Championship – very much a formality as England were the only bidders.

This bravado is vital to their development. Combine it with a smartphone that gives instant access to a world of games and all sorts of video content, however, and you have a potentially tricky cocktail.“The internet is an amazing place and a wonderful resource, but, like all things, it has its dark side and its dangers,” says children’s commissioner Anne Longfield. “Parents have a vital role to play in making children aware of how to handle the challenges of being online.”Parents are understandably anxious and reticent about discussing some of these issues, but learning and behaviour specialist Noël Janis-Norton, who also founded calmerparenting, is adamant they should tackle the subjects early. “Don’t wait until something goes wrong,” she says. “The conversation needs to start before tweenagers even have a phone, so clear rules can be put in place.”It’s not a chat to be had on the fly either. “The more serious you can make the conversation feel, the more likely children will take it seriously,” she advises. “If there are two parents involved, both should sit down together, to make the message feel united.”Taking the issues seriously is one thing, but it’s important not to let the conversation become emotional or dramatic. “As adults we can really set the tone,” says chartered educational psychologist Dan O’Hare. “Do you want a child to learn that when they talk about subjects like this they make Mum or Dad scared and angry, or do you want them to learn that you can talk about difficult things together?”Dictating a list of how much screen time is allowed, or which apps are out-of-bounds, won’t work either. Instead, work together to agree a set of suitable guidelines or a contract – your children will be much more likely to stick to these rules. “Parents can learn a lot about the internet from their children, so it needn’t be a lecture or a telling off, but an exploration together,” says Longfield.It’s a view endorsed by O’Hare, who recommends that parents draw on the tricky online situations they’ve experienced personally. “If an adult talks about an upsetting post they’ve seen on Facebook they can then involve the child in discussing ways to deal with it. That collaborative coming together gives the young person a sense of responsibility.”How can parents know whether their messages and advice are truly getting through to their children? Janis-Norton recommends “think-throughs”, where a parent spends just a minute at a time encouraging a child to consider a situation and how they would respond to it. “Ask something like: ‘What can you tell a stranger online?’ or ‘How can you tell if somebody online is really a kid?’ to get your child thinking about things properly. Their brain will automatically start visualising what they should do, so it sticks in their mind much better.”Having set these guidelines, it’s vital that parents praise their children when they abide by them, such as by turning off their phones at mealtimes. “Parents can be so preoccupied that they don’t say anything when things are going well, and only notice when something’s going wrong,” says Janis-Norton. “Praise helps a child associate following the rules with their parents being pleased and there being a relaxed, happy atmosphere at home.”There’s a growing amount of practical tools that can help. The monqi phone management app creates a closed and entirely safe ecosystem that makes it easy for kids to get started online, using a handset such as the IMO S2 the app also enables parents to monitor what their children are up to online via their own phone, and set screen time limits. Then there’s the phone behaviour contract for families, created by tech expert Andy Robertson, and Childline’s Zipit app, which gives kids the tools to deflect unwanted online attention – with the help of downloadable gifs.Parents can take an active practical role here too. “It’s all very well telling a child to block someone on Instagram or report them on Facebook, but they need to know how to actually do it,” says O’Hare. “As adults we have a responsibility to learn how to do these things ourselves, so we can teach the children.”Of course, the discussion about online safety doesn’t end there. New tech, new trends and even new friends all bring fresh challenges that will need to be talked about and agreed upon. But by establishing open, relaxed ways of communicating about tricky issues, parents can keep healthy conversations going throughout childhood, into adolescence and beyond.Visit Tesco Mobile to find out more about the IMO S2 with monqi"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/841058cc8cd9af17a6167a3023c35614392e20a0/0_2_1960_1176/master/1960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=890f10052caff9c4a2ae349b6c2a5d86","title":"legal analytics when big data meets big law","story":"Automated data analysis has changed how scientists think about health research, and is helping uncover inefficiencies in transport systems. Now it’s making waves in the legal sectorData is invading the legal system. In January, prosecutors in Germany presented a court with data from an iPhone suggesting a suspect was climbing stairs when it was alleged he had been dragging a body down a steep bank. It isn’t the only case of its kind: pacemaker data has been used in US courts as evidence against a wearer and data from fitness trackers has been used to indicate how, for example, a person’s lifestyle has changed after an injury.The amount of data being created by the devices people carry around has grown exponentially, and had a knock-on impact across multiple professions. For criminal lawyers, it has increased the potential evidence that’s available, and this increase in data has been mirrored across all branches of law. It’s a trend that has the potential to completely disrupt the legal profession. “The biggest impact,” says James Rogers, a solicitor at Norton Rose Fulbright, “will not be caused by big data alone – rather it will be the combination of big data with other innovations, such as artificial intelligence (AI) or distributed ledger technologies.”Data created through the legal process is already being digitised and combined with other tech. It has the potential to make the jobs of lawyers more straightforward. “We will be able to find pertinent cases more easily through better recommender systems that leverage machine learning,” says Wolfgang Alschner, an assistant professor in common law at the University of Ottawa. “Another area is document and compliance review, where computers can find patterns in large amounts of texts more reliably and quickly.”Everlaw, a legal tech startup that has raised more than $25m from Silicon Valley investors, is applying AI to historic legal reports to help lawyers prioritise and analyse documents. It is using computer science to visualise data from documents and predict the most relevant cases for lawyers to inspect.For such a system to analyse court cases and predict decisions, it needs data. But this has to be the right type of data. It needs to be easily read and understood by machines – scruffy handwriting can be tough to interpret, but clear check boxes on forms are easier for software to understand. If big data is machine readable, then AI systems can save the legal industry money and time.Rogers says it will initially have the greatest impact on areas that are “relatively formulaic and process- or volume-driven”. This includes disclosure, verification, first-tier due diligence review and similar processes. However, AI won’t be using data to formulate complex adversarial arguments at any point soon. “Human elements: intuition, judgment, emotion, memory, perception and so on, are all integral to that process,” he says.It’s already been proven that data can be put to work to speed up lengthy legal processes. In one instance, the UK’s Serious Fraud Office found itself with more than 30m documents to examine during a corruption investigation into Rolls-Royce.“The program was able to interpret and understand material from a range of sources, including emails, financial records, data tables and photographs – but, unlike a human team, it could work efficiently for days on end without interruption,” he says. The SFO won the case – its biggest investigation – and Rolls-Royce was ordered by a court to pay £497m, plus the costs of the SFO’s investigation.For the moment, AI and analytical platforms create an advantage for legal firms and clients that can afford to pay for it. But it also has the potential to democratise the sector. “It will make legal services more accessible to lay people by driving down costs and by fuelling the development of self-help applications directly targeted at non-lawyers,” Alschner says. “All this will transform the role of the lawyer and their day-to-day legal practice.”Stanford law student Joshua Browder has been pivotal in improving how legal data can be combined with technology to make the law easier to comprehend. He created a chat-bot “lawyer,” called DoNotPay, which allows users to contest parking tickets they have received. Browder says the system talks people through the legal steps required to make a complaint and automatically files their issue. It has won more than 400,000 cases. The DoNotPay system has since been expanded to tackle legal loopholes used when flights are booked, to help customers get automatic refunds.But there are some concerns around the use of big data. Data scientists, across multiple fields, have shown that automated systems inherit any bias that’s contained in the data they are trained upon. In some cases, AI has replicated racist and sexist language it has seen in data sets. Alschner argues that legal data needs to be freely accessible, while also ensuring that privacy laws are respected.“Law is a public good,” he says. “But most legal texts, from court decisions to filings, are only accessible through commercial service providers that do not generally share data in bulk.” The solution to the problem? “Large legal information providers can lead the way by sharing more of their data with academics, governments and legal analytics companies,” Alschner adds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e812bae47af73754f139888affba374ce97792d/1004_963_3915_2349/master/3915.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4829fbc42e6ec41c166054dcbd37e783","title":"engelbert humperdinck webchat interview","story":"The singer answered questions on his hometown, Leicester, working with Cat Stevens and the Walker Brothers, riding Harley-Davidsons, and his wife’s Alzheimer’sAnd that’s all for now To all the other people who posted questions, I\u0027m sorry we ran out of time - hopefully next time! All the best.Do you prefer building sandcastles or snowmen?I do like snowmen!You famously stopped the Beatles’ consecutive No 1 set of singles when Release Me beat Strawberry Fields ForeverPenny Lane. But which of those two Beatles songs do you prefer? And who is your favourite Beatle?I\u0027ll be honest with you - I was proud of the fact that a Leicester lad stopped the mighty Beatles, who I adore, with a song that came from Nashville. It stopped them having their 13th number one - unlucky for them, but lucky for me. I love all the Beatles, but I\u0027ve only met Paul and Ringo.Why is there a saddle in your living room?What about the broad sword? Doesn’t everyone have one of those?I got that in 1973. I was playing a rodeo, in a Houston arena, and my entrance to the concert on that particular day was on a horse. Named Blue, actually. I believe we had 73,000 people in the audience, a very memorable occasion, and I still have the saddle that they gave me. Sometimes when I go on holiday I still ride along the beach on a horse - but I\u0027m not a good rider. I\u0027m a Harley rider.What do you recall of your 1967 tour with Cat Stevens and Jimi Hendrix on the same bill in support of the Walker Brothers? 1967. Great lineup!I consider the time with Cat Stevens, Hendrix and the Walker Brothers a very memorable time in my life - working with artists of that calibre was inspirational. I love Cat\u0027s writing, and his attitude in life - he did what he wanted to do and that\u0027s what I appreciate in people. Hendrix, I adored the man. He was very kind person to me, and offered me one of his jackets - I should have taken it but said, no, it\u0027s ok Jimi. The Walker Brothers, they were a talented pair of people. I thought that Scott had a very fine voice.Is there any truth in the rumour that when you were very young, your dad, Tommy, swapped you for a new trombone?I don\u0027t know who you\u0027re talking about! My father\u0027s name is not Tommy - but he did buy me my first ever saxophone, for which I thank him most sincerely.I often used to sit under a signed photo of you in the Durham Ox pub in Leicester. I used to enjoy imagining that you at some point a habitue of this fine pub . Did you ever go there?I\u0027ve been to many pubs in Leicester, and this may have been one of them - please forgive me for not being so precise in my answer!Lineker or Vardy (or perhaps another)? Where does winning the league rank in all time “Best. Days. Ever”?I am a Leicester fan and I held the trophy in my hands. I like both Lineker and Vardy very much - Vardy is now in his prime, and a very fine and wonderful player. I\u0027m very proud of being part of Leicester, and I happen to know the recent owner who passed in that awful accident, who was very much loved by the people of Leicester and around the world.You have spoken about your wife having Alzheimer’s. What alternative therapies are you using to treat her and what effect are they having?The greatest cure is prayer, because no solution for the disease has come up as of yet. But I think you have to try everything possible, including stem cells, which I think is the way of the future. My wife had that right at the beginning of her illness - I took her to Germany and had it done, but I think it was a mite early in the time of stem cells. But maybe it did have something to do in keeping her as long as I have, and thank God I have her. I do use other methods besides the medical world - I use electrical acupuncture, which is also a form of creating new stem cells. And I also use holistic medicine, which I\u0027ve found instrumental in one of my early illnesses that I had which other doctors couldn\u0027t cure, but this holistic doctor in Germany took away in two weeks. I had an infection and I was cold all the time - no one knew what it was and it scared me. Until someone told me about this holistic doctor in Hamburg - I visited him and he gave me some medicine and in two weeks the viral infection had gone. He\u0027s no longer living - a sad loss.I’ve heard you chose your stage name after a village in France called Moulins-Engilbert (where I reside). Is this true, or is the name from an 18th-century German composer? Please clear this up as there are rumours locally.I don\u0027t know where this village is, but Engelbert came to me from the composer of Hansel and Gretel. Gordon Mills, my manager, chose it originally. It\u0027s difficult to sign, and say, and to put up on a marquee - but it\u0027s served its purpose well.If you were to introduce yourself to your guests with lists of your hits, which ones would you start with?I think that\u0027s a trick question, because I think you get introduced to other people singing your songs to you - the one that is sung in airports, in my face, everywhere, is Please Release Me. It\u0027s remained my signature song and has remained the greatest asset of my life ever.Have you ever met someone with a better name than yours?No. Mine has been good to me."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/909ed19610b6b4fa645e57ef8027363ef17dd8ab/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90237ba1b83c5e0a94a89398e554788f","title":"honduras a dam and the of berta caceres","story":"Seven men have been convicted of the murder of an award-winning environmental activist in Honduras.

The prime minister can’t keep pushing parliament away or avoiding responsible scrutiny,” he said.MPs had already voted down a government compromise, which would have referred the dispute to parliament’s privileges committee, delaying it until after next week’s crunch vote on May’s deal.With the prime minister still waiting to open the formal debate, MPs then inflicted a third defeat, passing a cross-party amendment tabled by MPs including Dominic Grieve aimed at strengthening the hand of parliament if the deal is voted down.Backers of a softer Brexit – or a second referendum on May’s deal – cheered the move, which they hope will allow them to demonstrate parliament’s support for alternatives to May’s approach.This soft Brexit compromise has been championed by the former Conservative minister Nick Boles as a plan B for leaving the European Union if Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement is defeated in the Commons.It is based on Norway’s relationship with the EU, which is outside the bloc and the customs union but inside the single market. Under the plan the UK would have to join Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland in the European Free Trade Association (Efta), which would then allow it to participate in the European Economic Area (EEA).The ‘plus’ in this option refers to a temporary customs union with the EU, which would need to be negotiated to avoid a hard border ion the island of Ireland. The temporary arrangement would remain in place until the EU and UK agreed a specific trade deal.The option has the advantage of being as close to the EU as possible without full membership, and it would do away with the need for a problematic backstop for Northern Ireland. Like Norway, the UK would be outside the common fisheries and agriculture policies, and would not be subject to the European court of justice.But it crosses a key red line for Brexiters by continuing freedom of movement, one of the preconditions of single market membership. It would also limit the UK ability to negotiate its own trade deals while a new customs arrangement is under discussion. And it would require continued financial contributions to the EU without an influence inside the bloc.Grieve said: “MPs are tonight starting the process of taking back control. No longer must the will of parliament – reflecting the will of the people – be diminished. Parliament must now take back control and then give the final decision back to the public because, in the end, only the people can sort this out.”Grieve’s amendment was supported by the Democratic Unionist party and by 26 Tory rebels, including several former cabinet ministers, some of them erstwhile loyalists, such as Damian Green and Michael Fallon. The government lost by 321 votes to 299.Asked if May still commanded a majority in parliament, a No 10 source said: “Everybody knows the parliamentary arithmetic but during the course of this administration, we have won the overwhelming majority of the votes taking place.”May went on to open the debate with a defiant speech, which some at Westminster said sounded like a first draft of her own political obituary, with the future of her government in doubt.“I have spent nearly two years negotiating this deal. I have lost valued colleagues along the way. And faced fierce criticism from all sides,” she said.“If I had banged the table, walked out of the room and at the end of the process delivered the very same deal that is before us today, some might say I had done a better job. But I didn’t play to the gallery, I focused on getting a deal that honours the referendum and sets us on course for a bright future – and I did so through painstaking hard work.”Doggedly vowing to plough on with her controversial EU deal, the prime minister insisted there was no alternative that could command public support – and warned that rejecting it would be risky. “This argument has gone on long enough, it is corrosive to our politics and life depends on compromise,” she said.The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, replying to the prime minister, dismissed the political declaration accompanying the 585-page withdrawal agreement as “a very vague wish list.”“We still don’t know what our long-term relationship with Europe would look like and that’s why so many MPs across parliament are not willing to vote for this blindfold Brexit and take a leap in the dark about Britain’s future,” he said.May faced a series of hostile interventions from her own side, with the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who resigned in protest at her deal in July, calling it “a national humiliation, that makes a mockery of Brexit”.“We are going to be rule-takers we are going to be a de facto colony – and out of sheer funk we are ensuring we will never, ever be able to take advantage of the freedoms we should have won through Brexit,” he warned.Brexiters remained defiant, despite the passage of the Grieve amendment. The former Department for Exiting the EU minister Steve Baker, who vainly sought to spearhead a no confidence motion against May last month, insisted motions passed by MPs in the wake of the deal being rejected could not be binding.Privately, pro-Brexit sources suggested they would be content if May’s deal is rejected by a margin of at least 50 votes.While the government opposed the Grieve amendment, Downing Street hopes it will focus the minds of pro-Brexit MPs, by increasing the likelihood that the defeat of May’s deal next week would result in a fresh referendum. With just a week to go before Tuesday’s vote, May is expected to spend time meeting colleagues inidually in a bid to win them over.The government is also making fresh efforts to woo the DUP by offering further reassurances over access to the mainland’s market if the prime minister’s deal is voted through.“We are talking about unilateral commitments we can give in the House of Commons to provide reassurance in relation to providing access to the GB market,” a Downing Street source said.Earlier, as Labour MPs heard they had defeated the government in the contempt motion, a loud cheer went up, with one opposition backbencher shouting: “Beginning of the end!”The attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, had argued that the public interest did not permit the publication of the legal advice and instead published a summary and took questions in the House of Commons on Monday.During the debate, Starmer said the government was “wilfully refusing” to comply with a binding order to release the legal advice on its Brexit deal, putting it in contempt of parliament.Downing Street sources later sought to clarify reports that May would publish the legal advice on Wednesday, indicating that while the government will respond to the contempt vote, it might not publish the advice within 24 hours. “The legal advice will be published. The government will respond tomorrow,” one said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/530324c11412ba6a2a2a2ef085e7b27f78603e38/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8542f1b8773fbd123650eed4c4960e52","title":"food banks are not photo ops for tory mps corbyn tells may","story":"Labour leader uses PMQs to attack May over poverty and rollout of universal creditJeremy Corbyn has accused Conservative MPs of treating food banks as “a photo opportunity” as he used prime minister’s questions to break away from the debate on Brexit to castigate the government on poverty.The Labour leader used all his questions to press Theresa May on what he said was an urgent crisis caused by austerity and the rollout of universal credit, which he said had been highlighted in a damning report last month by the UN rapporteur on poverty.Pointing to statistics showing rising use of food banks, Corbyn highlighted a series of visits by Conservative MPs to food banks in recent days, which were often promoted via social media.“The Trussell Trust has also pointed out that food banks face record demand this December,” he said. “I just gently say to her and the members behind her: food banks are not just a photo opportunity for Conservative MPs, all of whom supported the cuts in benefits that have led to the poverty in this country.”May responded by saying the government rejected the UN report, and dismissed Corbyn’s call for a halt to universal credit, which critics say is causing people to go into debt or deprivation through delayed payments.The prime minister faced a series of exchanges on Brexit later in PMQs, notably from the Scottish National party’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford.Blackford was reprimanded by the Speaker, John Bercow, for intimating that May had been dishonest with MPs over the government’s legal advice on Brexit, which was released on Wednesday after a Commons motion found ministers in contempt of parliament for refusing to do so.“Since the prime minister returned from Brussels with the deal, the prime minister has been misleading the house, inadvertently or otherwise,” Blackford said.This brought an intervention from Bercow, who reminded Blackford of the Commons convention that MPs must not indicate they believe another member has been dishonest.Blackford rephrased his comment to say, “perhaps inadvertently”, bringing another rebuke, before he backed down.Corbyn had begun by saying: “While we debate the critical issue of Brexit, we must not neglect the crisis facing millions of people across our country.”He cited what he said was a “scathing report” from the UN, asking: “When the prime minister read the report, what shocked her more: was it the words the UN used or was it the shocking reality of rising poverty in Britain?”May insisted she did not accept the report’s findings: “What we actually see in our country today is absolute poverty at record lows, more people in work than ever before, youth unemployment almost halved, wages growing.”Corbyn responded by saying: “It could be that she doesn’t agree because it’s an unpalatable truth that’s in that report.” In sometimes noisy exchanges he moved on to demand universal credit be halted, and condemned slow wage growth and the treatment of people with disabilities.“This government labelled disabled people scroungers, it called those unable to work skivers, it created a hostile environment for the Windrush generation,” he said.“When the UN rapporteur said British compassion for those who are suffering has been replaced by a punitive, mean-spirited and callous approach. He couldn’t have summed up this contemptible government any better.”May rejected the comments, saying the Conservatives had been forced to make difficult decisions from 2010 because of the financial profligacy of the previous Labour government.Corbyn replied: “When I hear the prime minister talking about ‘difficult decisions’, what always happens afterwards in these contexts is the poorest lose out in our society.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6818d325ef4e67e25e732eaf50a5e6826c2f2595/167_48_1310_786/master/1310.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=471271a5c1154ba879fea531cb4ce89a","title":"may to publish brexit legal advice as tories urge change of course","story":"Papers to be released at 11.30am, after contempt vote MPs are told they will ‘live to regret’The government will release legal advice received over Brexit on Wednesday morning following Tuesday’s extraordinary three parliamentary defeats in a single day.Andrea Leadsom said the documents would be handed over at 11.30am after MPs passed a historic motion finding the government in contempt of parliament for failing to previously publish.Meanwhile, a string of Conservative colleagues urged the prime minister to change her plans for Brexit, which are due to be voted upon on Tuesday. She is facing almost certain defeat when MPs vote on the withdrawal agreement on 11 December.In a defiant interview on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Leadsom, the leader of the House, said any MP who had ambitions of being in government at some point in the future would “live to regret” the contempt vote that forced the government to publish its full Brexit legal advice.She said Wednesday night’s defeats made leaving the EU without a deal more likely and urged colleagues to return to the deal when they voted on it next Tuesday.“Law officers themselves will be very reluctant to give advice which they might then see across the front pages of the newspapers.“Frankly, any parliamentarian who wants at some point to be in government is going to live to regret their vote last night.”She said that the amendment proposed by fellow Tory Dominic Grieve which was passed on Tuesday, giving MPs the chance to vote on a “plan B” proposal if nothing has been agreed by January, did not mean that MPs could block a no-deal Brexit.“The government is committed to leaving the European Union in line with the referendum and unless government were to do something completely different to change tack, or indeed to pass this deal, then we will be leaving the EU on 29 March next year without a deal,” she said.Asked whether Theresa May was the right person to lead the government, she said: “She certainly is at the moment.”Leadsom, one of few long-term Brexiters who have stuck with May’s deal, argued that MPs had not properly read the deal on offer.“There has been an awful lot of misinformation about what’s in this deal,” she said.Leadsom’s interview followed that of Mark Harper, the former Tory chief whip. He told Today that the prime minister had to go back to Brussels to demand the backstop came out of the deal to eliminate a wedge between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.“She should listen to Conservative colleagues … It would undermine the UK common market and threaten the integrity of the UK by creating a customs and regulatory border down the Irish Sea,” he said.Harper urged the prime minister to return to Brussels to attempt to negotiate a new deal before the leaving date of 29 March.“There will be new facts on the table and she will have to go back to our European partners,” he said.Even if May did win Tuesday’s vote, she would not be able to govern because the DUP would withdraw support, Harper said.“If the deal goes through, we will be in office but unable to govern and we saw what happened yesterday,” he said.Justine Greening, the former education secretary and a remainer, called for a three-option second referendum to see the government through the current chaos, warning that without it “we could be debating Brexit not for the next five days but for the next five years”.“This is less about the future of the Tory party but more about how we can bring the country together.”The parliamentary veteran and former minister Oliver Letwin called for the government to move towards a “Norway-plus” deal – an alternative that would keep the UK in the EU single market, through membership of the European Economic Area, the 31-country zone that covers EU member states plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.This soft Brexit compromise has been championed by the former Conservative minister Nick Boles as a plan B for leaving the European Union if Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement is defeated in the Commons.It is based on Norway’s relationship with the EU, which is outside the bloc and the customs union but inside the single market. Under the plan the UK would have to join Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland in the European Free Trade Association (Efta), which would then allow it to participate in the European Economic Area (EEA).The ‘plus’ in this option refers to a temporary customs union with the EU, which would need to be negotiated to avoid a hard border ion the island of Ireland. The temporary arrangement would remain in place until the EU and UK agreed a specific trade deal.The option has the advantage of being as close to the EU as possible without full membership, and it would do away with the need for a problematic backstop for Northern Ireland. Like Norway, the UK would be outside the common fisheries and agriculture policies, and would not be subject to the European court of justice.But it crosses a key red line for Brexiters by continuing freedom of movement, one of the preconditions of single market membership. It would also limit the UK ability to negotiate its own trade deals while a new customs arrangement is under discussion. And it would require continued financial contributions to the EU without an influence inside the bloc.Promoted by the Conservative former minister Nick Boles, the Norway-plus option also means joining the European Free Trade Area, which also includes Switzerland.Letwin told the programme: “There is a very high possibility that the deal will be voted down.“If I was a betting man, I would say that all the motions will fail.“If we have a Norway-plus solution, the whole issue of a backstop falls away.”Dominic Raab, the former government lawyer who resigned from his post as Brexit secretary over his opposition to May’s deal, told the Today programme that only a new law could stop Brexit now.“And therefore if the deal is voted down on Tuesday I think what will matter most of all will not be what parliament says in a motion – it will need legislation to stop Brexit – what will matter is the will and resolve in No 10 Downing Street,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ccd10ff221f67a9c8f4d1212b29d2a527b3a875/0_4_1701_1021/master/1701.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6752e04a9b49db8194872866610cc2f3","title":"brexit debate pmqs legal advice may corbyn government to publish full legal advice at around 1130am politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s politics, as full legal advice released ahead of second day of Commons debate on Brexit dealSam Gyimah, who resigned as universities minister last week because of his opposition to Theresa May’s Brexit deal, is speaking now in the debate. He set out his case against the deal at length in an article, which is here on his Facebook page.Sajid Javid, the home secretary, faced repeated questions during his speech opening today’s Brexit debate about the immigration white paper. It has been repeatedly delayed, and the government now admits it will not be published before next week’s vote. Labour’s Yvette Cooper asked him if he could promise it would be published in December. Javid said it was “my intention” to publish it in December - implying that, if it does not come until 2019, that would because of an intervention from 2019.Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, is speaking now. She started her speech with a tribute to Tony Benn. This is from the New Statesman’s Stephen Bush.I will post more quotes from the Javid and Abbott speeches later.My colleague Graeme Wearden is covering Philip Hammond at the Treasury committee in detail on his business live blog. You can follow it here.Philip Hammond is giving evidence about Brexit to the Commons Treasury committee. Here are some highlights, from my colleague Richard Partington and from CityAM’s Owen Bennett.Here are some extracts from the DUP’s comment on what the full Brexit legal advice reveals.Northern Ireland remains in the EU’s customs union and will apply the whole of the EU’s customs acquis and the commission and the European court of justice will continue to have jurisdiction over its compliance with those rules. Therefore, goods passing from GB to NI will be subject to a declaration process.Northern Ireland will remain in the single market for goods and the EU’s customs regime and will be required to apply and comply with the relevant rules and standards. Herein opens up regulatory ergence in the future.The implication, as outlined by the attorney general, of NI remaining in the EU single market for goods while GB does not is that for regulatory purposes GB is“essentially treated as a third country by NI for goods passing from GB into NI”. This is totally unacceptable and economically mad in that it will be erecting internal economic and trade barriers within the United Kingdom.In paragraph 26 it appears possible that the EU could apply that the protocol is no longer necessary “in whole or in part” and consequently it is possible that the GB elements of the customs union could fall away leaving only Northern Ireland in the EU customs territory as the minimum necessary.Downing Street sources have not denied reports the government is considering what fresh reassurances it can provide to backbenchers anxious about the Irish backstop.Speaking to journalists after PMQs, they cited Theresa May’s remarks in the Brexit debate on Tuesday, that she understood MPs’ concerns and was having discussions with colleagues and considering further options.ITV’s Paul Brand has suggested MPs could be promised a “parliamentary lock”, before the backstop was invoked. (See 1.08pm.)Government sources stressed that any compromise measure could not involve reopening the withdrawal agreement, which May has repeatedly said risks a worse outcome.And they said May’s meetings with MPs would continue in the run-up to next week’s meaningful vote.This is what May said on this in the debate last night.So the backstop is not a trick to trap us in the EU. It actually gives us some important benefits of access to the EU’s market without many of the obligations. And this is not something the EU will want to let happen - let alone persist for a long time. But Mr Speaker, despite all of this, I know there are members of this House who remain concerned. I have listened to those concerns. I want us to consider how we could go further. And I will be continuing to meet colleagues to find an acceptable solution.In the Commons MPs have just started day two of the debate on the Brexit deal. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, is opening for the government.Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Westminster, intervenes. Citing the full legal advice published today, he says this shows that under Theresa May’s plan Northern Ireland could remain bound by EU law. The DUP has set out in full its comments on the legal advice here.From the Press Association’s Ian JonesThis is from ITV’s Paul Brand.Ian Blackford, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, used his first question at PMQs to accuse May of “concealing the facts on her Brexit deal”. Referring to the full Brexit legal advice published today, he said:Is it time that the prime minister took responsibility for concealing the facts on her Brexit deal from members in this House and the public? Will she take responsibility?As the Press Association reports, May rejected the claim, and said the full legal advice they were forced to publish today was the same as the shortened statement the government made earlier this week.Blackford called that an “incredibly disappointing response”, and then went on to suggest May had “inadvertently” misled the House of Commons on the Irish backstop. He said:Since the prime minister returned from Brussels she has been misleading the House, inadvertently or otherwise.This prompted protests from Tories. Under Commons rules, MPs are not meant to accuse each other of saying things that are misleading.John Bercow, the speaker, said there could be no “ambiguity” in Blackford’s suggestion that the PM had purposefully misled the House, which led the MP to alter his comment to saying the she had done it “perhaps inadvertently”. As the Press Association reports, this failed to dampen the Tory jeers, and Bercow asked him to “rephrase” his argument, but Blackford continued. In reply, May said the copy of the full legal advice Blackford was holding was “no different” to the statement the attorney general made on Monday.After PMQs Anna Soubry, the Tory MP, raises a point of order. She says that, when Bercow introduced Sammy Woodhouse, Tory MPs did not applaud even thought Labour MPs applauded because they were obeying the convention of the House that clapping is not allowed. It was not a sign of disrespect, she says.The Labour MP Louise Haigh asks about Sammy Woodhouse, the rape victim who spoke publicly about how a council was trying to give parental rights to the rapist father. As John Bercow said at the beginning of the session, Woodhouse is in the public gallery.May praises Woodhouse for speaking out, and urges Haigh to carry on pursuing this matter with the Ministry of Justice with view to getting the law changed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9b34a5bd51d25d5fe1adda234b3260c4b7b052d/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=436802c2a2ebd49ea2b88348fd924da3","title":"from plants to pets how to make your office a stress free zone","story":"Whether you bring dogs to work or introduce some greenery to your desk, these tips will help your workplace feel more relaxedNot every employer has the financial means for mass yoga sessions and relaxing off-site trips, but there are still ways to bring wellness to the workplace.“In simple terms, stress is the result of our mind preparing our body to respond to a perceived threat,” says Litzi Essler, founder of Happy Engine coaching. “The key word here is ‘perceived’ – as, in modern life, we spend a lot of time worrying about things that haven’t happened.” This can cause constant feelings of anxiety, as you prepare to deal with all the possible problems that may occur, she says.Whether you work on your own, you have a small business or manage hundreds of employees, making sure your colleagues and employees aren’t under undue levels of stress is critical to having a successful business. And it doesn’t have to break the bank.Scattering plants around the officeYou don’t need to be a botanist to realise the positive effect plants can have on an environment, and the workplace is no different. Plants that have been shown to have a de-stressing effect include aloe vera, peace lilies, bamboo palm, spider plants and rubber trees. Try dotting a few of these on your desk and around the office and see what the effect is on people’s moods.Allowing petsThe act of stroking a dog has been shown to increase levels of a hormone called oxytocin in both the dog and the human, while reducing cortisol levels in the person, too. Oxytocin is a happy hormone, whereas, cortisol is related to stress. So stroking dogs makes you happier and less stressed.At the UK Mars Petcare offices, dogs are a constant feature. “What’s amazing about having dogs in the office is the genuine relationship of support that can build over time between people and pets,” says Essler, who also works at a pet care company.“I often notice people taking short breaks in their day to stroke, cuddle or play with the dogs, which relieves their stress and over time builds a positive bond with the dog,” she says. “This unconditional relationship is extremely beneficial in challenging environments and often I see dogs seeking to comfort those who are having a difficult day.”Creating a stress-free zoneTaking time away from the threat – or perceived threat – that’s making you stressed has been shown to be one of the most effective ways to overcome it. This is why having a separate area that people can go to when they feel overwhelmed will help improve the wellbeing of people in your office. It doesn’t have to be anything fancy it might be a coffee area or simply a corner of the office with beanbags or cushions.Socialising“We’re only a small team, but spending time together outside of the workplace to relax, bond, laugh and reflect has improved productivity and team dynamics endlessly,” says Ben Barker, founder of cold-brew coffee company Artemis Brew.“It can be as simple, cheap and non-disruptive as you make it,” he says. His team has been to events such as escape rooms and independent film festivals, and it usually involves a beer or two afterwards.Playing musicMusic can be comforting, relaxing and it has been shown to increase productivity. Instead of having everyone listening to their own music through headphones, try playing music in your office to help people feel less stressed.“We have the radio playing in all areas of the building,” says Tracey Dawson, managing director at Daletech Electronics, a company with 14 employees.Or, if you’re in the mood for something a bit different, why not try a podcast?“We love having music on in the office, but more recently we’ve been putting podcasts on, too, which are a great alternative,” says James Gupta, founder and CEO at Synap, an online education platform.Communication is keyMaking sure everyone knows what is going on helps to manage stress, says Gupta. “At the beginning of every week, we have a team meeting to discuss what we’ll each be working on,” he says. “The development team get to see how their work is being received by customers, and the sales team have an understanding of when new features are likely to be available.”Provide healthy snacks“We try to encourage active, healthy lifestyles, so we supply free fruit and we have a company lunch together once a week,” says Dawson.Healthy eating has been shown to help stress levels decrease, and if someone is working to a deadline, having a quick, healthy snack might be exactly what they need to get through a busy morning. Offering caffeine-free alternatives to tea and coffee can also help keep tempers from boiling over and keep the jitters at bay.Celebrate success“Celebrating success is important,” says Gillian Rattray, entrepreneur acceleration manager at Royal Bank of Scotland.Recognising small wins such as hitting certain revenue targets or securing an important meeting helps even out the rollercoaster of running a business. “At the moment, we are looking carefully at celebration,” says Dawson. “As a first step, we have installed a ship’s bell that we ring each time an order leaves the building.”“In my own business, we had fizz days – we bought a bottle of sparkling wine when we made £1,000 or more in a day,” says Rattray. “The more revenue we earned, the more fizz we bought!”SEAT believes in helping people move forward by making it easier to get to the good stuff.

Loneliness is something we all feel at some time of our life, however, if a lot of children are feeling lonely a lot of the time, we can’t sit back and do nothing, it can be really damaging for them. When young people are feeling isolated it could be hurting their mental health or they can even be vulnerable to things like grooming.”Many – but not all – of the triggers for loneliness identified in the research, which was both qualitative and quantitative, related to the school environment.It said the higher prevalence of loneliness among 10- to 12-year-olds could be attributed to the move from primary school to secondary school.Other issues identified as contributing to loneliness included punishment practices involving isolation and exclusion, approaches to supporting children with disabilities – for example having to have someone with them at all times – and bullying.One boy, aged 12, said: “Cyberbullying is a big problem in my school at the moment … There’s been a boy who’s just had it all thrown at him. And he just is alone all the time.”The Children’s Society is urging the government to ensure all secondary school pupils have access to a counsellor, but says wider changes are necessary.“Youth services, parks, leisure centres, you need those to have a thriving school life, where children are not going to feel lonely, but increasingly things are being cut,” said Crellin. “It’s difficult to solve the problem for the most vulnerable children when children’s services are facing a £3bn cut by 2025.”Children who were interviewed suggested their own ideas for tackling the problem, which included making it more acceptable to discuss loneliness. While social media is often criticised as having a detrimental effect on children’s mental health, respondents said it helps maintain connections and create new ones. However, potential negative consequences were also highlighted, including making someone feel more left out and promoting a shallower form of communication.A government spokeswoman said: “From 2020 schools will be required to teach relationships education in the classroom.“Our measures – set out in our Loneliness Strategy – will help young people to learn about healthy friendships and reduce the stigma of loneliness.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e23b77b24113cd482046d96ce46ef53fe76e1bb9/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49792aefa5d31c7a48a70a0628554bbf","title":"choose your favourite stage show of 2018","story":"Which plays left you speechless?

The piece is an improvisation by Daniela Maccari, a dancer in Kemp’s company, and rising star Vidya Patel, a former finalist on the BBC Young Dancer competition. Directed by Nendie Pinto-Duschinsky, it is receiving its online premiere on the.The dance is set to, and named after, Oiseaux Tristes, a movement from the French composer Ravel’s Miroirs suite, played by the pianist Sviatoslav Richter. Ravel described the movement, first performed in 1906, as evoking “birds lost in the oppressiveness of a very dark forest during the hottest hours of summer”.Pinto-Duschinsky, a close friend of Kemp’s, had hoped to introduce him to Patel when he visited London in 2016. He admired Patel’s dancing but the meeting never took place. When Maccari, who lives in Italy, came to London for a memorial event shortly after Kemp’s death, she met Patel and they immediately hit it off. The pair spent two days in the studio, creating the performance, which was directed and edited by Pinto-Duschinsky, who is also completing work on a documentary about Kemp.“We made the piece for Lindsay,” said Pinto-Duschinsky, “but also to help us cope.” She had known Kemp for more than 20 years and Maccari had worked with him for 10 years. There are hopes to develop the performance and stage it next year.Kemp loved the music of Ravel. The composer’s intention was that Oiseaux Tristes should feel as free as an improvisation. Maccari explained that all of Kemp’s movement originated with a piece of music: “He said the music was the choreographer and that we should abandon ourselves to it.” Each gesture, Kemp taught them, should be like “a postcard sent from your heart to the audience”. Maccari said that Kemp would tell his performers that the company had a responsibility to lift the spirits of the audience and to make them feel free of their inhibitions. He told his dancers to “enjoy every movement and try to dance as if it was your first time”.In the months before his sudden death, Kemp taught Maccari how to perform his signature stage roles. She said it was a “great gift” and that “I knew that in his career he never asked anyone else to dance his roles. I try to carry it on with love and humility.”Maccari has been playing Kemp’s roles – such as his solos The Flower and The Angel – in performances with his company in Italy. Their staging of his piece Memories of La Traviata creates a kind of duet between Maccari and Kemp, who appears in video footage on a huge screen. “La Traviata starts with his entrance from the corner. He walks very slowly – a typical Lindsay Kemp walk – and it seemed that he was alive, that it was real. It was very moving.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb058b4c84b60a1947ab2b4e1f4b9e57f7a8fa59/0_232_5274_3164/master/5274.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=947395587c347ddc8592c14028d2ed40","title":"share your experiences of lost footpaths","story":"More than 10,000 miles of footpath are estimated to have been lost from maps. We’d like your help in documenting their recoveryEngland and Wales have about 140,000 miles of footpaths, but it is estimated more than 10,000 have been lost from current maps. Volunteers have been working tirelessly to rediscover them and put in legal applications for the recovery of lost paths before a government deadline in 2026 after which claims will no longer be accepted.If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.Below are some tips on how to rediscover a lost footpath:1. The first port of call is the Ramblers, whose website gives clear advice on how to identify a lost path and make an application. The method involves comparing new and old maps, plus examination of historical sources. Walking and exploration is involved, but don’t forget that a lost path has to be proven before you can use it, otherwise you are trespassing.2. It is also important to be sure you are not replicating work already underway. This government website can give you information on current applications.3. You may also know of paths that are used regularly, but are not on the definitive map (you can ask your local council to see that map). Any footpath walked by the public for 20 years without any attempt by the landowner to prevent access can be made a right of way.

Previous celebrity judges have included Lady Gaga and La Toya Jackson.Dubbed by its creator as “the most radical show on TV”, Drag Race has won a cult following for its positivity and bonhomie, favouring “camaraderie over cat fights”.“It doesn’t have a political agenda in terms of policies in Washington,” Charles told the  earlier this year. “But it has a position on identity, which is really the most political you can get. It has politics at its core, because it deals with: how do you see yourself on this planet? That’s highly political.”Charles was heavily criticised after he told the  he would “probably not” let a trans woman on Drag Race, adding: “You can identify as a woman and say you’re transitioning, but it changes once you start changing your body.”He later apologised for his comments.The show finished its 10th season in the US earlier this year. No premiere date has been confirmed for the UK iteration."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5f77d29a6d0b43e1ee511d1087b8b0aafdcf584/0_593_4628_2777/master/4628.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=013ef6740e2a0cf8129abe842d56b7e2","title":"dutch art panels ruling against jewish family criticised as step back","story":"Committee backed museum in battle over Kandinsky painting obtained before Nazis invadedThe decision of a Dutch art committee to back one of the Netherlands’ most prestigious museums in its attempt to hold on to a prized painting obtained from a Jewish family in 1940 has sparked an international outcry over the fate of Nazi loot across Europe.The binding ruling against the descendants of Emanuel Lewenstein has come under heavy criticism after it emerged that the committee had taken into account the need to maintain the “public art stock”.The reasoning has been described as a “step back” by Stuart Eizenstat, the US diplomat behind the Washington principles, a 1998 agreement under which 44 countries including the Netherlands committed themselves to the return of 600,000 pieces of art stolen by the Nazis.At a conference in Berlin last week to celebrate the second decade of the principles, Ronald Lauder, the president of the Jewish World Congress, expressed concern and suggested Dutch moral leadership on the issue had been dented. The Netherlands is one of only five governments to have established restitution bodies.The claim by Lewenstein’s heirs to a 1909 work by Kandinsky known as Painting with Houses was first made in December 2013 and it has taken five years of research and legal argument to settle.The descendants argued that the expressionist work was sold to Amsterdam’s Stedelijk Museum under duress at auction in 1940, five months after Germany invaded the country.The unnamed heirs said the watercolour was purchased for a “modest sum” and the sale was not made in good faith.The committee, which was established by the Dutch government in 2002, and comprising lawyers and art historians, confirmed the sale was made between 8 and 9 October 1940 at the Frederik Muller auction house in Amsterdam, and said the transaction should be seen in the context of the times and that the Lewenstein family would have had a clear understanding of their probable fate under the Nazi regime. However, the committee ruled that there was evidence to suggest the family had long been in financial difficulties. It said Lewenstein’s immediate family had a good relationship with the museum after the war and did not try to retrieve the painting.The municipality of Amsterdam argued in its rebuttal to the family’s claim that the piece was important to the museum as it was “on permanent display and … the essential link in the limited overview of Kandinsky’s work in the museum’s collection”.A spokesman for the Stedelijk said: “We can only stress that the museum would have accepted any outcome, as the ruling of the committee is binding for both parties, and that we realise that this painting will forever remain connected to a painful history.”The ability of the restitution committee to take into account the state of the stock of public art was introduced in 2013.Its chairman, Fred Hammerstein, denied that the move was unjust, telling the Dutch newspaper De Trouw: “This statement, which has been looked at for a long time and carefully, is not a step backwards but in line with earlier recommendations. That is why the criticism is no reason for us to move away from this weighing of interests. We are not out of step internationally.”The Dutch restitution committee is already at the centre of a lawsuit filed by an American heir to a former Jewish art gallery partnership. Bruce Berg, a grandson of the late Benjamin Katz and a great-nephew of the late Nathan Katz, brothers and partners in the Firma D Katz partnership, alleges that 143 paintings are in the wrongful possession of the Dutch government and a number of private and public museums in the Netherlands.The case being heard in the US district court of South Carolina involves works by Dutch old masters such as Ferdinand Bol, Pieter Claesz, Jan Steen and the Rembrandt school. It is claimed that the paintings were sold or traded under duress to representatives of the Nazi regime between mid-1940 and 1942.Joel Androphy, a lawyer acting for Berg and Katz, said it was taking the legal action as previous claims made to the restitution committee had been “largely denied”.He said: “The paintings were destined for Adolf Hitler’s future Führermuseum in Linz, Austria, or for the massive art collection of Reichsmarshall Hermann Göring. Göring himself even paid a terrifying visit to Firma D Katz, accompanied by armed guards, to inspect and select the paintings.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36d1eb6abd50823cba5baab7cc1f73fb52de99e5/0_18_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=812615b998b140fcf985e4834b4921f8","title":"rohingya end of monsoon prompts fresh wave of boats fleeing myanmar","story":"Recent flurry of departures is close to reaching 2015 levels, as members of Muslim minority seek to escape displacement campsA new exodus of boats carrying Rohingya fleeing from Myanmar has begun, with at least six boats carrying hundreds of refugees intercepted at sea or washing ashore over the past month.The recent flurry of voyages making the treacherous crossing of the Andaman sea to seek refuge in Thailand and Malaysia is close to reaching levels last seen in 2015, which prompted the Thai authorities to crack down on human smuggling networks.Voyages tend to stop completely during monsoon season, which begins in June and creates dangerous conditions, but the end of the rains in October often leads to a fresh wave of boats taking to the calmer seas. Since August 2017, over 200 lives are estimated to have been lost in the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea, mainly in the crossing from Myanmar to Bangladesh.On Tuesday morning, 20 men believed to be Rohingya arrived on the shores of the Indonesian island of Aceh in a small rickety boat, seeking refuge.The arrival comes after the Myanmar navy picked up 38 Rohingya, 19 men, 11 women, and eight children last week in the Andaman sea, who were heading for Malaysia. After their boat was apprehended, they were detained by the Myanmar police and sent back to Rahkine state, where tens of thousands of Rohingya are forced to live in displacement camps.It is not known yet whether the men who arrived in Aceh this week had fled Rahkine or Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh, where almost one million Rohingya refugees are living after fleeing a brutal campaign of violence by the military and Buddhist locals, which the UN has described as ethnic cleansing.“We can’t communicate with them because they don’t speak Indonesian, Acehnese, or English. So we don’t know much about them,” said Iswandi, the head of Idi Rayeuk district in Aceh where the Rohingyas’ boat washed ashore.The surge in those attempting to escape by boat is an indicator that the situation in Rahkine, where the UN says Rohingya are subject to “apartheid-like conditions”, remains desperate for the Muslim minority.Displacement camps in Rahkine are home to tens of thousands of Rohingya, who live in dire living conditions with limited access to food and no freedom of movement.On 18 November, 93 Rohingya left their villages near Rahkine’s Sittwe township and Darpaing displacement camp and boarded a small boat to Malaysia, but were found by the Myanmar navy a week later. Days earlier, two boats carrying Rohingya living in Darpaing displacement camp were discovered, both attempting to make it to Malaysia.Caroline Gluck, UNHCR spokesperson, said that while previously, most boats from Myanmar had been headed for Bangladesh, “there are now indications of boat movements resuming with different destinations”.“There are differences between the pattern of these movements compared with 2015,” said Gluck, emphasising that a regional approach was needed to deal with refugees taking to the sea. “The boats are smaller and hold fewer passengers. The disembarkation points have changed. And more robust efforts are being made by the authorities both in Bangladesh and Myanmar to prevent the boats from setting out to sea in the first place.”The renewed exodus from Rahkine throws the possibility of repatriating the 700,000 refugees living in Bangladesh further into turmoil. The tension between the Buddhist communities in Rakhine and the Rohingya has not eased and last week a group of Buddhist Rahkine held a protest against the possible return of the Rohingya and any move to give them citizenship.AFP contributed to this report"},{"url":null,"title":"charity prints from the irish times","story":" photographers have produced a gallery of images that will make a unique Christmas gift.

Video: BBCPanoramaFreddie Scappaticci sent a young boy “on a message”, as they say in Belfast, up to the home of 44-year-old Anthony McKiernan in January 1988, asking McKiernan to call by to see him.Not only were they neighbours, the Scappaticcis and McKiernans were also friends – the children of both families had sleepovers. That was the last McKiernan’s wife and children saw of him.Twenty four hours later, McKiernan was found shot dead on Mica Drive in Beechmount, not far from the Falls Road. He had been condemned as an IRA informer, something his family has always denied.McKiernan’s death was not the only occasion when Scappaticci shut down the normal inhibitions that prevent people visiting harm on others, let alone friends and neighbours, and scheming to do so in such a viscerally treacherous way.Scappaticci headed the IRA’s internal security unit – referred to fearfully as “the Nutting Squad” – during the 1980s, though his association with the IRA went back to the beginning.Vincent Robinson’s family had also been neighbours of Scappaticci. In June 1981 his body was found in a rubbish chute in the Divis flats, Belfast.His head had been struck at least five times on its left side with a rod-shaped instrument (like an iron bar) fracturing his skull while he was still alive. He had also been kicked in the stomach.Following Robinson’s death, Scappaticci had gone to the home of his sister, Meg, and her then husband, both fellow IRA members. Looking Scappaticci in the eye, she asked him if her brother had been tortured before death.She had heard that his body had been marked when it was found. Looking Meg Robinson in the eye, Scappaticci replied “No”. The truth about the beatings emerged only at the inquest. Robinson’s father went to Dublin to complain to the IRA, where he was told to shut his mouth.During a decade at the centre of the IRA’s internal security, Scappaticci has been directly linked to 18 killings.Today, his actions and those of the people in British military intelligence who “ran”him are being investigated by Operation Kenova, an inquiry headed by the chief constable of Bedfordshire, Jon Boutcher.The inquiry is not the first into the secret intelligence war. However, seasoned observers of the Troubles are sceptical it will run its full course if the evidence implicates too many senior members of the British intelligence services, but also the Republican movement. Boutcher counters this concern, saying “if any of this perceived resistance happens, I will challenge it”.By 2007, the conflict in Northern Ireland had claimed 3,720 lives. Due partly to Sinn Féin’s laser-like focus, attention on the 367 killed by British forces has eclipsed the 2,152 killed by the IRA and other republican groups.Very little attention, by comparison, has been paid to the 1,738 members of the security forces killed by the IRA, and none at all on those murdered by the IRA for spying – some 70 people.In Kenova’s sights are also those IRA leaders on the Provisional Army Council who sanctioned the “executions” for spying, as required by IRA General Orders.Appeals against the death sentence were required to be heard by the IRA’s adjutant-general with a signed copy of the verdict and sentence, and a summary of the evidence.Gerry Adams continues to deny he was in the IRA, but a multitude of ex-IRA members and police officers say otherwise, and they say that between 1978 and 1982 Adams was its adjutant general.So how and why did Scappaticci manage to survive at the heart of IRA’s action for so long? Why did he become a British informer? How did he survive after he was “outed”?Scappaticci was one of several thousand Republicans who were interned in Long Kesh (the Maze) from 1971. Following his release in 1973, he returned to Belfast. By the summer of 1974 had been promoted to the brigade staff of Belfast’s IRA.However, then he was rearrested. The Belfast ’s front page for August 16th, 1974, carried the headline “Troops capture top IRA officer” with “an Italian-sounding name”.Scappaticci swaggered back into his “cage” brandishing the newspaper as if he was 7ft tall (he is, in fact, 5ft-3ins). His fellow inmates saw it as his way of saying “you need to respect me”.His boastful conduct inside Long Kesh mirrored the “Big Bossman” persona he had cultivated with his brooding presence at the Jubilee Club in the Markets in Belfast where IRA members would drink on a Saturday night.Perhaps, in the gratuitous raw racism endemic to parts of Belfast even today, the fact that Scappaticci was called “The Wop” helps to explain his need to prove himself. He owed his Mediterranean looks to his Italian immigrant father who became a cook and owned a popular ice cream van with the family name emblazoned down its sideThose he shared his Long Kesh cage with have spoken of their dislike for a man who seemed preoccupied with status: “Scap’s world was viewed exclusively through the prism of his ego,” says one ex-detainee.Scappaticci had also been outspoken in his criticism of IRA leaders. “To Scap most of them were wankers,” another source explained. This, along with his overtly, often grotesquely pornographic language, did not endear him.Perversely, however, the confidence with which he critiqued IRA leaders may account for his appointment to his next IRA post, one from which most IRA volunteers ran a mile.In 1978 the IRA established a new security unit as part of a restructuring order designed by Gerry Adams and other IRA leaders after they were interned in 1972.The security unit’s job was to protect the IRA from penetration by the British as the IRA bedded down for the so-called “Long War” strategy. In one leap Scappaticci had access to the very heart of the IRA war machine.Following his release, Scappaticci had gone back to the building trade. However, he was arrested by the RUC over a VAT fraud. Spared prosecution, he agreed to hand over information.Later, he graduated from being a police spy to spying for British military intelligence’s Force Research Unit. He was given an agent number 6126 (referred to simply as ‘26’) and a codename: Stakeknife.Belfast today teems with rumours as to what led him to do this: revenge for being beaten up by members of the IRA over an affair with another member’s wife is a favourite.Equally, he was open to blackmail because of his notorious interest in pornography, including watching videos in his two-up, two-down terraced house in Farnham Street off Belfast’s Ormeau Road.Several IRA volunteers have told me, independently, that he had an unhealthy interest in pre-teen girls, peeping through cracks into the women’s changing room during IRA Belfast Brigade meetings in a leisure centre.A former special branch officer says he believes Scap was “a walk-in” – turning up one day to an army base to volunteer his services. Others say money explains his actions, though the money was not enough to get rich.In his book The Ulster Tales a former head of the army in Northern Ireland, General Sir John Wilsey, gave Scappaticci the fictional codename of “Kerbstone”, describing him as an agent who became “a priceless asset that would run and run”.General Wilsey invites us to believe that a resourceful intelligence sergeant befriended Scappaticci “sinking pints until the early hours” in “the clubs and bars frequented by republicans”.However, the notion that a British-accented soldier could have waltzed in and out of Republican clubs at will – and lived to tell the tale unless able to give a good account of themselves – is quite fantastical.So why did he inform? A British Army record says he was “opposed to gratuitous violence”. If that was true, then why did he put a brick in a sock and smash it over the head of a neighbour? The neighbour had had the temerity to complain about living “up Provie Hill”, because so many members of the Provisional IRA, including Scappaticci, lived in his street. His neighbour’s primary offence, however, had not been to mock the IRA, but to challenge Scappaticci’s authority.The conflict was the centre of life in the North and Scappaticci’s dual role put him at the centre’s centre. He was head of an IRA unit that entitled him to prod and probe everywhere, while doubling as the British “master spy”.His value to the British can be judged by the fact that he was serviced by a team of handlers separate from the rest of their colleagues in the Force Research Unit, or FRU.Scappaticci enjoyed an especially close relationship with his handlers. They worked hard to engender in him a sense of being bound tightly into one team, all “we” and “us”, united in fighting a cruel and ruthless enemy.For a while, Scappaticci also exercised a kind of psychological control, if not terror, over the general population of west Belfast which went beyond the strict limits of the IRA itself.He ran the IRA’s “Civil Administration” which policed parts of Belfast under IRA control. Ordinary “decent” crime (as it was known) was rife. Criminality gave Gerry Adams the opportunity to create “an alternative government”.Scappaticci ran the Civil Administration “with a heavy fist”, a former IRA man who had dealings with him told me. Joyriders and drug dealers were routinely kneecapped. Civil Administration put the fear of God into locals in order to enforce collaboration with the IRA.In Belfast, kneecapping became a weapon. A licence for an ordinary decent “hood” to continue living in the community was to ensure their future was spent limping up and down the street on crutches. Equally, they had to limit their statements to the police after the shooting to say only that “two masked men held me down and then shot me in the back of the legs, but I don’t know their names and I can’t remember their descriptions”.But, of course, the victim usually did know the perpetrator. The (usually) teenage culprit had actually turned up to Civil Administration HQ – better known as Sinn Féin’s HQ – at Connolly House by appointment with a parent.There, the parent would have pleaded with the gunman not to shoot his child “here” pointing away from the joint, but “there, please” to minimise lasting damage.Repeat offenders risked a “six pack” – six shots, one for each knee, elbow and ankle. One mother vividly described her meeting with Scappaticci after he had demanded that she bring her errant son to see him.Scappaticci told her: “The next time we hear he’s been at it or of any complaints against him, I will personally blow the head off him.” Adams, she says, sat beside him, saying nothing. Some years later her son was shot dead.The IRA’s hold still exists. In 2015, the widow of an IRA man executed for being a spy – which he was not – joined other relatives of Nutting Squad victims outside Belfast High Court to launch civil proceedings against Scappaticci.There, she was abused by a neighbour. “What the f*** were you doing?” She was looking for justice, something she had kept quiet about since she was spat at on her way to mass after her husband was killed three decades earlier.Scappaticci’s luck ran out in January 1990 after police agent Sandy Lynch was rescued from the clutches of IRA interrogators. The police thought Lynch was about to be shot after Scappaticci got him to confess.However, RUC CID officers, who did not know that Scappaticci was a spy, found a thumb-print belonging to him in the house where Lynch had been held. He fled to Dublin.There, Scappaticci and his British handlers concocted an alibi. When arrested in October 1992 on his return he told police he had been there doing TV repair work. The homeowner confirmed the story. He was released.By now, however, the IRA was suspicious and removed him from the security unit. With his access to IRA secrets gone, the FRU formally stood him down as an agent in 1995.How did he escape the same treatment at the hands of the IRA that he had helped mete out to others? His bullet-ridden body would have been an admission that the head of IRA security had been the biggest threat to the IRA’s security all along. It would have provoked too many questions.It would also have provoked internal isions, raising questions about the leadership. The IRA in south Armagh had long been suspicious about Scappaticci and had made their feelings known.However, a reluctance to kill him did not stop the IRA putting him in his place. Following his sidelining, he agreed to help the staunchly republican family of Anthony Braniff clear his name. Braniff had been shot as a spy in 1981.Scappaticci spoke up for Braniff at a private meeting of republicans in Belfast. To his embarrassment, the IRA’s most senior man in Belfast, Sean “Spike” Murray, suddenly appeared through a side door.Murray deliberately embarrassed Scappaticci with a volley of awkward questions. Later, one witness explained that it was the IRA’s way of reminding Scappaticci that he had been told to fold his tent.In 2003 Scappaticci was eventually outed as Stakeknife by a former military intelligence operative, Ian Hurst. He was spirited out of Belfast to England where MI5 offered him protective custody.Scappaticci, though, had lost none of his chutzpah. He rejected MI5’s offer and flew straight back to Belfast where he sought a meeting with the IRA. The IRA, he calculated, had every reason to support his denials.He gambled that Sinn Féin, by now engaged in the peace process, could not afford to admit publicly that he had been a spy. If so, it would undermine their official line that they had fought the British to an honourable draw.Any such admission would provoke the rank and file into questioning whether the IRA had been pushed into peace, paralysed by the penetration of agents like him.On his return to Belfast, Scappaticci met two of the IRA’s most senior representatives, Martin “Duckster”’ Lynch and Padraic Wilson. Ten years earlier, Wilson had said he suspected Scappaticci was an informer.Now, Wilson, Lynch and Scappaticci came to an understanding: Scappaticci would issue a firm denial which the IRA would not contest. To this day, this has been the IRA’s official position.Interviewed by detectives under the politan Police Commissioner Lord Stevens, Scappaticci stayed silent until the interview was formally over. Then, he asked if he could say something. Eagerly anticipating some new nugget, the two officers, both British, assented. Scappaticci said: “Look boys, I’m not the monster people think I am.” And that was it. That was all he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3720358.1543960561!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord leo misses switching the lights on after the kylie excitement","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Mr Varadkar’s partner Matt and friends with Kylie Minogue at the singer’s gig at the 3Arena Photograph: Tiernan BradyTwitterAfter the excitement of the previous night’s Kylie Minogue concert, the annual switching-on of the Christmas tree lights at Leinster House proved too much for the Taoiseach.He missed this particular gig for the second year in a row.Last time, he blew his first chance to be Treeseach at the annual ceremony because a Cabinet meeting overran. His people explained that he rushed across from Government Buildings but it was too late.On Tuesday, he was missing again.In Tara Street? The ? Sure that’s within a reindeer’s belch of Merrion Street.Perhaps Leo couldn’t resist the lure of Fintan’s latest oeuvre. Although that’s been launched more times than the Dunmore East lifeboat.Actually, no. It was The Sunday Papers: a History of Ireland’s Weekly Press edited by Joe Breen and Mark O’Brien. Because Leo Varadkar adores the newspapers. That’s why he mainly communicates these days via Twitter and lifestyle orientated social media platforms.It’s how we found out the Taoiseach was at the Kylie Minogue concert on Monday night, along with every other gay man in Ireland under the age of 50. Great time had by all, according to the Twitter machine and the photographs.Then our social media elves told us some lad went on Facebook and swore he saw Leo and his entourage tucking into a free meal at the concert before going off without leaving a tip.Like he would. As a rule, he always pays his way.Gawd, but there’s so much heavy stuff going on at home and in the world at the moment you’d really need a skewed set of priorities to get upset about that random sort of thing. Wouldn’t you?Anyway, the Treeseach missed the lighting up yet again and the Oireachtas staff choir, in spectacularly good voice this year, stoically coped with his absence. (It would never have happen in Enda’s day).Maybe Leo is allergic to trees. Or staff.It was a lovely ceremony. Short, as it always is, due to the cold. Done and dusted in around 15 minutes. But it was a little seasonal treat to get everyone in the mood. Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald made a valiant effort to get into the spirit by wearing a Santa hat and going on a selfie-spree. She was joined at the tree by Labour leader, Brendan Howlin along with the two women who head the Social Democrats – Catherine Murphy and Róisín Shortall.“Said the night wind to the little lamb: Do you see what I see?” sang the choir.No. No sign of Leo.The Fianna Fáil leader, Micheál Martin, raced in the nick of time to the tree, narrowly missing the switch-on but mercifully making the photo ops. “I didn’t know about it,” he protested. “I heard the carols above in my office and ran down. I’d hate to miss it.”Fine Gael couldn’t muster one senior representative to take part.Of course, the Ceann Comhairle is in charge at this yuletide event. Heaven forbid this might have a bearing on the Treeseach’s aversion to the tree ceremony.As always, Sean O’Fearghaíl conducted proceedings with brevity and eloquence.“As I think about this Christmas, I am conscious of the fact that very many people living in this country are back living the sort of frenetic lifestyle that they did during the Celtic Tiger. But I’m thinking alongside that, we have poverty and homelessness and disadvantage as we have never had before.”He said he was also conscious that people in “the Oireachtas community” know they are “at a point in the political calendar in the schedule of events where the ante is being upped” and they are under a lot of work pressure. But they also must look after themselves.“Because before we can help family and help the disadvantaged we have to be conscious of our own wellbeing. So can I just exort you all to take time for yourselves, time for your family and time for the needy.”Then the lights went on. And the choir launched into a medley of Kylie’s greatest hits.No, they didn’t. They sang a selection of traditional Christmas carols.Kylie, though, was on Leo’s mind. Or rather, the concert on Monday night in the 3Arena and the subsequent minor post on Facebook.After the book launch in the , where the canapés are supposed to have been wonderful and the wine plentiful, he found time to tweet this: “I’ve been made aware of a post on social media saying I had a free meal at a concert the other night. This is not true. There was no meal, we only had drinks and I paid. I have the receipt to prove it too.”Oh, thank God for that.Which reminds us. Barbra Streisand. Another great female artiste. Known for the Streisand Effect – where making an unnecessary fuss about something minor attracts a major outbreak of negative attention. Has the Fine Gael leader ever heard of it?Because with that tweet, he bought tickets for it.Merry Christmas, one and all!"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3721054.1544016986!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"reality of brexit border backstop deal greeted as incendiary at westminster","story":"UK prime minister Theresa May vows to honour the Good Friday Agreement as MPs debate the proposed Brexit agreement. Video: UK Parliament TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s Attorney General Geoffrey Cox reacting as the outcome of a vote on a motion to find Government Ministers in contempt of Parliament is passed. Photograph: Getty ImagesFrom the Irish viewpoint, the conclusions of the legal advice to the UK government on the Border aspect of the Brexit withdrawal deal are merely a statement of the obvious.But in Westminster they are nonetheless greeted as incendiary.The full text of the advice from the Attorney General (AG), released on Wednesday, warns the UK government that the backstop arrangement for the Irish Border – involving the UK entering a customs union with the EU – could last “ indefinitely”.The so-called UK wide customs union, together with some regulatory checks on goods moving from Britain to the North, are the measures set down in the agreement to apply if no other way is found to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.This is the backstop – the insurance policy in relation to the border. The AG’s advice has highlighted the fact that this agreement, once triggered, could remain in place for a long time and tie the UK up in lengthy and potentially unsuccessful negotiations as it tried to escape.Accepting this risk has to be weighed against the desire to reach a stable agreements on their future relationship, the legal advice said. Striking this balance was “a political decision for the Government,” Attorney General Geoffrey Cox wrote.Inerestingly reports in London and comments by prime minister Theresa May suggest that she may be considering offering the UK parliament some kind of “ lock” under which it would have to vote before the backstop came into place. But it is hard to see the EU side agreeing to this as anything which makes the backstop in any way contigent on a final UK go-ahead would threaten to completely undermine it. We will have to see how the plays out.The wider political point here is that both sides have said that it is not their intention that the backstop , if it was triggered, would be a permanent arrangement. Rather it would stay in place until another solution was found, presumably via a new trade deal between the EU and UK.However the AG’s advice points out that there is no guarantee of another arrangement being concluded that avoids the need for border checks and so the backstop could remain in place for the long term.The backstop, in other words, could be for good and not just some temporary “fix”. As the AG put it : “Therefore, despite statements in the Protocol that it is not intended to be permanent, and the clear intention of the parties that it should be replaced by alternative, permanent arrangements, in international law, the Protocol would endure indefinitely until a superseding agreement took its place in whole or in part, as set out therein.”This shows the success of Irish negotiators in getting a rock-solid commitment in the draft withdrawal agreement. However it is this very fact - and its implications for the UK’s future room for manoeuvre - which is now causing such debate in Westminster.The warning by the AG of endless rounds of talks and negotiations relate to the review mechanisms proposed in the draft withdrawal agreement. This would be overseen by a joint committee including UK and EU representatives, with disputes ruled on by an arbitration committee.The AG’s advice appears to point to the risk of the UK getting caught in endless discussions and disputes about whether the backstop is still needed under whatever new arrangements emerge.For the backstop to end, Cox warns, a superseding agreement is needed to take its place “ in whole or in part”. And he concludes that the Withdrawal Agreement “cannot provide a legal means of compelling the EU to conclude such an agreement”. In other words, the UK has no unilateral way out of the backstop, and never will.Of course if the withdrawal agreement is not signed, then the UK does not sign up to the backstop and the Irish Border issue would again be back under discussion.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: AFP PhotoPRUHOGetty Before she opened a five-day debate on her Brexit deal on Tuesday night, Theresa May had suffered two humiliating defeats in the House of Commons. Her government became the first in history to be found in contempt of parliament because of its failure to publish attorney general Geoffrey Cox’s full legal advice to cabinet on the deal.The DUP joined the opposition to vote against the government, ensuring a defeat by four votes that will see ministers publish the advice within days.The prime minister’s second defeat was less dramatic but more consequential for the future of Brexit if her deal is, as expected, defeated next week. This time it was pro-European, Conservative rebels who demonstrated their strength, with 26 crossing the floor to help defeat the government by 22 votes.Dominic Grieve’s amendment will allow MPs to table amendments to any motion on EU withdrawal that would follow a defeat of May’s deal next week. MPs could vote to rule out leaving the EU without a deal, to pursue a Norway-style membership of the European Economic Area (EEA) or to call a second referendum.Such a vote would not be binding but it would be almost impossible for the government to ignore a direction of that kind backed by a majority of MPs.Earlier on Tuesday, Manuel Campos Sánchez-Bordona, advocate general to the European Court of Justice (ECJ), told the court that he believed Britain could unilaterally revoke its decision to trigger article 50. If the ECJ upholds that opinion, it will offer an important boost to campaigners for a second referendum by robbing their opponents of the argument that there is too little time to arrange a second vote.Grieve’s amendment and the news from the ECJ may have carried a dim, silver lining for the prime minister as she seeks to persuade MPs to back her deal. They strengthen her argument that rejecting her deal could lead to a reversal of Brexit if a majority of MPs rules out leaving without a deal.That majority against a no-deal Brexit revealed itself on Tuesday in a way that could help moderate Brexiteers fall into line behind the prime minister. The threat of reversing Brexit may not be potent enough to secure a majority next week but it could help to keep the defeat within the bounds that would give May’s deal and her premiership a chance of staying alive.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

Meanwhile, 27 per cent were found to be obese, and 72 per cent admitted consuming fewer than five portions of fruit and vegetables daily.More than half those polled had at least two risk factors, the data for England from 2016 and 2017 found.The survey asked 8,000 adults and 2,000 children about their lifestyles.The findings show a steep rise in diabetes rates between 1994 and 2017 - from 3 per cent to 8 per cent among men, and from 2 to 5 per cent among women.  The increase has been largest for those aged 65 to 74, increasing from 5 per cent in 1994 to 15 per cent in 2017.The research also compared the lifestyles of children with their parents.Children of obese parents were around three times more likely to be obese than children of healthy weight parents. In total, 28 per cent of children of an obese mother and 24 per cent of children of an obese father had such weight problems.One in 20 women in England is now classed as morbidly obese, according to the analysis by NHS Digital. Overall, 64 per cent of adults were found to be carrying excess weight.This includes five per cent of women and two per cent of men who are morbidly obese - meaning they have a body mass index (BMI) score over 40.Overweight parents are more likely to have overweight childrenIn 1993, when the survey began, just one per cent of women were morbidly obese.Susannah Brown, senior scientist at World Cancer Research Fund, said: “Unhealthy choices increase the likelihood of developing cancer, so it is worrying to see that over half of adults have two or more of these risk factors, especially as we know that around 40 per cent of cancer cases are preventable.After not smoking, eating a healthy diet, being more active each day and maintaining a healthy weight are the most important ways you can reduce your cancer risk. The responsibility to live healthily does not lie solely with iniduals – a whole-of-government, whole-of-society approach is necessary to create environments for people and communities that are conducive to healthy living, she said.Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said the figures should “shame” successive governments, accusing them of failing to take action to encourage healthier lifestyles.John Maingay, Director of Policy and Public Affairs at the British Heart Foundation, said:  “These alarming figures suggest we could be storing up a future of health problems for future generations unless we act now. Obese children are more likely to be obese adults and this, coupled with spiralling diabetes rates, could lead to thousands more people suffering heart attacks and strokes in the coming years.”Almost 4 million people in the UK have been diagnosed with diabetes, with nine in ten cases Type 2, which is linked to obesity. Dan Howarth, from Diabetes UK, warned that another 12 million people are at risk of developing the condition.“To prevent these millions from developing Type 2 diabetes, we must educate people about their risk of developing the condition, and help them minimise their risk by making the necessary lifestyle changes, which include eating better and moving more, he said. Brexit latest news: Legal advice reveals Britain will be trapped in backstop even if talks with EU break downTom Cruise hits out at \u0026#39motion smoothing\u0026#39 on high definition TVsStephen Lawrence murder suspect was \u0026#39ringleader\u0026#39 of drug dealing ring and hired family as delivery drivers, court hearsComment: We\u0026#39ve been reminded yet again that the ECJ is not - and can never be - an impartial court Italian supreme court orders Getty Museum to hand over famed ancient Greek statueComment: There\u0026#39s nothing new in Geoffrey Cox\u0026#39s Brexit legal advice - so why did the Government pick this fight?How popular is Donald Trump?

With a name like Legacy, the business could be selling investment products, luxury watches or even legal services. Except the assets in question are of the flesh-and-blood variety. Legacy is a mail-order service for freezing sperm.Khaled Kteily, the young founder of Legacy, came up with the idea for his business five years ago. But it wasn’t until 2017\u0026nbspthat researchers published a statistic\u0026nbspthat made\u0026nbspmen sit up and listen. A\u0026nbspstudy found sperm counts in men from America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand had dropped by more than 50 per cent in less than 40 years. Other studies have suggested stress, smoking, obesity and exposure to pesticides and chemicals may all be at fault.\u0026nbspClimate change could lead to lower sperm count in men, study showsHe was everything I was searching for – in a sperm donorNo-deal Brexit could disrupt delivery of foreign sperm to BritainAllan Pacey, professor of Andrology\u0026nbspat the University of Sheffield, says men are becoming more preoccupied with their fertility for another reason: “In my opinion, more cases of male infertility are being seen because men and their partners are waiting until they are older before trying for a family. This flushes out cases of male infertility that would not have been seen if the couple had tried for a family at a younger age when they were more fertile.”Unlike women, men are not told that “the clock is ticking” nor are they bombarded with adverts for fertility clinics and apps from the minute they turn 30. Many men may not start thinking about their own fertility until they start trying to conceive. Yet, among infertile heterosexual couples, the man is the cause in roughly half of the cases. Pacey dislikes the idea of an “infertility industry”, but he accepts that greater awareness of male infertility has created a growing market for startups offering solutions.\u0026nbspKteily says he founded Legacy to reshape the way that men and women think about family planning. “Men are sensitive about talking about fertility, so we are focused on creating a brand for men to be proactive about fertility,” he says. Kteily grew up in Lebanon, studied in Canada and the US, and established Legacy in Geneva, in part because he wants it to be seen as “the Swiss private bank for sperm”.“For a lot of the world, Switzerland has an association with quality. Think of Swiss banks, Swiss watches and even chocolate,” he says. “We have a strong emphasis on quality, privacy and security.”Kteily had never thought much about his own fertility, until a friend told him that\u0026nbsphe had to freeze his sperm after being told he had\u0026nbspcancer at the age of 30. After this conversation, Kteily went into a clinic to freeze his own\u0026nbspsperm but found the whole process awkward. He believes other men will also be sufficiently put-off by the prospect of attending a clinic to deposit their sperm over doing it at home and sending it to a lab.Legacy offers three packages to clients, starting with the bronze package for $1000, which includes fertility analysis and storage deposit of sperm for one year. A third-tier platinum package “is designed for the man who wants to preserve his healthiest genetic legacy in light of ongoing advances in healthcare”. It costs $10,000 for up to six deposits, genetic testing, fertility analysis and indefinite storage at multiple sites.\u0026nbspCoolmen is a device that cools and maintains the temperature in the testicles to improve fertility in men (Courtesy Photo)The website also contains a note about a research programme that plans “to study the sperm of the world’s most successful men”, which\u0026nbspinvolves strict eligibility criteria and a charitable contribution. When asked for more details, Kteily says the idea to study the genetic makeup of some sperm is still in its early stages. But he agrees that Legacy was modelled in part on another genetic testing service, 23andme. This mail-order DNA testing service was valued at $1.1bn in October 2015, nine years after it was founded. Kteily makes one clear distinction between Legacy and 23andme, which has come under fire for profiting off the sale of customer data Legacy would never sell customer data, Kteily says. It assigns a unique ID to each client to anonymise the process,\u0026nbsp“just like a Swiss private bank”.The UK’s Human, Fertilisation and Embryology Authority lists hundreds of private clinics in the UK charging on average between £175 and £450 to freeze sperm per year. But Pacey says some men may prefer to do a test at home if it means they don’t have to go to a clinic.He adds that the many attempts to develop male fertility products, from underwear, to mobile phone cases, to sperm-testing kits have often failed, perhaps because of male shame. “I have never sensed that they have taken off,” he says. “I wonder if this is because men are too embarrassed to buy them, or whether or not they are simply not interested in this topic until fertility becomes an issue in their lives.”The hidden trauma of male infertilityOne new device is hoping it will fare better than the competition. Coolmen was founded in 2016 in Poland. It promises to improve male fertility by cooling the testicles using a device held in place by a waist belt. “According to the current studies, approximately 60 per cent of all male infertility is caused by too high temperature of testicles, which is the direct reason for inappropriate sperm quality,” Dorota Partyka, programme manager for Coolmen, says. “When we consider this condition, freezing sperm which is not good quality simply doesn’t make sense.”The two businesses will meet at Disrupt Berlin, a startup conference hosted by TechCrunch, where they will be the only two male fertility\u0026nbspstartups in attendance despite a\u0026nbspmarket that some analysts expect to reach $4.7bn by 2025.“The main issue with any kind of product or service like this aimed at male fertility will be whether or not it speaks to men,” Pacey says. But, with sperm counts falling by an average of 1.4 per cent per year, startups like these may find an increasing number of men willing to have the conversation.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Wait until we actually leaveMeanwhile, a volley of tweets from Donald Trump punctured the optimism in markets that had followed news of a truce between the US and China.Just days after talks between the world’s two economic superpowers the US president once again fired off warning shots over trade,\u0026nbsptweeting: “We are either going to have a REAL DEAL with China, or no deal at all - at which point we will be charging major Tariffs against Chinese product being shipped into the United States.\u0026nbsp“Ultimately, I believe, we will be making a deal - either now or into the future…”The president’s words helped to put downward pressure on the dollar as scepticism grew that Bejing and Washington would agree terms within the agreed 90-day window.Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM\u0026nbspsaid: “The tremors created from President Trump’s Twitter outbursts continue to illustrate how financial markets remain extremely sensitive to trade-related newsflow.“Although the Trump Administration has repeatedly blamed the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy tightening for the unfavourable investor mood in stocks, the key culprit behind the selloff witnessed yesterday was clearly the comment made by Trump on trade with China.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It sets off Saturday, 8 December, and is expected to drop onto the Moon early next year.It will head up towards the Moon, fly around it and then drop down, into a specially selected region of the Moon that will become its home.Once there, it will look to learn a whole host of things about that nearby but still largely mysterious world. It will measure the surface temperature, examine the chemicals that make up its soil, as well as looking up at the Sun.But the mission is possible because it relies not only on the lander that will touch down on the Moon. It is also made up of a set of other hardware – chief among them the\u0026nbspQueqiao satellite, which will serve as a bridge and relay information between the lander on the far side of the Moon and its engineers down on Earth.Just as with the world it will explore, much of the mission remains murky and unknown. The Chinese space agency has stayed largely quiet about details of what will happen, including where exactly on the Moon it will arrive.Its mission comes amid a new focus on the Moon – particularly as an important stepping stone on the way to other missions, deeper into the solar system. Nasa, for instance, has spoken about how keen it is to send humans back there, with the aim of eventually using it as a base for journeys to Mars.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Because of that, Netflix is said to have paid $100m to keep the sitcom having initially been paying $30m a year.According to The New York Times, this new fee “reflects the thirst for content in the streaming age”. The report also states that Netflix pre-empted user outcry and began negotiations to keep the sitcom – which ran from 1994-2004 – months ago.Does this mean that Netflix’s library of classic shows will be reduced as newer streaming services arrive? It certainly seems so. Look no further than the recent cancellations of its Marvel shows, including Daredevil and Luke Cage, which is said to be a casualty of Disney’s forthcoming streamer, Disney+. It will host original shows featuring characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe and its Star Wars franchise.Despite this, it’s not just old films and TV shows that get watched by Netflix users with chief content officer Ted Sarandos confirming that new film The Christmas Chronicles was watched 20 million times in its first week, marking what he believes to be a career first for lead star Kurt Russell.Friends arrived on Netflix UK in January 2018, three years after making its debut on Netflix US.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Apple has often held out on such upgrades initially, waiting until they are improved and perfected.iPhone X could come back after weak sales of new Apple phonesLike 3G and 4G before it, 5G is expected to offer a vast increase in speed and reliability. But it is also talked about in much more enthusiastic terms: it will be faster even than internet connections delivered over WiFi, and might improve connectivity in such a way as to fundamentally change the ways that phones work.Such upgrades have previously come with weak coverage and poor performance, putting customers off the new technology. 5G\u0027s proponents argue that the speed increase that arrives with the new technology will be worth such teething problems.Those backing 5G claim that it will fundamentally change how networks and communications are organised. Networks will be so much faster than WiFi that they could make the wireless technology useless, for instance, and data transfer will be so fast that it will allow people to have internet\u0026nbspconnections to places across the world.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Wait until we actually leaveMeanwhile, a volley of tweets from Donald Trump punctured the optimism in markets that had followed news of a truce between the US and China.Just days after talks between the world’s two economic superpowers the US president once again fired off warning shots over trade,\u0026nbsptweeting: “We are either going to have a REAL DEAL with China, or no deal at all - at which point we will be charging major Tariffs against Chinese product being shipped into the United States.\u0026nbsp“Ultimately, I believe, we will be making a deal - either now or into the future…”The president’s words helped to put downward pressure on the dollar as scepticism grew that Bejing and Washington would agree terms within the agreed 90-day window.Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM\u0026nbspsaid: “The tremors created from President Trump’s Twitter outbursts continue to illustrate how financial markets remain extremely sensitive to trade-related newsflow.“Although the Trump Administration has repeatedly blamed the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy tightening for the unfavourable investor mood in stocks, the key culprit behind the selloff witnessed yesterday was clearly the comment made by Trump on trade with China.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But we know nothing about them directly, including what they might be physically made up of.An Oxford University scientist has suggested a new theory that would bring them together, solving a question that has haunted astronomers and astrophysicists for decades.Dr Farnes\u0026nbspsuggests that both dark energy and dark matter are a fluid that possess negative mass. That means in effect that it would be the inversion of normal mass: if you pushed it, it would be propelled towards you.We know even less about dark matter than we thought, scientists findThe implications of such a breakthrough suggestion are huge, offering a solution to what that vast amount of missing stuff might be.We now think that both dark matter and dark energy can be unified into a fluid which possesses a type of \u0027negative gravity\u0027, repelling all other material around them, said Dr Farnes.\u0026nbspAlthough this matter is peculiar to us, it suggests that our cosmos is symmetrical in both positive and negative qualities.Negative matter has been proposed before, since it would mean that the material would become less dense as the universe expands. That would contradict real observations, which shows that dark energy does not thin out over time.However, Dr Farnes\u0026nbsptheory suggests that new dark energy is being created all the time. Since more and more negative energy is constantly bursting into existence, such a fluid would not dilute even as the universe expanded.That proposed fluid appears to work exactly as dark energy does.The outcome seems rather beautiful: dark energy and dark matter can be unified into a single substance, with both effects being simply explainable as positive mass matter surfing on a sea of negative masses, he said.Researchers now hope the theory can be tested using the huge\u0026nbspSquare Kilometre Array, which is being built now and when finished will be the biggest telescope in the world. But if true it could fix\u0026nbspLambdaCDM, our current picture of the universe, explaining what exactly the dark matter and energy that has been so problematic for our physics is made up of.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Soviet cosmonauts Vladimir Titov and Gennady Strekalov jettisoned and landed safely near the launch pad.We are psychologically and technically prepared for blast-off and any situation which, God forbid, may occur on board, said crew commander Kononenko in a news conference.Additional reporting by Press AssociationShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

I have listened to those concerns.MPs can stop Britain leaving EU“I want us to consider how we could go further and I will be continuing to meet colleagues to find an acceptable solution.”The officials were clear that any solution would not involve reopening negotiations on the withdrawal agreement with the EU, meaning the solution could only involve domestic action.A decision to try and give parliament a full veto over entering the backstop however, could anger negotiators in Brussels who want the backstop to be a failsafe option for future UK-EU relations.However, the withdrawal agreement does already account for parliamentary involvement in the backstop process, including over what happens at the end of the transition period in December 2020.In the spring of that year, if a trade deal has not been agreed, MPs will have to decide whether to extend the transition for up to a further two years or enter into the backstop.MPs more control of Brexit if Theresa May’s deal falls in CommonsThe Independent understands that this existing mechanism could be developed domestically to give MPs greater control.On Monday the commons passed a motion that means that if Ms May’s deal is defeated, MPs will have greater sway over what happens next.The consensus is that it makes the no-deal Brexit, that some eurosceptics want a far less likely prospect – and consequently makes Ms May’s deal the hardest kind of Brexit on offer.Downing Street could use the opportunity, along with a new offer on the backstop, \u0026nbspto make a renewed push for Brexiteer support. How many it will turn to her cause remains unclear.It came as legal advice provided to the cabinet on Ms May’s Brexit deal was finally published, with the document warning it could result in the UK becoming stuck for many years in “protracted and repeating rounds of negotiations” with no lawful power to exit.It also made it clear that Brussels could apply to an arbitration panel for Northern Ireland to remain in the EU customs area while the rest of the UK left.The six-page document by attorney general Geoffrey Cox was released to MPs a day after the House of Commons found the government in contempt of parliament for trying to keep it secret.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

If talks over a future agreement break down, Cox said, the EU could submit a request that the GB elements of the customs union should fall away, leaving only NI in the EU customs territory. However, this would almost certainly be vetoed by the UK and would have to go to arbitration.It\u0027s not hard to see why ministers tried so hard to stop the legal advice being published. It confirms many MPs worst fears about Ms May\u0027s deal and makes it even more likely the draft agreement will be voted down by the Commons next Tuesday.Labour MP Chris Bryant asks Javid how any serious member of parliament could vote for a deal that is nothing more than a wishlist?Sajid Javid says Labour\u0027s six tests over whether they would back a Brexit deal are the wishlist - not the PM\u0027s deal.Chancellor Philip Hammond has told MPs he will deliver his spring statement on a date between February 26 and the end of March.The spring statement is the Chancellor\u0027s second most important annual parliamentary event, after the Budget. Its significance has been downgraded by Mr Hammond since he moved the Budget date to the autumn.Mr Hammond told the Commons Treasury Select Committee he had given the Office for Budget Responsibility the required 10 weeks\u0027 notice to prepare, adding: The spring statement will be some time between the end of the February recess and the end of March.As the statement is normally delivered on a Wednesday, it is likely to come on February 27 or March 6, 13, 20 or 27, in the run-up to the March 29 date of Brexit.\u0026nbspJavid says no one pretends this deal is perfect in every way - the PM herself admits that. But this is the best way to protect the Good Friday Agreement.\u0026nbspTory ex-chancellor Ken Clarke also offers him a boost, saying this is clearly the best way forward and it is pointless to protest until a better idea comes along.MPs have now moved onto the second day of debate on the Brexit deal, ahead of Tuesday\u0027s crunch vote.\u0026nbspOpening for the government, Sajid Javid, the home secretary, jokes that this is best way he can imagine to celebrate his 49th birthday.\u0026nbspHe says Ms May\u0027s deal is the best way to ensure a smooth exit from the EU and take back control of money, laws and borders. Today\u0027s debate will focus on security, hence Mr Javid kicking off proceedings.Geoffrey Cox\u0026nbsp- the attorney general - has said the decision to make his legal advice available to MPs by placing it in parliamentary libraries does not set a precedent for any future release of law officers\u0027 advice.In a written statement he said: It remains a fundamental constitutional convention that neither the fact, nor the content, of law officers\u0027 advice is disclosed outside Government without the law officers\u0027 consent.That convention provides the fullest guarantee that the business of governments is conducted at all times in the light of thorough and candid legal advice, which may also enter into matters of acute sensitivity to the public interest.It is necessary that the public has confidence in the ability of Government and Parliament to work together at a time of national decision-making of the most profound significance.The standing of the House of\u0026nbspCommons\u0026nbspis also of prime importance. For these reasons, having tested the will of the House twice, the Government will respect its decision and, in these exceptional circumstances and to resolve for the present those constitutional tensions, it has decided, with my consent, to publish this advice.Ian Blackford - the SNP leader - accuses the PM of  perhaps inadvertently misleading the House over the issue of the Irish backstop in the Brexit deal.\u0026nbspHe\u0026nbspaccused May of concealing the facts on her Brexit deal.The party\u0027s Westminster leader mocked the PM for having lost three votes yesterday and being found in contempt of Parliament, saying: We were promised strong and stable - what we\u0027ve got is a Government in crisis.The MP asked: Is it time that the Prime Minister took responsibility for concealing the facts on her Brexit deal from members in this House and the public?Will she take responsibility?Mrs May rejected the claim, and said the full legal advice they were forced to publish today was the same as the shortened statement the Government made earlier this week.Speaker John Bercow also reprimanded Blackford for the acusation.\u0026nbspThe DUP are not happy with the publication of the government\u0027s legal advice published just minutes before prime minister\u0027s questions. This is from the DUP\u0027s Westminster leader Nigel Dodds.He asks for the PM to immediately end the five-week for universal credit, but the PM says no one needs to wait for money if they need it.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCorbyn says foodbanks are not just a photo opportunity for Conservative MPs - after several of them posted photographs of themselves at their food banks this weekend.The new Work and Pensions Secretary seems to have taken a lesson from her and created a hostile environment for those that are claiming benefits, he said.One of the Government\u0027s policies that is causing the greatest anxiety and poverty is Universal Credit, the UN rapporteur professor Alston said it was fast falling into universal discredit.When will the Prime Minister demonstrate some of her professed concern about burning injustices and halt the roll-out of Universal Credit?May says the Labour leader wants to go back to square one with the welfare system - back to the system of legacy benefits.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCorbyn says universal credit is turning into universal discredit and demands for the rollout to be halted. But May says the government has made changes as we have gone through those changes.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWe\u0027ve listened and made changes - a system that delivers for people, she says.Prime Minister\u0027s Questions has now started - just minutes after the government\u0027s legal advice was published. Jeremy Corbyn kicks off the session with the word Brexit, but says we must not ignore rising poverty in Britain, citing a recent UN report on the issue.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe PM says we do not agree with this report.\u0026nbspPlease allow a moment for the liveblog\u0026nbspto loadThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Whether the UK had this power or not has been disputed, and campaigners had asked judges to rule.This isn’t a final legal ruling by the court, but judges usually endorse what the advocate general suggests. We should find out if this recommendation is confirmed within the coming weeks, with 17 December one date that is being talked about in Brussels.\u0026nbspIf it is confirmed, an accidental no-deal Brexit is effectively taken off the table – the government would be able to stop it in all circumstances if it wanted to.\u0026nbspThis is significant because the government’s main argument to remainer MPs to get them to support Theresa May’s deal has been that if they don’t, a disastrous no-deal Brexit could happen without anyone wanting it to. In one respect, the decision makes it harder for May’s deal to pass, because she won\u0027t be able to scare them into backing it.Meanwhile, in WestminsterAs the news from the Luxembourg court broke in the morning , MPs were settling in for a big day in Westminster. By the time they went home for the night, the Government had been defeated in three votes – a record bad day for Theresa May’s minority administration.One of these votes was about whether the Government was in contempt of parliament for refusing to release its legal advice about its Brexit deal. MPs decided that ministers were indeed in contempt – effectively forcing the government to release the legal advice. This is significant because the advice is expected to provide more ammunition for opponents of the deal, especially Brexiteers.But another vote lost by the government will likely have even bigger implications. MPs – including 26 Tory rebels – voted to give parliament more power if Theresa May’s deal is voted down.If the deal is voted down next Tuesday the Government has 21 days to come back to Parliament and lay its plan for what happens next. But under the successful amendment tabled by Tory Remainer Dominic Grieve, the Commons will also be able to vote on what it wants the Government to do. Though that vote wouldn’t technically be binding, it would be politically incredible for the Government to ignore it.\u0026nbspTaken together with the likely ECJ ruling that the UK has the power to stop Brexit if it wants, MPs would be expected to take no-deal off the table. They might also call for a so-called ‘plan B’ – a call for Theresa May to go back to Brussels and negotiate a different deal. Whether that would be successful is another matter.So what are the implications for Brexit?The overall effect of the events of Tuesday 4 December are to make a no-deal Brexit significantly less likely. Nobody thinks there is a majority of MPs in favour of a no-deal, and they will now control the Government’s response to its deal being defeated.\u0026nbspIf the ECJ decides that the UK does have the unilateral power to revoke Brexit, then no-deal is effectively off the table. But even if it doesn’t it’s unlikely member states would stand in the way and push Britain off the cliff.In one sense, the deal is also less likely to pass because of what happened: Remainers were being encouraged to vote for it on the basis that a no-deal might happen.\u0026nbspBut in a strange way, the deal might win more support – if Brexiteers decide that the defeat of the deal might mean Brexit not happening at all, they could swing behind it. A large number have already publicly said they will vote against it, however – so whether that will be enough remains to be seen.Is that everything that happened?No, that’s just the main thread.

Even if the government decides to pursue no-deal, MPs\u0026nbspwould now have the power to oppose it. While such a vote would not be legally binding,\u0026nbspit would be almost impossible for ministers to ignore.Mr Grieve\u0027s amendment was\u0026nbspbacked by MPs from across the Commons, including 26 Conservative rebels.In addition to pro-EU\u0026nbspTories who have previously voted against the government, it\u0026nbspalso received support\u0026nbspfrom\u0026nbspMPs who have traditionally\u0026nbspbeen loyal\u0026nbspto Ms May.\u0027Arguable case\u0027 government guilty of contempt of Parliament - BercowSupporters included former cabinet ministers Sir Oliver Letwin, Sir Michael Fallon\u0026nbspand Nicky Morgan, as well as Ms May\u0027s former deputy, Damian Green.\u0026nbspIt was also backed by\u0026nbspNick Boles, who is garnering support among MPs for a Norway for now option that would see the UK remain in the European Economic Area (EEA) and customs union until a further arrangement was agreed with the EU.Many of the Tory MPs\u0026nbspwho backed the amendment did\u0026nbspso despite\u0026nbsphaving already said they will vote for Ms May\u0027s deal.\u0026nbspMr Grieve pushed the motion to a vote shortly\u0026nbspbefore Ms May opened five\u0026nbspdays of\u0026nbspdebate on her\u0026nbspproposed withdrawal agreement.\u0026nbspThe amendment will fundamentally\u0026nbspalter\u0026nbspthe sequence of events that will\u0026nbspfollow if the prime minister\u0027s deal is rejected by MPs.Under the terms of the EU Withdrawal Act, the government must publish a statement within 21 days of the deal being voted down outlining how it plans to proceed, and MPs must be given\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspvote on this within a week.The vote, though, would only be on a neutral motion simply saying\u0026nbspthe Commons had considered the matter.

It says parliamentary rules stating that neutral motions cannot be amended should not be applied to\u0026nbspgovernment motions on\u0026nbspBrexit.\u0026nbspThat means MPs will be able to order ministers to change tack, for example by extending Article 50, reopening negotiations with the EU or calling another referendum.A similar motion has been tabled by the chairs of\u0026nbspseveral parliamentary select committees, including Brexit committee chair Hilary Benn. However, their amendment explicitly rejects Ms May\u0027s deal, meaning it is unlikely to be supported by Tory MPs who are backing the prime minister\u0027s plan but want Parliament to be given greater control\u0026nbspif the Commons rejects it.Speaking in favour of his motion, Mr Grieve told the Commons: The reality remains that we have an unsatisfactory procedure\u0026nbspto resolve differences of opinion in this House if we come to a point where the government does not succeed on its motion. The opportunity exists this afternoon to cure that anomaly.\u0026nbspIt is contrary to all sensible practice, and I have to say slightly disrespectful of the role of this House, that we should end up with a situation in which\u0026nbspwe have unamendable motions\u0026nbspfor consideration\u0026nbspat a time when Parliament ought to be fully focused on trying to find means of resolving outstanding issues.He said his motion would ensure that whatever the outcome next week, we have a means of continuing the debate thereafter if we need to.Speaking for the government, Andrea\u0026nbspLeadsom, leader of the Commons, told\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspit was not the time to pre-empt whether or not further motions are likely as a result of Ms\u0026nbspMay\u0027s proposed\u0026nbspdeal being rejected.\u0026nbspThe amendment secured\u0026nbspthe guarantees Mr Grieve\u0026nbspgeneral initially tried to extract from ministers during debates on the EU Withdrawal Act in June.UK \u0027can cancel Brexit by unilaterally revoking Article 50\u0027Final Say: Two-thirds of students demand referendum on Brexit dealPetition with 1m names goes to No10 demanding Final Say Brexit voteWhat would UK voters be asked in a referendum on the Brexit deal?Having\u0026nbsptried to ensure MPs would be able to amend the government\u0027s motion in the event the Brexit deal is rejected, the former attorney general eventually backed down after claiming he had received assurances that ministers would respect the sovereignty of Parliament.\u0026nbspIt comes as a senior adviser to the European Court of Justice said that the British Parliament could unilaterally revoke Article 50, thereby halting the Brexit process.Launching a People\u0027s Vote report outlining how Parliament could block a no-deal Brexit, Mr Grieve said: “All the evidence I’ve picked up is that the EU would give us a reasonable period of time to hold a referendum if we wish to do so.“If Parliament expresses a view that it wishes to have a People’s Vote then unless the government has taken complete leave of its senses, it is possible for us to put in place the necessary procedure to hold such a referendum. And, more over, to make the necessary changes to the EU Withdrawal Act very simply to make sure that we don’t crash out on 29 March.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

What happens if Theresa May\u0027s deal is voted down?  What are the alternatives to May\u0027s deal?Click to followIndy PoliticsWe are entering one of the most uncertain periods in the modern history of Britain, with even the most experienced\u0026nbsppoliticians and commentators unsure of what the immediate future holds.This article will help you get to grips\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspwith some of the various outcomes from Brexit that the UK faces, and how we might get to them.It\u0026nbspwill be updated regularly as the picture shifts day by day...1 What are the key dates? December 11: This is the day of the \u0027meaningful vote\u0027, when MPs\u0026nbspwill\u0026nbspdecide in the House of Commons whether to accept or reject Theresa May\u0027s deal.December 13: A summit of the European Council will start in the wake of the meaningful vote in the UK. If British MPs have rejected the deal May agreed with other member states, this could be an opportunity for her to request changes, to allow it to become more palatable to MPs.December\u0026nbsp20: This is when the House of Commons breaks up for Christmas. If May\u0027s deal has been rejected the week before, and she wants\u0026nbspto put it to MPs\u0026nbspa second time before the holidays, it must happen before this date.January 7: The House of Commons returns, but to what? If the deal on the table has been blocked once, there may still be a chance for a second vote at this point, the prime minister may or may not have resigned and MPs\u0026nbspmight or might not have attempted to pass an amendment for a second referendum.January 7 to March 29: If those points above haven\u0027t been addressed before the Christmas break, they likely will be in this period. You may also see a push for the UK to opt for a Norway-style relationship.March 29: Brexit Day. Under terms of Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, if a country triggers the withdrawal process from the EU, they have two years to try and conclude negotiations on how it happens before their membership automatically ends –\u0026nbspand it ends regardless of whether those negotiations have been successful or not.2 What happens if Theresa May\u0027s deal is voted down?The big question to which no one knows the answer. There are lots of possibilities if\u0026nbspMay\u0027s plan falls as expected. Here are those likely to be pursued or rejected early on...\u0026nbspRenegotiation:\u0026nbspThere will be an opportunity to renegotiate within days at a summit of the European Council, but pretty much everyone at the meeting has been adamant there will be no further changes to the package agreed, even if MPs vote it down.That does not mean it is absolutely impossible –\u0026nbspboth sides currently have an interest in saying the deal cannot be renegotiated,\u0026nbspto encourage MPs to back it.\u0026nbspBut the incentive to find a different deal will become greater if the current one is rejected.The prime minister pushes the deal to a Commons vote...again: It may be that the PM does win some small further\u0026nbsptweak to the language in the withdrawal deal that means she can go back to the Commons and ask for it to be voted on a second time.\u0026nbsp Alternatively, the plunging pound and disruption to financial markets if the deal is voted down a first time, could also give May a reason to ask MPs\u0026nbspto vote again and pass her deal in the national interest.This course is only likely to be open, if the first defeat is close. If her administration loses with 100 Tories voting against her,\u0026nbspgoing back for a second attempt will look pretty futile.General election:\u0026nbspTheresa May could try and take a stand, calling an election, saying her deal is the foundation of the Tory manifesto in a bid to win a popular mandate for it. If she could, it would make it difficult for her MPs\u0026nbspto rebel against it. But there\u0027s a fundamental flaw in the plan. Under the Fixed Term Parliament Act a prime minister no longer has the power to call an election at will. Either they have to win a vote in the Commons by a two-thirds majority, or they lose a vote of no confidence by a simple majority. For both of these things lots of Tory MPs\u0026nbspneed to vote for an election, and with their seats at risk and a left-wing Corbyn government waiting in the wings, they are not likely to do so.\u0026nbsp3 What are the alternatives to May\u0027s deal?If it finally sinks in that the PM\u0027s strategy is dead, other possibilities start to arise...A second referendum:\u0026nbspThere will at some stage be a big push for a new referendum.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbsphas campaigned for the public to have a\u0026nbspFinal Say, with more than one million people signing its petition. The\u0026nbspPeople\u0027s Vote\u0026nbspcampaign has galvanised the support of politicians, celebrities and millions of people across the country.The new referendum would, however, have to be secured through a vote in the House of Commons and it appears that there is no majority for it at this time. Lots of Conservatives are opposed. Labour appears to be moving towards possibly backing one, but the party is split and leader Jeremy Corbyn is said to be against the idea. Even if Labour does back it, there are likely to be up to 20 of the party\u0027s\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspwho still vote against it, because their constituents so heavily backed leaving the EU that it would risk them being ousted at the next election.Time could change this situation. As other possible outcomes are whittled away and the prospect of an economically damaging no-deal Brexit looms, more\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspmay feel compelled to back a new referendum. The question of timing will be critical. Some backers feel the issue should be pushed to a Commons vote, as an amendment to the \u0027meaningful vote\u0027, fearing that waiting will mean other outcomes take hold and become more likely. Others say if the vote is brought to the Commons too soon, without enough support, and it falls – then supporters will lose their only chance of making it happen.\u0026nbspThere is also not a consensus on what the question should be in a new vote – in or out, May\u0027s deal or no deal, no deal or Remain. Some suggest a three-way vote on May\u0027s deal, no-deal and Remain, with the option receiving the fewest votes being knocked out and votes redistributed, as in the \u0027alternative vote\u0027 electoral system.\u0026nbspEven if a proposal for a new referendum is passed, there is every chance Leave could win again of course.Plan-B (Norway):\u0026nbspThere are those – including some in cabinet – who believe that once the deal is ditched the best plan would be for the UK to enter a Norway-style arrangement with the EU – either as a temporary state until a wider trade agreement can be arranged or as a permanent solution. It would mean leaving the EU, but staying in the single market. A \u0027Norway-plus\u0027 route could also see the UK remaining in the customs union.But this is likely to enrage half of the Tory party in parliament, and probably all of the more\u0026nbspBrexitish\u0026nbspmembership, as a less than full break from Brussels. It also does not end \u0027free movement\u0027, risking a backlash from Leave voters for whom immigration was the key issue in 2016.An extension to the Article 50 period:\u0026nbspThe EU has indicated that the March 29 Brexit day could be postponed, but only if there is a set course of action to postpone it for. In other words they could delay it for a new referendum or an election perhaps. It is not clear if they would do it for a late renegotiation.No Deal:\u0026nbspThis is the default. If May\u0027s deal is voted down and the government and\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspdo, or are able to do, nothing else, then on March 29 Britain will fall out of the EU with no deal in place. Many\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspare looking for ways to stop that from happening, but this is in the territory of the legislative wing of government trying to act as the executive, and so there are complications.In the Commons on December 4,\u0026nbspMPs backed a move that will allow them to amend a motion bought forward by the government, setting out its plans if May\u0027s deal is rejected.This gives MPs\u0026nbspthe chance to express a clear view of what should take place next and means that view could include any of the above options including opposing no deal, backing a new referendum or going into a Norway-style status.This motion would not be legally binding on the government, but it would be impossible to ignore. Certainly doing so would create a major political crisis.Then again, we are already going through\u0026nbspconstitutionalpoliticalsocial\u0026nbspcrises of sorts, so predicting exactly what will happen is extremely difficult.\u0026nbspThis is something that could occur at any time. She may feel that if her deal is rejected by\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbsponce, or even twice, then the collapse of her strategy means she should quit and let someone else have a go. Tory rebels may also try and force her out.Under party rules they need to secure 48 letters from Conservative\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspdemanding she stand down, to trigger an internal vote of no confidence in her leadership. But so far rebel attempts to achieve the letters have verged on the incompetent. Even if they can get them May\u0027s team think they can win the overall vote.There is the question of successors too. Boris is unpopular in the parliamentary party, other Brexiteers do not seem credible. A\u0026nbspRemainer\u0026nbspis unlikely to win. It is not clear Jeremy Hunt or\u0026nbspSajid\u0026nbspJavid, the other two frontrunners, have a plan that would somehow eliminate the problems May faces.The reason May lasts through the toughest period yet, could be the same reason she has lasted up to now. No-one in their right mind would want to come in and be the prime minister to sort out the mess that is Brexit. Better to let May take the hit, and then come in to look to a brighter future afterwards.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The court’s advocate general this morning issued an opinion to that effect, and the court usually follows such\u0026nbspadvice.\u0026nbspIf confirmed, this would make a new referendum easier because a vote to remain in the EU could be implemented straight away – and our membership of the EU would continue under the existing terms, the UK rebate on contributions included.\u0026nbspUK ‘can cancel Brexit by unilaterally revoking Article 50’However, the UK government would still have to apply for an extension of the Article 50 deadline so that it could hold a referendum in the first place – and that would still need the unanimous agreement of the EU27 countries.\u0026nbspSome enthusiasts for a second referendum might think that the ECJ’s likely decision would allow the UK to cancel Brexit and then hold the referendum. But that would mean, if the vote were for Leave again, that we would have to start the Article 50 process all over again. Which might fall foul of the advocate general’s opinion, which says that revocation of Article 50 notice is allowed provided it “does not involve an abusive practice”. Revoking and invoking our notice might be seen by the ECJ as precisely that: an illegitimate negotiating tactic.\u0026nbspIf the UK asks for more time to hold a referendum, the\u0026nbspEU27\u0026nbspare highly likely to agree to an extension to the timetable.So the significance of this opinion is indirect. It makes a possible referendum simpler because it would present a choice between two definite options: Theresa May’s Brexit deal versus remaining in the EU on existing terms.\u0026nbspThat would take away one of the arguments against a second referendum, namely that, if “Remain” were on the ballot paper, it would not be possible to guarantee what it meant because – without this legal opinion – we would need to ask permission of the EU27 to stay in the EU. That would probably be granted, but it might be complicated to secure an agreement to that effect before a referendum.\u0026nbspIn the next few days, as MPs debate the prime minister’s Brexit deal, the advocates of giving the people the final say can therefore propose a new referendum that seems credible and well defined.\u0026nbspThey know that, if the UK asks for more time to hold a referendum, the EU27 are highly likely to agree to an extension to the timetable. They want us to stay and want to make it easy for us to do so.\u0026nbspHowever, that EU law is interpreted in a way that suits the cause of integration – “ever closer union” in the words of the founding treaty – does reinforce the argument of Leavers that the EU will always seek to become a single superstate.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The key issue that we’re\u0026nbspsaying\u0026nbsptoday, and that’s why we’re delivering a petition signed by a million people in this country, is that those choices are ones that should be made by the British people.“Parliament is gridlocked ... This is no way to decide the most fundamental question facing Britain for the next 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years.“It is time that we now put the clear choices to the British people and allow them to decide.”Thornberry contradicts Jeremy Corbyn and insists Labour could still back Final Say Brexit referendumThe two documents were handed in to officials at 11am by Ms Greening, politicians from three other parties and The Independent‘s editor Christian Broughton.\u0026nbspLabour’s\u0026nbspChuka Umunna, a champion of the People’s Vote campaign, said: “The biggest issue that we’ve had since the Second World War is being left to MPs. And the problem we have with MPs\u0026nbspin parliament, is\u0026nbspthat they can’t come to a view of what should happen in this situation.“The bottom line is how else are you going to resolve impasse in Westminster if not by referring it back to the people. I don’t know anyone who has come up with a viable alternative.”\u0026nbspLiberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said the “let’s-just-get-on-with-it”\u0026nbspattitude is a “fallacy”, because “even if we accept the government’s deal we’re not just getting on with it”.“We’ll be spending years in negotiation of what kind of arrangement we’d want with the European Union – the problem isn’t going to go away,” he said.The prime minister has repeatedly said that she will not countenance a further referendum on Brexit. But with no option carrying a majority in the Commons, a new vote has become\u0026nbspa more likely way to break the political deadlock.\u0026nbspReferring to calls for a new referendum on Monday, Ms May said: “People are talking about a second vote when we haven’t even delivered on the first vote.“I think we need to deliver on the first vote. We asked people to vote. We said ‘please decide whether we should leave or remain’.“People voted to leave and I think there’s a, sort of, democratic duty on us as politicians, having had that referendum, and having said it is your choice, to actually deliver on it. So, let’s deliver on the first vote.”Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

In recent days she has outlined how her proposals will deliver on the\u0026nbsppublic’s desire to end EU free movement.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

When you first see it, you just gasp because it’s just this huge hole in the ground.”The opening itself is 100m long and 60m wide, big enough to fit an entire football pitch.\u0026nbspWhen a team tried to climb down inside the huge chamber in September, they descended\u0026nbsp80 metres before being stopped by the flow of an underground river.John Pollack, an archaeological surveyor who has visited the site, said it was a “nationally significant” find.Sarlacc in its pit in the Star Wars film Return of the Jedi (Lucasfilm)“I’ve been in some of the biggest caves in the world, and this thing has an entrance that is truly immense, and not just by Canadian standards,” he told Canadian Geographic.The exact depth of the monstrous cave is not yet known but the water which flows in a torrent at the top of the shaft is believed to flow in a river underground for more than two kilometres\u0026nbspand emerge some 500 metres lower.\u0026nbspThis suggests the chamber would be among the biggest caves in Canada.\u0026nbspThe massive shaft which leads down from the surface is thought to have been carved out of the rock over many years by melting ice from nearby glaciers.\u0026nbspDuring its peak in the spring and summer, as much as 15 cubic metres per second of water could be rushing over the edge into the cave, Mr Pollack said, equivalent to two dumper trucks full every second.The exact location of the cave has not been revealed in order to protect the undisturbed site while officials prepare for a formal exploration and survey in 2020.But even if the public knew where to find the unspoiled marvel of nature, Mr Pollack said it is almost inaccessible.\u0026nbspMs Hickson said it was inspiring to know there was still much left of the world to discover.“Even in this day and age, when we think we know everything and we’ve explored every place, we can be surprised.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

This is particularly affecting the critical voices in civil society – human rights lawyers, journalists and bloggers.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High school students burn a barricade in front of their high school during a demonstration against French government Education reformsSully, the service dog of former US President George HW Bush in his final months, lays in front of Bush\u0027s casket at the George H Lewis \u0026amp Sons funeral home in Houston, TexasCourtesy Office of George HW BushReutersDemonstrators march in Brussels to \u0027claim the climate\u0027 as world leaders meet in Poland to discuss the Paris climate agreement targetsA protester moves to lob a tear gas canister during a protest in Paris today against rising fuel pricesUS President Donald Trump, Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Theresa May, French President Emmanuel Macron and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe wave hands in front of other leaders during a family photo at the G20 leaders summit in Buenos Aires, ArgentinaFirefighters battle a blaze on Fingerfield road at the Deepwater National Park area of Queensland.

We must be duly punished.EU leaders can see — apparently more clearly than our own abject leaders — just how well we might do and how much of a threat a prosperous, independent Britain would pose to their Grand Project.Nobody can be certain what will happen after next Tuesday’s crunch vote.A snap election or a second referendum are unthinkable but possible.Returning to full EU membership is both unthinkable and impossible.There are alternatives... the Norway Option, Canada Plus... but they are fraught with complications.Yet there is a way we could avoid Mr Gove’s “turbulence” and leave in an orderly fashion without any deal at all.We don’t have to “crash out” or drive off a clf like Thelma and Louise.Neither option would be good for Britain — or the EU.It should be possible to negotiate a  to -month window to prepare a deal which suits both sides — and pay an appropriate sum to Brussels for the extra time.First, of course, we need a new leader and a new Prime Minister.That is almost as complicated as Brexit.DISGRACED Labour MP Kate Osamor has finally quit Jeremy Corbyn’s team, but only after proof she lied about knowing her son Ishmael was a convicted drug handler.Ms Osamor told a Times reporter who confronted her with the evidence: “I should have come down here with a bat and smashed your face in.”“F*** off,” she added and chucked a bucket of water.Two questions. Is it any surprise Ishmael grew up with contempt for the law And what would have happened to a Tory MP who behaved like that to ahack Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Most are keen and eager to learn. That’s why teaching can be a really rewarding job, but there’s no doubt it is also a tough one.Today I will be launching my annual report, which will show that, overall, schools in England are doing a good job.The vast majority of children are attending good or outstanding schools, which is as it should be. Young people get just one shot at childhood — leaving no room for complacency.Yet in recent years it feels like more and more is being asked of schools and teachers, which could put this improvement at risk.They are being asked to do things that should be done at home by parents, as they used to be.This is making the job of schools harder. It takes up too much precious time and stops teachers from doing their actual job — teaching.One of the most shocking examples I hear about is the growing number of children beginning their reception year still in nappies.I’ve asked about this in primary schools this year, and each time I’ve asked I’ve been told it is a real problem.This is dficult for teachers, embarrassing for the children concerned and disruptive to their classmates.Quite simply, it is wrong. Toilet training is the parents’ job. It should not be left to schools. Only in the most extreme cases should parents be excused from this most basic of parenting tasks.And this isn’t the only area that concerns me.We all know about the growing problem of childhood obesity. By the start of primary school, almost a quarter of children in England are overweight or obese. This is at the age four or five.This rises to more than a third by the time they go to secondary school.It is estimated that nearly , young people in the UK are now suffering from type  diabetes, an unpleasant disease normally only seen in people over the age of .Schools have an important role to play, teaching children about the importance of healthy eating and exercise. Kids need to get out of breath during PE.But schools can’t do it all. It is lazy for us to rely on schools to change kids’ habits.And the reality is, that as Ofsted research shows, schools on their own can’t make the dference. The answer to the obesity crisis, particularly among younger children, lies in the home, and parents need to make sure their offspring eat healthily, go outside, and don’t spend all day playing on electronic devices.There is no point in teaching about healthy choices, making sure school meals are healthy or having rules about what goes into a packed lunch,for breakfast, dinner and all weekend children have a supply of junk food.One of the saddest things I’ve heard about recently is cases where children have leftover fast food, cold chips or chicken nuggets, in their packed lunches the following day. With the best will in the world, schools cannot fight this single-handedly.Sadly, in some parts of our country, schools are also at the forefront of tackling a very dferent kind of risk: kne crime and gang culture.Thankfully most schools are safe, and of course they can help educate young people about the dangers of knives and how to avoid being drawn into gangs.But they cannot be expected to solve the problem alone. Preventing kne crime requires people working together — police, youth services, health services — to protect children and to do everything to bring those who cause harm to children to justice.However we must not forget the role of parents here either. This is about taking responsibility for your child. I accept that many families are busy and that some children have dficult and complex problems to deal with.But that doesn’t excuse parents from the basics of teaching their children right from wrong, giving them proper boundaries and security. And that means not trying to be their “best friend”.One answer may be to introduce more parenting classes. We know these can work and help parents who might otherwise be struggling.These shouldn’t be for schools to run, but perhaps to run in schools. Maybe now is the time to look again at the ambitions of the Le Chances strategy or the ideas behind the Sure Start programme.But parents must recognise they cannot off load their responsibilities at the school gate.Every minute we ask teachers to spend on these issues is time children aren’t learning the Rs, studying our nation’s history or the scientic forces that shape our world.I want schools to be able to do their proper job, and to let them do that, parents have got to step up.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

On Christmas Day I will be enduringour annual family fallout over a game of Monopoly. ButI wasn’t, I’d be straight round to Middleton Towers in Bucklebury, Berks, for what sounds like an idyllically festive few days.In a Christmas walnutshell, it goes something like this: Wake up whenever, pop in to the local church, go for a walk, open a few pressies, smoked salmon and champagne for lunch, more pressies, some games, then the main meal early evening.Oh, and all the grandchildren will have a small tree in their bedrooms that they can decorate themselves. The rest of the year, she says, “is really normal most of the time”. Which, to Prince William, who has grown up amid the pomp and circumstance of stuffy royal traditions, must feel like a slice of sheer heaven.Instead, poor love, he and Kate are expected to join the rest of the royalsat Sandringham, where the Queen et al stick to the German tradition of opening gts on Christmas Eve before dressing for a “formal dinner” from which, oh dear, the women eventually retire to another room while the men enjoy a port or brandy.Then it’s off to the highly publicised visit to St Mary’s Magdalene church on Christmas morning, followed by a turkey lunch and a communal viewing of “Granny’s” speech at pm.It’s unclear when William and Kate will head off to see her family, but what’s the betting they get in the car with fixed grins before mumbling “thank God that’s over for another year” the second they hit Norfolk’s A  And that’s why, whatever the truth behind the rumours that Kate and Meghan aren’t getting on, it won’t matter one jot to the admirably grounded Duchess of Cambridge who, thanks to her idyllic childhood, knows exactly who she is.Meghan, on the other hand, has no such cosy alternative to retreat to. Her parents orced when she was just six years old and it’s no secret that she’s now estranged from her father Thomas and his highly vocal, deliciously off-message side of the family.So, however well meaning she is, all her charitable grandstanding and repeated declarations of being “an independent woman” suggest she finds validation from being regarded as a, yawn, groundbreaking feminist role model rather than, as Kate is dismissed by some, a dutul we and mother, who toes the royal line and doesn’t make waves.But Kate has no need to virtue signal because she’s rooted in the love and respect of her tight-knit family — a set-up she’s replicating with William, who, after his own fractured childhood, clearly adores the normality of le Chez Middleton.And of course, they’re both equally secure in the knowledge that, post-“King Charles”, the top job is theirs.Harry, on the other hand, has chosen a bride who, despite her efforts at reinvention, has a chequered pastand a burning desire to be seen as more than just a pretty appendage to the sixth-in-line to the throne.That’s understandable.

The British people voted to leave and Parliament cannot frustrate that.”But privately, senior No admitted that while any Commons motion would not be legally binding, it would be politically impossible to ignore the will of the House of Commons.As Westminster was plunged into a frenzy after the shock vote, some loyal Tory MPs claimed the hammer blow could actually help Mrs May win round wavering Brexiteer Tory MPs to back her deal, fearing an even softer Brexitit falls.Backbench Eurosceptic Andrew Bridgen even accused No of conspiring with Mr Grieve to bring on the defeat.Mr Bridgen told The Sun: “I am left highly suspicious after observing that the Government did not appear disappointed at all when the Grieve amendment went through.“Now No can threaten Brexiteers with either her deal or Parliament saying no Brexit - but that’s a  choice.”The defeat also sparked fresh calls from fervent Brexiteers for Mrs May to be ousted.Another rebel Tory MP said: “This again proves it’s time for colleagues to get the letters in.Look what a disaster Theresa May is making of Brexit”.The drama came just minutes before Theresa May fired the starting gun on the biggest show down in Parliament in decades.A few minutes after the crippling defeat, the PM was forced to take to the Despatch Box to open the marathon five day debate on her deal.After arguing for eight hours each day, MPs then vote on the  page Withdrawal Agreement and  page Political Declaration for a future trade deal at pm next Tuesday night.Imploring the Commons to back her deal and save her Government, the PM surprised MPs by swtly signalling she could make a fresh concession to Eurosceptics on the hated Irish backstop.Separately Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn incensed Brexiteers by saying that reopening the negotiations couldn’t be ruled out.And in incredible scenes, Tory MPs turned on each other as Boris Johnson labelled the PM’s deal a “national humiliation” and said it was “finely balanced” whether Britain would be better off staying in the EU.In a passionate hour long address, the PM said she was aware of the fierce opposition to the so-called Irish ‘backstop’.And she said: “I have listened to those concerns.I want us to consider how we could go further.“And I will be meeting colleagues to find an acceptable solution.”Government sources indicated this could involve giving MPs a vote on approving the activation of the insurance plan in .The PM had earlier warned that reopening the Withdrawal Agreement was impossible – and would give EU member states the chance to wrestle back wins from the UK in areas such as fisheries.In a charged debate, Labour’s Yvette Cooper accused the PM of not being “straight” with the House on the failure to agree a comparable deal on security co-operation.And DUP leader Nigel Dodds hit back at claims his party didn’t represent the pro-Remain feeling in Northern Ireland by saying he wasn’t afraid of another General Election.Original Maastricht rebel Christopher Gill could be seen shouting “outrageous, outrageous” from the peers gallery as the PM spoke.But in a passionate address, the PM urged the House to back her deal, reunite the country and put Britain on course for a brighter future.She said: “This argument has gone on long enough corrosive to our politics and le depends on compromise.”Defending the way she has handled the negotiations, the PM insisted that while she could have “banged on the table” and “faced criticism from all sides”, she had done what she believed was best for Britain.She said: “I didn’t play to the gallery. I focused on getting a deal that honours the referendum, sets us on course for a bright future, and I did so through painstaking hard.“Because I have never thought politics was simply about broadcasting your own opinions on the matter at hand.”Defending her record, she added: “When the EU gave us a choice between off the shelf models, I won a bespoke deal.“When in Salzburg the EU tried to insist on a backstop that carved out Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK I faced them down and they backed down.And right at the end when Spain tried to make a move on Gibraltar I stood firm and protected Gibraltar’s sovereignty.”She said: “Don’t let anyone think there is a better deal to be won by shouting louder.Don’t imagine thatwe vote this down a dferent deal is going to miraculously appear. The alternative is uncertainty and risk.“I don’t say this deal is perfect it was never going to be, that’s the nature of a negotiation.Yes it is a compromise it speaks to the hopes and desires of our fellow citizens who voted to leave and those who voted to stay in.“We will not bring our country togetherwe seek a relationship that gives everything to one side of the argument and nothing to the other.“We should not let the search for the perfect Brexit prevent a good Brexit.”But in a staggering sign of civil war in the Tory party, Conservative MPs turned on Boris Johnson as the former Foreign Secretary said no MP would “sincerely believe” is a good one.In a barb at Brexit-backing members in the Cabinet he added that it appears “those sent out to support it know it is a democratic disaster”.He also called for the Government to withhold the £ billion orce bill until the EU has agreed a trade deal. He stormed: “In Brussels they think they have us beat and our nerve will fail.“They think we have got nothing left in our tank and that we want to do a deal at any price.“Now is the time as we all think about this vote for us to show that they grossly underestimate this country.But in a series of Tory counter-attacks ex-Minister Ed Vaizey stood up to insist he “sincerely” believed in Theresa May’s deal.And fellow Brexiteer Roger Gale intervened to pan him for preferring “grievance to the solution”.Backbenchers then howled with laughter when the big hitter said we may be - down against the EU but “we can win -”.The PM walked out  minutes into her arch enemy’s address.With the PM listening on Boris ripped apart her deal and joked that it had achieved an “extraordinary thing” in bringing Remainers together with Leavers and “uniting the whole Johnson family”.“This is a national humiliation that makes a mockery of Brexit.”To heckling he summed up by warning people who voted Leave in  voted for change, not an “endless transition or thinly disguised version of the status quo”.He stormed: “It is a paint and plaster pseudo Brexit and beneath the camouflage we find the same old EU institutions the customs union  single market.“The people of this country voted for freedom, they voted for independence and for a better Britain and for a country where politicians actually listen to what they have to say andwe try to cheat them now they will not forgive us.”Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had earlier accused Mrs May of putting the country over a barrel.To the packed Chamber – which had earlier included Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson and her baby - he said: “Following the  election, the Prime Minister could have attempted to build a consensus, recognising the new arithmetic of Parliament, and sought a deal that brought people together.“Instead, just like her predecessor - who called a referendum without preparing for the eventuality of a Leave vote - the Prime Minister has seen these negotiations only as an exercise in the internal management of the Conservative Party.”He added: “This Government is not taking back control, it is losing control.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Prime Minister said it was not a negotiating ploy, explaining: What it is is our commitment as a UK Government to the people of Northern Ireland. She added: People need to know it is beyond a political assertion that there is that commitment there to the people of Northern Ireland to ensure that we have no hard border.

In a stinging attack the Labour leader accused the Tories of creating a hostile environment for those on benefits. He referred to a string of photographs of Tory MPs at foodbanks in their constituencies which have been promoted on social media in recent weeks.Mr Corbyn was visibly angered when the Prime Minister dismissed again the findings of the UN Special Rapporteur who said the Government’s policies and drastic cuts were “entrenching high levels of poverty and inflicting “unnecessary” hardship in one of the richest countries in the world. Asked which part of the report she found most shocking, Theresa May responded: We have been clear ashas been, that we dont agree with this report because what we actually see in our country today is absolute poverty at record lows, more people in work than ever before, youth unemployment almost halved, wages growing - and thats because of the balanced approach we take to our economy.  In his report Mr Alston, said the Government’s policies and drastic cuts were “entrenching high levels of poverty and inflicting “unnecessary” hardship in one of the richest countries in the world. His damning report said ministers were “in denial” about how the Universal Credit had pushed people into poverty. Today Mr Corbyn said the Government does not agree with his findings because the report presents an unpalatable truth. He added: The new Work and Pensions Secretary seems to have taken a lesson from her and created a hostile environment for those that are claiming benefits.  One of the Governments policies that is causing the greatest anxiety and poverty is Universal Credit, the UN rapporteur Professor Alston said it was fast falling into universal discredit. When will the Prime Minister demonstrate some of her professed concern about burning injustices and halt the roll-out of Universal Credit   Mrs May responded by saying the Government had listened to concerns about the benefit and had made changes. Fury erupted on the Tory benches after Mr Corbyn, during his final question, said: When I hear a Prime Minister talking about dficult decisions, what always happens afterwards in this context is the poorest lose out in our society - . million disabled people are now in poverty, , were hit by appalling cuts to the Employment Support Allowance benefit alone last year. This Government labelled disabled people scroungers, it called those unable to work skivers... Mrs May could be seen saying outrageous, while Tory colleagues shouted Withdraw! at Mr Corbyn, which prompted Commons Speaker John Bercow to intervene.  Mr Bercow took against Home Secretary Sajid Javid for offering advice, adding: He should seek to discharge his own obligations in his office to the best of his ability - I require no advice fromon the discharge of mine. Be clear about that. Mr Corbyn added: This Government also created a hostile environment for the Windrush generation. Mrs May faced MPs after bruising triple defeat in the House of Commons on Tuesday night. The SNPs Ian Blackford accused the Prime Minister of concealing the facts on her Brexit deal after her government became the first to be found in contempt of Parliament.  He said: We were promised strong and stable - what weve got is a Government in crisis. The MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber asked: Is it time that the Prime Minister took responsibility for concealing the facts on her Brexit deal from members in this House and the public  Will she take responsibility  Mrs May insisted the full legal advice the government was forced to publish was the same as the shortened statement made earlier this week.

When the people cant, they tell politicians to figure it out. The courts pick their way through the detail trying to be fair to all sides, and only the journalists try to explain why its complicated. So it is with capital punishment, terrorism, drone strikes, tax reforms, benefit cuts and everything  in le. Most of us expect complexity, relying on others to help us find a balance that doesnt kill us. We vote for representatives, then ask them to rely on their judgement to decide everything until we demand they rely on ours. But with Brexit the whole things gone cockeyed. We voted for those who suggested our relationship with the EU was simple. Parliament voted enthusiastically for a simple referendum. The people gave a simple answer, the government issued a simple letter. The courts were the first ones to decide it was complicated and journalists have spent the past two years failing to explain much at all. Its hardly surprising were now in a world where simple people still demand a simple Brexit and that politicians rely on the people to figure it out for them. A ComRes poll shows that people oppose remaining in the EU, oppose leaving with Theresa Mays deal, oppose a second referendum and oppose leaving without a deal. Their big idea instead is to renegotiate, despite the fact weve done that for two years and all the clowns achieved was a joke buttonhole that squirts water at the EU infor poundbillion. Politicians are now so confused about whos supposed to be doing what that the Disgraced Dr Liam Fox says theres a real danger that MPs may attempt to stealBrexit from the British people, and Michael Gove said that not delivering a simple thing that isnt possible because its more complicated than that would be a fatal blow to faith in democracy. Andrea Leadsom smilingly added that Parliamentarians who want to be in government in the future will live to regret the decision they took last night, as though she were a Mafia consigliere threatening painful retribution against those who disrespected the Prime Minister. Lets just stop there. Lets go back a bit, and explain. In  there was a massive, global, banking crash. Had it been ignored by politicians everyone would be living out of dustbins by now. All right, Richard Branson would be in Necker and Alan Sugar on his yacht, but it would be dustbins for them too.   Politicians worldwide did their jobs and figured out a solution. Two years later there was a general election and the people couldnt pick a team, so politicians had to form their own. Bizarrely, the party that came second wasnt part of it. The not-quite winners teamed up with the actual-losers and took power with barely a flicker of democratic concern.In the years that followed they housed immigrants in areas that rarely voted for their parties. Despite the fact such people produced more tax than they spent, they cut services in those places more than in friendlier ones. The aim, and result, was that Labour-voting areas became more xenophobic and more likely to turn Tory on immigration issues. They declared the previous administration profligate, then accumulated so many debts theyve started selling them off. They promised a northern powerhouse, while investing poundbn in the south and cutting investment by poundbn in the north.Thats not normal behaviour for politicians of any stripe, as theyre usually fully aware they can be sacked at short notice. But THIS lot established fixed, five-year contracts, which meant democracy was limited.When we were finally allowed a vote, the people picked the team which had been doing all the above but pretending that it wasnt. That team then opted to protect itself - not the country - by offering a referendum on leaving the EU which it thought no-one would want to do. But the people, now thoroughly confused by lies, theft, quantitative easing, Question Time, austerity, bananas and everything  hurled at them for years, picked the easy road - the f*** it road. The team captains ran away, the pound noseed, and those left on the field started barking the chaos was all Project Fear and could be completely ignored.   A new team captain activated Article  and told Parliament it had no say. The courts intervened to say Parliament was sovereign. Newspapers said judges were the enemy. Parliament was cowed into backing Article , even though it was vague and fully-revokable.The government then spent two years not negotiating a deal that isnt actually a deal, before telling the people and Parliament its the only option when it isnt. Few people notice that were preparing to leave the EU with , more people in poverty than we had  years ago, or have asked whether Brexit is in their interests.When the four estates of a democratic nation are in such turmoil and acting in direct opposition to their normal roles, there is nothing to do but hold on and hope for the best. And now, the ship of state is righting itself. Journalists are explaining complexities and detail. Judges are regarded as refuge. And Parliament has, finally, begun holding government to account.   For the first time in history, those ruling the country have been proven to be in contempt of our democratic processes. For the first time since the Brexit vote, the government has been forced to bow to the will of those figuring things out on behalf of the people. And for the first time in  years the Mother of Parliaments is acting like a grown-up - something that happens when loyal MPs rebel for a principle, when politicians seek to listen to one anothers arguments, when the people take an interest in what is being decided on their behalf. Nothing is perfect. We live in a world where racists claim the same freedom of expression as journalists, and believe that makes it all right to hurl homophobic slurs at a columnist while chasing him down the street, to threaten Jewish MPs online, to cause BBC reporters to need bodyguards. In the past decade, the confusion in our system has been fed by fake news, populism and idiots. The reason that these things - more properly called propaganda, fascism and the unelectable - do not dominate our world is because the system self-corrects. Each part pushes and pulls against the others, and the result is stable, slow, progress.  That is what happened in Parliament yesterday. Its what, hopefully, will continue this week while they vote on Brexit. Remember ityou are asked to vote again. Remember it when a journalist tries to explain, when judges rule, when MPs rebel and amend and argue. Elsewhere, with Parliaments that do not scrutinise the government, dictators hold power. Where journalists cannot explain, the people are kept in ignorance. And where those things are actively attacked, the world grows dark -  journalists were murdered this year while  languish in jail, most of them for crimes against the state. While Putin and Bin Salman high-five after the dismemberment of a journalist, remember that reporters are the first bit of democracy that dies. In their wake come the opponents, the judges, and then the people. However confusing and chaotic your democracy is, hold on to it. Be glad you have an MP, especiallythey dont always do as theyre told. Seek out a journalist whos explained well and say thank you, because the occasional pat is the only encouragement they need to keep headbutting walls. Note what happens when people dont vote, and make sure you do. Above all, be glad you have an opportunity to argue about your nations direction, and that youre not the only one steering the ship.

What we have is a Government in crisis. A Government which has lost two Brexit Secretaries, a Home Secretary, a Foreign Secretary, a Work and Pensions Secretary. A Government which has suffered from three consecutive defeats in just two hours. The first government to do so in  years. And now a government found to be in contempt of Parliament. Is it time that the Prime Minister took responsibility, a responsibility for concealing the facts on her Brexit deal from members of this house and the public. Will she take responsibility   Mrs May denied concealing the facts on the deal, adding: “What he will see is that the legal position that was set out on Monday in the -page document together with the statement made, and the answers to questions given by the Attorney General on Monday, very clearly set out the legal position.” Mr Blackford responded: “That is an incredibly disappointing response from the Prime Minister. “The facts have had to be dragged out of this government by Parliament. “This morning we have seen the detail of the legal advice. We have seen the facts that the government tried to hide. “Mr Speaker, this government is giving Northern Ireland permanent membership of the Single Market and the Customs Union. “The legal advice is clear, it states: ‘Despite statements in the protocol that is not intended to be permanent, in international law would endure indefinitely.’ “Since the Prime Minister ed from Brussels with her deal, the Prime Minister has been misleading the house inadvertently or otherwise.”  MPs are not allowed to accuse other MPs of lying, or deliberately misleading the House. It’s considered ‘unparliamentary’. Speaker John Bercow interrupted Mr Blackford, ordering him to withdraw the words ‘or otherwise’. But the SNP’s Westminster leader failed to withdraw the accusation, merely adding: “I did use the word inadvertently, and I repeat it. “The Prime Minister ed from Brussels with her deal. The Prime Minister has been misleading the house, perhaps inadvertently.” Again, Speaker Bercow got involved, telling Mr Blackford: “There can be no imputation of dishonour. And the insertion of the word ‘perhaps’ suggests the right honourable gentleman wants to keep his options open. “The option of imputing dishonour does not exist. That word must now be removed.” He ordered him to “rephrase, continue and complete, briefly.”  Mr Blackford responded: “I say again, inadvertently,” going on to ask the PM why she “continues to deny Scotland the rights and opportunities her deal offers to other parts of the United Kingdom.” Mrs May again insisted a “careful analysis” of Attorney General Geoffrey Cox’s statements and answers in the House would reveal no dference with the legal advice the Government was forced to publish today. She added: “I have myself said on the floor of this house that there is indeed no unilateral right to pull out of the backstop. “What I have also said is that it’s not the intention of either party that the backstop shouldbe used in the first place, or should it is used, should be anything other than temporary.” The legal advice from Attorney General Geoffrey Cox to Theresa May admits the Northern Ireland backstop could endure indefinitely. And it confirms the government would not legally have the power to remove the UK from the fallback position, which would keep Britain in the customs union to avoid a hard border in Ireland, without agreement from the EU. It comes after MPs on Tuesday found the Government to be in contempt of Parliament for the first time in modern history.

The Tories have  MPs, plus she has a confidence and supply deal with Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party, so all will be well for the Prime Minister, yes  Emphatically, no. In fact, she appears doomed to certain defeat, unable to cobble together the numbers to force her blueprint through the Commons. Thanks to Mrs May needlessly squandering David Cameron’s hard-won,fragile, majority at last year’s snap general election - the one she never needed to call - she has to rely on the DUP to win parliamentary votes. But despite the poundbillion bung she conjured up for the Ulster hardliners, the DUP will not support the pact because elements of the deal would make Northern Ireland dferent from the rest of the UK. That strips away the PM’s stitched-together majority in a trice. In her own party, insiders believe up to nine Tory Remainers could vote against the deal, piling further pressure on the premier.   And then there is the European Research Group, a seemingly innocent name for the Conservatives’ hardline Brexiteers. Scores of its members are set to revolt unless Mrs May conjures a compromise. Sources estimate up to  Tory MPs could vote against the deal. While some Labour MPs may rebel against Jeremy Corbyn and offer their support, it is highly unlikely to be anywhere near enough to save the PM’s pact. What happened in the Commons yesterday  Theresa May lost three crucial votes. MPs backed a Labour amendment which held the Government in contempt for refusing to publish its full legal advice on the Brexit plan. The advice will now be released, and could confirm the worst fears of the Brexiteers – making even more of them likely to vote down the deal. Then MPs backed an amendment by Tory MP Dominic Grieve which would give MPs a say on what happensTheresa May’s Brexit deal is voted down. This means they could block a no-deal Brexit, send the Prime Minister back to the negotiating table or even call for a second referendum. The PM is no longer in control of Parliament or the Brexit process.   Can Brexit be halted  Remainers have seized on the provisional findings of the The European Court of Justice’s advocate general, who said the UK can decide on its own to cancel its withdrawal from the EU. It is not a binding judgment but suggests the ECJ will come to the same conclusion in its official ruling. This would allow us to revoke Article , the two-year mechanism Mrs May triggered which started the countdown to our departure on March , . What happens next  The key moment is on Tuesday when MPs vote on Mrs May’s Brexit plan. Unless she persuades Tory rebels to change their mind she is heading for almost certain defeat. More than  Conservative MPs, the DUP, the vast majority of Labour MPs,  Lib Dems and the SNP have all said they will vote down the proposal. But some Brexiteers may take fright at Mr Grieve’s amendment, fearing it could scupper Brexit. What does the Prime Minister doshe loses  We are in uncharted territory. The law says Mrs May has toto Parliament within  days with an updated response. Much will depend on the scale of defeat. If it is close she could try to wring further concessions from Brussels. If she is heavily defeated she will be under intense pressure to resign.   Where does that leave Brexit  Nobody knows. MPs could send the PM back to Brussels but that would need the EU to agree to extend Article . Or Mrs May could call a snap election. This is a high-risk move for the Tories as it could land Jeremy Corbyn in No . MPs could also decide only a second referendum can break the deadlock. The default is that we crash out without a deal. But most MPs will do everything they can to prevent what they see as an economic calamity.

So when Drew Povey was suspended from Harrop Fold in July after being investigated for administrative errors, staff and pupils launched a campaign to have him reinstated. But Drew, , quit in September. Now an Ofsted report has placed the school, in Little Hulton, back in to special measures after it deemed the school inadequate in all five categories. The local council blames the schools problems on long standing issues and historic practices. Now for the first time Drew fully explains his emotional toll at seeing the school’s progress unravel and why he believes he was ousted from the job he loved. “It was a dim, dark and cold December lunchtime when I arrived at some green gates. I pressed a buzzer and waited a while till eventually a voice over the intercom asked, “Hello, can I help ”.   I said, “I’m Drew Povey and I’ve come for the Christmas concert.” Driving into the carpark I saw an old building that looked a bit like a factory, with the odd frosted window and bars outside. I eventually found the entrance, where a sign that had seen better days and with peeling paint read: “Welcome to our school”. Inside, a typical lunchtime in a busy second school was in full swing. The smell of chips, the hubbub of kids chatting, and some music playing in the background. As I walked to reception, I noticed two queues of students. One was very long and they were holding pink tickets. The other, only had a handful of kids holding green ones. It took me a moment, then I realised that this was the way the free school meals kids were separated from the payers. The kids in the pink queue were all on free school meals. I was given a tour of the school and that’s when I saw all needed to see. Kids making chip butties and chatting excitedly about the Christmas holidays. On the yard, kids were playing football and basketball, with others hanging around eating packed lunches and laughing. The students told me about their friends and the teachers they liked most. The staff looked tired,but were buzzing about the students who were doing great things and the couple that were harder to reach.   The bell rang for the end of lunch and the energy was like nothing I’d seen in a school before. I stood smiling and saying ‘hello’ and kids responded with ‘hiya’ and a look that said, ‘who are you ’ I went into the hall and the concert started. Four students at the piano, unorms perfect and chests puffed out with pride. At the point, I knew this was they place I wanted to be. They had me heart and soul from that point on. This was Harrop Fold in , the ‘worst school in the country’, but with a charm that literally took my breath away. I started at the school in charge of pastoral care – my perfect job. The next few years were challenging and tough,but the school soon came out of special measures. My goal was to work with the students to get them to own their school and to encourage staff to raise the bar even more. In , I was called into the Head’s office. I’d seen the Chair of Governors arrive and the Council’s Director of Children’s Services. This could either be very good news, or very bad. They asked meI’d be interested in being the Headteacher – the proudest moment of my career. I agreed on the condition that I would be able to do what I thought was best for the community. The following nine years were simply amazing. There are just too many high points to list, but thebest part was seeing the students start to believe in themselves and whole school’s confidence grow.   The once maligned blue blazer became respected and the community got behind us for the first time. People starting saying, ‘this is a good school’. In January  we started the new year with new hope, anticipation and optimism. The students and staff had just voted to do another series of Educating Greater Manchester, and our reputation was continuing to grow, and the school was now considerably over-subscribed. The Council had been in touch early in the term to say they had spotted an error in the census data that we submit to them. We looked into it, and it was clear that a mistake had been made, relating to how – students had been recorded. Queries were also raised about how the attendance of two students had been recorded, and about a student being sent home early after a conversation with parents. We met with officials from Salford City Council, accepted full responsibility and held our hands up to the mistakes and set out how we were now changing processes so that this didn’t happen again. Everyone thought that was the end of it. But it was just the beginning. In March the Council came back to us to say they needed to investigate further. And then in July three members of staff, myself included, were suspended. The implication was clear: they believed we were trying to massage our results by recording students as not being on roll .   What had clearly been an administrative error - which was corrected as soon as we were aware - had now been blown up into a set of accusations that were questioning our integrity and our honesty. But something didn’t stack up. Whilst the error should certainly not have been made, it only involved a tiny number of students. Did that really warrant suspensions and a costly investigation  And besides,we were in the business of massaging results and chasing grades, there are certainly be far more effective ways to do that at Harrop. If we had wanted to, we could have squeezed another –% from our results by having a dferent approach. We are a genuinely inclusive community school. This means we don’t exclude pupilsand we have signicant numbers of students who have additional needs not normally seen in mainstream schools. We also accept what are called “managed moves” – in other words, students who have struggled at other schools and move school to have a fresh start. Many schools just don’t have this same inclusive approach, andwe followed suit, our results would look a hell of lot more impressive than they do now. Which was why the implied accusation just beggared belief. I’m not one for conspiracy theories I’m a typical northern lad who loves what he does for a living, loves his family, and loves – for my sins – Everton. But to my mind, the approach that Salford Council took seemed to be utterly disproportionate. Something  was driving this and as the investigation dragged out over the summer, into September and now seemingly likely to stretch further into the autumn with still no resolution in sight, it has become increasingly clear that the end goal was to get me out. The reasons for this are actually pretty simple. It’s fair to say that I’ve been a thorn in Salford City Council’s side for some time. I’m no diplomat and I speak plainly.   When I arrived at Harrop, the single biggest challenge was nothing to do with the kids, or the teachers, or even the building. The school was utterly hamstrung by a debt of pound.m that had been racked up under the Council’s direction. Expensive but largely ineffective consultants were bought in during the time the school was struggling. They added very little to the school, other than an almighty bill. Someone had to pick that bill up, and according to the Council, it should be the school. Anyone in education will know that that level of debt is crippling for a school. And even though we managed to negotiate a payment holiday of a couple of years, the shadow of it hangs over Harrop, threatening to derail the progress we have made over the years. Independent school finance experts who were brought in to look at the debt and advise on ways to repay it recommended to the Council that they should write it off. This fell on deaf ears. Taking part in the first series of Educating Greater Manchester was all about singing from the rooftops about how amazing our students and staff are, and about raising the profile of the school. As a result, I have been fortunate enough to get involved in leadership development work in the corporate sector, and also wrote a leadership book called Educating Drew. The proceeds from both the leadership work and book have all gone towards paying off the debt – around pound, in total.  But it seems that the combination of me refusing to keep my mouth shut about the debt, together with the prospect of another series of Educating Greater Manchester was the straw that broke the camel’s back, and the Council had decided enough was enough. I must go. The ensuing investigation has been harrowing. It has been dficult both professionally and personally. It’s clear to me that Council have attempted to bully me, but I am not someone to take that sort of thing lying down. And so I decided that I needed to take a stand. It was put to me that I could go quietly, and accept a pay deal and go on gardening leave – which would, of course, involve a gagging clause. But it’s just not in my nature to do that. Since being suspended in July, I have been astounded and appalled by the number of other Heads and leaders that have come forward to say that they have suffered similar treatment, but they felt they had no option other than to go quietly. The stories have been distressing – families being torn apart, people on medication, educators – great educators – unable to work. This cannot be allowed to go on. I have made clear to Salford City Council that I will continue to co-operate with any investigation. I continue to publicly acknowledge that mistakes were made, and that as the leader of Harrop, I take responsibility for those mistakes. Just last week though, Harrop has been dealt yet another blow, with an Ofsted report that points to many problems in the school. I readily acknowledge that Harrop is a challenging school and that mistakes certainly happened on my watch, but the school I left in July bears no resemblance to the school described in Ofsted report. To me, this just illustrates all the more, thatyou destabilise a vulnerable school, things can go wrong at a quite shocking speed. I have no doubt that all sorts of accusations will be thrown around in the days and months to come, and this whole experience has been an education in itself on human behaviour – both good and bad.   Tens of thousands of hours of footage have been taken at Harrop Fold over the last few years – all from   fixed point cameras. I’m not going to comment on the fairness of an inspection regime that doesn’t allow those being criticised the right to reply, so I say only this:surelythis catalogue of issues are all “historic” as is being claimed, this would have been evident in both the first series of Educating Greater Manchester, and indeed in the one to come. I’m a die-hard optimist by nature so I do believe that the truth will out, one way or another. I have been humbled by the support I have been given on social media and in person, and I have been shocked at the depths some people will sink to. But in all of this, amidst all the accusations and recriminations, only one thing matters, and that is the kids of Harrop. They are the stars, and they will continue to shine no matter work."},{"url":null,"title":"brit matthew hedges endured psychological","story":"NewsBrit Matthew Hedges endured psychological torture at hands of UAE captorsThe British academic was held in solitary confinement for six-months by the Gulf state after he was accused of spying for MIShareCommentsByLuke Kenton:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video spy-accused-academic-matthew-hedges-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA British academic accused of espionage by the United Arab Emiratesreveals he went through scarring ‘psychological torture’ during his near-six-month stay in solitary confinement.

YouTuber Brad Holmes reportedly pulled one of these pranks on his fiance Jenny and uploaded the footage of her screaming in agony for his two million fans to watch. Brad, , has more than , subscribers on YouTube and is known for pulling pranks on his other half. His videos include him calling Jenny thick, cutting a chunk of hair off while shes asleep and pretending to propose before telling her it was all a joke.   The term Cloutlighting was coined as a combination of clout which is a type of social media fame and gaslighting where an abuser manipulates their victims into doubting themselves. The more extreme the prank, the more likes or followers the prankster gets thereby increasing his clout or fame online. While some of the videos are set up stunts where the partners have given consent, some charities have expressed concern that there could be abuse going on behind the scenes. The tampon prank video, which was recorded in , was one of Brads more shocking pranks.  In the footage, Brad can be seen rubbing the seeds of a red chilli onto the tampon before putting it back inside the applicator. Jenny is then filmed as she goes to the loo but within seconds shes screaming in pain. He then laughs as she shouts and screams in pain while desperately splashing water onto the intimate area. The video went viral but was taken down after people complained that it was abusive.   Amanda Major, a representative of the charity Relate, told Sun Online: Placing something in the vagina that you didnt give permission for is abuse, and a woman on the receiving end of that would be in their right to question their safety within the relationship.

And that terrible quest to look a little dferent has ended in her death from a cardiac arrest following a bottom op or ‘bum lt’ at a clinic in Hungary. She’d initially only wanted a tummy tuck, breast lt and liposuction. But the offer of a freebie bum lt was presumably too good to resist.  There are few of us in our late s who’ve been through the ravages of childbirth and all that follows who don’t wish we were a little more taut or toned. . And while cosmetic surgery was for a long time regarded as an shyindulgence for the young, vain or feckless – it’s now within the budgets and imaginations of us all. Which is why the realities of its dangers need to be in the minds of us all too – and why today’s warning by Kirk so needs to be heard. For Tryce’s terrible story is by no means unique. Only last week we told the story of how another mum – -year-old Louise Harvey – died after developing a blood clot following a boob job.  And in August, Leah Cambridge, another young mum of three, died after undergoing a bum lt in Turkey. These, tragically, are just the tip of the iceberg. More than , British women every year are suffering complications as they jump on cheap flights to even cheaper foreign clinics in the hope of finding the perfect body. The number of Brits travelling abroad for elective surgery is thought to be up by between % and %. On days when we  and -something women feel fat and frumpy and invisible to the outside world, it is easy to be lured by the idea youth can be regained for less than the price of a family holiday. It’s an opportunity which can sound too good to be true. Tryce’s tragic tale reminds us once more that anything that sounds too good to be true... probably is.

This Tory Government is a shambles. I am reminded of this every time I walk into the House of Commons and look at the Tory frontbench. Do they see the country as we do  Do they care that young families are living off foodbanks  How do they explain to their kids why more and more people are sleeping on our streets  Can we trust the Tories with the future of our country  Since  the answer has been no. And that’s why Labour MPs will vote against this Tory Brexit next week. We have to end the need for foodbanks.  We have to get people off the streets. This should be the priority for towns all over Britain. Until there is a solution to that, no one should trust the Tories on our future. Worse than that though, May’s Brexit deal isn’t even a plan. Brexit has already taken up two long years in which the Prime Minister couldn’t even get the Tories in her own Cabinet to agree, let alone her MPs. The House of Commons is in deadlock. That’s why all she is offering now is a vague ‘political statement’, which tells us nothing about the future. If we vote for it, we will be voting for two more years of wrangling and greater uncertainty. It will drag on and on and on. Many Labour members and voters are coming to the conclusion that the only way out of this mess is to let the public have the final say.  Parliament has ground to a halt. Meanwhile poverty is rising. If we can’t boot the Tories out with a general election then let’s take power form their hands and give the final verdict to the public. Has Brexit been a resounding success  Do we trust the Tories with our country  I think we all know the answer to that.

Alexander Heavens waited until his partner had nodded off in bed before placing her thumb print on the iPhones home button to access her texts and emails. The -year-old then woke her up to interrogate her throughout the night as to who everyone was. He has now been convicted of psychological abuse. In the last year of their six year romance, Heavens, from Failsworth, near Oldham, Greater Manchester, would also demand the pin code on her phone to check her messages. And during rows he bit her on the arm and bent her fingers back so far that she thought they might break. At Manchester Crown Court, Heavens admitted engaging in controlling and coercive behaviour in an intimate relationship. The court heard the couples relationship soured in Christmas  after he suffered bouts of paranoia due to his cocaine use. Prosecutor Rob Smith said: [She] always had issues with his temper but had never taken things out on her. She said things started to change when he met new friends in November . He began spending time with these new friends and subsequently taking drugs.  He started taking his anger out on her and was paranoid about her actions. The first incident in , the defendant became angry because she was spending time with her family rather than him. They rowed about it and he kept arguing with her about it until he bit her and bruised her upper arm. After  his behaviour worsened with her, particularly when he alleged that she had been with other men. During arguments, he began bending her fingers back so far that she thought they were going to break. When she was asleep he would grab her finger and use it to unlock her phone as it had her fingerprint ID code. He used this to check her phone messages and go through her contacts. He would wake her up and ask who everyone was and keep her up all night. Her work became affected and she became sleep deprived. On one occasion she was going to sleep when he asked her a question about something on her phone, and when he didnt get a reply he punched her in the face. She remembers being pushed to the kitchen floor, stood on and trampled on. He called her on another occasion whilst she was in bed and woke her up asking for her pin code to gain access to her phone. One morning she woke to find him watching pornography on her phone, which he had been doing all night. In March  she found messages suggesting he was seeing someone . When he responded to her he began screeching at her, ran to the kitchen and he got hold of a kne and held it to his stomach. She tried to calm him down but he was continuing to shout at her so she decided to leave. She was worried he would use the kne on her or himself. After this he continued getting angry with her and his behaviour worsened even more to the point that whenever she said something he didnt like, he punched her twice to the face.  She decided she had enough, she said she was shattered and ended the relationship on her birthday in October . When he was arrested he denied all allegations and said it made him laugh to say he was controlling as he had never lay a finger on her. In a statement, the partner said: I have always tried to help him but he has responded with abuse both physically and mentally. He sent numerous messages, he visited me at home and he would always call me when I was with my family.In mitigation, defence lawyer Stuart Duke said: The defendant accepts he is guilty of controlling behaviour. This was his first long term relationship. He accepts he behaved badly. He was drinking a lot after the breakup, he took it badly, and he was taking cocaine. Deferring sentence for six months, Judge Martin Rudland said: The public needs to be aware that this sort of behaviour wont be tolerated. This behaviour needs to be properly met with an appropriate sentence. I have come to the conclusion it is in the public interest that this sort of behaviour must be acknowledged, but not today. I have no doubt he has suffered with his own demons, and he hasnt helped himself by the consumption of alcohol and cocaine. He needs to put some distance between him and these events. The court needs to see what he can do by way of addressing the problems he has. He needs to put this behind him and stabilise his le. This doesnt mean he wont get an immediate sentence. He can get a lot of self help here. This will still be hanging over him. Addressing Heavens he said: Please be under no illusion, this is an extremely serious course of conduct. This course of conduct often takes place behind closed doors and is dficult to detect. Victims are often too afraid to go to the police, doctors or hospital and so it goes undetected for some time. I am going to defer your sentence, which means you can address your problems and you need to grasp those demons that come with them. You must understand Mr Heavens, this has been a close run thing. You have been given a chance to address your issues, and your family can support your through this. Heavens was banned from contacting his ex under the terms of a restraining order.

She said: I made what some might say a naive decision to re-mortgage my house and open my own salon, with no clients, and at the time I was a single mum without a penny to my name. I never really gave it a thought that I could potentially lose everythingit didnt work out, I just threw myself in and hoped for the best, but I was never going to let it fail. My personality is such that I was determined to make it work. In  she begged and borrowed pound, to train in semi-permament makeup and buy the equipment - but the real turning point for her business came in  when she trained in microblading. Shes now got thousands of clients, her diary is full and her skills are recognised far and wide and customers visit her from all over the country for treatments thanks to her reputation.   I just love what I do, its a hobby, not a job, said Gemma. Helping people feel and look better is an amazing thing to do. I absolutely love helping people feel better about themselves. Gemma, who employs seven staff, has also now launched the citys only semi-permanent makeup training academy - so she can share her skills with others who want to excel in the beauty field. And despite enjoying the financial rewards of the industry, which can be more than what a doctor earns, her latest venture is not motivated by money. She says the reason for the next step of opening the Microbeau Training Academy is the love and passion for her job which makes her want to share her skills. The academy, in Hedon has been launched alongside friend Marie Selby, another beauty expert who is based in the south of England.   Its been a massive investment, but I wouldn’t let it not work, Im really driven and passionate about what I do, said Gemma. I always try to do the best treatments I can, and I want to pass on my passion. Students come to me because they have have seen my work, they like how I work, and they want to learn my technique. Together we felt we could offer something not received at other training courses weve both been on.   Both of us have trained with independent people and also with big companies, we liked the way a big company is ran with training material and other benefits but we also like the personal touch of independents, theyre more approachable, more personal so we wanted to give the best of both worlds. It can be quite a stressful thing to learn, you do have ups and downs, and what I never got from my training was that little bit of counselling, and that’s why I think were a little bit dferent from others.   The academy now offers courses in semi-permament eyeliner, lips and powder brows and Gemma is planning to add new treatments during the next few years. Everyone from complete beginners are trained. Andthat doesnt keep her busy enough, Gemma is so passionate about what she does, she offers some treatments, for medical conditions free of charge. Gemma often does areola reconstruction treatment for recovering breast cancer patients. She tattoos the nipple after women have had a maestactomy.

Theresa May’s dogs dinner of a Brexit deal looks almost certain to fall on Tuesday, not least because MPs know that it hands far too much power to the EU after  March. With no appetite for an economy-shattering No Deal, her own cabinet ministers must now persuade her to pivot to the only other feasible Brexit option Norway Plus. Let’s be clear. The Norway option is a strong compromise. It would respect the result of the referendum – the : vote was an instruction to move house, but to stay in the same neighbourhood. Aside from a few loud voices on both ends of the spectrum, the silent majority of people – Leave or Remain – recognise that we must leave the EU but maintain a close, practical, working relationship with those countries.  On the doorstep in Aberavon I hear that my constituents are fed up of politicians bickering and want a Brexit that can move our country forward. Joining the European Free Trade Association and the European Economic Area would mean an exciting future for Britain where we lead a group of countries outside of the EU, free from pressure to join the Euro or a European army, but still with access to the job-saving Single Market. Importantly Norway’s Prime Minister and Iceland’s Foreign Minister say they are happy to have us, while the EU’s chief negotiator has offered the EEA, plus a form of customs union , as a route forward. Some claim Norway Plus would make us a ‘rule-taker’, but the truth is that the EFTA court which we’d be joining is far preferable to the more powerful European Court of Justice which we’d be leaving, due to the fact that EFTA has the power to erge from ECJ rulings and, crucially, respects national sovereignty.  Then there’s the question of managing immigration. Norway Plus would represent a signicant step forward because the EEA agreement contains an emergency brake on freedom of movement and a chance to reform the system. By providing Britain with a lever to pullnumbers get too high the EEA agreement consequently ends the seemingly limitless nature of freedom of movement that was such a key factor in the referendum. And what about Norway’s payments to the EU  Well, EEA countries simply pay for the EU institutions they have access to, which seems fair, and pay far less per head. The time has come for adult politics. Norway Plus is a sensible bridge-building Brexit that can and will re-unite our deeply ided country.

He also had scabs on all four of his extremities, was so thin that his ribs were exposed, and had bruises on his buttocks and back.The coroners report documented injuries all over Anthonys body, assistant district attorney in the case, Jonathan Hatami, told jurors.   There were injuries to Anthonys side and his hip area, both his left hip and his right hip, and his arms, and even injuries to his feet. Mr Hatami also said the coroners report suggested there was blunt force trauma to the boys head and brain, Eyewitness News reports.And he suffered multiple blunt force trauma to his body.The shocking allegations have come to light after a Calornia judge ordered the unsealing of grand jury proceeding transcripts.Barron, , and Leiva, , who is ft in, have both pleaded not guilty to charges that they tortured Anthony and murdered him. The child died on June  in Lancaster, Calornia. The proceeding transcripts, obtained by the news station, detail what Mr Hatami told jurors in his opening statement on the case. He claimed that the two defendants caused injury to Anthony by beating him with objects such as belts and a vacuum hose. They also allegedly used wrestling moves and chokeholds on the little boy, made him kneel on rice and locked him in his room for days.And they reportedly withheld food or water from him.The prosecutor said the evidence heard in the case will clearly show Barron and Leiva are ultimately responsible for Anthonys murder. They brutally tortured and intentionally murdered him, he said.The documents were unsealed on Monday on the order of Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Kathleen Kennedy, Fox  reports. However, some exhibits will stay sealed pending a January hearing. Leivas attorney had objected against the transcripts release, arguing that it could harm the defendants chance of a fair trial.Earlier, reports claimed that Barron and Leiva could face the death penaltyconvicted of the charges against them.It has been alleged that Anthony was burned with cigarettes and banned from using the toilet before his death.The childs eight siblings witnessed and were forced to take part in some of the abuse, according to court documents. They allegedly had to fight the youngster and keep watch “so he would remain standing or kneeling”. Mr Hatami wrote in an indictment: “At one point Anthony could not walk, was unconscious lying on his bedroom floor for hours, was not provided medical attention, and could not eat on his own.”  Anthony had previously said that he “liked boys”, the deputy director of the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services confirmed.Sherf’s deputies were called to the little boys home a day before he died - with his mum allegedly claiming he had fallen down the stairs. The youngster was taken to hospital, where he later passed away.After his death, authorities removed his siblings — aged between  months and  years old — from the home. It is thought they are now being cared for by county child welfare workers.Barron and Leiva deny the charges against them.

The site was disguised as a business that hired elite brand children’s clothing which were worn by underage models. Media reports in Moscow say it was offering girls and boys aged from five upwards to sex perverts for an hourly rate of pound-to-pound,. The website was blocked by Russian law enforcement and a probe is now underway by criminal investigators into who was behind the paedophile ring. One model pictured was said to be just eight years old. One hour’s rental was priced at , roubles - or pound. The wording suggested this price was for hiring clothes - but the innuendo indicated it was for abusing the child. In the same way, another “model”, aged five, was priced at , routes , or pound,.  One picture showing a six-year-old boy put the cost of his clothing at , roubles - or pound. A seven-year-old had the same price for one hour’s rental. Yulia Ivanova, spokeswoman for the Russian Investigative Committee, said: “According to the media, the creators of the website advertising clothing for children were in fact making a profit…. offering services renting out children for prostitution”. The website indicated the hourly cost of rent and also offered a delivery service outside Moscow. While the site showed branded kid’s clothing, reports said this was a mask for advertising children for sex. “Everything suggested child prostitution,” one media report claimed. “Photos of children, their ages and names, prices, detailed information about delivery of the product and opportunities to order a comfortable place for using the product -unambiguous references.” The site’s operators took steps to remain anonymous. “Payment for services could be made only with a cryptocurrency.” Deals were negotiated by a web messenger known for its secrecy. “There was also a photo of an absolutely naked child on a beach holiday,” said the report.  TV reported that the service was created for Muscovites. The organisers were “delivering little victims of violence in a car - and taking them back in the same car”. Children could be brought to the door of clients living outside the Russian capital “for an additional payment”. One page on the site - before it was blocked - offered “delivery across Moscow and Moscow region around the clock with no days off. “We deliver rented clothing in our own transport that we use to take [it] back. “If you have no opportunity to use rented product at your , we have our own comfortable spaces in Moscow.” The site contained the name CPidzhak - with the letters ‘CP’ seen as standing for ‘child porn’. Reports said two grotesque “references” supposedly from clients made clear beyond all doubt that the website was offering child sex. One user called “connoisseur”, stated: What is offered by cpidzhak website is a lot more pleasant than any CP video or photo! “Trust me! Its like heroin! “Now you dont need to watch child porn…. or CP, just choose the product in the shops catalogue and contact managers through the website or .” The revolting post continued: “If you use the services, unforgettable joy not compatible to anything  is awaiting for you!” Another ‘reference’ claimed ‘everything was to top standard’. “I had unforgettable time and I wanted to express my sincere gratitude,” it read.

The stalker, who attacks women from behind, has already stabbed several victims leaving two in intensive care. Locals in the Toliyatti area are said to be in a “panic” over the situation. Vigilante patrols have taken to the streets and police are urging local women not to go out alone until the “maniac” is caught. The -year-old suspect - named today as Artem Semyonov and seen prowling the dark snowy streets on video - has struck three times in less than a week.  But locals claim more attacks have been hushed up. Local resident Irina Bazanova told Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper: “People are talking about dozens of victims. “My friend did not let her daughter attend her evening classes because she would had to come back home late. “People are offering help in social networks – to meet, to walk together. “It is asthe whole city is united”.

He slashed her coat with his kne - but did not injure her before fleeing. On November , a -year-old female bank employee was stabbed in the liver after an attack in a residential area. The next day, a post office manager, aged , was attacked on Kosmonavtov Bouled.   “She was stabbed in her abdomen, she was taken to hospital,” said a police source. Both the wounded women are in intensive care. Police say there is no apparent motive for the attacks. His victims are stabbed once before he flees, said a source.

Local citizens including fans of a local ice hockey club, a football club, and martial arts federation members are “searching and patrolling the streets”. Toliyatti, with a , population, is the car capital of Russia, home of the famous Lada brand. Police have told women only to walk in well-lit areas.   They should “not walk alone” and they are urged to have the phone number of their local police station to hand. They should “look around, monitor the situation at all times” and are told: “If you feel that you are in danger, do not be shy to call for help.” A newspaper said “every man wearing a brown jacket has become suspicious”.

It can really hurt teams,” said Jim.“We didn’t utilise Jesse and Calvin’s pace nearly enough at Hibs but they are still young and they are still learning their positions.“We have that pace, though, andyou take our three midfielders last Saturday, although Paul McGowan doubled up as a striker because of the system we wanted to play, you look at Martin Woods, you look at Glen Kamara you look at Paul McGowan, every one of them can pick a pass.“They are clever players and they can spot a pass, sowe make the runs early enough we can use that.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"south argyll schools reach bowl final","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowSouth Argyll Schoolstravelled to Eastwood High School in Glasgow on Tuesday November  to play in the Scottish Schools Bowl semi-final.The game was played in good conditions and the team were looking forward to building on their recent quarter final performance.The game started with an early converted try for SAS but they were pulled back to - by half time.

No wonder he looked nervous.The boys got to grips with the dferent handling characteristics of Willie Senior#s car and started to up the pace in the afternoon bringing the car home in a respectable th overall and third in class three. This result was enough to secure second position in the overall championship in class.Jamie Miller continued the learning process with the little Citroen C-RMax with Ian McCulloch pointing him in the right direction. A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages. They got the hammer down over the last three and were to finish fth overall and first in class three.They were beaten only by the Kirkaldy brothers, both in Escort MkII#s of the highest calibre, and two WRC cars driven by Brian Watson and Reay Mackay.Last but not least, Oban#s Angus MacNeil was out with Sam MacFadyen in Brian Watson#s Mitsubishi Evo  binging it home unscathed in th overall.The event was won by Alan Kirkaldy in a freshly built Escort MkII, followed by his circuit racer brother Andrew in secondand Reay Mackay taking the last podium place in his WRC Fiesta. This was a fitting finish to the Championship at Leuchars with very fast stages and a good test of manand machine in equal measures.Photographs by West Coast Photos."},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"abandoned bird left cage inside","story":"NewsAbandoned bird left in cage inside a carrier bag beside Ayr bus stopThe bus stop is close to the Pets at Home store so the forgetful owner may have been getting food or vet treatment.ShareByStephen Houston:,  DEC News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA daft bird fancier left their canary while waiting for a bus.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as .

And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13689315.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS170228854.jpg","title":"ayr uniteds somerset park football","story":"NewsAyr Uniteds Somerset Park football ground damaged as car ploughs into turnstilesThe vehicle smashed into historic Somerset Park shortly before pm last night.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsCrash at Somerset Park\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA football clubs stadium has been badly damaged after a car ploughed straight through its turnstiles.

Peter Maclean, clinical director, cancer services, said: “The next stage is to determine where the site will be.” The NHS Ayshire  Arran health board meeting was told a new model for cancer treatment is being proposed across the whole of the West of Scotland. Non-executive board member Ian Welsh said there is concern about moving services away from Ayr. As well as the main cancer unit, new outreach treatment hubs could be available where but they would only cater for low-risk cases. Nurse director Professor Hazel Borland said the outreach service could be located at Ayrshire Central Hospital in Irvine. She added: “For the next  to  months there will be no change. It continues as it is.” Councillor Joe Cullinane raised the issue of consultation and said any change at Ayr would become political. He added: “At the end of the day cancer touches most people’s lives in our community.” Chief executive John Burns said the ambition was to deliver the “best care we can to our population”. He added: “We need to think of it as a pathway, not just a building.” Councillor Laura Brennan-Whitefield wanted more information on the outreach cancer treatment. She said: “There has been a question mark over Ayr Hospital since . For me it is such a big thing. We have to have a sight of what the final result will be.” The chosen hospital would undergo an upgrade to host the cancer unit. A paper presented to the board said it was proposed: “NHS Ayrshire  Arran would have one cancer unit and should seek to determine optimal provision of outreach services as appropriate.” The proposed West of Scotland service model was endorsed by the board.

Alexander MacKenzie, , of Galloway Avenue in Ayr, was caught with a sick collection of illegal material involving animals and others showing children thought to be as young as one-year old. Police discovered the sick creep had a total of approximately  images. One involved two women and a black dog. And images displayed naked kids – the youngest aged between one and three. Ayr Sherf Court heard at an earlier hearing that police carried out a search on September  last year and uncovered a USB stick and HP computer terminal storing MacKenzie’s disgusting collection. Officers attended at the home MacKenzie shares with his elderly mother. She stated he was at work and told officers she only used the computer for online banking. His mum told officers that MacKenzie used the computer everyday – to go online, for Facebook and “something to do with animals”.  Mackenzie, who has a previous conviction, appeared at court last Wednesday for sentencing. Solicitor Chris Munro said: “This is something that has spiralled, causing him to possess the images. “It’s a fairly low volume of images. “This is a matter of possession rather than distribution. “He appreciates these are particularly serious matters and custody may be on your lordship’s mind. “He resides with his mother and Mr Mackenzie is her registered carer. “She clearly would face some problemsMr Mackenzie was sent to prison today. “He has a relatively close bond with his mother.” Sherf Desmond Leslie replied: “[I have] concerns with the previous conviction and the superficial appreciation of the disposal that was made at that time.”  Mr Munro replied: “There is clearly a risk here but that can be managed in the community.” Stepping back from custody, the Sherf imposed a y community payback order. The perv was sentenced to three years supervision and as a requirement must attend the Moving Forward Making Changes programme. He was tagged for nine months where he must remain in his home address from pm - am. And he was also placed on the sex offenders’ register for five years. MacKenzie pled guilty to being in possession of a quantity of extreme pornographic images depicting in an explicit and realistic way bestiality between adults and animals between June ,  and September , . He also admitted having in his possession indecent photos or pseudo-photos of children from June ,  and September , .

However, when the fall of communism led to the break-up of Yugoslavia, war came to Bosnia in , driven in part by Serbiarsquos desire to create a lsquoGreater Serbiarsquo, including large parts of Bosnia, from which they planned to remove Croats and Muslims in what became known as lsquoethnic cleansingrsquo.Our delegation leader Resad Trbonja was , living in Sarajevo. On April , , he woke to find his city under siege, surrounded by Serbian artillery and snipers on the mountains overlooking the city. The siege would last four years, the longest in modern warfare, longer than Stalingrad. An average of  mortars landed in the city every day, , on the worst day.Resad, who lived through, and fought in, the siege, explained that Sarajevo regressed two centuries overnight ndash no water, no electricity, no phones. The Serbian army allowed minimal UN aid into the city sporadically but nothing .The survival of the siege is a story of human courage, spirit and defiance.Our first visit was to the remnants of a tunnel, dug under Sarajevo airport to reach Bosnian-held territory on the other side. This tiny tunnel was the only way in or out for four years.Through this tunnel extra aid came, for example from Edinburgh Direct Aid, who drove lorries of supplies from Edinburgh to help Sarajevans. My own predecessor, John Home Robertson, then MPfor East Lothian, spent several Parliamentary recesses as a volunteer lorry driver. It was dangerous work and one of his colleagues died on the notorious road known as lsquoSnipers Alleyrsquo.Perhaps the most affecting visit in Sarajevo was to the War Childhood Museum, where those who grew up in the siege display the things they kept to remind them of what it was like, and tell their story.A homemade cardboard knightrsquos breastplate made by a brother who later died a cuddly toy from a UN delivery, cuddled threadbare because it was the only toy a homemade lsquounormrsquo for a childrenrsquos choir which rehearsed and performed in defiance of bombs and bullets the remains of a playpark lsquojungle gymrsquo kept to remember the day a mortar tore it apart and killed your friend ndash no one who visits this museum will forget it.That is true too of Srebrenica. This was supposedly a lsquosafe havenrsquo protected by UN troops. Yet on July , Serbian paramilitary units overran it. Thousands of Bosnian Muslims sought refuge in the UN base at a disused factory.When we visited the museum now sited there, survivor Hasan Hasanovic explained to us how UN soldiers stood by as women and children were herded onto buses and deported, while their men were separated and removed in lorries. They were systematically murdered nearby. Thousands more who tried to escape through the forest were hunted down, shepherded into a meadow, and shot. In all, , Bosnian Muslim men and boys were slaughtered at Srebrenica.Finally, the international community acted. In a matter of days, air strikes lted the siege of Sarajevo, drove Serbian paramilitaries out of much of the territory they had occupied, and forced agreement to a peace deal signed in Dayton, Ohio.Srebrenica was not the only genocide in this war, but it is emblematic because it happened under the noses of the UN and because of the bravery of the Mothers of Srebrenica, who ed home to find out what happened to their husbands and sons, refused to be silenced, and demanded justice.This led to the International Commission on Missing Persons and the forensic anthropology unit in Tuzla, where we saw the incredible work done to identy remains using DNA. More than , victims of genocide have now been identied, allowing their families to grieve and to bury them at the final stop of our visit.We arrive at the cemetery at Potaceri, outside Srebrenica, as the sun sets. On the hillside, , stark white tombstones bring home the enormity of what was done over only a few days a mere  years or so ago.More than , died at Srebrenica , perished in Sarajevo , women suffered rape as an act of war millions fled their homes, some even finding their way to the refugee reception centre at Cheylesmore Lodge in North Berwick.All the survivors I met asked the same question: why did so much suffering have to happen before the international community acted to stop it  In telling us their story, they relived their own pain. They did so in the hope that we learn the lessons of Bosnia. We need only look at Syria or Yemen to know that we have not.That is why we must remember Srebrenica.If any local groups would like to hear more about the work of Remembering Srebrenica, please contact my office on  ."},{"url":null,"title":"the-best-fortnite-gifts-for-christmas-2018","story":"Fortnite is the most popular video game of the year and has taken over not just everyonersquos console, but Christmas lists up and down the country too.If you have family members, big or small, who are mad for Fortnite but find yourself utterly clueless as to what itrsquos all about or what to get someone who loves it for Christmas, we can help out with this guide to everything Fortnite from the game itself to presents you should buy this year.*On some occasions, we earn revenue from content.

are now in talks with Transport Scotland in a bid to seethey can claw back extra public funds.Bill Hocking, chief executive officer for construction and investments, Gallord Try, told MSPs: ldquoWe have put forward a claim to Transport Scotland in respect of some of the issues that have been faced in the project.He said those were linked to the poor weather which has hindered construction work, as well as delays from erting essential utility services.Stephen Tarr, managing director of the major projects ision at Balfour Beatty, added the claim submitted to Transport Scotland was ldquofor a not insignicant sum.How can the public have confidence in the #AWPR when it is delayed, over-budget and relations between the #SNP and contractor have fallen to a new low and claims are being made against the former  Utter shambles from the Scottish Government. pic NCRhLogqnmdash Jamie Greene MSPDecember , He told MSPs on the Scottish Parliamentrsquos Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee: ldquoWersquore in a situation as of today where the joint venture partners are hundreds of millions out of pocket as a consequence of the work wersquove been doing in Aberdeen.He was pressed on whether the claim amounted to tens of millions of pounds, or hundreds of millions of pounds.But he told the committee that was not something he wanted to reveal ldquobecause of the commercial nature of the discussions that we are having.North East Scotland Labour MSP Lewis Macdonald then asked him: ldquoIf I was to put to you that the total cost of the project is over pound billion you would accept that that is broadly correct Mr Tarr told him: ldquoYes, I think from what wersquove said you could deduce those are the areas of the cost.Work on the-mile road had been due to be completed in the spring of this year, after it was hit by delays.But further problems have seen the opening date pushed back, with contractors now hoping the final section of the roadway could be open before Christmas.Mr Tarr said the opening of the new road ldquowould have been delayed longer than it currently isthe two contractors had not taken mitigating measures.ldquoThere are signicant costs that run into the hundreds of millions, he said, adding these had contributed to the construction firm Carillion ndash which had also been involved in the AWPR project ndash becoming insolvent.Brian Love ofAberdeen Roads Ltdndash the consortium set up to carry out the work ndashstressed however that finishing the work before Christmas is ldquonot cast in stone as weather could delay the completion of a section of the road which crosses over the River Don.He stated: ldquoThe contractor is targeting a date prior to Christmas for the opening of the Don bridge, that construction programme is subject to many things, notably weather, so adverse weather could throw that out.However the Stonehaven to Craibstone section of the roadway should be open to traffic next week, the committee was told.Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said it had taken his intervention for this to happen, despite this stretch having been completed two months ago.He stated: ldquoI have explored every possible avenue with Aberdeen Roads Ltd to open this section of road as soon as possible and I am delighted my efforts to bring this matter to a positive conclusion have been successful.But he was also clear ministers were ldquosimply not willing to pay over the odds for the road on account of mistakes or miscalculations that are of the contractorsrsquo own making.He also said the ldquooptimistic programme to have the work completed before Christmas should be regarded ldquowith caution.ldquoAberdeen Roads Ltdhas said it aims to finish the bridge before Christmas but has also correctly warned the remaining works are complex, very weather sensitive and subject to safety and quality tests, Mr Matheson added.ldquoWe should therefore treat this optimistic programme with caution.He added the contract cost currently remains at pound million and would not clary the figure of the claim made by in addition to that by the contractors due to commercial confidentiality.Mr Matheson saidongoing discussions do not resolve the matter it could end up in court, but pledged to noty parliamentany additional costs to the taxpayer over pound million are incurred.Transport Scotland insisted afterwards it did ldquonot recognise the pound billion cost figure.A spokesman said: ldquoIt is not unusual for claims to be raised by a contractor on large complex infrastructure projects such as this one. Like most contracts of this nature, the AWPR contract contains a mechanism for dealing with claims.ldquoAs confirmed by the Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity, Transport Scotland and ARL have been engaged in dialogue to gain a better understand of the exact nature of ARLrsquos claim, however, ARL has yet to provide the evidence to substantiate any such claim. This process has not yet concluded, so we are not in a position to provide further details.ldquoHowever, ARL spent two years in dialogue bidding for the project where the risks associated with it were known and this did not deter it from bidding for and winning the contract for this major public infrastructure project."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/9137064.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"boy-so-overwhelmed-he-crawls-away-from-meeting-with-queen","story":"Eight-year-old Nathan was introduced to the Queen as part of her visit to Coram, the UKrsquos oldest childrenrsquos charity.Based at the site of The Foundling Hospital in London, Coram has been helping vulnerable children since it gained the Royal Charter in .The Queen visited the charity to open The Queen Elizabeth II Centre ndash a national centre for children named in her honour.

Within the next two years that will rise to  for everybody, with both the Labour and Coalition governments agreeing down the years that such changes are necessary to help deal with the burden of an ageing population.The arguments in favour of the move are sound. When the first state pension was introduced over a century ago, the cost of providing it was relatively small, with just one in four people living long enough to receive it and those that did generally only surviving a further nine years once theyrsquod started to draw it. Fast forward to  and le expectancy is so high that women in particular can easily expect to live at least  years in retirement, with the cost of providing the state pension expected to balloon from pound billion a year at the moment to poundbn in the s. As the bill for state pensions is met out of current year taxation, the intergenerational impact of that will be immense. Anything that can reduce that burden while also removing a rare historical inequality that favoured women over men is to be welcomed.Yet while the change will affect all working women in the long run, it is only those born in the s that are really feeling its impact. Indeed, while phasing was deemed the fairest way to effect the increase to , it has meant that while a woman born in April  could retire at ,she had been born three years later she would have had to wait until she was . Not only that, but with legislation passed in  speeding up the rate at which equalisation was achieved while also raising the overall state pension age to , a woman born in December  has seen her own retirement date sht first from December  to September  and then on to December .No wonder the affected women are irate, with campaign groups such as Women Against State Pension Inequalityand Backto accusing the Government of robbing them of their retirement dues. Yet while Backto last week won the right to challenge how the Government handled the increases in the courts, it seems unlikely that they will achieve their ultimate goal of having the pension-age increases reversed.Nor should they, particularly when the arguments being put forward by the women are taken into account. While at first the s women claimed their pension age should not be raised because they had not been given adequate time to prepare for the change, more recently they have argued that everything from career breaks to pay inequality make them entitled to earlier and longer payments than men.Their points about historical inequalities are are certainly valid. Thanks to huge societal shts in the past few decades we are getting to a position where women - and men - can just about have it all. Indeed, with men taking on an ever-greater share of household responsibilities, women have been freed up to pursue their career ambitions and that in turn has enabled men to enjoy a better work-le balance. That is to everyonersquos benefit.Yet, as gender pay gap statistics show, the near-equality that so many of us enjoy in the home is not being reflected in the workplace, with men continuing to dominate the most lucrative senior positions while women in general continue to fill lower-paid ones. Not only does that put women at a financial disadvantage when it comes to saving for their own retirements, it also means their careers suffer when there is a child or elderly relative to be cared for: regardless of how committed we are to achieving gender equality, household economics will almost always dictate that the lower salary is the one worth being partly sacriced. That in turn reduces the amount that women can channel into a private or workplace pension, exacerbating the long-term gender pay gap and reinforcing gender stereotypes in the process.But these are problems that affect women entering the workforce just as much as those preparing to leave it and, unless something drastic is done - and fast - they will inevitably go on to impact the working lives of the girls yet to begin their working lives too. Crucially, these are not problems that the state pension - a benefit designed to provide everyone with the same foundation income in retirement, regardless of their other means - can, or should, be used to solve.Yes, the Government has a role to play in helping eradicate inequality, and it must be held to account for that. But reversing for some of us a policy that is supposed to make things fairer for all of us is not the way to do it."},{"url":null,"title":"joanna-cherry-why-we-must-know-if-mps-have-the-power-to-revoke-article-50","story":"We expect the case to establish as a matter of legal certainty that Brexit may be stopped by the UK revoking the Article  notice.The fact that the UK Government has fought this case tooth and nail at considerable expense shows how desperate the PM is to prevent MPs having this certainty.:ECJ Advocate General says UK can revoke Article  unilaterallyThe question matters because when MPs vote on whether to raty the Withdrawal Agreement, a vote against ratication could result in a no-deal exit unless there is an alternative.When he referred the case to Luxembourg, Scotlandrsquos top judge said: ldquoThe answer will have the effect of clarying the options open to MPshellip..Whatever the interest of MSPs and MEPs, MPs have an interest in seeing the matter resolved.\"On that basis the petition is competent at least at the instance of an MP.The case was heard by the Grand Chamber of the Court comprising  judges.Extraordinarily counsel for the UK Government refused to take a position on whether revocation is possible and argued only that the case was inadmissible.:Scotlands Brexit legal bid explained as European court to hear Article  challengeNormally where a partyrsquos primary position is that the court should not entertain the question, a fall-back position would be advanced.Instead the UK government invited the court not to open up a Pandorarsquos box.

This includes up to eight hours of debate on December , ,  and  - with the votes expected on December . Amendments have been tabled by two Labour MPs to extend the time for debate.- What are they debating The Withdrawal Agreement negotiated by the Government, which outlines the terms on which the UK will leave the EU and the desired future relationship. MPs are being asked to approve this by supporting a motion tabled by the Prime Minister.- Can MPs change what has been put forward Yes. Speaker John Bercow can select up to six amendments which MPs can then vote on.- What are the amendments Various amendments have been tabled. Labours official proposal would decline to approve Mrs Mays Brexit deal and explains this is because it fails to provide for a permanent UK-EU customs union and \"strong\" single market deal.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned. David calls himself a jazz film-maker and doesnt really like to spend too much time planning it all out. Its very much part of his style.\"Jims mother, Beryl, still lives in Thurso and said she is \"immensely proud\" of her sons achievements.Wednesday  Dec  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"December ,  at : amThere#s still time left to sign up to the second annual Santa Fun Run and Walk.

Golspie is operational   three days a week.\"The writer states that the letter represents the feelings of paramedics and technicians in Easter Ross, and they are calling for six more staff to make Alness and Tain   and ldquogive the residents of Easter Ross a fighting chance in their hour of need\".The Scottish Ambulance Service hit back however. A spokesman said: ldquoThe claims are untrue. We have ambulances working a   sht at Dingwall, Golspie, Lairg, Wick and Thurso ndash a crew is also available at either Tain or Alness stations and often both at the same time, depending on sht patterns.ldquoPatients in this part of Scotland can also rely on the air ambulance helicopter, a team of emergency response doctors based in Tain, Dornoch and Dingwall, and our teams of community first responders to provide an emergency response within a matter of minutes.ldquoWe closely and continuously monitor our staffing levels, through our demand and capacity review, to ensure we can provide safe patient care in all parts of Scotland and continue to invest in our workforce.Contacted for comment, Highlands and Islands Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said: ldquoStaff have raised concerns with me which I in turn have raised with the ambulance service. I believe that we do require more ambulance resources throughout the Highlands and Islands.ldquoCrews have to travel long distances to transfer patients and with specialist services becoming more centralised that will only increase.ldquoIt is right that crews who are fatigued sign off and ideally we should have more stations covered without the use of on call staff, who are in greater danger of becoming fatiguedthey have already undertaken a long transfer.ldquoI know from SAS that they are using Inverness crews to do some of these transfers where that is clinically safe.ldquoObviously in an emergency the nearest crew must respond. Sadly the whole of our public sector is suffering from the impact of funding cuts and we must now end austerity and fund the le line services that our people need.Share your views by emailing us at newsdesk@spp-groupWednesday  Dec  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It is best not to talk about the creatures of the night, and how we engage with them, other than with one’s psychoanalyst and, at a push, one’s more tolerant friends. The absurd world of dreams is neither here nor there – which is why the memory of our dreams fades very fast. Of course, there are exceptions. The dream recounted by Freud’s Wolf Man still makes for entertaining reading, and any dream we have of seven fat cows and seven thin ones should be perhaps be mentioned – just in case. But, in general, dreams are a private inconsequential business best kept to oneself.So, it is with considerable hesitation that I mention the dream I had last night. It is, I think, a dream that others might have had. It could be, in a Jungian sense, a manestation of some collective unconscious. That is perfectly possible, indeed probable. Having reiterated the self-denying ordinance of not revealing dreams, I hesitantly write about it here, knowing that not many people read my column anyway, and so this is virtually a private reflection.In my dream I was in Brussels. How did I know that  Well, the dream was preceded by one of those images that they use in film to signy location. A London scene is usually preceded by an image of Big Ben, or possibly Trafalgar Square. Passing double-decker buses may remind the dozier members of the audience of the milieu to which they are being transported. Paris is easy: the Efel Tower is spotted in the distance and there is French accordion music. But Brussels  In my dream there was a large road sign that said Bruxelles. That made the location of what followed quite clear.It being a continental dream, there was a pavement café. I looked for a table, but could find none and was about to turn around when the waiter summoned me to offer a seat at a table where a large woman in a voluminous blue dress was already seated. In the normal – or the normally abnormal – dream, Freudians would unhesitatingly tell you that this figure is your mother. Of course it is. Except in my dream it became immediately clear that she was in fact Europa, we of no less a personage than Zeus. We do not hear much from Europa these days, but she is there, deep in our mythic consciousness, often riding on a white bull. Every so often she surfaces.: Alexander McCall Smith: Should there be second referendums on Brexit and independence Europa was very welcoming, and offered to buy me a cup of coffee. I asked for decaffeinated and she said that this would be perfectly possible. I should not think of her as a threat, she said. If you want decaffeinated coffee, you can have it. But then she added, “But you must have coffee.”I was a bit taken aback by this. Could one not sit at her table and not drink coffee  No, she said. That is not possible. That is a fundamental demand. My coffee arrived. It was delicious. “There,” she said. “See.”Now I must add another detail. It is not important, but it did give texture to the dream. Dreams with texture are generally better than those without. In this case, the texture-conferring detail was this: Europa looked terribly like Mrs Merkel! That, I think, is purely co-incidental, and would be of no interest even to the most symbol-sensitive dream analyst. There are plenty of women who look like Mrs Merkel. Some people even have mothers who look like her. As I sat there with Europa, I felt a certain sense of embarrassment creep over me.“I must say how sorry I am about all this business,” I said. “You do know, don’t you, that Scotland behaved dferently ”She nodded. “I’ve heard as much,” she said.“And I wouldn’t want you to think that Scots voted that way largely because we rather enjoy voting the opposite way from that in which the Government in Westminster tells us to vote.”Europa smiled. “Of course not!” And then added, “Perish the thought!”“I liked the coffee,” I said.She smiled again. “Good. And please don’t feel in any way awkward. No damage done. Or not too much. You’re going to vote again, you see.”I thought I should clary the situation. “You mean a general election ”“Oh no,” said Europa. “Another referendum. You’ll vote again and voilà, a dferent result. You can’t leave, you see. Look at history. The consolidation of states prevents that. Germany used to be a whole lot of little entities, as did Italy, France and so on. Look what happened to the kingdom of my son, Minos. Existing countries become passé. That’s what’s happening here, you know. We are witnessing the creation of a new state. And every such creation involves birth pangs, and one or two protests. We’re feeling those at present, but everything will be all right. Reason will prevail.”“Are you sure ” I asked. “Perfectly,” she said. “You’ll see.”I have no idea of the meaning of this dream. Even as I write about it, its memory fades. I mentioned it, though, to a friend.

He’s already made the move from playing rugby to acting with a role in the latest season of Outlander, and now he’s moving ahead of the pack with a new Bollywood film, Shamshera. Right now he’s on the phone minutes after his flight from Mumbai lands, catching a connection to Scotland where he is due for a bout of fight training for his latest role.“SorryI sound a bit tired and jetlagged.” He doesn’t, in fact. He sounds on a high after a week of meetings and rehearsals for the action adventure film, walking and talking  to the dozen in his warm Paisley tones as he cuts a swathe through the airport, all sculpted beard, Matchless leather jacket and jeans. In four short years, he’s made the move from working as a sports consultant to acting in films, this latest being made by Bollywood giants Yash Raj Films. Directed by Karan Malhotra, Shamshera stars Ranbir Kapoor, Sanjay Dutt and Vaani Kapoor as well as McGinlay playing the lead villain.“It’s been a bit of a whirlwind in Mumbai,” he says. “I’ve never been there before and I’m just getting used to it. I’m back for a week here, then back to India and we’re filming until July.”We’ll catch him while we can, when he’s back for a bit of dreich weather to cool him down after the heat of India.“I like dreich-ness,” he says, “the fresh air.” He’s upbeat and positive and why wouldn’t he be  He’s running with the ball, taking his chances without getting ahead of himself. With his muscular physique he’s action hero villain material and has played both so far, honing his sword skills and horsemanship as well as his acting. Guy Ritchie cast him as good guy Sir Percival in last year’s King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, which starred Jude Law and Charlie Hunnam. Then he nailed lead villain Aldred in Knightfall, a historical drama about the Knights Templar on the History Channel alongside Tom Cullen. He packs a punch too in the season two opener of the Edinburgh-filmed BBC  student thriller Clique, before playing a baddie again in Outlander. “I play a horrible guy called MacNeil and the army of Outlander fans on Twitter have been at me over it,” he laughs. “No, there’s been a lot of positive feedback. I never really thought I was gonna play villains because I always loved watching Superman and James Bond and I thought action hero roles were for me. And I do still want to do those, but the latest three have been villains, so it’s nice to do that too.“This is my first Bollywood film and I didn’t know much about it,” he says. “But I do now. Bollywood just gets bigger and bigger and bigger. It was daunting, but it’s been amazing. I’ve worked on big sets – King Arthur and Outlander were massive – but I’ve been blown away by this. There are  people on the sets in India just now, building forts, castles, docks, caves, it’s incredible.” McGinlay didn’t expect to break into the Bollywood market, but after Guy Ritchie finished King Arthur, he moved on to making Aladdin, using a lot of Bollywood actors and the same casting director who was working on Shamshera.“There was that initial connection: it’s a small world,” says McGinlay, who knows to take his chances when he can, and put in the hard work when he is given an opportunity. “I’m playing a British soldier and I’ve been doing screen tests, rehearsals, stunt work with horses and fitness and soldier training. “And I’m doing some fight training now with Seoras Wallace who did the fight choreography on Braveheart, Gladiator and Highlander. I’m also working with my friend Roger Gracie Gomes, who is a Brazilian jiu-jitsu fighter. So it’s a real adrenalin rush movie, it’s going to be fun.”But McGinlay is not all action and no words – in fact he’s learning Hindi for the part, something a bit dferent to go alongside his swashbuckling skill set.“I speak a little bit of Hindi in this so I’ve been doing intensive language training. I would never have thought I would be learning another language for a movie any time soon, but I’m really excited about the challenge and enjoying it so far.” Not that he’s been out and about in the sprawl of Mumbai to practise his vocabulary. With a schedule that consists of am pick-ups and full studio days of rehearsals, Hindi training, screen tests, costume fittings and horse riding, he’s hardly been out of the studio.“I’ve only been out to go to meetings and do muay thai training at Soho House, although that has phenomenal views of the beach! Once we start shooting I’ll be there for a long time, so maybe I’ll get to walk along it.” Among the on-set discussions has been the question of McGinlay’s appearance, from hair colour to moustache, beard or no beard. “They’re trying dferent looks, dferent hair colouring, moustache, no moustache. We’ll see. If a director wants something, I give it a go, whether it’s having a moustache or dferent hair colour or having to go skinny or bulk up, learn a language… The exciting thing for me is the challenge of trying to become the character.”The grooming issue is something McGinlay has been brushing up on since he started acting and did a bit of modelling too. He picked up Breakthrough Star of the Year at the  Scottish Style Awards and was named as British GQ Rising Star last year, requiring him to get red carpet ready.“It’s all a bit of a change for me from shorts, T-shirts and trainers, which is what I wore before. It’s a bit of a learning curve,” he laughs.Shamshera won’t be released until , but McGinlay is on our screens at the moment in Outlander, season four of the Starz and Amazon Prime International hit which features Sam Heughan and Caitriona Balfe. Based on Diana Gabaldon’s historical time travel novels following the adventures of Jacobite Highlander Jamie Fraser and Second World War nurse Claire Randall, the new series sees them building a le in th century America. It’s a time of slavery and colonisers encountering Native Americans, with Scotland doubling as North Carolina. McGinlay plays Andrew MacNeil, a Scot who leads a racist mob. “He’s not a nice guy – a horrible character and a horrible situation. I thought Outlander dealt with the slavery issue very well, and these issues should be raised. It was a tough episode to film and it hit home how bad that situation was. There were a couple of people crying on set, and you do feel emotion. The hairs were standing up on the back of my neck.“Because there’s a massive Outlander fan base you want to do these characters justice, but I was such a small part of this beast of a machine that is Outlander. It was amazing to be part of it.”McGinlay was pleased to be involved not least because he sees the “Outlander effect” as building momentum for the establishment of a Scottish film studio. “Outlander is sparking ripples throughout Scotland. You see it at the Baftas, in the press, all the talk of building a film studio. It would be a massive positive because there are so many talented, passionate people in the industry here who are just dying to get in there – we could do some good stuff.”Now  and based in London, McGinlay is modest about his success so far, although ambitious to make the most of the opportunities that come his way.“I’m still new to acting and I’m learning all the time,” he says. “I wasn’t sure how some actors might take it, because I’m not trained in acting and I’ve obviously moved quite quickly within the last two and a half years. It’s early stages…” One of the actors whose path he has crossed is fellow Paisley Buddy Gerry Butler, who he first met at a film festival last year in Ischia, Italy. “I’ve only met him two or three times, so don’t know him well, but he’s been really kind, given me some good advice and introduced me to a couple of people. And obviously the guy’s from Paisley, and doing really, really well, has an amazing career.”At one time McGinlay was destined for a rugby career, playing for the national under-s team in the World Cup, but was forced out by injury in . “I dislocated my shoulder playing in a World Cup in Italy and had two operations. I could probably have come back and played as it doesn’t cause me any hassle now. I liked the game, but I probably didn’t love it enough.” Determined to stay in sport, McGinlay did a sports science and physiology degree at the University of Stirling and after graduating started working with professional athletes. Setting up his own consultancy, he worked with professional footballers and rugby players, focusing on general fitness and doing sports massage. He trained athletes for the  Delhi,  London and  Commonwealth Games, working with the hockey, badminton, swimming, cycling, weightlting teams. “Then they took the ones I was working with to make an advert for the Games and said the weightlter was a little bit too short, would I step in  Why not  I had to pull on this tiny one-piece weightlting outfit and was out in the cold by the Squinty Bridge [in Glasgow] with everyone looking, thinking, ‘What is this idiot doing, lting a bar above his head’, doing a clean jerk.” He laughs. “Anyway, the ad came out and randomly a director saw it and I got a lead role in a short film that randomly won best thriller in LA and Calgary so I went out for the premiere. It wasn’t Hollywood or anything, but it was a great experience and I hadn’t done anything like that before. I loved it.” Back home in Glasgow, McGinlay signed up with an extras agency and did a couple of adverts, one being for the Haig Club whisky, starring the brand collaborator David Beckham and the stunning Scottish landscape, directed by Guy Ritchie. “It was just five days’ shooting, but I got to know Guy quite well and that was a turning point for me. I was standing in Glencoe looking down at Guy behind the monitor and [cinematographer] John Mathieson behind the camera and [film pilot] Marc Wolff taking shots of Beckham riding his motorbike up Glencoe, and that was it for me. So many great movies were made there, like Skyfall, and it felt so cinematic, although it was an advert. I decided: when I come off this I’m gonna go back, quit my job, move to London at least give it a go. If it doesn’t work out, then, you know, it’s not worked out…”But it did work out: within four months McGinlay had an agent, auditioned for Ritchie’s King Arthur and landed the part of Sir Percival. “It was very hard to give up my job because it was going well and I did love it, but I can always go back. I wanted to keep going with the wave, having done the advert, met Guy, wanted to keep the pace going and move to London. So that was another turning point: I moved down and did King Arthur, then got Knightfall.” With Chris Pine famously watching Scottish rugby captains on YouTube to prepare for his role of Robert the Bruce in Outlaw King, McGinlay has the advantage, being the real McGinlay and able to jink the middle man. For him, the worlds of rugby and acting are not so far apart. “There are similarities, things like bulking up and getting fit and ‘in the zone’. How I prepared in the dressing room as a rugby player is still how I build up for a fight scene or any kind of fight choreography. You pump yourself up for it. Outlander was the same, marching at the head of a mob, you’ve got to get yourself into a zone and turn yourself into a dferent character. “Running out onto a sports field you have to play a character a bit as well. You’ve got to make that last tackle, be aggressive, stand up for yourself. Rugby’s about teamwork and it’s the same in acting – costume, hair, make-up, director, producer, writer, everyone’s trying to do their best.”As someone who never seems to stand stillit’s time for McGinlay to catch his next flight. “I’m not in any way there or where I want to be yet. It’s very early stages. I’m still massively learning. I’ve had a few good short film roles, three good roles in three big productions so far and this is the fourth one now, so it’s going well, but I’m still way, way short of where I want to be. “I’ve not made it or anything. I still have a long, long way to go and I’m very ambitious. If I quit my job to move into this, then I’m not in it for a laugh, I’m in it to go as far as I can.” Craig McGinlay can currently be seen in Season  of Outlander, available to watch now on Amazon Prime.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It has taken many years to reach this pointand is much needed.I wonder what,any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building  If you do have some proof to justy your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion George DicksonI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisationof a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in dferent buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep itfor the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.I also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last  years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.Some parents and staff have had a look through the new building at dferent stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability..."},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"Marc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

This motion was agreed. earlier this week, the chair of the EDI committee, Councillor Allan Henderson said that the council was putting pressure on the Scottish Government to have the route classed as a trunk road. However, during Thursday’s meeting Councillor Cockburn was quick to dismiss the likelihood of this happening: “Who in their right mind would take  miles of the worst road in the Highlands” He said. “After six and a half years we still only have two options… and the delays and the consequences for the wider community have been absolutely shocking.”The SNP member for Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh also went on to question the tendering process behind the work at the bypass, saying: “Was it necessary to shut the road during the day  I believe there was a tender on the table that would have allowed the road to open during the day.”He went on to argue that the council needed to release money straight away to enable design work on the replacement options for the current bypass to begin, adding that it was a matter of urgency due to the risks identied in the  annual sloping report which detailed four very high-risk rock slopes at the Stromeferry bypass.In response to Councillor Cockburn, the council’s head of infrastructure Colin Howell said that the council did receive an alternative tender from a contractor who said they could carry out the required works at night, however, Mr Howell said the cost was signicant and due to concerns about these plans it was decided it would be wise for some of the work to be undertaken during the day.Mr Howell said that while there were ongoing issues with rockfalls and managing slopes, he believed that the council had done a good job. He went on to add that the council were prioritising the high-risk slopes and currently working on the cost and details in relation to stabilising those areas which would be delivered at the next EDI committee meeting. He added that there were “three optimum solutions” in respect to replacement options and said that the committee had “decided to leave those three on the table# and seek dialogue with Scottish Government for funding. He said: “The administration is looking for feedback, we are working on slopes with high risks and will come back to the next EDI with the costing.”Councillor Derek MacLeod described the current situation as “one episode in a long, long history of problems with the route#, and in contrast to his fellow ward member, Councillor Cockburn, he argued that the route should be “trunked between Auchtertyre and Garve” as he believed it to be strategic in linking the ferry points of Uig and UllapoolCouncil Leader Margaret Davidson told the committee that she would be meeting with the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson and would report back “what options have been put on the table.” Councillor Davidson said that the council were “acutely aware of what’s needed” and were working towards a long-term sustainable option for Stromeferry.

Sinn Féin’s lead in boycotting the Assembly was followed by the SDLP for fear of losing further support to republicans. The Fine Gael Labour Government, led by Garret FitzGerald, set up the New Ireland Forum in Dublin mainly as a  for the SDLP. In June , the political establishment in Ireland and Britain was rocked by the election of Sinn Féin Vice-President Gerry Adams as MP for his native west Belfast. For long a leading republican activist, Adams advocated the deeper politicisation and popularisation of the republican struggle and the building of Sinn Féin across the  Counties.The British Tory government of Margaret Thatcher was also concerned at the rise of Sinn Féin. In the week before the Ard Fheis in November , Prior told Tory MPs that Ireland could become a “Cuba off Britain’s west coast”. He said he feared Sinn Féin could overtake the SDLP electorally and “we must do all we can to strengthen constitutional nationalism”. When the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis gathered in the Mansion House in Dublin on  and  November, it was set to elect a new leadership. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh had been president since  and he announced that he would not be seeking re-election. He said the four-province federal Ireland plan, of which he had been a strong advocate, had been rejected at the  Ard Fheis and his approach on other issues, including electoral strategy, had been rejected by the Ard Chomhairle.In his address, the new party president, Gerry Adams, dismissed media claims of a ‘Northern takeover’ and said:“We are not a Northern, nor a Southern party – we are an Irish republican party organised throughout Ireland.”The main theme of his speech was the need for republicans to break out of political isolation and “get among the people in the basic ways which the people accept”. In line with this approach, the Ard Fheis voted to contest European Parliament elections with the intention of taking seatsthey were won. This followed the expansion of party electoral strategy the previous year. The Ard Fheis coincided with a by-election campaign for the Dáil seat of Dublin Central, which was contested by Sinn Féin candidate Christy Burke, turning in a creditable performance. There was further controversy after the Ard Fheis, and discomfort for Fianna Fáil leaders in particular, when Gerry Adams was confirmed as the main speaker at the annual Kilmichael commemoration in west Cork. Gerry Adams was elected president of Sinn Féin at the Ard Fheis of November ,  years ago.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27495  ","story":" Robbie SmythOver the last  years Irishsociety has evolved and transformed in many ways.

Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from - years previously, when he was travelling to deliver a speech.Dimitrios told his taxi driver what he was planning to say at the meeting.The taxi man replied:“Remember, you are a politician, not a prophet. Do not promise me things it will take  years to achieve. Make change for me tomorrow.”Dimitrios immediately decided to change his speech. He learned a lesson that day from the taxi driver which has stayed with him ever since.Theories or notions, and even visions for changeremain just that unless they can translate into concrete change in society.People want change which makes a material dference in their lives for them and their families.And thats how it should be.Fair wages high quality education and health services free at the point of delivery and a clean sustainable environment should not be dreams. They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential

Two other posts - at Clady and Strabane in Co Tyrone - were also to have been demolished that night but the bombs to be used exploded prematurely, killing three Volunteers at Stranamuck, near Castlefin, Co Donegal.Comdt John James Kelly and Staff Capt James Joseph Reynolds were killed instantly and Comdt Charles McCafferty died a few days later in Lford Hospital.The three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof. The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady. He took part in many operations during the Tan War and was arrested and imprisoned in England. On hishe took the Republican side in the Civil War and saw action against the Free Staters.John James Kelly was a man of the left - he spoke often to his son about Lenin. In the s and s, because of his Republican views, he found it dficult to make a living but he remained in the IRA and was elected to its Executive Council. He was  years old when he died.CharlieMcCafferty was OC of the IRAs st Tir Conaill Battalionat the time of his death. He was born in  and he too joined the IRA at a young age. In  he was arrested and sentenced to six months in Derry Prison for possession of firearms. He worked as a barge loader on the Strabane-Derry Canal and he was known as a quiet man with an abiding interest in the history and folklore of his area.Jimmy Joe Reynolds was from Leitrim. He was the OC in that county and had been for a time OC of Britain. He had been sent to Donegal as the representative of the IRAs General Headquarters Staff and it was he who transported the bombs - three in all - to Stranamuck.Jimmy Joe had been active in the IRA for many years. In  he was charged along with six other men, including his twin brother, John Joseph, with the assassination of a rack-renting landlord, More OFarrell, at Edgeworthstown, Co Longford. After two trials the case was dismissed and there were bonfires for fty miles around to celebrate their escape from the Free State hangman.All three Volunteers received huge funerals with full IRA honours. They were buried eighty years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27501  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna“We already have all-island teams that demonstrate that we can achieve great success when we work on an all-island basis.

It has even been shared on Australian media. The lighting show will continue to run at pm, pm and pm every day until January  in effort to enhance community spirit and lure shoppers into the city. Dungannon has opted for a more traditional approach to herald in the festive season proving you dont always need to branch out to impress. Leafy plants have been carefully pruned to create an angelic atmosphere around the slimline tree, which has been beautully wrapped with thousands of tiny bulbs. Theyve even added wings of light and a halo to a carefully crafted tree as an angel looks out across the Co Tyrone town. Cookstown remains as impressive as ever with trees lining the longest and widest main street in Ireland.Elsewhere its the usual set-up, but not everyone has been left feeling the festive spirit - the Christmas tree in Castledawson has caused local residents to scowl at the scraggly structure which is tangled up in a few dozen lights and baubles. \"This sorry sight is a laughing stock around the town and beyond,\" one local man wrote on social media, and it follows last years spectacle which was also branded \"embarrassing\".

BelfastBrexit survey: Have your say and you could win a £ Amazon voucher UUP leader Robin Swann said his party was prepared to look at all the alternatives to Theresa Mays \"unacceptable\" current deal but he stressed that any solution must be \"UK-wide\".Sinn Fein said the DUP couldnt negotiate their own agreement and there already was a Brexit deal on the table. NI boss is called ‘Tory cow’ for May support Speaking to BBC Radio s Today programme yesterday, Mrs Foster said she would not support calls for a second Brexit referendum, as the UK had already voted to leave and \"we respect that\". Repeating the DUPs opposition to Mrs Mays deal, she urged the Prime Minister to \"not waste time\" on it and instead look for a better solution to the border question.She hinted thatthe current Withdrawal Agreement failed to get through the House of Commons, her party could be open to a Norway plus style arrangement, where the whole of the UK stayed in the customs union until an agreement with the EU is reached on future trading relations. Would membership of the EEA work  Ms Foster said the DUPs \"one red line\" was to make sure Northern Ireland was not dferentiated from the rest of the UK in terms of customs and was \"not prescriptive\" about other potential options on the future relationship with the EU.But a Norway plus-style arrangement has been rejected by the TUV leader.Mr Allister told the Belfast : \"It would retain us fully within the EU single market, subject to all Brussels-made rules - adjudicated by the European Court of Justice - and maintain free movement of labour and require ongoing payments to the EU. That is not Brexit. Brexit: Ulster Farmers Union remain amenable to alternate Withdrawal Agreement proposal \"But for us it would be worse, because the Norway plus that is being talked about would additionally keep Northern Ireland in the customs territory of the EU - completing the repudiation of the Brexit that was voted for. Thus, the backstop would essentially still apply.\"Mr Allister continued: \"The core of the backstop is that Northern Ireland alone remains part of the customs territory of the EU.\"With the EU likely to only agree a Norway-style deal which had this add-on, it would leave us incarcerated in the EU in perpetuity.\"The UUP did not appear to rule out a Norway plus style arrangement. Mr Swann said: \"The Ulster Unionist Party cannot give our support to the Withdrawal Agreement and its disastrous backstop. However, we will look at every option and assess its merits - but the bottom line for the Ulster Unionist Party is that any solution must be UK-wide in its entirety.\"Sinn Fein MLA Mairtin O Muilleoir said: \"There already is a deal on the table - its not perfect but it avoids physical infrastructure on the border.\"The DUP cannot negotiate their own deal. Nor can they back a deal that isnt there.\"The EU has recognised that a unique solution is needed for the north because of our historical and geographical concerns. The backstop recognises that - that must be maintained.\"Mrs Foster told Radio  that Mrs Mays deal would see Northern Ireland \"erge off from the United Kingdom\" and she urged the Prime Minister to \"look for a better deal\" that \"takes back control of our money, of our borders and of our laws\".The DUP leader said: \"All the things that made us vote for Brexit are the things that are going to be imposed on Northern Ireland.\"Reiterating that the DUPs  MPs would not back the Withdrawal Agreement on December , Mrs Foster said it would create a \"huge democratic deficit\" in Northern Ireland.Mrs May yesterday rejected a suggestion that the failure to get a deal with the EU would see the UK stuck with the Northern Ireland backstop plan permanently.She was responding to Andrew Murrison, the Tory MP and chair of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, who compared it to a \"post-war pre-fab\".He said: \"Its sold as temporary, its built to last, and its likely to outlive us all.\"However, the PM dismissed his comments and told the House of Commons Liaison Committee it would only ever be a temporary solution.She added: \"Neither side thinks the backstop is a good place to be.\"Mrs May admitted that it would not be possible for the UK to unilaterally withdraw from it, though. But she said this was a guarantee to the people of Northern Ireland there would never be a hard border in place.Mrs May also rejected the claim that passing her Brexit deal in Parliament without the DUPs support would lead to the end of her partnership with Mrs Fosters party.\"Actually, the DUP have themselves said that the confidence-and-supply agreement remains in place,\" she stated.Mrs May refused to be drawn on what would happenMPs down the Withdrawal Agreement. But she insisted a second referendum was not an option as it could not be held before March ,  when Britain leaves the EU."},{"url":null,"title":"ten of the uks favourite tweets of","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The latter opened last year at a cost of poundm.ldquoSuch facilities are important in the provision of sport and recreation, especially to young people who are just starting out in their sporting activities, the council chairman continued.ldquoFacilities like the Down Leisure Centre provide a gathering place around which social activities occur. They provide a sense of pride of place and belonging that can add value to community and indeed the entire district.ldquoThe council is committed that all people in Newry, Mourne and Down enjoy good health and wellbeing via the districtrsquos community plan and that the lsquoBe Activersquo campaign is a superb way to help support this outcome.Cllr Murnin added: ldquoA healthy and active lestyle contributes positively to physical, mental and social wellbeing and as an organisation we want to encourage all our citizens to be active every day.Council officials are delighted with the new centre and the initial reaction of the public to date.One of the key features is the teaching pool which will allow the new centre to provide more swimming classes and education training for teachers, allowing full access to the main pool for other swimmers.Mains gas has also been connected to the new multi-million pound building which also boasts a combined heat and power source, helping minimise its carbon footprint. Photovoltaic cells which have been fitted on the roof help heat the water in the pools and shower systems across a number of changing room areas.In addition, air source heat pumps sucks in cold air from the outside and turns it into warm air, while so-called ocalux glass allows natural light to stream into the building, with everyone associated with the new centre, from the designers to builders and the councillors who supported it financially, delighted at the opening of a new chapter in the history of local leisure provision..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygalget on the ball helping families dealing with dementia  ","story":"BALLYGALGET GAC has been recognised for its effort in helping people who live with dementia in an award ceremony recently.John Mitchelrsquos GAC received the award after teaming up with the Alzheimerrsquos Society to become the first GAA club to take on the Dementia Friendly programme.This award recognises the work members do to ensure everyone affected with dementia in their parish and beyond gets the support they need.Brendan Birt, a spokesperson for the club, explained that the club had been crossing every cultural and religious ide since it was founded in .He said that in that time the club had attended to the needs of everyone who live in what is a very rural part of the Ards Peninsula.ldquoWe are delighted to win this award in recognition of the work that has been done by our club and in the community, he remarked.ldquoThe first initiative of our new award-winning health and wellbeing centre was to become a dementia friendly community. We already have  trained dementia friends and that is growing.ldquoAs the first GAA club, we wanted to get involved because of the many people within our community who are living with dementia. This has raised the profile and understanding of dementia within our club and parish.Although this project is in its infancy, two dementia friendly community workshops have already been delivered creating  dementia friends, not only in Ballygalget but in the surrounding areas too.Future plans include extending the dementia friends initiative to two neighbouring GAA clubs and to hold a workshop in the local primary school.Bernadine McCrory, Country Director for Alzheimerrsquos Society, said: ldquoIt is amazing that John Mitchelrsquos GAC has won the Championing Diversity award and it is a testament to their tremendous work they do.ldquoThe level of nominations received this year was truly phenomenal and there were some exceptional stories heard at the awards ceremony.ldquoWe want everyone affected by dementia to know that whoever you are, whatever you are going through, you can turn to Alzheimerrsquos Society for support, help and advice.She added: ldquoAll the finalists and winners at the Dementia Friendly Awards have demonstrated how we can unite against dementia and support those affected by the condition..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch edge derby tie  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH secured an ugly derby win in front of a large home crowd and banished a few memories from the three defeats to Banbridge last season which cost them promotion.The home side were almost at full strength, with Peter Nelson at full back, Kyle McCall ing in the front row and Johnny McPhillips sprung from the bench in the second half. Conor Kelly was the only signicant absentee, with Richard Reaney taking his place on the wing.Banbridge were without most of their Ulster contingent, fielding the team which had propelled them through the leagues over the past few seasons, and they will feel that they should have beaten a jittery home side.Defence dominated an attritional match and both sides were guilty of giving away penalties when in strong positions. Nelson kicked his side into the lead after five minutes, following a positive start, but Banbridge cranked up the pressure and had an excellent ten minute spell. They were held up over the line following some excellent driving play and continued to pile on the pressure, a charge down leading to a succession of m scrums. Despite some heroic defence, Banbridge scored when Stevie Irvine was driven over in the nd minute.Ballynahinch followed this with their best spell of the match, with excellent carrying from forwards and backs, pinning Banbridge in their own . When it seemed they had finally stretched the Bann defence to the limit, a knock-on gave the away side some respite.As lsquoHinch began to build another wave of attacks, scrum half Rhys OrsquoDonnell spotted a gap around the ruck in the centre of the pitch and ran under the posts untouched for an excellent try.Nelsonrsquos simple conversion made it -, but lsquoHinch failed to push on and there was more defending to before half-time. Banbridge missed a penalty just before the break and the home side turned round with a narrow three-point cushion.McPhillips replaced Hilton Gibbons at half-time and knocked over an excellent penalty early in the second half to stretch the lead to six points. However, Banbridge had already shown their intention to move the ball and they looked increasingly dangerous with ball in hand, especially from scrums.Centre Andy Morrison looked dangerous every time he received the ball and Banbridge upped the tempo with lsquoHinch looking increasingly nervous. A yellow card for number  Conall Boomer in the rd minute following a collapsed maul invited pressure and only sensational home defence with  men kept them out.The home try line was eventually breached in the th minute when Morrison went over following a missed tackle in midfield. The missed conversion gave Hinch a leline and despite more pressure form a superbly well drilled Banbridge team the final score remained -.

A motion on the issue will be tabled at next monthrsquos meeting of the local authority.The council chairman was presented with a consultancy report on the merits of the proposal and the minor costings of delivering the scheme which have not yet been made public.The delegation was led by Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who was joined by David Flinn, from the Ulster Ramblers Association.The report on extending the existing Quoile River walk into Rowallane was commissioned by the Downpatrick-based Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, which was represented at the meeting by Anthony Trainor.Also taking part was Peter Smyth from the Downpatrick Community Collective, a body which represents all community and residentsrsquo associations in the town. It is also supporting the proposed initiative.Cllr Enright described the off-road paths proposal as a ldquosimple, affordable and detailed plan to restore linkages lost in the s and s.He continued: ldquoIt has long been the desire of all political parties to restore the Ulster Way and reconnect Killyleagh, Delamont Country Park, Downpatrick, Castle Ward and Strangford.ldquoImplementing the reported does not require actual money at all, but simply the local council using its powers under the Countryside Order to remove some of the obstructions that have grown up in recent years.Cllr Enright said the network of paths would reconnect Delamont and Castle Ward with Downpatrick. He explained the route would require two or three short sections of boardwalk similar to those near the Belfast Road to reconnect paths or overcome boggy ground.ldquoAll this needs is a resolute approach by council management to reflect cross-party consensus over the priority of this project, he added.Cllr Murnin said the loss of official Ulster Way status in  for an area stretching from Killyleagh to Downpatrick and from Downpatrick to Strangford was a ldquohuge blow to East Down.He continued: ldquoSince then, local authority staff have intended to re-assert off-load links to recreate these vital routes, but this project has not been prioritised.ldquoWe can re-establish East Down as the centre of a network of off-road community trails that would be both regionally and nationally signicant. I will be lending my support to the cross-party motion in council to prioritise these three inter-linked routes.Mr Smyth said funding for the off-road paths study was obtained though the Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, with the project supported by the Downpatrickrsquos Collective which surveyed hundreds of users of existing pathways around Delamont and the Quoile River.He added: ldquoThere is clearly overwhelming public support for this proposal that would cost a small fraction of the money recently invested in providing so-called greenways in the Newry, Warrenpoint and South Armagh areas to link into the Cooley mountains..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Congratulations all round at Saintfield High School  ","story":"SIXTY years of providing outstanding education are being celebrated at Saintfield High School.The school proudly opened its doors in  as Saintfield Secondary Intermediate School with  pupils and five teachers.The school has seen many changes, including extensions and additions, the subjects offered to pupils, the ied members of staff and, of course, the generations of pupils.Miss Sarah-Lucy Hynds, principal, said the th anniversary was being marked ldquowith a real sense of pride in our past, and an excited and positive outlook for the future.She continued: ldquoIt is an absolute honour and privilege to lead such a thriving and active school community a school with a highly commended academic, pastoral, sporting and cultural history.The school has been instrumental in the development of the wider community during the last  years mdash in the citizens that it has produced and in the many and ied achievements of pupils, both past and present.Mr Johnston Young was appointed as the schoolrsquos first principal in .

When he was included in the play, he was absolutely lethal and too hot for Killough to handle.Alas, Killough were masters of their own downfall. They had the major share of possession throughout a feisty encounter, but were never going to be as ruthless as Celtic up front with too many chiefs in midfield and not enough Indians up front and any time they did threaten, goalkeeper Nathan Curran was there to deny them.Celtic started in a hurry and were - up after only four minutes. Stevie Galbraith, who led the line with distinction, linked up with McCoubrey out on the left before cutting inside Chris Fryer.He had only one thing on his mind as he entered the box and an angled right-footed curler, that seemed to take a bit of a deflection, beat Gerard Gormley all ends up.Killough tried desperately to get back on level terms and with seven minutes gone they went close when Fryer let loose from just outside the box. Curran did well to take the sting out of the shot and did even better to retrieve the loose ball ahead of the lurking Tony McIlhone.Two minutes later at the other end a McCoubrey cross was met at the back post by Sean McMahon, but he failed to get a good connection with his head and the chance was wasted.With  minutes gone the same combination dovetailed perfectly again, but McMahonrsquos cross hit the crossbar. McCoubrey was back in the thick of things minutes later when he had a shot well saved by Gormley, but Killough continued to threaten at the opposite end as well with McIlhone again being denied by Curran.Killough were starting to edge midfield and with  minutes gone Curran prevented Liam Graham from equalising after a tidy pass from Michael Burns. Just as Killough started to believe they could get back into the game, they shot themselves in the foot.As they dithered at the back, getting the ball forward, Celticrsquos pressing game bore fruit and McCoubrey took full advantage to race away and beat Gormley with a clinical strike.Four minutes into the second half McCoubrey made it - after Galbraith picked him out with a delightful pass that split Killough wide open.The exciting teenager could have added to his tally on a couple of occasions as Killough gamely tried to get back into contention, but he was out of luck with two cheeky efforts that went narrowly wide.McCoubrey eventually completed his hat-trick in the th minute when Celtic again caught Killough napping at the back and there was only going be one outcome when the talented youngster raced through to beat Gormley.Celtic Bhoys: Nathan Curran, Sean Megahey, Conor Doherty, Matthew Carson, Michael Rice, Jordan Curran, Jordan McCoubrey, Ricky Kerr, Stephen Galbraith, Sean McMahon, Chris Mullan, Subs: Terence Bell, Caolain Boyd, Andy Baggley.Killough: Gerard Gormley, Chris Fryer, Conor Black, Michael Burns, Colm Stranney, Kevin Groves, Liam Graham, Tony McIlhone, Ross Armstrong, Gareth George, Jack McLaughlin.

He said the study will look at the causes of the current issues in Saintfield and outline solutions.Pointing to sewage spills at the Old Grand Jury Road, Mr Blockwell, NI Waterrsquos head of investment, said the study was part of NI Waterrsquos approach to wastewater capacity and described it as a tool ldquoto get timely solutions.Mr Blockwell continued: ldquoIn terms of the drainage plan we need to get the right analysis to come up with solutions and the model we are working on will be ready in December . It takes time to do this work and analysis and get the right solution. If there is available funding, we will be able to bring schemes forward.ldquoThere are under capacity issues across Northern Ireland in relation to wastewater treatment works but there are parts of the Saintfield area like Darragh Cross where development is not restricted.Mr Blockwell added: ldquoUnfortunately for some current residents in Saintfield when there is heavy rainfall, there is restricted toilet use. This is very unpleasant and we sympathise with them. We will work to ensure everything is in place to develop a solution to this issue.Rowallane councillors Billy Walker and Terry Andrews have urged officials to ensure that the study is not only completed on time, but that money to implement its ious recommendations is available. They argue it is not unrealistic to suggest that the development ban could be in place for up to two years.ldquoIt is very concerning that work on the study will not be completed for another  months with no guarantee that the money needed to provide a st century sewerage system in Saintfield will be available, said Cllr Walker.ldquoThis is a very serious issue and one that must be urgently addressed. The ban is impinging on the future development of one of this districtrsquos leading towns and we currently have situation during heavy rain that raw sewage is backing up into peoplersquos gardens.Cllr Walker said it was his understanding that Saintfield is one of  towns in Northern Ireland which requires major investment to upgrade sewage treatment plants and the sewerage network.He added: ldquoSaintfield must be at the top of NI Waterrsquos priority list and the money needed to upgrade the sewerage system must be available. Given that the study will only be completed next December, by the time it takes to draw up detailed designs and secure money to carry out improvements, the development ban could be in place for at least two more years. This is unacceptable.Cllr Andrews said Saintfieldrsquos existing sewerage system could not cope and there were major questions over the long term future of the townrsquos treatment plant.ldquoThe preparatory work to identy solutions must be completed as soon as possible and the money required to signicantly upgrade the system must be made available, he said.ldquoI believe a new treatment works is required, but it will take time to deliver such a strategic capital investment scheme. People in Saintfield are looking for answers to questions they have on the future development of the town. This is an extremely serious issue..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/9065029.jpg","title":"yacht club claim proposed new boathouse site by rnli would be a waste of donations","story":"Lough Erne Yacht Clubhas accused the RNLI of changing its mind over a proposed site for the building of a new boathouse and have claimed that the project would be a ldquowaste of donations.The LEYC has hosted the RNLI temporary boathouse on its site for the past  years but says that the proposed new site would ldquohave a detrimental effect on the club and sailing in the bay.Now, however, the RNLI has made a planning application for a new leboat station at Gublusk Bay and in a letter to members, seen by the Impartial Reporter, the LEYC has said that it will be objecting.In its letter, by Commodore John Carton, the LEYC has said that it is ldquodisappointed that the RNLI have decided to go ahead with their application to build a boathouse on the shore of Gublusk Bay.The letter goes on to say that the situation is ldquoespecially disappointing since the RNLI were originally given a site one mile away which would give them more visibility.In a statement the RNLI said: ldquoThe RNLI have submitted a planning application for the building of a new leboat station for Enniskillen RNLI, comprising a boathouse and associated facilities, including the erection of slipway, installation of holding tank, landscaping and associated site and access works on a site at Gublusk Bay. It has also argued that the current application represents the ldquobest value for money.ldquoThe RNLI applies the highest standards and practices to all its applications for its facilities. The site chosen, from what was available, is the one that represents the best location and value for money for the Institution.That assertion is one that has been challenged by the LEYC who has said in its letter to members: ldquoWe also believe that the cost of the new site will be considerably more expensive overall with higher ongoing maintenance and cost and therefore a waste of donations.The LEYC also claim that the RNLI have changed their mind over the site of its proposed new station: ldquoWhen we originally discussed the proposed site with the RNLI they told us that they preferred to build as part of a bigger development as originally it was submitted as part of a bigger development plan. They later changed this to saying that the newer site would give them more visibility and potential footfall despite it being obvious that the original site was much more public facing.The LEYC also asserts that the original site it refers to would not require as much dredging as what is being proposed by the RNLI. In its letter however the LEYC stated that ldquowe are supporters of the RNLI and any objection we have is only to the proposed siting of the boathouse and should not be interpreted as any fallout with the local volunteers who we respect and support.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The backstop will come into force on the conclusion of the transition period while negotiations are continuing for an agreement that supersedes it and “unless and until” that “subsequent agreement” is applicable.“. While the UK as a whole will form a single customs territory the arrangements as a whole apply dferently in GB and Northern Ireland.“. Northern Ireland remains in the EU’s customs union and will apply the whole of the EU’s customs acquis and the Commission and the European Court of Justice will continue to have jurisdiction over its compliance with those rules.Therefore, goods passing from GB to NI will be subject to a declaration process.“. Northern Ireland will remain in the Single Market for Goods and the EU’s customs regime and will be required to apply and comply with the relevant rules and standards.Herein opens up regulatory ergence in the future.“. The implication, as outlined by the Attorney General, of NI remaining in the EU Single Market for Goods while GB does not is that for regulatory purposes GB is “essentially treated as a third country by NI for goods passing from GB into NI”.This is totally unacceptable and economically mad in that it will be erecting internal economic and trade barriers within the United Kingdom.“. The backstop will continue indefinitely and cannot be exited by the UK.Mr Cox says “Therefore despite statements in the protocol that it is not intended to be permanent and the clear intention of the parties that it should be replaced by alternative, permanent arrangements, in international law the protocol would endure indefinitely until a superseding agreement took its place in whole or in part as set out therein.” The truth is now laid bare for all to see in that the backstop will not be temporary in nature.MPs need reassurance over ending the Irish backstop says powerful Tory MP in Brexit debateHeartbreak as teenage Syrian refugee dies suddenly Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“. In paragraph  it appears possible that the EU could apply that the protocol is no longer necessary “in whole or in part” and consequently it is possible that the GB elements of the customs union could fall away leaving only Northern Ireland in the EU customs territory as the minimum necessary.“. The legal advice makes clear that the current drafting of the backstop does not provide for a mechanism that is likely to enable the UK lawfully to exit.”Mr Dodds added: “This advice concisely sets out the stark reality of the operation of the backstop.Its publication demonstrates how the Prime Minister has failed to abide by the commitments she gave in that the United Kingdom as a whole would leave the European Union and that she would ensure there would be no customs or regulatory ergence within the United Kingdom.“This backstop is totally unacceptable to Unionists throughout the United Kingdom and it must be defeated and arrangements renegotiated that uphold the commitments which the Prime Minister and her government has in the House of Commons.”try catch     .               ..

the risk Brexit could be stopped, the risk we could crash out with no deal.”She said it would not be in the “national interest” to block the Withdrawal Agreement, adding: “The only certainty would be uncertainty.”MPs’ decisions over the next week would “set the course our country takes for decades to come”, she said.Mrs May told them: “I promise you today this is the very best deal for the British people, I ask you to back it in the best interests of our constituents and our country.“And with my whole heart I commend this motion to the House.”In a speech repeatedly interrupted by MPs attacking her deal, the prime minister pledged to give Parliament and the devolved administrations a “greater and more formal role” in forthcoming negotiations with the EU over trade — but declined to say whether MPs would get a vote on that deal.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mrs May’s deal would “make this country worse off”.• Morning View, page JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy  Cookies Policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.7083089.1544001994!/image/image.jpg","title":"opinion","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to Johnston Press# Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Opinion   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Opinion Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Offbeat News Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Opinion      David Campbell: Pan nationalist front should help press for a trade deal with EUMichelle O#Neill#s comments on behalf of the new pan-nationalist front of Sinn Fein, SDLP, Alliance and Green Party that the Brexit backstop is the only way to protect the Belfast Agreement is abject nonsense.

.removeAttr  .html  .html.valThe DUP#s Westminster leader has said he would be #happy# to have another general election to prove the party has support in Northern Ireland for blocking the PM#s Brexit deal.Nigel Doddsreiterated his party’s opposition to the current proposals, saying in the House of Commons yesterday: “In terms of the views of the people of Northern Ireland I’m quite happy to put it to a test any time.DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds MP“We will happily go to the electorate and put our views to the peopleneeds be, and I’m quite certain we would be ed in greater numbers than today.”The comments were in response to independent MP Lady Sylvia Hernon , who said the pro-Brexit DUP does not represent the views of the majority in Northern Ireland.Mr Dodds added: “So I’m quite happy to take on the challenge that has been put down.”Mr Dodds also said it is not the job of a government minister to decide what is in the national interest, as Theresa May’s administration was held in contempt of Parliament for failing to publish its full legal advice on Brexit.The North Belfast MP was speaking during yesterday’s debate, after his party joined forces with Labour, Liberal Democrats and SNP MPs to force the government to disclose the Attorney General’s advice in full.While the DUP deputy leader praised Attorney General Geoffrey Cox for offering the “unnished truth” as he was grilled by MPs in the Commons on Monday, he added: “This does not fulfil the order that was passed by this House, which was for the final and full advise provided by the Attorney General to the Cabinet to be published.”Mr Dodds told MPs: “The government may not like the fact that this was passed by this House, but it can not simply wish it otherwise.“Surely this is one area where the government must respect the will of Parliament.”He said that one of the arguments against publishing the full advice – that it is protected by privilege - was “bogus”.“I have heard the argument that this is privileged, but of course in the lawyer-client relationship, privilege belongs to the client, not the person giving the advice. If the client waives that, then the lawyer is quite at liberty to disclose,” Mr Dodds said.“It is not the duty or the job for any government minister to decide the national interest, the House has decided what it wishes to do and it is not for a government minister to override that.”Gunned down in front of terried school kidsMPs need reassurance over ending the Irish backstop says powerful Tory MP in Brexit debate Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"He added that parts of the legal advice had already been leaked to the media by members of the Cabinet, so therefore MPs should be entitled to see it as well.DUP Brexit spokesperson Sammy Wilson said that government had “scored an own goal” by refusing to release the legal advice.The East Antrim MP told the Commons: “This secretive approach only confirms in people’s minds that there is something to hide.”try catch     .               ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

bn","story":"While the bypass is being built under a pound million fixed price contract, building firm Balfour Beatty said delays to the project had resulted in additional costs that ldquorun into hundreds of millions.Balfour Beatty andGallord Try ndash the other company involved in the project ndash are now in talks with Transport Scotland in a bid to seethey can claw back extra public funds.Bill Hocking, chief executive officer for construction and investments, Gallord Try, told MSPs: ldquoWe have put forward a claim to Transport Scotland in respect of some of the issues that have been faced in the project.He said those were linked to the poor weather which has hindered construction work, as well as delays from erting essential utility services.Stephen Tarr, managing director of the major projects ision at Balfour Beatty, added the claim submitted to Transport Scotland was ldquofor a not insignicant sum.How can the public have confidence in the #AWPR when it is delayed, over-budget and relations between the #SNP and contractor have fallen to a new low and claims are being made against the former  Utter shambles from the Scottish Government. pic NCRhLogqnmdash Jamie Greene MSPDecember , He told MSPs on the Scottish Parliamentrsquos Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee: ldquoWersquore in a situation as of today where the joint venture partners are hundreds of millions out of pocket as a consequence of the work wersquove been doing in Aberdeen.He was pressed on whether the claim amounted to tens of millions of pounds, or hundreds of millions of pounds.But he told the committee that was not something he wanted to reveal ldquobecause of the commercial nature of the discussions that we are having.North East Scotland Labour MSP Lewis Macdonald then asked him: ldquoIf I was to put to you that the total cost of the project is over pound billion you would accept that that is broadly correct Mr Tarr told him: ldquoYes, I think from what wersquove said you could deduce those are the areas of the cost.Work on the-mile road had been due to be completed in the spring of this year, after it was hit by delays.But further problems have seen the opening date pushed back, with contractors now hoping the final section of the roadway could be open before Christmas.Mr Tarr said the opening of the new road ldquowould have been delayed longer than it currently isthe two contractors had not taken mitigating measures.ldquoThere are signicant costs that run into the hundreds of millions, he said, adding these had contributed to the construction firm Carillion ndash which had also been involved in the AWPR project ndash becoming insolvent.Brian Love ofAberdeen Roads Ltdndash the consortium set up to carry out the work ndashstressed however that finishing the work before Christmas is ldquonot cast in stone as weather could delay the completion of a section of the road which crosses over the River Don.He stated: ldquoThe contractor is targeting a date prior to Christmas for the opening of the Don bridge, that construction programme is subject to many things, notably weather, so adverse weather could throw that out.However the Stonehaven to Craibstone section of the roadway should be open to traffic next week, the committee was told.Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said it had taken his intervention for this to happen, despite this stretch having been completed two months ago.He stated: ldquoI have explored every possible avenue with Aberdeen Roads Ltd to open this section of road as soon as possible and I am delighted my efforts to bring this matter to a positive conclusion have been successful.But he was also clear ministers were ldquosimply not willing to pay over the odds for the road on account of mistakes or miscalculations that are of the contractorsrsquo own making.He also said the ldquooptimistic programme to have the work completed before Christmas should be regarded ldquowith caution.ldquoAberdeen Roads Ltdhas said it aims to finish the bridge before Christmas but has also correctly warned the remaining works are complex, very weather sensitive and subject to safety and quality tests, Mr Matheson added.ldquoWe should therefore treat this optimistic programme with caution.He added the contract cost currently remains at pound million and would not clary the figure of the claim made by in addition to that by the contractors due to commercial confidentiality.Mr Matheson saidongoing discussions do not resolve the matter it could end up in court, but pledged to noty parliamentany additional costs to the taxpayer over pound million are incurred.Transport Scotland insisted afterwards it did ldquonot recognise the pound billion cost figure.A spokesman said: ldquoIt is not unusual for claims to be raised by a contractor on large complex infrastructure projects such as this one. Like most contracts of this nature, the AWPR contract contains a mechanism for dealing with claims.ldquoAs confirmed by the Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity, Transport Scotland and ARL have been engaged in dialogue to gain a better understand of the exact nature of ARLrsquos claim, however, ARL has yet to provide the evidence to substantiate any such claim. This process has not yet concluded, so we are not in a position to provide further details.ldquoHowever, ARL spent two years in dialogue bidding for the project where the risks associated with it were known and this did not deter it from bidding for and winning the contract for this major public infrastructure project..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: AWPR cost  uto top  xAbn u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/les_1.jpg","title":"a word from the wise les mccracken","story":"Posted on Monday  November  by Ulster Business Name: Les McCracken Position: Managing director, McCue Crafted Fit How did you get to the position you are in today I’m a big believer in work ethic. When I was young,  or so, I had a summer job on a farm. I would have milked  cows, morning and night, in addition to general duties around the farm. I was probably working  hours a week at that time, plus cycling five miles back and forth. It has stood me in good stead throughout my le. If you apply yourself, you can do anything.What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  In short, people. They are the greatest assets to a company but they can also be the biggest challenge. I’ve been fortunate enough to build a fantastic team around me at McCue but that has taken time. I’ve been here over  years and we’ve organically grown over that period from  employees and a turnover of £, to  employees and £m. It is also worth noting that in our sector there is a lack of skilled people, when you train them up some leave, which is disappointing but you have to train them and hope they stay. More must be done to engender the younger generation in to these skilled jobs. Too many are still going aimlessly in to third level education not knowing what they want to do, whereas they can earn as you learn in a trade, and that is much needed across the manufacturing sector.How would you describe your management style  I like to think I have a good management style, most of the time I’m very easy going and I do believe in autonomy. I expect those with responsibility to be capable and willing to do their job to the highest of their ability. I also have an open door policy allowing anyone to come and discuss problems but please bring with you a solution too.This allows my team to complete projects around the world from Vienna to Milan to Stockholm. We’ve been very fortunate to work with great brands, both in retail and hospitality, and on some fantastic projects from Ten Trinity Square in London to Danske Bank in Belfast and around Northern Ireland.What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  Of course, who wouldn’t say things could be done dferently, and better  Nobody is perfect, there’s always room for improvement. If I was to work until I was  years old, I would still learn something new every day.Have you done it all on your own  No, of course not. Who does  After  years I’ve a fantastic team who are very competent and trustworthy. But it has taken hard work and graft to get here. Today is very dferent to  years ago and for me I chose the right path. Today, you can enter this sector via a trade, an apprenticeship or a university background it’s about the right fit and enjoying what you do.How would you like your business to be remembered  McCue Crafted Fit is bigger than I. It’s been going for  years and providing unquestionable quality work. Like Jimmy McCue, who set this company up, when I choose to go, I hope to be remembered as a good leader who left the company in the best possible shape. Thirty years is a long time to be managing director and I have seen many changes in skill base, technology from hand drawn floor plans to full colour D fully explosive plans. It certainly has been an interesting three decades or so. I’d also like to note that McCue weathered the recession very well. I took some strategic decisions in  and , which ensured we not only held our own, but grew as a company.What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you Be patient. Time will come.

And boss Brendan Mooney says it is “disappointing” that a political argument around Brexit is “over-shadowing” the business case, which is largely supportive of the withdrawal deal currently on the table. The company, which has it headquarters in Belfast, saw adjusted pre-tax profit rising % - from £.m to £.m, in the six months to the end of September. It says much of the increase is down to the expansion of its Workday business throughout Europe. It says “to support the continued expansion with our Workday-related business, in Europe we continue to grow from our recently established offices in Frankfurt and Copenhagen, alongside our existing offices in Amsterdam and Gdansk”. “In North America we continue to expand our presence in Boston and Atlanta and we will open an office in Toronto in the next few weeks.” Brendan Mooney, the firm’s chief executive, told Ulster Business “There is no single reason or new reason .” He said the firms government commercial work was still a very strong part of the business, with a move towards digitalisation. “In Workday, as it rolls out across the world, there is great demand for the service as well. “There is underlying geographical expansion and signicant revenue outside the UK – we are seeing growth across Europe.” The company has grown its workforce to , – up again on the previous year, and has continued to grow. Of that,  workers are based at its Belfast and Londonderry offices which Brendan says “are a very important part of our business, and that trend will continue”. On Brexit, from a company perspective, Brendan says the services it provides to government are “not linked to Brexit”. “For us, it doesn’t get impacted by the Brexit direction – we are pragmatic on that. “In terms of Northern Ireland, the reality is… conversations about a political impact, they are over-shadowing what businesses are talking about and that’s disappointing.” He said looking forward at the next five years, the rise in demand for areas such as machine learning could form a much bigger part of the business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/223.jpg","title":"lunns opening m rolex store in city","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by Ulster Business Luxury watch and jewellery business Lunn’s is opening a new £m Rolex store in Belfast city centre.

The store will offer customers a truly immersive experience of the brand. “We are also very excited to be opening a fully accredited Rolex workshop, which will help owners to maintain the value and ensure the quality of their watches by having them serviced by skilled technicians on site at Queen’s Arcade.

Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”. Joining Ms Graham at the Banquet was guest speaker Jed Mercurio, creator of BBC hit dramas Bodyguard and Line of Duty.

It really is a fascinating mix of the old and the new.“With high ceilings, exposed brick feature walls, high quality wood flooring and the strikingly restored staircase from the entrance lobby, the space reflects innovative contemporary design.”The development is guiding a rental income of £, for each floor.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nick_web_1.jpg","title":"dale farm boss a no deal would be mad and disruptive for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew Dale Farm chief executive Nick Whelan speaks to John Mulgrew about bringing pride to the business, growing profits, facing Brexit hurdles and expanding the dairy giant’s portfolio Nick Whelan took over at the helm of Northern Ireland’s largest dairy co-operative just as the UK decided it wanted to leave the world’s largest trading bloc.Now, marking two years in the role, after replacing long-time boss David Dobbin, he says he wanted to grow earnings and profit to more than £m, while ersying into product lines with bigger margins for the some , farmers which own the operation.At the time of writing, we still haven’t agreed what arrangement will be in place to safeguard the current trading freedoms Northern Ireland producers have. A deal is on the table, though.Nick says that, aside from issues around getting staff, a transition must be in place after March  for export certicates, otherwise he can’t sell product outside the UK.“I have an ambition to get it to the mid-s . We are growing our EBITA from the £m average to about £m.”Pre-tax profits have cracked the £m mark in the last year, while turnover has soared by almost £m to £m.Nick says he turned his attention to attracting back some of the farmers which it has lost to other competitors.“At one point we had a billion litres of milk, now it’s around  million. We hadn’t been paying a particularly good milk price. “What ithad done is invested in itself quite heavily, and invested in the future, and had made a really brave strategic decision in , long before I came here, to get out of producing milk powders, and getting in to cheese and whey.“Now, that cost them £m to do that. That was really brave.“The first thing we did was get out to farmers, and explain to them what their business was.“We have paid a leading milk price, and that has brought genuine pride.“We needed to get into the business. The most fundamental change – it’s a people agenda. We were a very centralised business and all decisions came from the top, and went out.“Now, we have put the business into seven strategic business units and we are getting more adept with strategy, day-to-day, and developing people within the business to take ownership.”Nick says it’s about getting the right people into the business, and helping mentor and develop strong teams to ensure Dale Farm’s success.“We have spent a lot of money on additional people in the business. It’s not about numbers, it’s not about capacity, it’s about capability. We are really trying to find world-class people. gtHe said the firm will spend another £m on its people this year. Meanwhile, data and decision making is another area it’s expanding and developing. gt“We have a little bit of latency in the business, and I’m saying how do I get live information to those people ”That includes looking at new markets and products. Nick says the business had been focusing on the macro, and perhaps missed potential opportunities.“We have massive opportunities for growth,” he said. “The EBITA growth isn’t necessarily about growing your top-line, although it will grow a bit. We process  million litres of milk. Are you making sure you are making products which will give you the most profit from that – the answer to that is no.“We can switch categories and products, and we can make a whole lot more money with the  million litres. “It’s looking at consumer trends by getting out of commoditised type products and getting in to more value-added products. That’s about understanding your consumer.”He said the business has made “serious traction” in the last two years, as a company. As for growth in the future, with March  around the corner, Nick says it will continue “as long as there isn’t something mad and disruptive from Brexit”.“That could happen. A ‘no deal’ and no transition Brexit is mad and disruptive and changes everything. I don’t think people have really looked at it, and really understand what it means. We have looked at it, and it’s very challenging.”For Dale Farm, Nick’s Brexit concerns centre around staff and people – with around % of the workforce EU nationals.Nick says the company has struggled to get lorry drivers when milk supply is at its peak.But for Dale Farm, and other food processors, there is a concern over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says.“For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t.“It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate.“I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now.”“Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.”Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy output goes to the EU and the rest of the world. “In milk, milk keeps flowing. We can’t say to farmers ‘we can’t sell the product, can’t get the certicates, tell the cows to take a break for a few weeks’. It doesn’t happen.“I’m going to have to reassess... ‘how long can I survive not selling my % of dairy off the island ’“If there is a no-transition no-deal Brexit it will be really bad for business. Supply chains will be severely disputed and you’ll have a shortage of products everywhere.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sk_123.jpg","title":"more than  of business group members back brexit withdrawal deal","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s business community has overwhelming thrown its weight behind a withdrawal agreement on Brexit – with almost % of one major lobby group’s members in favour, it can be revealed.The CBI, Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce, Federation of Small Businesses and IoD are among the groups which have backed the deal on the table. Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town. The rules are clear – in order for the UK to move to the most productive discussion on what the future relationship will be, we need a withdrawal agreement. The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before. This opportunity needs to be taken.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
