But I was able to get back in and finish the filming. And afterwards I felt elated.As anyone who has had a panic attack knows, the only upside of the nightmarish ‘am I actually going mad?’ midst of the attack itself is that once it subsides it can give way to an almost euphoric high.After that, panic attacks became regular visitors in my life. After a month or two of these episodes, it was my mother who diagnosed me. She said she’d read an article about panic attacks and thought that was probably what was going on with me.But what to do about it? The triggers seemed to be any situation I felt I couldn’t walk away from without being conspicuous.Tube carriages when the train suddenly stopped in a tunnel caused immediate panic. This paranoia increased the panic and I’d be sent spiralling into a shortness of breath, the craziness in my head and an inability to get a proper grasp on the passing of time.Other panic-inducing situations included things such as meetings with my record label, where we’d sit in a boardroom with the door shut.But the biggest and baddest of these situations was live TV.Eventually I thought to myself: Enough, I need to sort this out.The most popular route to help with panic attacks seemed to be hypnotherapy. This was the first therapy I’d ever tried – for anything – and I was a bit wary.The initial session – with a very well-meaning practitioner – did nothing for me. She put on calming music and told me to lie still and relax, which sent me straight into the beginnings of an attack.After that, a friend told me about someone who had been treated by the hypnotist Paul McKenna.He’d become a regular fixture on TV and claimed he could change your life. I wasn’t sure whether he could really help me but I got in touch and trotted along to his place in Kensington, West London.We spoke about the triggers of my anxiety and about other situations when I’d felt that way.He said to imagine that I was standing in a room, and in the corner there was a television with a black-and-white image on it. The image should be an image of me from when I first remembered feeling out of control.I thought back to when I was little and my mum and dad had split up, and all the fights over where I would spend the time, especially when there was an uneven number of nights to be shared.The image I saw was me standing there at around the age of six while my stepmum explained how Dad was feeling about not seeing me as much as he’d like to.While she spoke, I felt incredibly guilty and out of control.The pressure was too much and I didn’t want to hurt anyone or upset anyone. I simply didn’t know what to do.Paul listened and told me to get closer to the screen and then let the image turn from black-and-white to colour.‘Now step inside the image. Climb into the scene and speak to that little version of yourself. Tell her you’re now an adult, that it’s OK she didn’t know what to do, and that you’ve grown into a happy grown-up so she doesn’t need to worry. It’s all going to be OK, and you can tell her that.’I did what he said and shortly afterwards I walked out of Paul’s house in a daze.I had been completely awake and aware throughout the session, but boy, was it powerful. For the next two or three days I could remember so many details from the time I was around the age of six or seven – things I had long forgotten, sights and smells. It was bizarre, but it really worked.Since that time I’ve had the inklings of a panic attack – the occasional little tug – but never again has it bloomed into a full-blown thing. Whatever Paul said to me that day, in just one session, was incredibly effective in giving the power back to me. I’m so grateful to him. Especially amazing was the fact that he never charged me. He told me to make a contribution to charity, instead, which I did of course.Pretty cool, that.© Sophie Ellis-Bextor, 2021Abridged extract from Spinning Plates by Sophie Ellis-Bextor, published by Coronet on October 7 at £16.99.

Photograph: iStockThe proportion of students who attended private or disadvantaged schools varies significantly across inidual higher education institutions, new figures show.Overall, a similar proportion of graduates nationally previously attended a disadvantaged or Deis (10 per cent) or fee-paying school (11 per cent), according to research by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) which has tracked college graduates.However, at university level, more graduates previously attended a fee-paying school and fewer attended a Deis school.TCD and UCD have the highest proportion of graduates who attend a fee-paying school (26 per cent and 27 per cent, respectively) compared with a Deis school (6 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively).By contrast, NUI Maynooth, DCU, NUI Galway and UL have higher proportions of graduates that attended a Deis school compared with a fee-paying school.The HEA study shows university graduates earn the most in the workplace, especially at TCD, UCD and DCU, while those who attend regional institutes of technology earn significantly less.Highest proportionOverall, for institutes of technology, more graduates previously attended a Deis school and fewer attended a fee-paying school.Limerick IT and IT Blanchardstown (now part of TU Dublin) have the highest proportion of graduates who previously attended a Deis school (38 percent and 31 percent respectively). Less than half a per cent of graduates from Limerick IT attended a fee-paying school.More graduates from colleges previously attended a Deis school compared with a fee-paying school, except for NCAD.Less than 4 per cent of graduates from colleges previously attended a fee-paying school compared with 21 per cent of graduates from NCAD.The study says the type of second-level school that graduates previously attended was used in a new report which tracked graduates’ earnings as a proxy measurement of socio-economic background.The study also shows the differences in Leaving Cert points achieved by students across higher education institutions.Across all institutions, just less than half of undergraduates entered their institution with more than 400 points.Undergraduates from teacher education colleges achieved the highest Leaving Cert points overall.AchievedFor example, 94 per cent of St Patrick’s in Drumcondra graduates achieved more than 400 points, while 84 per cent of graduates at Mary Immaculate in Limerick did so.Graduates from universities also achieved high Leaving Cert points. A total of 87 per cent of TCD graduates entered their courses with more than 400 points, while 45 per cent achieved more than 500 points.Among universities, graduates from NUI Maynooth entered their courses with the lowest Leaving Cert points with 55 per cent achieving more than 400 points.Graduates from institutes of technology generally attained lower points than the average for all graduates.Graduates from IT Blanchardstown entered with the lowest points (3 per cent entered with more than 400 points), while graduates from DIT and IADT entered with the highest points (32 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively, entered with more than 400 points)."},{"url":null,"title":"graduate","story":"We talk to six experts about what awaits university graduates about to enter the workforceWhere do you start if you really want to change the direction of your career?"},{"url":null,"title":"new study reveals which college graduates earn most in the workplace","story":"Study finds Trinity  students have the highest average earnings within a few years of graduation.   Photograph: Alan Betson Trinity College Dublin students have the highest average earnings within a few years of graduation, followed by Dublin City University and University College Dublin, according to a study by the Higher Education Authority. Teacher education college graduates, such as those from St Angela’s College in Sligo, St Patrick’s in Dublin and Limerick’s Mary Immaculate, also record relatively high earnings in the early years of their careers.By contrast, graduates from regional institutes of technology are more likely to be on lower salaries, with those from Letterkenny IT, IT Tralee and IT Sligo earning the least.Overall, the study shows the extent of the earnings gap which opens up among graduates across colleges and widens over time.For example, there was a gap of €257 in average weekly earnings between graduates from the highest earning college (TCD, €724) and the lowest (Letterkenny IT,€495) four years after graduation. After eight years, the gap grew to just over €400 in weekly earnings between the highest ( UCD, €1,017) and the lowest (Letterkenny IT, €615).The research did not include graduates from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland as the sample size was not big enough.The research, An Analysis of Graduate Earnings across Higher Education Institutions, is based on anonymised student records combined with earnings data from Revenue and other sources. The study’s authors say the findings indicate that what graduates earn when they enter the workforce is not just influenced by where or what they study, or their sector of employment, but also by their Leaving Cert points and type of second-level school they attended.Differences in graduate earnings are also likely due to regional earnings differences and “institutional prestige” factors.For example, undergraduates from universities and teacher education colleges achieved higher Leaving Cert points. Some 94 per cent of St Patrick’s graduates and 87 per cent of Trinity graduates achieved more than 400 points compared to 3 per cent of IT Blanchardstown graduates.Overall, more university graduates previously attended fee-paying schools compared to a disadvantaged or Deis school, while the reverse is true for institutes of technology. In UCD, 27 per cent of graduates previously attended a fee-paying school, while 7 per cent attended a Deis school. In Limerick IT, less than 0.5 per cent of graduates previously attended a fee-paying school, while 38 per cent attended a Deis school.The proportion of male and female graduates also varies significantly across institutions. Almost all graduates from St Angela’s in Sligo, and 68 per cent of graduates from the National College of Art and Design, are female. This compares to 46 per cent and 45 per cent of female graduates respectively from Carlow IT and GMIT.While the earnings gap is significant among graduates, it narrows considerably when data is adjusted to compare like-for-like graduates – such as students who studied the same subject and received the same grade.Using this measure, the earnings gap between the highest and lowest earning college four years after graduation falls from €257 to €154.On this like-for-like basis, predicted earnings for students from TCD, DCU and UCD falls substantially, but remain above average.Conversely, predicted earnings for graduates from IT Tralee, Letterkenny IT and IT Sligo increase, while still below the overall average.HEA chief executive Dr Alan Wall said the data shows the factors which influence students’ course choices and their subsequent early-stage earnings. “This will help institutions and other stakeholders in providing students with appropriate career advice and relevant information on their course choices,” he said.The Technological Higher Education Association, which represents institutes of technology, said graduates from its colleges performed well alongside other graduates when compared on a like-for-like basis. This was despite the lower socio-economic profiles of students in general and the fact that many students have attained lower overall Leaving Cert points.“It is clear that the technological higher education sector is the driver of access to education for the most socially and economically challenged cohorts of students throughout Ireland and they should be recognised and financially supported in this,” it said.Gearóid Hodgins, the association’s director of corporate affairs, said the report shows that areas such as the northwest would benefit greatly from inward investment to support high earning roles for graduates who wish to stay working and living in their home region."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Australia has so far refused to endorse a net zero emissions by 2050 target or double its emissions-cutting target for 2030Climate and bioersity policies demand much more rigorously coherent planning"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: Earlier leaf-fall, even of days, could reduce carbon stored by forestsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"children under 12 unlikely to get vaccines this year minister says as 1 049 new cases confirmed","story":"Minister for Health  Stephen Donnelly defended changes to the contact tracing system in schools. Photograph: Alan Betson A further 1,049 cases of Covid-19 have been recorded by the Department of Health in the past 24 hours.There were 310 patients in hospital with the virus at 8am on Monday, with 66 of those treated in intensive care.The figures came after Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly confirmed that children between the age of five and 11 are unlikely to be eligible for vaccination this year.Mr Donnelly also said that the booster programme will begin this week for those who are immunocompromised with those above 80 and those in nursing homes being offered a third dose from next week onwards.Asked about signals that children over the age of five will be offered Covid-19 vaccines, Mr Donnelly said the issue is being examined but he indicated a decision is not imminent.“We are looking at that at the moment obviously. No recommendation has come in on that, the conversations that the Chief Medical Officer and I have had is that we wouldn’t be expecting anything like that in this calendar year. We will keep that under very close review.”The Minister also defended changes to the contact tracing system in schools. From today, there will be an end to contact tracing of asymptomatic cases in the classroom.Under the changes, children under 13 who are close contacts of confirmed coronavirus cases in schools or childcare will no longer be required to self-isolate from September 27th if they are symptom-free.Mr Donnelly said the decision was taken on foot of “the very best advice from the Nphet”.“It is something that the chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan and I have discussed at great length” he said, adding that the “the recommendation is coming because of such encouraging results from the schools”.“So obviously we had a huge number of students and teachers go back and what we are seeing is that the rate of infection is stable and many people are staying it is actually falling. Positivity has been low and remains low and what it looks like is that the level of infection within the schools is in fact lower for that age group than outside the schools.”He also gave details on the State’s booster vaccination campaign.Pop-up Vaccinations“ This week as well we are doing pop-ups in the colleges, we have had fantastic response from students in college. I would just have an ask for anyone who in college who has not got around to getting vaccinated yet, please avail of this service.”The pop-up vaccination clinics are being offered by the HSE at 15 colleges campuses from Monday as thousands of first years begin third level.The clinics will be offering the PfizerBiontech vaccine and will provide first or second doses and will be provided to students and staff.The pop-up clinics will be in: University College Cork NUI Galway Trinity College Dublin University of Limerick Dublin City University Maynooth University Munster Technological University Cork Mary Immaculate College Royal College of Surgeons Ireland National College of Art and Design Athlone Institute of Technology (Technological University of the Shannon from 1 October) Limerick Institute of Technology (Technological University of the Shannon from October 1st) TU Dublin (All 3 campuses - Blanchardstown, Grangegorman, Tallaght). In addition, clinics operating in UCD, Letterkenny, Sligo and Waterford Institutes of Technology will be open to students and staff . Times and locations can be found on the HSE website.Meanwhile the Health Service Executive (HSE) chief executive Paul Reid said is planning for a transition phase in its treatment of Covid.Transition phaseMr Reid said the focus would now be on planning for a transition phase, how to move from pandemic to endemic, how to monitor and assess symptoms and maintain surveillance of outbreaks.Mr Reid said part of the transition would also include treatment of long Covid, he added.Mr Reid also defended the decision to allow primary children who are close contacts to attend school if they are asymptomatic from Monday.There were lower levels of transmission of the virus in schools, he told Newstalk Breakfast which meant that “on the balance of risk” it was safer for children to be at school.The level of transmission in schools was only five percent while it was 25 percent in households, he added. Having significant numbers of children out of school was a much higher risk for their wellbeing.On the issue of public consultants also operating in the private health system, Mr Reid saidone of the lessons learned during the pandemic was that the private health service was part of the healthcare system. “Private is part of the system and we have to respect it.”Mr Reid said that the HSE will meet the Sláintecare advisory group, probably the middle of this week, and that the HSE was determined to drive through the changes. “There will have to be significant reforms to have impact.”Mr Reid said the way in which the HSE responded to the challenges of the last 18 months should reassure people.It was “simply not true” to say that the HSE was too big or not capable of reform.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker how many people have been inoculated in ireland","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine.

Photograph:  Getty ImagesAustralian prime minister Scott Morrison, under pressure to step up the country’s efforts to cut carbon emissions, has yet to decide whether he will travel to Glasgow, Scotland, to meet other world leaders for a critical climate meeting in November.Australia, the highest per capita carbon emitter among the world’s richest nations, has so far refused to endorse a net zero emissions by 2050 target or double its emissions-cutting target for 2030 to match pledges by the EU, the US, Britain and Japan. Foreign minister Marise Payne said on Monday that Australia had yet to decide who would attend the UN climate summit in Glasgow – called Cop26 – but would first firm up a long-awaited plan to cut emissions.“One thing we are absolutely committed to, as we have said, is setting out our long-term emissions reduction plan prior to the COP, and that is what we’re focused on as a government,” Ms Payne told Australian Broadcasting Corp radio.“Australia will be strongly represented at the conference no matter by which senior Australian representative, and our commitment is very clear.”Mr Morrison has just returned from Washington, where, amid security and climate talks, he struck an emissions-cutting deal with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi focused on the supply of hydrogen and cheap solar technology.“That’s what gets you to net zero, because unless we can put developing countries and developed countries on the path to net zero, well, the world just gets hotter,” Mr Morrison told US CBS News programme Face the Nation. Largest experts Mr Morrison has said Australia “wants to achieve net zero as soon as possible and preferably by 2050”, and that the country expects to beat its pledge to cut carbon emissions by 26 per cent to 28 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030.Coal and gas are Australia’s second and third largest exports, making any move to curb fossil fuel-use challenging for the country’s politicians.Facing an election by May 2022, Morrison needs to appease moderates in his Liberal Party pressing for more climate action but at the same time needs support from the rural partner in the ruling coalition, the Nationals, which is concerned about the impact of tougher carbon targets on farming and coal mining.“This is a very vexed issue,” Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce said on ABC TV.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"sydney s covid 19 lockdown to end sooner for vaccinated people","story":"New South Wales state premier Gladys Berejiklian: ‘If you want to be able to have a meal with friends and welcome people in your home, you have to get vaccinated.’   Photograph: Joel CarrettEPAAustralian authorities announced plans on Monday to gradually reopen locked-down Sydney, unveiling a two-tiered system that will give citizens inoculated for Covid-19 more freedoms than their unvaccinated neighbours for several weeks.Movement restrictions across New South Wales, the country’s most populous state and of which Sydney is capital, will be lifted gradually between October 11th and December 1st as vaccination rates push through 70 per cent, 80 per cent and 90 per cent.However, people who are not fully inoculated will be barred from joining the vaccinated to resume community sports, dining out, shopping and other activities until the final date.“Unlike most cases in the world, if you are not vaccinated you will have to wait at least four or five weeks ... in order to participate in things that the rest of us can participate in,” state premier Gladys Berejiklian said in a televised briefing.“If you want to be able to have a meal with friends and welcome people in your home, you have to get vaccinated.”Ms Berejiklian did not detail how the block on activity by the unvaccinated would be enforced.Third waveSydney, along with Melbourne and Canberra, has been in lockdown for several weeks, with the three cities bearing the brunt of a third wave of Covid-19 infections that has taken national case numbers to almost 100,000 – 68 per cent recorded since mid-June. The three states – New South Wales, Victoria and Australian Capital Territory – logged just over 1,500 cases on Monday, most in NSW and Victoria.At 1,245 deaths, the national fatality rate, however, has slowed due to higher vaccination levels among the most vulnerable.The Delta-fuelled outbreak has ided state and territory leaders, with some presiding over virus-free parts of the country indicating they will defy a federal plan to reopen internal borders once the adult population reaches 80 per cent vaccination, expected in late October.In New South Wales, where about 60 per cent of people aged 16 and over are fully inoculated, restaurants, pubs, retail stores, gyms and indoor recreation facilities may reopen on October 11th – days after the state is expected to reach 70 per cent vaccination – with capacity limits.Once 80 per cent vaccination is achieved, expected a few weeks later, state-wide travel will be allowed. Limits on people attending funerals and weddings will be lifted, and the number of vaccinated people allowed to gather in a home will double to 10.From December 1st, there will be no limits on home and informal outdoor gatherings. Capacity limits will remain at indoor venues, but masks will no longer be required. Businesses may impose their own rules regarding customer vaccination.Neighbouring Victoria has not yet given a date when all residents, including those unvaccinated, may move around without restrictions. The state is however expected to relax some curbs from Wednesday when the number of adults receiving a first vaccine dose tick over 80 per cent.Vulnerable groupsWhile businesses and the tourist industry broadly welcomed the New South Wales reopening plan, some advocate groups said vaccination rates were not high enough among vulnerable groups such as the indigenous population, people with disabilities and those in regional areas with lower vaccine supply.“These groups are at higher risk of serious illness and death from Covid and it would be unconscionable to ease restrictions until we are sure people at high risk have at least the same vaccination rate as the broader community,” said Australian Council of Social Service chief executive Cassandra Goldie in a statement.Qantas Airways, which has already said it would require international flight passengers to be fully vaccinated, said it would bring forward its reopening date for flights between Sydney and Melbourne to November 5th, from December 1st based on Monday’s update.However, it said it would re-route its Perth-London direct flight until at least April 2022 and suspend most flights between Perth and the east coast states, since Western Australia had not given a border reopening date. – ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"analysis german voters chose candidate to continue merkel s policies","story":"Olaf Scholz, chancellor candidate for the Social Democratic Party (SPD), delivers a statement to the media following the election at the party headquarters in Berlin on Monday. Photograph: BloombergGerman voters are a cautious lot and, on Sunday, they voted for political change – but with a half-engaged handbrake.With chancellor Angela Merkel no longer on the ballot, Germans shifted their allegiance in record numbers away from her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) to the person and party they felt most likely to continue her policies: Olaf Scholz and his Social Democratic Party (SPD).Mr Scholz and the SPD finished first thanks to a sobre, centrist candidate and a snappy leftist campaign with clear messaging. It revived the promise of social justice – higher wages for low-earners, stable pensions and more affordable housing – and married it with a promise of a jobs-friendly green transformation of Europe’s largest economy.To secure a parliamentary majority in a three-way alliance, though, Mr Scholz will need to balance contradictory political ambitions of would-be partners: a big state Green transformation financed by tax hikes for top earners, and a liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) that wants a more modest climate shift financed by trickle-down economics and a swift post-pandemic return to balanced budgets. On Monday morning, sleep-deprived Social Democrats (SPD) hurried into their party headquarters, the Willy Brandt Haus anxious to convert Sunday’s election victory into a new coalition.Before reaching out to potential partners, though, the party knows it has to clarify a tricky internal dilemma. Olaf Scholz, their election hero and chancellor presumptive, is the same man members rejected as leader in 2019.On Monday the leftist leadership duo who beat him back then – Saskia Esken and Olaf Walter-Borjans – insisted Mr Scholz had their full support. Their task in the weeks and months ahead will be to hold in check rival leftist and centrist camps now there are spoils of power to carve up.Four kilometres west, the knives were out on Monday morning at the Konrad Adenauer Haus to find someone, anyone, responsible for the CDU’s election debacle and runner-up result.Given support for the CDU and its Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) ally has halved in just eight years, CDU leader Armin Laschet, the man who lead the party into its worst-ever result on Sunday evening , insisted there was enough blame to go around.Mr Laschet insisted there is still hope of a fifth term. He held brief talks on Sunday evening with the FDP and hoped to talk to the Greens on Monday. His hope: to offer a sweeter deal than the SPD and pull them over to a so-called “Jamaica” coalition.Last week senior CDU figures recalled how, in the 1960s and 1970s, the SPD finished second but its leaders Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt ended up chancellor.At their post-mortem meeting, some long-faced CDU figures blamed Angela Merkel for giving up the party chair in 2018 but lingering around as chancellor, leaving Laschet little room to manoeuvre in the campaign.Others point the finger at Wolfgang Schäuble, the outgoing Bundestag president and CDU grey eminence. He pushed through the gaffe-prone Laschet largely to thwart the political ambitions of Markus Söder, the more populist head of the CDU’s Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU).Mr Söder and his allies attacked Mr Laschet on Monday for “stepping on every banana skin available”: from laughing during a visit to a flood-wrecked town to posting his ballot on Sunday with his vote visible to photographers.But those CSU attacks from Munich were blunted somewhat given the Bavarian party also had its worst election since 1949.When all is said and done, most CDUCSU figures accept that, nine months after Mr Laschet became leader and four months after he was chosen as joint candidate, their centre-right alliance’s will to retain power was not matched by a clear political offering. The Green Party frontbench met on Monday with mixed feelings. Its record result of 14.8 per cent was half its support in the spring. In a year of catastrophic floods and Fridays for Future marches, that was far from the vote in confidence it predicted for its climate protection agenda.Senior Green figures have spoken out in favour of exploring both coalition options with the FDP: a “traffic light” with an SPD lead and a CDU-lead “Jamaica” option.Sensing political opportunity, FDP leader Christian Lindner has urged the Greens to meet him first and carve out a joint strategy for their two would-be suitors.Sunday’s poll highlighted ongoing east-west political isions in Germany. Despite a national struggle and just 10 per cent support nationwide, the far-right Alternative für Deutschland took one fifth of the vote in eastern regions , rising to 24.6 per cent in Saxony.All German political parties insisted on Monday morning that no one wants a protracted period of uncertainty. But after German electors chose change on Sunday, it remains to be seen how much change the elected dare give them.

Photograph: Martin DivisekEPABerlin voters have given their backing to a campaign demanding the city-state government est corporate landlords of up to 240,000 apartments in the city.On Sunday a majority of 56.4 per cent of Berlin voters, more than one million voters, backed the initiative “Disappropriate Deutsche Wohnen \u0026amp Co”. Named after one of the city’s largest landlords, the non-binding initiative orders the new city-state government to buy-out all landlords holding more than 3,000 housing units.Campaigners say the initiative is necessary to slow a housing crisis in the capital that has seen rents in some areas jump as much as 146 per cent in 10 years.“This is an unambiguous result and a clear vote of the population for disappropriation, we want to drive speculators and property sharks out of the city,” said Rouzbeh Taheri, spokesman for the initiative. “I expect the incoming coalition, regardless of its make-up, to include a clear timeframe for including the socialisation law and to begin preparations without delay.”Some 39 per cent of Berliners rejected the buy-back proposal, with cost forecasts ranging from €7.3 billion to €36 billion.Sunday’s vote would affect about 15 per cent of Berlin’s housing stock. All of Berlin’s main political parties, with the exception of the hard-left Linke, oppose the proposal.Divided viewsOn Monday the city’s Social Democratic Party leader Franziska Giffey, the new governing mayor elect, indicated she “respected the decision” but insisted it would not result in any new apartments.“Preparation work for a draft Bill law will have to begin, but any draft must be examined for its constitutionality,” she said.Legal experts are ided over whether such an intervention in property rights is lawful, with each side citing competing clauses in Germany’s post-war constitution.Sunday’s election in Berlin descended into chaos when the wrong ballot papers were delivered to at least nine polling stations in the city and were distributed to voters for up to two hours before anyone noticed.By mid-afternoon polling stations around the city ran out of ballot papers while couriers dispatched with fresh papers were stuck in the Berlin marathon.The Berlin election was always going to be a figurative marathon with four separate votes: for federal, state and local parliaments, as well as the housing referendum. Now legal experts are examining whether the irregularities on Sunday in Berlin were grave enough to warrant a re-run of the election.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"lived winter discontent boris can avoid turning ted heath","story":"News last week about soaring fuel prices was the final part of the jigsaw. I did not need any more convincing: this really does feel like a weird return to Britain in the 1970s.For me, it is more than a vaguely remembered glimpse into the past. I became a BBC reporter in the summer of 1970 and, as with all formative experiences, it is a decade seared in my memory. The eerie old mood music is inescapable. I am not thinking of the songs, although it is uncanny that new Abba tunes are being released. The BBC isn’t helping by putting on repeats of Fawlty Towers and The Good Life.For those of us who lived through the 1970s, there is a clear sense that the bad times are back again. It is not a cheery trip down memory lane. It feels more like an awful warning.My first foreign assignment was to Vietnam, to cover the last stages of that “forever war”. In 1972, my bosses at Broadcasting House thought Saigon would fall they didn’t share their thoughts with me, they simply sent me to find out. In fact, it was three years later that South Vietnam was defeated, and then I was in the press room at the White House reporting for Radio 4’s Today programme on the last helicopter lifting off from the roof of the American Embassy.Gerald Ford was the interim president, and the man who took over was the peanut farmer, Democrat Jimmy Carter. He won because he was not the disgraced Republican president, Richard Nixon. The parallel is obvious: Joe Biden, who was not Donald Trump, brought us last month’s shambolic withdrawal from Kabul. For Vietnam, read Afghanistan. A bit spooky, don’t you think?The sharp rise in fuel prices and the ever-growing fear of inflation is the narrative arc which pulls the two decades together. The Bank of England has revealed that it now expects inflation, which saw a sharp increase last month to 3.2 per cent, to exceed 4 per cent before the year is out and remain there into the second quarter of next year. And it’s thanks to the energy price shock that last week queues formed outside petrol stations – once a familiar sight during the 1970s global oil crisis.Families are once again making an early start on their Christmas shopping, amid fears of a toy shortage caused by ongoing supply chain problems. In the 1970s, a shortage of plastic, sparked by the oil crisis, caused production problems for popular toys, from clacker balls and Space Hoppers to the Mastermind board game.That decade saw the first real signs that energy supplies could be crucial. For the influential pressure group, the Club of Rome, running out of fossil fuels was a serious threat.For today’s climate militants, abundant supplies of fossil fuels are the real cause for concern. The Club of Rome was keen on bringing economic development to a standstill with its zero-growth mantra. Present-day climate activists are inspired by the call for zero carbon. They too insist that not only governments but private citizens should take action. We should cut out red meat because it comes from cows emitting methane gas. Decades apart, they seem to share the same conclusion: hair shirts all round.In the early 1970s, I remember a prominent news presenter suggesting we should leave our comfortable lives to join her and others in forming a Somerset commune. To my embarrassment, she cheekily suggested I would be perfect commune material. Thankfully, I never got to pack my sandals.Allegra Stratton is the Government’s spokesperson on the COP26 climate change conference to be held next month in Glasgow. To much amusement, she suggested we could all do our bit by not rinsing our dishes before putting them into the dishwasher. It immediately brought to mind the advice given by one of Ted Heath’s cabinet ministers, Patrick Jenkin: his idea for saving power during the Three-Day Week – when, for three long months from midnight on New Year’s Day 1974, the Government imposed limits on electricity to reduce usage and help eke out coal reserves depleted by union strikes – was for all of us to brush our teeth in the dark.There was merriment partly because, in those days, there was much less talk about the need for the Government to send a message. Last week, when Boris Johnson took a train, and not the plane, from New York to Washington, no one laughed. On the eve of his climate speech at the UN, it was treated like routine PR.In the 1970s, union-backed strikes were frequent, and as I followed Heath around on his attempted re-election campaign in 1974, he routinely argued that the election would answer the simple question: “Who rules Britain?” At the ballot box, the response came swiftly: “Not you, mate.”It became clear in the months that followed that, increasingly, people were not expecting the answer to be found at Westminster. In February 1974, Labour’s Harold Wilson returned to power – but it wasn’t long before his replacement Jim Callaghan was at the helm, desperately trying to keep a lid on inflation with an official pay policy. BBC staff would buy steak in the subsidised canteen to take it home to their families.There was a common view throughout much of the 1970s that the country was, in effect, leaderless, best summed up in the famous winter of discontent headline attributed to Callaghan: “Crisis, what crisis?” I remember at a high-powered political reception a well-known industrialist came up to me and said, without any preamble: “Is Britain ungovernable?” As a BBC correspondent I could not, of course, openly agree, but the mood of pessimism was unavoidable.Britain’s image abroad suffered. On a Tube train from Heathrow airport with a group of newly-arrived Americans, I was startled when one of them shouted and pointed at some allotments by the side of the track. “Look,” he exclaimed to his friends, “subsistence farming.” To him, we were obviously down on our knees.In 1979, it all ended in public humiliation for the Labour government. When there is speculation now of a new winter of discontent, I feel a shudder remembering the rubbish that wasn’t cleared, the bodies that weren’t buried. It is not the same.This is where it is dangerous to make too close a connection with the past. Politics now does not depend on the hope of a Conservative revival. Labour is still unable to pose as a government-in-waiting, and Sir Keir Starmer is no Margaret Thatcher. The unions have nothing like the power they used to wield. Disputes over ideology have lost their bite. The pandemic has forced the Conservatives to become unlikely advocates of the Big State.But Covid has thrown up a raft of problems, too, which has left many voters feeling let down and marginalised. That is why I am thankful the true spirit of the 1970s is firmly in the past. I spent a good deal of that decade covering the conflict in Northern Ireland, and reporting on wars abroad, often at the end of a crackly telephone line. Computer wizardry was in its infancy. Colour television had only just arrived. The human genome had not been charted, and we would not have been able to mount in less than a year a successful vaccination campaign against a deadly virus.It is fun to play with history but, like children, we should be careful about playing with fire. One of the key lessons from the 1970s is that, in a relatively short period of time, how easy it is for an administration to lose control. Now, the country is emerging from its toughest civil emergency since the war. A sense of proportion is what is needed.John Sergeant is former chief political correspondent of the BBC and former political editor of ITN.

Her chosen descriptive was in the same biological league (and in the same geographical area) as “cervix” and began with the same letter.This was a woman in her forties, a senior and respected NHS staff member and  the mother of three children. In public.Another former friend from my student days, and who is of a similar age to me, has, as her Facebook profile, a banner stating “F*** the Tories”, but without the asterisks.I spent 34 years campaigning for the Labour Party, 14 of them as an MP. And I find myself dazed and confused when I see people who are old enough to know better using such ugly, childish terms to describe parties and politicians with whom they happen to disagree.Something unpleasant has happened culturally, when language in which we indulged as young people and students (who, frankly, didn’t know any better) continues to be used by adults. Perhaps it’s all the internet’s fault: however bad your behaviour, you will always find someone somewhere willing to applaud it and to commend your foul language and one dimensional approach to complex political issues.Who knows what might lie at the heart of Angela Rayner’s ugly outburst on Saturday night at Labour conference, in which she derided her political opponents as “a bunch of scum, homophobic, racist, misogynistic, absolute pile… of banana republic… Etonian… piece of scum…”The diatribe falls some way short of Churchillian demagoguery and it sounded like a confused attempt at a complicated and rather niche word search puzzle, but you can see where the deputy Labour leader is going with it.Naturally there have been various calls for Rayner to apologise, if not for her class-based vitriol then for the broader crime of lowering political discourse to a level where it might be refused entry to any respectable gutter. Keir Starmer, Rayner’s (nominal) boss, raged that he would “speak to her” about her remarks, a prospect which no doubt had Rayner shaking in her shoes.But all the outrage – and the inevitable full-throated support from the likes of my two former friends described above – misses a more important point, more important than the loss of civility and courtesy from our public debate. And it is this: what Angela Rayner revealed, and what her supporters and apologists have unintentionally conceded, is that they have no idea why ordinary people vote Conservative.This is vital. If you genuinely believe that your opponents are “scum” – in other words, undeserving of being described in human terms but only as something ugly to be disposed of – then it is surely fair to say that you cannot understand the mindset of a voter who would place a cross in a box next to the very party which has earned such contempt. It goes without saying that if Rayner genuinely believes what she said about Boris Johnson and his colleagues (and she is nothing if not genuine), then she is incapable of understanding what motivates, not just long term Conservative voters, but the many former Labour voters who supported Johnson in 2019.And if you cannot get your head round the reasons why you lost the last election, how can you possibly hope to win any future one?The key to political victory is to understand your opponents and, more importantly, to understand the reasons why ordinary people voted for them. Without that you’re flailing around in the dark shouting at no one and everyone. Which is where Rayner and her supporters are right now. No empathy, no sympathy, no walking in other people’s shoes. Their own perception and their own experiences are all they need to form their opinions. Maybe they reckon it’s up to those voters in the Red Wall to try to understand where Rayner’s coming from. That’s not how politics works, Ange.At the root of all the “Tories are scum – Never kissed a Tory – Tories are lower than vermin” sloganising that passes for analysis in certain parts of the Labour Party lies a profound but endlessly comforting misconception: Labour people are morally superior to Conservative people. It matters not that there is not a microscopic particle of evidence to justify this conclusion it is an article of faith among activists that is rarely, if ever, questioned. This moral superiority has hampered the movement for decades, because it allows adherents to skip the part where they need to justify their own moral motivations.You have to admire the chutzpah of any political party that can be found to have failed to prevent anti-Semitism by the Equality and Human Rights Commission and yet can still, with no appearance of self doubt, lambast others for racism from their pious high ground.Labour is just a political party like all the others. It has some good policies and some bad policies, some good MPs and some bad ones, some fantastic activists and some who, frankly, shouldn’t be allowed outside without an adult accompanying them. From a moral perspective, Labour is no better – and in many cases far worse – than its opponents.But so what? Political parties aren’t supposed to be like evangelical churches. Unless you’re the Liberal Democrats there’s little need to preach.Rayner and her fellow Labour teenagers need to get a grip, come out of their room and apologise to their parents for slamming the door. More urgently, she and her party need to understand why ordinary decent people would rather vote for “scum” than for Labour.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Shadow Cabinet minister resigns saying Labour \u0026#39more ided than ever\u0026#39 Richard Gere could testify against Italy\u0026#39s Matteo Salvini in migrant boat trialRachel Johnson: Conmen stole from my mother’s homeEmmanuel Macron pelted with egg by protester who shouts \u0026#39Vive la revolution!\u0026#39The flashpoints that make forging a new German government a hard taskMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"losers german election france china russia","story":"After the voting comes the horse-trading. The inconclusive results of Germany’s  general election look set to confirm the truth of Otto von Bismarck’s advice: Never ask how sausages or politics are made.The laborious process of political deal-making in Berlin revolving around squaring the domestic circles of interest groups and, of course, who get’s what job in the cabinet shouldn’t distract us from the implications for the rest of the world.Germany faces tough geo-political choices as it grapples with energy supply and ecological concerns and the question of whether its economic weight gives it the duty as well as the power to play a bigger role in foreign policy.  Although many commentators saw Angela Merkel as the “most powerful woman in the world”, they overlooked that her foreign policy style was to twist arms to get what her French partners prioritised through EU councils.  If there is to be continuity in German foreign policy after Merkel that means letting France take the lead and the Paris-Berlin axis putting business dealing with Russia or China ahead of principles. At the start of this year, Macron and Merkel were pushing an investment deal with China with patently empty phrases about human rights and were anxious to re-open EU dialogue with Russia.In Germany, the sharpest criticism of this “appeasement” of authoritarian trading partners came from the free market FDP and the Greens. The CDU’s new leader, Armin Laschet, was firmly for continuity with the Merkel approach, while his nemesis, the SPD’s Ola Scholz, had silently supported it as finance minister.  With the Anglosphere cohering around a human rights agenda in setting the tone vis-à-vis the two great Eastern powers, it is striking how far the tone of German Greens and the FDP on these issues chimes in with America and Britain.The electoral arithmetic has made these two parties the two kingmakers in German politics. Their shared foreign policy orientation could ease the way for them to split differences on domestic policy in a new coalition government.The German Greens have shifted a long way from their first generation of anti-NATO pacifist members of the Bundestag in 1983. Nowadays, their foreign policy-spokespersons are the most forthright in Germany in criticising Vladimir Putin’s Kremlin and decrying the treatment of Uyghurs and Hong Kong dissidents by the neo-Maoist Chinese regime.Those of us old enough to remember the Greens\u0027  elders waving the Little Red Book may smile wryly at the transformation of yesterday’s student radicals. But there is a fundamental shift in Green politics  across much of Europe (though less so here) from a 1968 knee-jerk anti-Americanism to a contemporary set of liberal, apparently “woke,” values which actually put them at odds with authoritarians to the East and less out of kilter with the West than their founders.If the cultural mood in Germany is more in synch with the English-speaking world, the political consequences put it at odds with its traditional EU partner, France.France could be the big European loser out of either possible three party coalition. President Macron shared Angela Merkel’s preference for doing deals with both Russia and China ignoring the human rights concerns voiced by both the FDP and German Greens.Back in the spring, the Macron-Merkel axis already buckled under pressure from both the East European EU states but also the Dutch and Swedes, for instance, when they tried to swing both a big investment pact with China without serious human rights clauses and also a  re-opening of dialogue with the Kremlin.Without Angela Merkel at the helm in Berlin, Macron’s vision of European “strategic autonomy” from the United States and an American-led NATO give looks like a mirage.Given Britain’s sour relations with Russia and growing estrangement from China, an EU re-orientated away from a Paris-Berlin axis to give more weight to its Central and East European members would be welcome in Whitehall.That shake-up in the geo-politics of the EU could of course revive the tensions inside it. A more “isolated” France could reject Macron’s re-election bid in favour of an even more openly nationalist, euro-sceptic candidate of the right.  German voters might not have been thinking of destabilising the EU’s settled ways but their votes look set to do just that.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Shadow Cabinet minister resigns saying Labour \u0026#39more ided than ever\u0026#39 Richard Gere could testify against Italy\u0026#39s Matteo Salvini in migrant boat trialRachel Johnson: Conmen stole from my mother’s homeEmmanuel Macron pelted with egg by protester who shouts \u0026#39Vive la revolution!\u0026#39The flashpoints that make forging a new German government a hard taskMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"now conservatives even labour labour","story":"We’ve had the queues and shortages, but we can’t have a full 1970s tribute act without one more piece of the jigsaw falling into place: the government adopting a prices and incomes policy.  But it seems we are not far away:  we already have a prices policy in the shape of the price cap on energy bills, which is causing havoc with suppliers going out of business. Now for the incomes part of the policy: the Prime Minister at the weekend demanded a pay rise for lorry drivers, claiming that would sort out the current shortage and get our shelves full again and our petrol stations flowing with fuel.There is, though, one crucial difference between Boris Johnson and Jim Callaghan. The latter did at least attempt to use his influence on wages and prices to keep inflation under control – even if not very well. It is a long-forgotten detail of the Winter of Discontent that it began with the Ford Motor Company – the privately-owned competitor to the state behemoth that was British Leyland – defying the then Labour government by awarding a 17 per cent pay increase, way above the 5 per cent ceiling that Callaghan was trying to impose on industry. Suddenly everyone wanted an increase, threatening to set off another inflationary spiral and throwing us into the hell of mass strikes.Johnson, on the other hand, is demanding that employers set higher wage rates.  It is as if Len Murray, Callaghan’s nemesis at the TUC had suddenly been catapulted into Downing Street -- not just for a round of beer and sandwiches but to run the whole show. Whatever the horrors we endured in the early months of 1979 it would have been nothing compared with the chaos which would have ensued had we had a government actively trying to push up wages and so stoke inflation and ruin the public finances.That seems to be Boris Johnson’s ambition just at the moment. It might well be true that part of the reason we have a shortage of lorry drivers is that too few people find it an attractive career, either because they would be paid too little, they don’t like the conditions or because the whole workforce has received a subliminal message from society that manual jobs are inferior and that you are a nobody unless you aspire to be a pen-pusher. But it is up to employers to work out what is an appropriate level of remuneration to attract new drivers into the industry. It is not for the Prime Minister, or any other minister, to try to set the level of pay in private companies – beyond setting a minimum wage, which I would say is justified on the grounds that it reduces dependence on state benefits. Johnson hasn’t thought through what he is doing.  At the same time that the government is trying to hold down public sector wages to regain some degree of control over public spending, the Prime Minister starts barking at supermarkets, oil companies and logistics companies to jack up the wages they pay their lorry drivers.It isn’t hard to work out the consequence of this. Workers in all industries are going to start saying to themselves: look, if Boris thinks lorry-drivers should have higher pay, then we can have it too. Stand by and prepare as public sector union after public sector union starts putting in wage demands – which the government will either have to grant or be prepared to rebuff at the threat of strike action.If only we had a Conservative opposition waiting in the wings, promising fiscal responsibility. The situation is even grimmer than it was in 1979 because at least then the country could look forward to a change of ruling political philosophy via a general election. Now, the Conservatives are even more Labour than Labour. The country looks to be stuck in the early months of 1979 for the next few years.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Shadow Cabinet minister resigns saying Labour \u0026#39more ided than ever\u0026#39

Crete hit by 6.5 magnitude earthquakeA “terrifying” 6.0-magnitude earthquake struck the Greek island of Crete this morning, killing one person and injuring several others, amid reports of structural damage to homes and churches.The European Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) reported that a 6.0 magnitude quake struck at 9.17 am with an epicentre 16 miles south south east of the city of Heraklion and a depth of 6.2 miles. At least nine aftershocks have also struck the area, with the strongest one registering a magnitude of 4.6.Greece’s Climate Crisis and Civil Protection Ministry confirmed that one person had been killed and a further nine people suffered injuries. Local authorities reported that a man was crushed when a church dome in the town of Arkalochori collapsed they said that he had been renovating the church when the earthquake struck.The details of the circumstances of the injuries were not immediately available.Vassilis Lambrinos, the mayor of Heraklion, told Greek Skai television that all schools had been evacuated to check for structural damage.Local media in Crete have reported that some old buildings had experienced structural damage, with walls collapsing in villages near the epicentre.Holidaymakers were also evacuated from their hotels in Crete. Sarah Williams-Long, a doctor at King’s Hospital in London who was staying at the Creta Maris beach resort with her partner and three-year-old son told The Independent that the experience was harrowing.She said: “They’ve evacuated us from our hotel in case there’s a second earthquake - we’re waiting to be taken to a hotel away from the higher buildings. “We’ll hopefully be allowed back in to hotel if nothing happens in the next 40 minutes. It was terrifying.

The centre-left Social Democratswon .% of the vote, ahead of .% for Merkelaposs CDU CSU conservative bloc, according to provisional results. The Greens came in at .% and the liberal Free Democratswere on .%. The SDP are now set to start the process of trying to form a government after the election, which was held after Ms Merkel said she would retire as Chancellor after four terms.The SPDaposs recovery marks a tentative revival for centre-left parties in parts of Europe. Democrat Joe Biden is US President and Norway’s centre-left opposition party won an election earlier this month.The Social Democratsapos chancellor candidate, Olaf Scholz said he hoped to strike a coalition deal before Christmas.  But his conservative rival Armin Laschet said he could still try to form a government despite coming in second. Merkel will stay in charge in a caretaker role during the coalition negotiations that will set the future course of Europeaposs largest economy. Today, the parties will start sounding each other out about possible alliances in informal discussions. In order to secure a majority in parliament, the SPD is likely to seek an alliance with the Greens and the FDP, although the two parties could also team up with the conservatives. The SPD is in first place. We won the election, Lars Klingbeil, the SPD general secretary, told ARD television, adding that the party would fight to make sure Scholz becomes the next chancellor. The SPD will talk to the Greens and the FDP about forming the next government, he said, adding that party leadership was set to meet on Monday to discuss the next steps. If Scholz, , succeeds in forming a coalition, he would become the fourth post-war SPD chancellor after Willy Brandt, Helmut Schmidt and Gerhard Schroeder. Finance minister in Merkelaposs cabinet, he is a former mayor of Hamburg. But Laschet, , still hung on to the possibility that he could be chancellor, even though he led the conservatives to their worst ever election result.Ms Merkel was a giant on the European stage almost since taking office in  - when George W Bush was U.S. president, Jacques Chirac in the Elysee Palace in Paris and Tony Blair UK prime minister.But Berlinaposs allies in Europe and beyond will probably have to wait for months before they can see how the new German government will engage on foreign issues. Assuming the SPD agree a deal with the Greens and the FDP, the Greens could provide the foreign minister.  A row between Washington and Paris over a deal for Australia to buy US instead of French submarines has put Germany in an awkward spot between allies, but also gives Berlin the chance to help heal relations and rethink their common stance on China. On hearing that the SPD were slightly ahead in polls, US President Joe Biden told reporters in Washington: Iaposll be darned... Theyaposre solid. On economic policy, French President Emmanuel Macron is eager to forge a common European fiscal policy, which the Greens support but the CDU CSU and FDP reject. The Greens also want a massive expansion offensive for renewables”. One thing is certain: the future government will not include the far-right Alternative for Germanywhich scored .%. This was a fall from four years ago when they stormed into the national parliament with .% of the vote. All mainstream politicians rule out a coalition with the party.

But her comments have threatened to overshadow the start of Labouraposs annual conference in Brighton. Speaking at a reception for Labour members in the North West of England on Sunday night, she said: I’m sick of shouting from the sidelines and I bet youse lot are as well.  We cannot get any worse than a bunch of scum, homophobic, racist, misogynistic, absolute vile [inaudible] Banana Republic, vile, nasty, Etonian [inaudible] piece of scum.” She told the audience that she had held back a little. Tory MPs immediately seized on her words and demanded Ms Rayner apologise. But Ms Rayner doubled down, telling Sky News: I am not saying that anyone who voted for the Conservatives are racist, scummy and homophobic… I’m saying the Prime Minister has said those things and acted in that way. If the Prime Minister wants to apologise and remove himself from those comments he’s made that are homophobic, racist and misogynistic then I will apologise for calling him scummy.Mr Corbyn said she was right to go for the Government - rather than focusing on rule changes, in a jibe at his successor Keir Starmer.He told LBC: Angela uses her own words, sheaposs absolutely right to attack this government for the way itaposs treating people in our society. Britain now has more food banks and branches of McDonaldaposs, more children living in poverty, greater levels of inequality than ever before in my letime, and Angelaaposs right to go after Tories. I wish this whole conference was spending itaposs whole time going after the Tories rather than rule changes. I donapost think she has anything to apologise for. She speaks from the heart, sheaposs saying it like it needs to be said.  On Sunday, Mr Starmer repeatedly refused to sayMs Rayner should apologise. He told the BBC: “I take dferent approaches and that is not language I would use.” But he added: Iaposll talk to Angela about it later on Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said she would not have called Boris Johnsonaposs Government scum - but she claimed lots of people shared the sentiment. I understand why Angela Rayneraposs angry, we are all angry with what the Government are doing at our conference here in Brighton this week, Ms Reeves told Times Radio.I wouldnapost use that language but I think that sentiment is shared by many people who are struggling at the moment, queuing for petrol, who are worried about cuts to Universal Credit next month and worried about increases in taxes next year.The comments have triggered mutterings among Labour MPs at conference. One shadow minister told the Mirror: I wouldnapost have said it. It just makes us look daft.

As Labour conference began in Brighton, Ms Reeves told The Sunday Times: “I don’t have any plans to increase the rates of income tax. But she added: “I do think that people who get their income through wealth should have to pay more.” Mr Starmer appeared to slap down his colleague, telling the BBC: We are looking at tax - nothing is off the table, but we donapost know what the state of the national finances will be as we go to the election.  What Rachel Reeves said is sheaposs not currently considering income tax and that is fine, but what Iaposm saying is as we go into the election we will apply the principles we have set out to the situation as it arises. What we donapost want to do - whether itaposs income tax or any other sort of tax, national insurance - is unfairly to hit working families, which is what this Government is doing. Mr Starmer would not say whether he was considering a wealth tax. He said: Look at the choice the Government is making - under their provision, under their tax they announced the other week, those with many properties as landlords donapost pay a penny more, their working tenants do. It comes as party faithful gathered in Brighton for Labouraposs first in-person conference since . Mr Starmer is under pressure to outline his vision for Labour after nearly  months at the helm, with all eyes on his big speech on Wednesday. In an interview with the Sunday Mirror, he said Labour would scrap the charitable status of private schools to claw back £. billion for the state sector.He also told the BBC that Labour would not nationalise the biggest energy firms, in a major departure from his predecessor Jeremy Corbyn.Askedhe would nationalise the Big Six energy companies, he said: No. He was shown his  leadership campaign pledges, one of which states that public services should be in public hands and that he would support common ownership of rail, mail, energy and water. I donapost see nationalisation there, he said. When it comes to common ownership Iaposm pragmatic about this. I do not agree with the argument that says we must be ideological. He did not say what form common ownership would takeit was not nationalisation.

The Labour leader expressed delight as members backed a package of reforms at Labouraposs conference in Brighton, including a fully independent complaints process to tackle anti-Jewish hate. Members overwhelmingly backed rule changes proposed by the equalities watchdog, which found Labour had broken the law over its handling of anti-Semitism complaints. Labour published its plan for a major overhaul in response to the damning report by the Equalities and Human Right Commissioninto anti-Jewish hate in Labour ranks last year.At a reception for party activists, Mr Starmer said: We have closed the door this evening to anti-Semitism in the Labour Party.Weaposve turned our back on the dark chapter.  Having closed that door, that door will never be opened again in our Labour Party to anti-Semitism. We will be an inclusive, open, tolerant Labour Party proudly facing our country, proudly facing the world. The Board of Deputies of British Jews welcomed the new approach. Board of Deputies president Marie van der Zyl said: The result shows that Labour is on its way to banishing the anti-Semitism spectre that has hung over it for the past few years. While there is clearly still work to do, Labour must continue to demonstrate that it will not allow British Jews to feel marginalised in the party again. Former Labour MP Ruth Smeeth, from the Jewish Labour Movement, told delegates she felt sick being in Brighton as she feared receiving more abuse. But she struck a defiant tone as she insisted the party is turning the page on the blight of anti-Semitism that has infected the party, adding to the abusers: You failed. Weaposre still here. Ms Smeeth told delegates: I stand here with mixed emotions. Relief that we can finally turn the page on the blight of anti-Semitism that has infected our party. Anger that it has taken five years to get here. Disbelief that despite the hurt of so many Jewish members, there are people in here today who say it was all a smear. And sorrow that so many wonderful friends were forced to choose between their faith and their politics.  Ms Smeeth said this was her nd year at Labour Party conference, adding: And yet I feel sick at the idea of being in Brighton knowing that I will be a target for more racist abuse for being here. But Iaposm here to help deliver the promise that Keir made when he became leader. He promised the country he would root out the anti-Semitism that has infected our party and end the anti-Jewish hate which undermines the values we were founded to protect. It breaks my heart that racists thought they had a place in the Labour Party, that Jewish members, usually women, were threatened, abused and bullied every day not by the BNP or the EDL but by those who claimed to share our values. Ms Smeeth added: These racists tried to break Jewish members, to hound us out of our party and to scare us into silence. Well conference, I have news for them: you failed. Labour former minister Dame Margaret Hodge said there was enormous relief and immeasurable hope to every Labour Party member who has been a victim of vile anti-Jew hate. She added: My message is simple: never again. Never again can anti-Jew racism pollute our party. Never again can we become a hostile environment for Jews. Never again can the complaints process be manipulated with serious complaints ignored and victims silenced. After Dame Margaret finished her speech, a shout of apology for Palestinians could be heard in the hall with Mr Ferguson warning members to be respectful during the debate. Earlier, members also backed Mr Starmeraposs controversial changes to the party rulebook, which have angered some on the partyaposs left wing. Leadership candidates will now need the backing of % of MPs, or  on current numbers, to get onto the ballot paper. A scheme for registered supporters will be abandoned. And the bar for which MPs can face deselection will be raised from a third of members or trade unions affiliates to half of both groups.

Shadow Foreign Secretary Lisa Nandy said the party should take hope from the stunning result in the German elections where the centre-left Social Democratshave claimed victory over Angela Merkelaposs Christian Democratic Union . She said the result showed how quickly political tides can turn and expressed optimism for the next election. Boris Johnson won power until  but there has been speculation in Westminster that he could push for an early election in .Ms Nandy made the comments at a Labour conference event, where she also revealed plans to visit Israel and Palestine in her first official overseas trip as Shadow Foreign Secretary. Asked about the German election result, Ms Nandy said: The biggest lesson is never ever believe that itaposs not possible. We have been out of power in Westminster for  years. But we are in power in so many of the major towns and cities around this country. We are showing the dference we can make. She pointed to the extraordinary work done by local councils to house Afghan refugees over the summer. Never let them tell us that weaposre powerless. Never let them tell us that it canapost be done, she said. Look at whataposs happened in Germany. Look how quickly things change and things move.We think there is going to be a general election, possibly in .So we could be in power in  months time and that is the lesson that I take from what happened  months ago [the  election]. She urged Labour to go out with confidence and the courage of our convictions to win the next election. Boris Johnson has a profoundly cynical and pessimistic view of the people of this country despite his grand optimism, she said.You can see it in all the attempts to stoke ision in the country, the way in which he thought he could use the statue of Churchill to stoke some kind of culture war. Back home in Wigan people just said, aposWhataposs he going on about a statue for  Whataposs that got to do with anything apos She accused the PM of stereotyping all these areas where you can use racism and LGBT rights to stoke up ision. And she said Labour had to do more to fight for the silent majority and the quiet patriotism that they have rather than allowing the Tories to stoke the so-called culture war. In a wide-ranging event on foreign policy, Ms Nandy said she would urge her new opposite number Liz Truss to stop selling arms to Saudi Arabia. She also said the UK should use its diplomatic clout in the battle against climate change by shutting out countries from who refuse to sign up to green targets. And she restated her opposition to signing trade deals with countries that havenapost signed up to the Paris climate agreement. Ms Nandy criticised reports that the UK had dropped certain climate commitments to secure a free trade deal with Australia. She told delegates: That is precisely the wrong approach. We should be using trade as a tool to lt other countriesapos standards and to help pitch the world towards progress.

Jonathan Reynolds said in  he was “coming out” for the idea, which would see a set sum paid to everyone rich or poor.But speaking on the margins of Labour ’s party conference this afternoon, the Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary said while he was “interested” in UBI, it is not yet “in any way feasible”.He added: “I’ll always engage in the debate, but there’s obviously not a plan I can look at to implement and that’s not the conversation. “It’s how you take the best of that political debate and use it to build a genuinely real world, effective system for the future.” It’s understood the party is focusing on universal elements of the benefit system, and problems with Universal Credit, rather than a UBI.  His comments come despite Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham voicing support for UBI at the conference on Sunday night.Labour-led Wales is also due to pilot UBI, while Labour under Jeremy Corbyn promised in its  manesto to trial the idea.But Mr Reynolds said: “As far as I understand, Andy didn’t lay out an actual plan for UBI, just expressed an interest in it, last night. “If you look at any social security system in the world you’ve got elements of the universal… elements which are means tested… and wage insurance based bits. “So you’re trying to build a system out of these principles. There is no UBI plan on the shelf that you could just implement in the UK that’s in any way feasible. “But I think again, people come to the conversation because they share the aims and aspirations that many of us have as to how to fundamentally give people the protection they need.” Mr Reynolds said UBI was “really interesting” and could be “truer to the principles of social security” than the current system. But he said he had previously acknowledged “two huge problems” - whether it dilutes support for priority groups, and how housing costs are calculated.He added: “If you took the current money that’s spent on Universal Credit and its legacy predecessors and ide it by the population, it would be minuscule - it would be more like £ or £ a head on broad figures…“Could you take the current spending and deliver it - obviously not. It just wouldn’t be anywhere near sufficient.” It came after Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves unveiled a pledge to keep government borrowing under controlLabour win power. She told the conference: “We would put in place fiscal rules that will bind the next Labour government to ensure we always spend wisely and keep debt under control, so that we have the means to transform schools, hospitals and communities, and pay for investment in the new industries and jobs that our country desperately needs.” Read more Mr Reynolds was speaking at a fringe event titled ‘replacing Universal Credit with a living income’. In an earlier speech to conference he vowed to “replace Universal Credit with a better system”.He added: “When people receive a letter from the NHS they don’t fear it. The same cannot be said of the DWP. We are going to change that.” He said the new system could be based on the same basic IT infrastructure. “I’m more than satisfied we can build a better system onto that existing ,” he told the fringe event. He told the fringe event he had a timescale in mind about revealing more detail of what Labour’s system would look like. But he insisted his pledge to cut the taper rate - leaving working claimants with more money - had pulled the government to open private talks about doing the same. Mr Reynolds also said Labour will be chasing new opportunities in the Commons and the Lords to block the £-a-week UC cut. Despite the cut kicking in from October , he said talks are under way with peers adding: “I’ll pursue any opportunity I can.” Comment MORE ON Labour PartyJeremy CorbynAndy BurnhamHospitalsPensionsPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Today, we recognise the fight against corruption as a key plank of defending our national interest.  Friends, the next Labour Government will introduce a new arms export regime that is truly transparent and committed to upholding international law. We will end arms sales to Saudi Arabia. We will introduce an Act of Parliament so companies have a duty to eliminate forced labour from their supply chains and face financial penaltiesthey fail. Under a Labour Government, British shelves will never be stocked with the products of modern slavery. We will end cotton imports from Xinjiang. On the new partnership with Europe, Ms Nandy said: We will bring an end to a decade of ision. Starting with Europe. We are out of the EU, but we remain part of Europe. Comrades, even a Government that believes the sea can be closed cannot deny the reality of our geography.

We will work with EU partners to develop a new action plan for conflict prevention and peacebuilding, to face up to the challenges in places like Somalia, Yemen, and Tigray.

The First Minister of Wales praised Labour for achieving so much across the four nations despite being at the teeth of Boris Johnsonaposs cabinet. But he called on his peers to turn thought into practical action on the road to power in Westminster. Speaking after a raucous applause, Mr Drakeford said: Everything Labour has achieved in Wales, across England and in Scotland, has been achieved in the teeth of one of the most awful UK Governments we have ever seen. Incompetent to its core and automatically hostile to anyone who does not share its visceral reactionary instincts at home or abroad.  In a sly dig at Sir Keir Starmeraposs indecisiveness on devolution, Mr Drakeford added: Just imagine what we could dowe had a UK Labour Government committed to renewing and rebuilding the United Kingdom so it genuinely worked for everyone.

The poll took place on September - - before the fuel crisis gripped Britain and before the start of the Labour Party Conference.

He told the Mirroraposs Labour News Agenda that leaving the promises to an election campaign was too late.I think we will have to accelerate that up to about Christmas, and I say that because there are some rumours we might be having a general election next year, and we have to be ready, he said. The public have to kind of hear about Labour policy long before itaposs in the manesto. One of the problems we had at the last general election is that we were announcing things like free broadband and a  day week and they were like, aposhang on, I didnapost know about that, how is that costed, I didnapost ask for thatapos and we donapost want to be in that situation again.  It comes as party figures piled pressure on the Mr Starmer to show the country what Labour stands for. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, who has been tipped as a future leader, told a fringe event that Labour needed to become doers rather than sayers. Mr Burnham went on: Deeds rather than words as the famous suffragettes from our city said. Buy into devolution and you can start doing deeds and not words. And it makes politics more meaningful for people. He added: We’ve got to win hearts and minds back in the north. We’ve been pushed a little outside. The party has’t yet decided what itaposs really doing about English devolution. It needs to decide. The north of England is a bit of le raft for the Labour party. Dan Jarvis, who is stepping down as Sheffield City Region Mayor next year, said Labour needed to be clearer on its offer to voters to win back former Red Wall seats. “The reality is that the levelling up agenda is underpinned by smoke and mirrors. There isn’t a plan, there isn’t the transformative resources in place,” he told a conference event. “I think we need to be clear about what’s our story, what’s our offer to the people in the north of England ”  To win back seats that fell to the Tories in the former Red Wall, he said Labour needed to be clearer on its offer to voters. Mr Jarvis said: “We need to go into the next general election and be clear about what we stand for, to make sure they trust us on those big issues about which they previously had a thousand concerns, and have a very clear retail offer about the kind of investment we are going to put into the north of England.”He said he was “optimistic we can make very signicant progress” - as he said voters in the north had buyersapos remorse over backing Boris Johnson in .Mr Jarvis, who has been touted in the past as a possible leader, said he wouldnapost mind ato the front bench. “I want to do my bit from parliament, supporting the leader, hopefully on the front benchheoffers me a job, he said. Senior Labour figures have told the Mirror they believe this week is a make or break moment for Mr Starmer as he attempts to show the country what he stands for. His aides insisted he had already shown steel by pushing through radical changes to internal rules and could now turn his gaze outwards to the country.But London Mayor Sadiq Khan said Labour needs to stop internal fighting to have a chance of winning the real prize of power at the next general election.Comment MORE ON Labour Party ConferenceKeir StarmerSadiq KhanAndy BurnhamDan JarvisDavid LammyLabour PartyPoliticsChristmas party\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Currently graduates on ‘Plan ’ loans pay % of anything they earn above £, a year to fund the cost of their university degree.But Chancellor Rishi Sunak is reportedly considering a swingeing cut in this threshold to raise billions extra for the public finances.It would add to the cost of living crisis for -something Brits, who also face a £ rise in the energy price cap and a National Insurance hike. The  Augar review - which is being studied closely by the government - recommended a £, cut in the threshold at which graduates repay. This would add £ a year to graduates’ repayments. But sources told the FT it could be cut even further. The newspaper even raised the prospect of a £, threshold - adding more than £ a year too bills - though this was considered “a bit low”. A source told the newspaper “the plan” is to lower the threshold in the Chancellor’s Spending Review and Budget at the end of October.The  Augar review argued the  decision to raise thresholds from £k to £k added £.bn a year of costs to the Treasury. It also reduced the average student’s contribution over their letime from % to %, with many loans never paid back. The review said at the time: “The current repayment threshold of £, is higher than the median graduate salary three years after graduation of £, . “And [it is] also in excess of the median earnings of all working age non-graduates which is around £, . “We question the justication for a system which excludes so much of a borrower’s earnings from any repayment and which helps to reinforce the “no win, no pay” element in student choice.  “We believe that there should be a stronger expectation that student contributions will be made once a financial benefit is secured. “For students in degree-level education we therefore recommend that the most suitable threshold is median non-graduate earnings. “In - prices, this would mean reducing the threshold from £, to £,.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “The student loan system is designed to ensure all those with the talent and desire to attend higher education are able to do so, whilst ensuring that the cost of higher education is fairly distributed between graduates and the taxpayer. “We continue to consider the recommendations made by the Augar  carefully alongside driving up quality of standards and educational excellence and ensuring a sustainable and flexible student finance system.” Comment MORE ON The TreasuryEducationSchools\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Kevin Courtney, NEU Joint General Secretary, said Covid- had shone a grim light on child poverty in the UK. He said teachers had seen shocking levels of poverty during Zoom classes during the national lockdowns - with some pupils struggling to learn as they lacked basic supplies. Speaking at a joint NEU Mirror event at Labouraposs annual conference, Mr Courtney said it was “absolutely inexcusable” that children live in such poverty that they lacked pens and paper. “Covid has thrown a new light on poverty. It didn’t create it though,” he said.  He described children forced into cramped conditions, trying to learn without proper IT equipment or working in a room with lots of family members. “Staff have looked inside children’s homes through a Zoo link, through a Teams link… having seen that you can’t unsee it.” The Mirror has teamed up with the NEU to stamp out child poverty and ensure that no child is left behind. Vital school supplies were sent out to schools through our joint Help a Child to Learn campaign, kick-started by a major £million donation from the NEU. Mr Courtney told delegates how  out of  members had dipped into their own pockets to buy supplies, school unorms or even food for struggling children. Shadow Child Poverty Secretary Wes Streeting spoke movingly about how his nursery teachers bought him a Victoria sponge cake so he would have something on his birthday as his mum couldn’t afford it. “I will remember that to this very day and I will be grateful to those staff for the rest of my le,” he said. “I want to say to all the staff who have put their hands in their pockets, please do not think children will not remember that.” Mr Streeting, who grew up on a council estate in East London, was reliant on free school meals growing up.  And he recalled his own mum going without so her family had enough to eat. But he said he was afraid things were “worse than when I was growing up in the s”.Mr Streeting said Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak were not “cartoon villains”, but added: “They don’t understand what le is like for most people in this country.“If they did, there is no way they would be taking £ a week out of the pockets of some of the poorest working families in our country. “There is no way they would be plunging , children into poverty.” Cllr Louise Atkinson, a primary school teacher and local councillor in Carlisle, said the impact of deprivation “lasts a letime”. Growing up in the s, her family were often homeless and reliant on free school meals. She was bullied for not having the right unorm and her mum would go without food to ensure the children had food on the table. Some people are struggling to understand how important that £ uplt is because it’s a bottle of Merlot to some people,” she told delegates. “When you haven’t lived like that, that £ goes a really long way when that’s all you’ve got.”Cllr Anntoinette Bramble, deputy leader of LGA Labour, said the Government needed to step in urgently to end child poverty.She told the event: “As one of the richest countries in the world, we should be saying from a powerful , ‘This is what we want for our children, this is what we want for our families… We see ourselves as sophisticated and world-leading.

Forty-six years on, the heiress and journalist is presumed dead, but her fate is still unknownJuanita Nin disappeared on th July,  and has never been seen since Image: Fairfax Media via Getty ImagesByJessica TaylorReal le features writer:,  Sep | commentsWhen Juanita Nin went to the Carousel nightclub for a morning meeting on  July, , she had expected to discuss advertising. But the -year-old journalist and heiress to a multi-million dollar department store fortune was never seen again - and to this day, her fate is unknown. Nin, from the Kings Cross district of Sydney, Australia, owned a fortnightly newspaper NOW and was known as a prominent campaigner in the area. Her dad, Neil Donovan Smith, was the heir to the Mark Foyaposs department store chain and Nin worked at Mark Foyaposs in her earlier career.  In the early s, Ninaposs dad financed her takeover of NOW newspaper, where she modelled hair and clothes - and started a campaign that is widely believed to be behind her vanishing. Victoria Street campaign As owner of the newspaper, Nin started a campaign against a high-profile development in Kings Cross proposed by property developer Frank Theeman. The  million plans involved evicting dozens of people from their homes in Victoria Street which were due to be demolished and replaced by three high-rise towers. Residents in the houses due to be destroyed fiercely campaigned against the development and refused to leave their homes. When Nin heard about their campaign, she used NOW newspaper to support it. But while the residents fought against the development, they became targets of harassment by Theeman and his men - including former cop Fred Krahe, who is widely believed to have been corrupt.  In , the residents lobbied the Buildersapos Labourers Federation to impose a green ban on the Victoria Street site, protecting the area from development. But by , the BLF lted the ban, leaving the residents on their own to fight the development. Itaposs widely believed that the union was bribed by the developers. Stepping in to come to their rescue, Nin convinced the Water Board Union to impose another green ban - creating another problem for the developers. Carousel nightclub The Carousel nightclub in the Kings Cross district was owned by notorious organised crime boss Abe Saffron. Saffronaposs son, Alan, has since claimed that his dad had lent large sums of money to Victoria Street property developer Frank Theeman.  On th June, two employees from the nightclub knocked on Ninaposs door under the guise of discussing advertising in NOW newspaper. But Ninaposs business partner and boyfriend David Farrell answered the door instead - so Nin was invited to Carousel for an advertising meeting four days later. But in a  police interview, it was revealed that Carousel employees Edward Frederick Eddie Trigg and Shayne Martin-Simmonds had actually tried to kidnap Nin on th June and take her to see people who wanted to talk to her. Martin-Simmonds said the plan was to: Just grab her arms and stop her calling out, no real rough stuff, no gangster stuff. We thought that just two guys telling her to come would be enough to make her thinkshe didnapost come she might get hurt. On  July, Nin set off for the am meeting at Carousel, but phoned David Farrell at . to tell him she was running late.  Loretta Crawford, secretary to Eddie Trigg, claimed Nin arrived for the meeting and said she was hungover from the night before. She shook Triggaposs hand and went upstairs to his office. This was the last time Juanita Nin was ever seen. Unsolved mystery On July ,, Ninaposs handbag was found on a freeway near Penrith in the west of the city, but there was no sign of the journalist. In , Eddie Trigg, Shayne Martin-Simmonds and another Carousel employee, Lloyd Marshall, were charged with conspiracy to kidnap Nin on June  . The three were tried in , but Marshall was acquitted on lack of evidence. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on Martin-Simmonds and Trigg, so a retrial was ordered the following year. In , Martin-Simmonds was convicted and jailed for two years - but Trigg was long gone and had fled to the USA on a fake passport. Trigg was finally apprehended in San Francisco in . He was extradited to Australia where he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to kidnap and jailed for three years in .  Despite these convictions, no one has ever been brought to justice over Ninaposs actual disappearance on th July . A coronial inquest was opened in  which found Nin was most likely dead - but there wasnapost enough evidence to say how she died or where her remains were. Familyaposs grief Forty-six years on from Ninaposs disappearance, her loved ones still have no idea exactly what happened to the journalist, or where her body is. In June this year, New South Wales police offered an enormous reward of  million Australian Dollars for information that would help solve the mystery of what happened to her. Ninaposs cousin, Francis Foy, appealed for information alongside the police reward offer, claiming the family just wanted answers. He said: Juanita was very much loved by her family and very much missed. Her disappearance and the unknown of what happened to her caused incredible pain for her family.

But there’s more to it. A team of Cambridge researchers has shown teens who are bullied fantasise about being violent. They go further – experiencing bullying and aggression in late ­adolescence and early adulthood is likely to lead to daydreams or fantasies about hurting or killing people, and seeking revenge for being bullied. An international team working in Zurich tracked the thoughts and ­experiences of , young people at the ages of ,  and . They focused on bullying over the past  months and violent thoughts in the past  days. Questionnaires probed their darkest fantasies and levels of aggressionand imagined targets . The team, led by a University of Cambridge professor, Manuel Eisner, Director of Cambridge’s Violence Research Centre, also delved into  forms of victimisation. They included taunts, physical attacks and sexual harassment by peers, aggressive parenting – yelling, slapping, hitting with a belt – and dating violence such as being ­pressured into sex. Suffering a range of mistreatment was closely associated with a greater likelihood of thinking about killing, attacking or humiliating others. Males were prone to violent thinking so among -year-old boys who hadn’t been victimised in the preceding year, the probability of violent fantasies in the past month was %. Those who listed five forms of victimisation had an % probability of having had violent fantasies. For those who listed  it was %. Among girls the same age, no victimisation experience had a violent fantasy ­probability of %, which increased to % in those who listed five types of mistreatment, and % in those who said they had suffered . “One way to think about fantasies is as our brain rehearsing future scenarios,” said Professor Eisner. “About % of all -year-old boys and % of girls reported having at least one fantasy of killing a person they know during the past  days – close to one in five of all the study participants at that age. “These thoughts may be deeply troubling to those who experience them,” he said. They found that socio-economic status, financial troubles or parental separation played little role in violent fantasy rates. It’s the dference between conditions that make people angry and upset, and those that make people vengeful. Reassuringly, violent thoughts dropped by the age of  when only % of young men and .% of women had thoughts about killing someone they know in the past month.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Bullying\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Richard Aldrich and Rory Cormac are set to release a new book The Secret Royals: Spying and the Crown, from Victoria to Diana. It uncovers the relationship between the Royal Family and the intelligence community, from the reign of Queen Victoria to the death of Princess Diana. In an extract from the forthcoming book the authors detail how le was made dficult for the security forces tasked with protecting Diana and Charles while their marriage was falling apart. The pair claim that when Charles drove his Aston Martin from Highgrove to visit Camilla Parker Bowles, he was aposalways partnered by his Special Branch officer, Colin Trimming.apos  Meanwhile, when Diana visited her lover James Hewitt, her security officer was said to have slept downstairs on the sofa while they were upstairs.  In an extract published by the Mail Online the authors wrote: Not surprisingly, Charles and Diana became intensely secretive and at times tried to evade their own security. Diana was the worst. Even early in her marriage, she became rather good at giving her own security the slip. Like an intelligence operative, she knew how to elude her tail. This caused periodic panics when royal flunkies realised she had slid out to go shopping down the King’s Road protected only by a pair of stylish sunglasses. After the couple separated, she was even more reckless. In the Austrian mountain resort of Lech, she evaded her protection team by making a night-time leap into deep snow off a first-floor balcony at her hotel and then going for a walk. Her protection officer later asked her: ‘Ma’am, what were you thinking ’ He left her service, and thereafter she dispensed with routine police protection — a dangerous strategy indeed. The Secret Royals: Spying and the Crown, from Victoria to Diana is authored by Richard Aldrich and Rory Cormac and will be published by Atlantic on October .

It sounded like a massive lorry was going past the hotel and then it got really loud, she told the Mirror. You just felt things shaking. I looked at my son and we both said aposthat’s an earthquakeapos. Then people just started screaming and running out of the restaurant. I didn’t expect people to react like that but I’ve never been in an earthquake.Were you affected by the earthquake  Let us know at webnews@mirror Some people really looked terried and I just sat there and had another bite of my croissant and said aposkeep calm, itaposs going to be fineapos. Michiela was with her twin son and daughter, Damien and Rebecca, aged , with the latter having learning dficulties. She said due to years of helping to keep her daughter calm, as well as her work as a police officer, she didnapost want to overreact.  I initially thought the windows smashed but it must have been glasses on the tables, she continued. The hotel staff then escorted everyone to an RVP point in a car park across the road. There were kids crying but I think that’s more the reaction of people screaming and running, that frightened them, Michiela explained.  With a manager announcing that it would be an hour before people could re-enter the hotel while they carried out safety checks, the mum and her kids went onto the beach. We were sitting on the beach and we felt an aftershock, and that was quite weird, said Michiela, who is originally from Harlow, Essex, but now living in Suffolk since retiring in December. We were lying on the sun-beds and you felt the beach underneath you start shaking, but it wasn’t as strong as the first one.  Less than an hour later they were back round the pool at the hotel and it was like nothing happened, she added. The mum and her children are due to fly back to the UK on Tuesday after two weeks. Michiela said it was sad to hear that one person had lost their le as a result of the quake. They were killed after the dome of the Church of Prophet Elias in the town of Arkalochori - which appears to be the worst hit area - collapsed trapping three workers inside, reports protothema.gr. Another person in the village of Patsideros was trapped inside his own home due to rubble outside his front door before being rescued. Several older buildings were severely damaged, while other structures crumbled, with at least nine people injured, according to local reports.

He must pay the full compensation to the hotel within six monthsRoss James Ferris has to pay nearly £, to the hotel Image:Tony PalmerByTony PalmerChiara Fiorillo:,  Sep | commentsA Scotland fan who jumped naked from a fourth-floor hotel window after his nationaposs - draw with England during Euro  has been ordered to pay nearly £, in compensation. Ross James Ferris, , suffered a psychotic episode after an alcohol and cocaine binge. The electrician ripped a window frame out of the wall at the four-star hotel and wrecked his room, causing £, worth of criminal damage. He ripped a TV bracket and trouser press off the wall, smashed mirrors, and covering much of the bathroom in his own blood. The court heard Ferris then assaulted police as they tried to handcuff him in the street. Ferris, from Cowdenbeath, Fe, pleaded guilty to damaging his room at the Corus Hotel, Lancaster Gate, Bayswater, near Londonaposs Hyde Park on June . He also pleaded guilty to three counts of assaulting three police officers, two he spat at and a third who suffered a cut and swelling to their hand, during the struggle to handcuff him.  Ferris, who was supported at Southwark Crown Court by his we and parents, also pleaded guilty to possessing a small amount of cocaine police found in his hotel room. Prosecutor James Marsland told the court: The hotel manager was alerted to damage being caused to one of the rooms, which had a broken window and items being thrown from it. The police were called and they found Ferris had barricaded himself in and by the time officers gained access Ferris had jumped from the window. The TV bracket and trouser press had been ripped from the wall, windows were smashed, mirrors were smashed and there was blood in the room and the bathroom. Officers in the street saw Ferris emerge from the window and jump onto a conservatory with a glass roof below and then down to the street. He was naked and he had to be tasered by the police and held down by multiple officers and he was shouting and struggling. The police concede Ferris appeared to be in the grip of some kind of mental breakdown. The prosecutor said: He thought the police were there to hurt him and there was talk of grenades. He spat at two police officers and caused an injury to anotheraposs hand, a small cut and swelling caused by Ferris struggling with the handcuffs on. Ferris was questioned in police custody the next day. The prosecutor said: Having sobered up he said he had been drinking and taking cocaine and suffered an episode where he thought everyone was out to get him and feared for his le. Ferris had convictions for assault in  and assaulting police in February , the court heard. His lawyer Roger Sahotra told the court: This was a drug-induced psychosis that he brought on himself and is not an excuse, but an explanation. He is truly ashamed and found it very, very dficult to view the CCTV of himself. He apologises to the police and to the hotel staff for the distress and damage he caused and has offered to make restitution for the damage. He has emailed the hotel and his father has visited the hotel. Mr Ferris owns his own business and is in a loving relationship. He is a loving father and son and the balance of his mind was not right at the time. He should abstain from alcohol permanently and use of cocaine could cause a repeat and damage to his health. Ferris has since become teetotal and refrained from taking cocaine, the court heard. Judge Alexander Milne QC sentenced Ferris to six months imprisonment, suspended for two years and ordered him to complete  hours of community service work. He must also pay the full compensation to the hotel within six months. The judge told Ferris: As you recognise it was a shameful pattern of activity that must have been stressful for those that had to deal with you and clean up the room after you. The damage to the room is horrendous and the behaviour in the street was horrendous. This was bizarre and I accept for the most part out of character and a result of the dreadful reaction you had to the illegal drug you took that evening.Otherwise you are a responsible father, businessman and employer.You are somebody capable of getting your le back into proper shape and you seriously wish to correct what you have done.

But the couple from Ipswich, Suffolk, who both taught English and had no children, invested wisely in a wide portfolio of share ISAs, amassing a small fortune. Mr Dumper who was known as Bob had left most of his estate to his we after he died aged  in April  after battling Parkinsonaposs disease. But he specied in his will that the bulk of his wealth should be split between eight charitiesJoyce had died before him. Mrs Dumper respected her husbandaposs last wishes that good causes should benefit from their respective deaths, when she drew up her will. Probate records reveal that she left an estate worth £,, with most of her fortune going to the same eight charities nominated by her husband and two more chosen by her. The couple who were married for  years were both known as dedicated teachers who devoted their lives to education before retiring in . Mr Dumper taught at a prep school and grammar school before joining the School of Commerce and Social Studies in Ipswich in , which later became Ipswich Civic College, where he remained until retirement. He was said to be known for many years for his trademark red suits and his bright shirts and ties. Mrs Dumper taught English at Everton College in Ipswich before moving to nearby Kesgrave Hall School. The couple remained friends with many of their pupils and students, and enjoyed an active retirement taking regular holidays around Europe and further afield. But instead of flying first class, they joined tour groups to make their money go further and because they enjoyed meeting new people. As their investments grew, the couple continued to live in their three-bedroom s house in Ipswich which was worth around £,. Their friend Rowell Bell, a former pupils of Mrs Dumper who was an executor of her will, said: They were both brilliant teachers and lovely people. They did so much for so many people during their lives and now they have done something marvellous for a large number of charities. I wrote to people on their Christmas card list after Joyce died, and got a call from one woman whose husband was taught by Bob and had stayed in touch with him. Apparently, her husband was a lad of  who had gone off the rails, but Bob had got him back on the straight and narrow, and he had gone on to be very successful. He and Joyce were great fun and loved entertaining their friends at parties. They were also great film buffs and loved music. But they came from fairly humble backgrounds and lived relatively frugal lives. They only had a small oven and fridge and a tiny kitchen in their home and even their sherry was a cheap iety.  They travelled widely in retirement and had trips to New Zealand, Singapore, China and Egypt as well as all around Europe. But they always went on tour groups which were a cheaper option and because they enjoyed meeting and talking to other people. They both had pensions and they always invested their money wisely, moving money around dferent shares. They were really quite canny. They excelled at whatever they put their minds to and their sparkle lives on in the memories we share. As Joyce wrote: aposDonapost cry because it is over, smile because it happenedapos. Probate records reveal that Mrs Dumper left £,, to be split equally between the same eight national and local charities nominated by her late husband, with each receiving £,.The charities benefiting are the Marie Curie Memorial Foundation, British Heart Foundation, St Elizabeth Hospice in Ipswich, the British Diabetic Association, Arthritis and Rheumatism Council for Research, Age UK, Stroke Association and Royal National Leboat Institution.In addition, she left £, each to the British Red Cross Society and World Cancer Research Fund. There were also gts of £, each to two friends. Hannah Bloom, director of income generation at St Elizabethaposs Hospice, said the coupleaposs donation would help fund nurses providing end of le care. She added: We are delighted that Mr and Mrs Dumper have thought of the hospice in their will and to receive such a generous gt is fantastic. We know that demand for our specialist end of le care is increasing and such generosity will enable us to be here for those who need us today, as well as in the future. Amber French, the RNLIaposs area lesaving manager for Suffolk, said the organisation was immensely grateful for its most generous gt. She added: Like so many other charities, our ability to fundraise in person has been hit hard by the pandemic, so this legacy will help keep our boats well maintained and our volunteer crews trained to the highest standard and in the best kit to do their job and save lives at sea. Anne Hillion, legacy and in-memory lead for Suffolk at the Marie Curie Memorial Foundation, said: Mr and Mrs Dumper will make a dference long into the future, and their gt will help Marie Curie to be there for people through all aspects of death, dying, and bereavement. The gt may also go towards funding important research into end-of-le care, or may help us to campaign for change to create a better end of le for all. Mr and Mrs Dumperaposs legacy will be providing comfort, care and compassion for people long into the future. The coupleaposs ashes are set to be scattered at a beauty spot on the Rive Alde, Suffolk, on October .

Drivers trailing petrol tankers. Talk of the Army being called in. It’s clear the Government’s message to keep calm and carry on has fallen on deaf ears when it comes to what has become a national fuel shortage crisis. What began as an isolated number of forecourts running out ballooned into hundreds within hours as motorists rushed to fill up their cars rather than risk being left without. It’s important to remember that now, as then, there is no shortage of fuel itself - or at least at the refineries where it comes from. The situation has been caused by a lack of lorry drivers, something that has plagued the industry for years but which has been signicantly worsened by, first, Brexit, and then the Covid crisis. Have you been forced to queue for hours to get fuel  Let us know in the comments below  The ‘just in time’ nature of deliveries for fuel and much  besides meant that it didn’t take much for a slight worsening of the trucker shortage of late to spill over into the crisis we see now. The Government has - like on so many occasions - been wrong-footed. Talk of temporary visas for lorry drivers is too little too late to deal with the here and now.  Ministers will no doubt be hoping that, after the initial rush of panic buying, demand will naturally begin to ease. After all, you can only fill up the tank of your car to the brim once. That’s dferent to the panic buying of food and toilet rolls we saw at the start of the Covid pandemic.  For those able to work from home, the current shortages are a distraction. But those who have to get about by car - whether for work or necessary school trips - it is proving a nightmare. Then there are key workers, from care staff to NHS employees to teachers, where not being able to travel by car can have huge implications. Petrol stations normally have reserves for emergency services but it is hit-and-miss for off-duty essential workers. For now, many people are glued to social media looking for updates from others flagging up where and when fuel deliveries arrive. This could turn out to be a short-lived crisis that soon blows over. But the fundamental issues, from a lack of lorry drivers to a rotten public transport system that forces many people to drive, will stay with us for much longer.

Andrew Dellbridge, who runs Ace Pest Control, says rodents the size of cats are on the loose in Norwich. He says rats are now bigger and braver than before lockdown. One couple Andrew worked with were run out of their home by an infestation, he said. Another client found a giant rat swimming in her toilet bowl, which he says is starting to happen more often.She’d been using the bathroom and heard a noise. She looked down and it was in the toilet bowl. And this is happening more and more frequently,” he told Norwich Evening News. “They used to work around us but now they’re gaining access they wouldn’t have attempted before.”  Andrew - who has employed more staff to control the rats - blames the surge on overflowing bins. He said: “Because of the throwaway culture we have the rubbish is just piling up and feeding them. “Rats are letting themselves into people’s houses and businesses.” Norwich City Council explained how infestations can be avoided. “Try not to feed your pets outdoors,you do, make sure you’re present when feeding them, and remove any remaining food afterwards, the council said.  “People that have seen rats near their property should avoid feeding wildle as this is a food source for rodents too.” Meanwhile, Andrewaposs company are urging Brits to keep their toilet seats down and to plug up holes in windows and garage doors. This will give rats no way of entering the home, meaning they will stay outside.Another pest controller last year warned coronavirus lockdowns could brew a perfect storm for rat infestations in British homes.Jenny Rathbone, her firm pest see a  per cent surge in rat reports for the winter months. In November , an enormous rat measuring  inches from nose to tail was found in a Bournemouth property. Experts say it is the biggest rat ever caught in Britain.Pest control expert Terry Walker, who caught the rodent, said the creatures are growing because humans are throwing out more waste which includes fattier products, the Independent reports.Comment MORE ON Giant rats\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Lois McIntyre, had her first child as a teenager and lived with her mum for the first  months after her relationship with her dad broke down. Struggling to cope with arguments at home and the separation from her partner, who lived with his own mum, Lois moved into her first council house at .Now , she runs a successful Instagram account and has proved those, who judged her at becoming a young mum, wrong. Lois from Huyton, Merseyside, told th e Liverpool Echo about her first night after she moved into a council house just her and her baby. Do you have a story you think we should cover  Email us at webnews@mirror She said: Oh, it was horrible. It was horrible. It was just like, it all just hit me at once. Obviously, Iaposd become a mum when I was young and then Iaposd had a bit of support from my mum. I was living in her house and I was doing the cleaning. I didnapost know the first thing about being a mum and then all of a sudden, I was in my own flat and I had this baby, and it was just horrible. I remember thinking, aposHow am I going to do this apos  Lois said she had no idea how to set a budget or make her money stretch and has suffered with anxiety and depression, and previously with bulimia, which stems from when she was pregnant. She said: I was walking around school heavily pregnant. I think my anxiety started there, because everyone had quite an opinion on me. I always wanted to prove everyone wrong. I think you hear the words, aposyoung mumapos, aposLiverpoolapos and aposcouncil houseapos in the same sentence, and you have this stereotype of what that person is going to be like. I always wanted to prove them wrong. Like I always remember everyone saying, aposOh, her mum will have that kid all the timeapos or, aposShe wonapost have nothingapos, and itaposs just totally dferent now. Ten years the mum-of-four now inspires other women with her home. Her Instagram account, HomeLeWithLois, shows photos of Lois and her partneraposs glamorous home and her journey renovating it since the time when she aposcried for about a monthapos after first moving in. Lois used to look at home accounts on the social media  and felt aposdepressedapos and aposjealousapos seeing expensive renovations. She said: All these home accounts, theyaposre all big, fancy houses and theyaposre all mortgaged houses and brand new builds. The mum of three girls and one boy added: I thought, aposI wish my house was like thatapos, or aposI wish I could afford to go out and buy things like that to make my house look like thatapos. Iaposve come to realise that you donapost need to go out and buy a £, kitchen and have it fitted. You can literally go and spend £ and have a kitchen like that. Lois shares her advice on budget home makeovers and cleaning with her followers, who she says are mostly single mums.  She even does cleaning videos just to help take her mind of mental health problems, helping both herself and her audience in the process. The account took off, gaining over , followers in two months. [My house] is just a little council house, and I think thataposs why a lot of people relate to it, because it just goes to show that you donapost have to have a big house. I think most of my followers are single mums and people who havenapost got quite a lot of money, and are trying to budget the stuff to have a nice house. You can go into my bathroom and itaposs all tiles, but most of them are just stick-on tiles that cost me £ off Amazon. So I think thataposs how it originally took off when I was putting all the budget stuff on. It started getting shared and people were tagging people into it. Now Lois has almost , followers and receives messages from people who knew her as a pregnant -year-old. She said: A lot of people who I went to school with now follow me on my home account. Message requests are constantly packing all the time with people texting me saying they canapost believe how far Iaposve come. They say, aposOh I remember you walking around school with your big pregnant belly, and now look at youapos. The inspiring young woman added: Iaposve got four kids now, and Iaposm still with the same partner. Weaposve been together for years. So itaposs just nice to see that Iaposve gone from this young mum, not having a clue about anything, to now being this hands-on mum who knows everything about anything.

Mark, who works at Asdaaposs Chaucer Road store in Sheffield, said: The front door to his ground floor flat was unlocked but the security chain was on and I could see his feet on the floor. In the end I used a screwdriver to break the chain and the neighbour and I managed to get in. The gentleman had become dizzy and collapsed. Heaposd been there all night and was shaking. We got him a drink and covered him up to make sure he was warm and waited with him until the ambulance arrived, which wasnapost too long.  Adrenaline kicked in and I just did what I had to do. It was lucky that I called when I did as he could have laid there for perhaps days and the situation could have been much worse. Iaposve been back to see him since and heaposs now on medication and is fine. He was very appreciative of what we did that day. Markaposs been nominated for an Asda service superstar award, and the storeaposs online trading manager Spencer Parkes said: Weaposre all so proud of Mark – heaposs potentially saved someoneaposs le.

Markaposs a lovely guy who builds up relationships with his customers and will do anything for anyone, so what he did is no surprise. To be fair, all our drivers here would have done the same too. People were impressed with Markaposs quick thinking and heaped praise on the delivery driver. Amazing and what a good company for recognising him wonderful. Some companies have the drivers dropping off so fast they wouldnapost have heard the man, said one. Another added: Well done Mark! Need more like you! This is another reason why shouldnapost have got rid of Milkman. Ours was invaluable at times of need! Others said: Well done Mark, just glad you were there at the right time and it was a good outcome and the gentleman is fine. Well deserved award. Keep up the good work that you do for everyone.

Agnes Malcolmson has been left with a crater where her conservatory should be after handing £, to A Contracts.She is one of dozens of customers who have paid out thousands to the Glasgow -based firm in recent months but been left with nothing, Daily Record reports.A dossier has been compiled by Trading Standards after being contacted by scores of families who paid deposits thought to total about £,. Staff nurse Agnes, who once tackled a man who set himself alight in hospital, should have been enjoying the summer in her new conservatory after working hard on the frontline during the Covid- crisis. Agnes, , from Glasgow’s Carntyne, has been left with a huge hole covered by old boards after reluctantly writing off the £, she paid out to A.  She said: “This was supposed to be helping me de-stress but I’ve been going off my head. I’m really depressed about it. “I’m not going to let A kid me on any more. I’m not stupid and I know I’m not going to get anything back. The police have been out to me and took a statement.” In , Agnes received ­accolades, including a Pride of Britain Outstanding Bravery award, after she and hospital worker Danny Turner ­overpowered a man who walked into Glasgow Royal Infirmary, set himself on fire and headed towards a maternity ward. Agnes hurled him to the floor before battling to put the fire out, saving his le. When she picked up her award, she told host Carol Vorderman: “My only thought was for the safety of the babies. ”Now working in a care home, Agnes said she had been left in turmoil over her ­dealings with A. She added: “I signed the contract in April and handed over £, in two instalments.  “It was supposed to be done for the end of July for me to relax in, but I’ve just got a big U-shaped hole with a base of cement.” It was meant to double up as an extra room for Agnes to sleep in because she has given up her bedroom to her -year-old daughter, who has learning dficulties, and is bedding down in her living room. We told in August how Trading Standards was probing A and we were then contacted by a string of customers. One said they had paid £, for an extension but were left with only partial foundations. Others told us they had alerted police after the firm’s website and social media was shut down amid a barrage of negative online reviews. One dad, from Fe, said he paid more than £, for a new sunroom and a mum from Aberdeenshire paid more than £, for an extension – neither of which was started. Trading Standards said complaints included allegations of “poor workmanship, failure to commence or complete work, failure to provide refunds when requested and the ­provision of misleading ­information”.  A director Stephen Hughes, , has left a trail of misery for years, with dozens of customers claiming in  that they have lost cash through his heating firm Green Deal Rewards. He went on trial in  accused of offences in the north-east and Highlands linked to Celsius Energy ­Solutions but the case was thrown out after a sherf ruled only a handful of charges could be put to a jury. Hughes told us Trading Standards had “sought to destroy” his latest firm when it contacted his customers earlier this year, leading to a string of jobs being cancelled.He said Brexit and Covid had caused delays in some projects but the firm had been managing the issue. He insisted his accounts were due to be closed next month but was adamant he is not closing the business.He said: “I cannotfunds to anybody, not only because I don’t know who these people are and what the basis of their complaint is, I am simply unable to access all the relevant areas of my business due to this investigation.” Police Scotland confirmed it is investigating reports of “alleged fraudulent activity” against A Contracts.

Or cry because  months into a pandemic and the misery caused by lockdowns, isolation, bereavements, job losses and other money woes, we now find ourselves unable to go out because we have no petrol.“How is le in England ” my uncle from Karachi asked the other day. “Well, we have food and fuel shortages and I had to wait a month for an emergency blood test,” I replied. “And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.” How the tables have turned. Great Britain has now become a great big joke. Secretary of State for Culture Nadine Dorries can tweet all she likes about how ‘THERE IS NO FUEL SHORTAGE’ butthe pumps have run dry then more fuel her. Do you agree with Anila  Have your say in the comments below Ministers are desperately throwing out ideas to avert this crisis, such as drafting in the Army and issuing , short term visas, but why would anyone from Europe answer our SOS when they were so inhumanely treated before They fare much better in other European countries and aren’t treated like dirt.There are also plans afoot to introduce training programmes so that people here can learn to be HGV drivers even though haulage company bosses have long been warning about a shortage of workers.And surelyit was that appealing we wouldn’t have had a shortage in the first place  It feels like history is about to repeat itself. In the s and aposs my parents’ generation were told that this country needed them. War had decimated the economy and immigrants from the colonies were needed to rebuild the nation. They faced deep hostility from some native Brits who put up signs on their doors like ‘No dogs, no Irish, no Pak…’ Still, they kept the wheels of industry turning by enduring horric conditions working in the ‘dark satanic mills’ and kept the country moving by driving buses and working as conductors.  This time it is not war which has caused shortages but the utter incompetence of the Tory government who have been in power for over a decade. Brexit cost billions and yet we are all so much worse off than before. Sono-one from Europe wants to be humiliated again, where do you think the drivers will come from  I would not be surprisedpeople from the Asian subcontinent and former colonies will be expected to fill the vacancies, the absolute last thing that the diehard Brexiteers wanted in the first place. Or, just like our elders who came to drive buses, will our youngsters now be told they need to retrain as HGV drivers  Suddenly it has gone very quiet from those who were highly vocal about ‘them foreigners coming here and taking all our jobs’. It was always the jobs that no-one  wanted and now there is no-one to do them. When it comes to sorting out this mess who exactly is in the driving seat  Because it sure as hell isn’t the Tories.

He explains why it’s such a good partnership for young farmers like himselfAdvertorialByLaura Tait:,  Sep Updated:,  Sep Tucked away in the Staffordshire hills is a -acre mixed beef, sheep and arable farm that has belonged to Richard Hopley and his family for the past  years. From their grass-fed cows and sheep, which are inspected annually by Red Tractor to ensure high farming standards, Richard is proud to supply Lidl with top-quality beef and lamb. And he knows that Lidl’s commitment to the best-quality produce will help him keep his own standards high. “We are on the same page – I feel that Lidl understands my farming business,” Richard says. “The company has a keen interest in how the produce is grown, with good feedback on what it wants to see in what it puts on its shelves. “We both want quality products, and Lidl is supporting British food that has been grown to high standards.”But as well as its focus on quality, Lidl also supports young farmers across the UK, and is committed to investing £billioninto British food and farming over the next five years. Through its Grassroots Dairy Partnership it is working with  young beef and dairy farmers across the UK to create sustainable businesses, with a particular focus on mitigating the impacts of climate change. One key goal, for example, is reducing the use of plastic across Lidl’s dairy range.“I like the fact that we have got a group of young farmers together,” says Richard. “It allows us to see how other people are operating and understand dferent ways of working. It feels like we’re part of something good.”  Richard’s farm has been in his family for three generations, and he still works with his father, Roger. He also hopes his young son, Matthew, will follow in his footsteps. By keeping it in the family, Richard is confident his farm will continue to keep the high farming standards they have always held. “Any cows housed in the winter are bedded on straw produced on the farm. That allows us to keep cosy beds for them,” Richard explains. “After winter the straw is used as fertiliser on the fields to feed next year’s crops and promote healthier soils. It’s all circular and balanced it’s why, in my opinion, mixed farming is the best way to farm sustainably.” The quality of Lidl’s beef reflects the care and attention that Richard and its other suppliers give to their cows. Indeed, one of the commitments of the Grassroots partnership is continual improvement of animal welfare, beyond national standards. “Our beef is not produced, it’s nurtured,” says Richard proudly. All of Lidl’s fresh chicken and beef is from British suppliers and is Red Tractor assured. “Red Tractor checks that we are doing everything to the highest possible standards, including animal welfare, environmental, quality, and health and safety aspects,” says Richard. “The inspector is there to check that we are doing everything right. “It’s great that they are coming out regularly to ensure we are doing things correctly.” FEED IT BACK IT’S not just British farmers that Lidl is supporting. Lidl has also been helping to tackle hunger in Britain’s communities through its Feed it Back scheme. Since , Lidl has been involved in donating food surplus to over , good causes such as food banks, community centres, and soup kitchens.Cereal - Soup - Pasta - Rice - Tinned tomatoes pasta sauce - Lentils, beans and pulses - Tinned meat - Tinned vegetables - Tea coffee - Tinned fruit - Biscuits - UHT milk - Fruit juice Lidl is working with its partner Neighbourly to ensure any donated food will be put to good use every day. Now customers can support the scheme. By buying a little bit extra with the weekly shop and putting it in the donation box found at the checkout in-store, they can help Lidl meet its target of donating  million meals a year to those in need.Find out more about how Lidl changes for the better."},{"url":null,"title":"lack respect beer festival punters","story":":root Lack of respect as beer festival punters sip pints while sitting on gravestonesThe thirsty festival goers were spotted apparently using gravestones as tables and chairs at the Norton Beer Festival in Norton Village, Durham, triggering waves of fury from locals Image: TERRY BLACKBURN   BACKGRIDByKatie Anderson:,  Sep Updated:,  Sep | commentsPunters were spotted indulging in pints of beers while using headstones as seats and tables at a beer festival. Pictures emerged showing people drinking pints atop graves at Norton Beer Festival in Norton Village has caused ripples of outrage to spread through the local community.The behaviour has been labelled disrespectful and disgusting, Gazette Live reported. One person claimed theyaposd be devastatedit was their familiesapos resting place. Taking to social media, one shocked resident wrote: Why couldnapost they sit on the green, which is just outside, instead of on graves  I think itaposs appalling. Would they think it okit was young adults  What a total lack of respect for the deceased and their families.Did you attend the beer festival  Get in touch at webnews@mirror Another wrote: Fair enough holding a beer festival but come on, don’t have it centred around the cemetery. There’s enough space around Norton for people to meet friends and have a few drinks without needing to sit on graves. The event, which ed after a two and a half year absence, is hosted by the church in conjunction with The Three Brothers Brewing Company. The three-day celebration is split between the car park where there is a mobile bar, food stalls and toilets, and the main festival inside the church. In between is a path with the graveyard surrounding it. According to the Brewery manager David Dodd: There are lots of clear spaces within the graveyard which were used by people for seating with tables and chairs set out accordingly.Given it was a lovely day many people were enjoying the weather and the opportunity to be together, which is what this festival is for.At no point were chairs put around gravestones by staff and it was certainly not recommended for people to sit on them. For future events there will be signage and taping off sections to make this clearer. We will also have even more chairs available outside to give people an alternative.  He continued: To put an event of this size coming out of covid has been a massive undertaking for our tiny family team alongside our day job of running a brewery making and delivering beer around the North East. Itaposs also a huge step in terms of logistics and infrastructure whilst making it a manageable and safe space for attendees. The suggestion to spill out on to the green is not possible as the perimeter fence offers a great barrier from a licensing and security point of view. Part of every entry ticket includes a donation to St Maryaposs building maintenance raising some vital funds for this stunning church after the pandemic. It is also worth noting that we had a great local security firm supporting us at the event and we have not been made aware of any instances of antisocial behaviour, only positive feedback about how St Maryaposs Beer Festival has been a truly unique event. Rev. Martin Anderson, who has worked at the church for the last eight years, also responded to the criticism. The village church of St Mary’s is a beautul space in the heart of Norton - it’s wonderful that we have the opportunity to use the space for a iety of purpose, he said. On the whole, the people attending the festival have been respectful of the space and there has been a real sense of community and positivity. However, like in all areas of le, there are sometimes a small group who donapost see or do things from the same perspective. We didnapost want people to use tombstones as tables, and our security firm was working to make sure everything was kept calm in the church yard and the building itself. As a parish church in Norton, we work really hard to support the community of Norton in times of celebration but also in times of bereavement. The festival took place over the weekend, from Friday  September to Sunday .

Squadron Leader Alfred Clarke was left with a burning engine after his Lancaster was hit during a raid over Germany. But he refused to turn for home out of respect for the  Allied bombers relying on him to mark their target. Sq Ldr Clarke earned a Distinguished Flying Cross for his ‘outstanding skill and tenacity’ during the  raid. Bernard Pass, auctioneer at Marlow’s, said: It is remarkable that Sq Ldr Clarke got his crew home and saved their lives given the damage the aircraft suffered. He showed true grit in carrying on to Cologne and not turning around, aware that the pathfinders had a crucial role in marking the targets for the following bombers. They were specially trained and known for being exceptional pilots, and Sq Ldr Clarke demonstrated all this skill and determination on the raid.  Sq Ldr Clarke was born in South Africa and served with  Squadron during the Second World War. His rear gunner was badly wounded during the raid near Cologne on the night of March  .

Officers were called to the service station in East Grinstead, West Sussex at pm on Sunday. But the Del Boy and Rodney imitators were challenged by staff members and had scampered by the time Sussex Police arrived. It is not known how much they were charging for a can of fuel. Mid Sussex Neighbourhood Policing Inspector Darren Taylor posted: Team received reports yesterday @ pm of two young males trying to sell petrol from Jerry cans to motorists looking to fill up in East Grinstead.  Not only were they trying to sell petrol at inflated prices but they were trying to sell it on the forecourt of a petrol station!!! Mike Ricketts commented: Enterprising but I guess it is illegal. Megan Stow added: Supply and demand - watch out dragons den. It comes as chaotic scenes unfolded at garages across the country. At a Texaco garage in south London on Sunday, people queued up in the hopes of filling their vehicles ahead of the start of the week. And after one car conked out just yards from the pumps, several people leapt into action and rolled it forwards. BP announced on Thursday evening that it was closing some pumps and rationing petrol and diesel because of a lack of lorry drivers, despite reassurances from the Government and sector experts that there was no shortage of fuel. This led to many motorists panic-buying fuel over the weekend with the company then confirming on Sunday that nearly a third of its British petrol stations had run out of the two main grades of fuel. Downing Street suspended competition law in an attempt to get a grip of the shortages. The decision comes after Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng met with oil companies and retailers yesterday with thousands of petrol stations running dry. A scuffle at a north London petrol station was posted on social media as motorists waited to fill up their tanks in a bout of frenzied buying.  Mr Kwarteng has opted to temporarily exempt the industry from the Competition Act to allow it to share information so it can target areas where fuel supply is running low. The triggering of what is known as the Downstream Oil Protocol comes as the Petrol Retailers Associationwarned that as many as two-thirds of its membership of nearly , independent outlets was out of fuel, with the rest of them partly dry and running out soon.

The mum of two was able to drop  dress sizes after swapping out high-fat foods for salads and getting into running. Maria Bullock, , had gained the weight after years of unhealthy eating, but decided to change her le after reaching a point where she was struggling to breath and being unable to tie her laces. She now exercises daily and will be competing in the London Marathon on Sunday. Maria, from Littleworth, Derbyshire, gained the weight after going through a orce in , and was st at her heaviest.  Speaking on her transformation, Maria said: Iaposve changed my lestyle and put stops in place, like on my fridge I have a aposhaltapos sign because I go to my fridge when Iaposm hungry but also when Iaposm angry, tired or stressed. Emotional eating is what you really need to be aware of. Her weight gain caused her to suffer from back problems and cholesterol, and she really decided to make a change when she could not tie her laces one morning. She describes that being a wakeup call, and she joined Slimming World to help her control her diet. Maria, said: Iaposm only ft ins tall and even though I was skipping breakfast I was eating far too much for lunch and dinner. Iaposd have lasagne with fatty mince and cheesy sauce. I also loved spaghetti Bolognese which Iaposm heap with cheese. I had always been overweight and lost ten stone several times. But when I achieved my goal I would go back to the baguettes and cheese so my weight was always changing. I really knew I had to change for good when I couldnapost bend down to tie my laces because I couldnapost breathe. I suddenly thought aposoh my Godapos Iaposm only  and I need to do something about this. The last pair of jeans I bought were size  and they are the only clothes Iaposve kept from then to show people, but now I am  or . By  Maria, who has two daughters Adrianne, , and Hannah, , had shed  stone and now runs five times a week.She was motivated after realising that her health was suffering, and that she wanted to be as fit as possible for her children.I was on blood pressure tablets, the maximum you could have, and my knees were aching because of the weight, she said. It was the thought of not being able be around for the children getting married, andI was and they had kids, would I be able to play with them  She has now managed to keep the weight off and has competed in a km ultra race and a parachute jump. She added: I swap things out to make them healthier. Itaposs easy to do and doesnapost taste much dferent. I still have a large appetite and you can still eat a lot of food.I do go out for takeaways and know that le is for living, it is all about moderation and I donapost mindmy weight goes up a bit because I know how to get back to my target.Maria now mostly eats low fat alternatives for dinner and eats salad and protein, such as mackerel, for lunch instead of baguettes with butter, cheese and ham.She does not follow an extreme diet, but instead chooses more nutritious food such as porridge, chicken curry and fruit and vegetables. I took about a year to lose the last half stone and my weight has been around . stone for four years. Now Iaposve done a parachute jump, done a km ultra run around Derby and all this bucket list stuff. The thing I also get out of running is the wellbeing side of it. It sets you up for the day and then you are more likely to follow a healthy eating plan, and less likely to suffer from depression. A pound of fat and a pound of muscle weigh the same but the muscle will help you burn more calories.

Smart motorways use active traffic management to reduce congestion and increase the amount of traffic that can pass through areas which are known to be busy.But an undercover investigation by the Daily Mail claims to have uncovered safety failures which put countless motorists at risk.Points of particular danger were found where hard shouldrs convert to a live lane. More than one in ten cameras at this section were broken, misted up or facing the opposite direction, the Mail claims in their investigation, elements of which have been disputed by Highways England. The reporter worked in a control room for six weeks, where he says he overheard a worker saying: ‘We’ve got no signals, you’re all going to die. Whichever God you believe in, start praying now.’ On September , on one of the busiest stretches of the M, almost half of the cameras did not work, the Mail claims. Motorists were stranded in fast-moving traffic because staff in the control room were unable to check broken-down vehicle reports. Since the report was made public, the Department for Transport has ordered an inquiry into the failures. Fty three people have died on smart motorways since  and at least eighteen of those deaths were blamed on the way the roads they were on worked. Nargis Begum was one of the victims - hit by a lorry on the M.  Her son Niaz Shazad told the Mail: With people including my own mother being killed on these roads, there needs to be accountability.’ Sallyaposs Jacobaposs husband was also killed on the M, at a stretch without a hard shoulder. She said: It’s no longer manslaughter, it’s murder. They know they’re killing their citizens. What are they waiting for  A coachload of children to be killed or something horric like that  National Highways Chief Executive Nick Harris said: “We recognise concerns continue to be raised about smart motorways. These upgrades work as a system, with technology, infrastructure and people working together, and data shows fatalities are less likely than on conventional motorways. If there is a problem with any one part of the system, other parts are activated to help keep traffic moving safely. Our traffic officers work around the clock, every day of the year to help drivers and deal with incidents. We are, however, investigating these allegations as a matter of urgency.” Comment MORE ON MotorwaysDepartment for Transport\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Seven-month-old Lexi Robins suffers from a rare degenerative condition called Fibrodysplasia Ossicans Progressiva . The cruel disease causes skeletal bone to sprout in the bodyaposs tendons, tissue, ligaments and muscles - after even minor injuries like falling over.Mum and dad Alex and Dave Robins, from Hemel Hempstead, are launching a petition to improve funding for treatment of FOP which is currently not provided by the NHS, Hertfordshire Live reports.Dad Dave, , called the fight for a cure a race against time as he recalled the raw emotions and hopelessness felt when Lexi was diagnosed with the sinister disease.Do you have a story that you think we should feature  Get in touch at webnews@mirror It will severely reduce her mobility, said Dave. FOP itself is classied as one of the rarest and most degenerative diseases known to medicine. It was shortly after Lexiaposs birth on January  this year when Alex and Dave noticed some unusual signs. Lexiaposs big toes didnapost look normal and she couldnapost move her thumbs as she should be able to. The illness is ultra-rare - with only  people in the UK currently diagnosed - so it took doctors a while to diagnose her. X-rays in April showed bunions on the youngsteraposs feet and she had double-jointed thumbs.  Results from additional tests were sent to a lab in Los Angeles and by June they had confirmed she had FOP. Having the disease means she must be incredibly careful as even the most minor fall could have serious consequences. Injections, vaccinations or dental work must all be handled with strictest care and she will be unable to have children in later le. Trauma causes bumps on her body, which make extra bone grow - preventing her from moving the affected area. Alex and Dave have done their own research and found Lexi has a  per cent chance of going deaf as additional bone grows in her body and travels up her neck. The parents have been advised to kit Lexi out in elbow and knee pads to reduce the severity of any impact. Despite the serious and cruel condition she is facing, Alex said her baby is absolutely brilliant. “You almost couldn’t write it. She sleeps through the night, she smiles and laughs constantly, hardly ever cries. Thataposs the way we want to keep her.” The condition is caused by a genetics which can be inherited from a parent or most often a brand new mutation without family history of the disease. The youngster has grown some lumps on her head recently, and the couple says they are monitoring her closely. At the same time, theyaposre still trying to let her have as normal a childhood as possible. Itaposs a race against time, said Dave. As a parent, when you first get the news itaposs so raw and heartbreaking. You donapost see any hope whatsoever.  Now, with the support everyoneaposs given and with the clinical trials that are happening and the amount of specialist people working on what is such a rare disease, I feel hopeful that there is something for Lexi going forward. I donapost know when itaposs going to be, thataposs when itaposs a true race. There will be something, in our letime, that is going to be able to support her, whether it be a treatment or a cure. She is fully able-bodied at the moment, added Alex. Weaposve just got to stop it from overtaking her body. I think, as well, itaposs almost like the process of grieving where you accept it, and now weaposve gone through the upsetting stage. Now weaposre like right, the fightaposs on now. Twenty-nine-year-old Alex says the disease is an absolute rollercoaster. She said: Obviously it’s a journey no one would want to be on. We’ve had incredible support locally, nationally and in ourselves it’s hard to manage. We’ve got Ronnie who is Lexi’s older brother. He’s three years old so we have to make sure that no conversations are taking place in front of him because we don’t want him to know what’s going on or pick up any energy. In terms of us, every day it’s hard to deal with but it’s - in a way - getting easier in terms of how well we’re doing and how much positivity there is around the amount of clinical trials that are going on and the research they’re doing. It gives us a lot of hope. Their petition calls for more funding for research into the disease. A three-person research team at Oxford University is working on a cure, costing £, each year. As it stands, parents of children with the disease are funding the team. If researchers cure FOP, it may have an Iceberg Effect and help crack other diseases like rare cancers, osteoporosis and hip replacements, Alex said. The couple say they have had to be patient to figure out how to deal with the youngsteraposs diagnosis in their marriage. Lexiaposs diagnosis has been tough for everyone to handle and that itaposs taken them time to figure out how best to deal with it within their marriage. Itaposs up to me and Alex, said Dave. Thereaposs a couple of ways when you get news like that, you can regress and you can get in that slump. I understand exactly how people feel like that, or you can try and wake up the next day and as much as you can summon the strength to fight it. Thataposs what we decided we had to do. Expose it, raise money, fight it as best we can and then we can be honest with ourselves in a few years and say have we tried everything, have we done everything for our kids  Any parent would do the same for their kids. Alex has thanked everyone who has helped raise money for their battle against the disease. They hope the petition will be the next step for people suffering with FOP. The petition is something thataposs really hopeful, she added. This is something new, itaposs something that we really want to raise the level of awareness through, but then itaposs also hope for other families who have FOP.To sign Alex and Daveaposs petition visit here, and you can donate to their fundraising page here.Comment MORE ON NHSOxford UniversityBabiesCharitiesMarriageHeart diseaseOsteoporosisHip replacements\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I just think heaposs really cute and I like the colour - itaposs all pastel and thataposs my kind of aesthetic. I knew it would look goodI had all pastel colours in my room with pig items to match. Iaposve been obsessed ever since - every time I see something new I think aposI need itapos and Iaposm running out of space, to be honest. Iaposve definitely spent a couple of hundred pounds on it because Iaposve got two of the Percy Pig quilts which cost about £ each and then thereaposs everything  on top of that. I feel super happy about how my room has turned out but Iaposm always wanting the next Percy Pig release so itaposs getting a bit costly now! The Percy Pig fan first found her favourite treat a few years ago when she was vegetarian and they offered a veggie version of the gummy sweets.

Chaddesley Fuel Station  Shop usually closes at pm on Saturdays but stayed open until .pm on Saturday night so health workers could buy petrol and diesel. Bosses have been forced to defend their plans after being hit by criticism that others could not take advantage of the service. It comes as drivers have been facing long queues as they try to fill up, with some petrol stations running out of fuel due to panic-buying. Customers have been told to avoid panic buying as a shortage of HGV drivers threatens the supply chain. What do you think about this story  Let us know in the comments below  BirminghamLive reports that the fuel station in Kidderminster, Birmingham, posted on Facebook saying: The garage will be staying open later this evening for NHS Staff only. From -.pm.You will need your NHS photo ID card before filling up. Thank you. The business was praised by hundreds of people online who shared the news. But business owners were forced to defend their kind gesture after being hit with criticism online. Some social media users asked the business about carers or people in everyday jobs. Anita Nostud commented: Some of us are private carers who actually take the pressure off NHS but we donapost have ID but nonetheless essential working with very vulnerable people in the community often in areas others wonapost go .....l appreciate what you are doing l really do but we are extremely essential too. Mike Preece said: What about your everyday customers.  Sue Johnson added: Is that fair, people need fuel to get to their jobs. To keep the roof over their head. How about you stop letting people fill up and only allow a certain amount then everybody can get fuel and I know you can do that as Iaposve worked in fuel stations.The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

Sian Hope had been begging the Birmingham City Council to help with an infestation of vermin.The pests had gnawed through her electricity cables and bed slats, Birmingham Mail reported.While the council sent pest control many times to try to resolve the issue, Sian and her toddler continued to be plagued with rat droppings and nightly scampering.  The exasperated mum took the council has court which led the authority to rid Sian of her rat problem - just days before she gave birth on July , . The council managed to treat the mouse and rat problem just after the court case and I’ve not heard or seen any signs of them since, said Sian, whose name has been changed as she previously fled an abusive partner. “They’ve also cut down the trees as there was an argument over whether it was squirrels, even though I had evidence that it was mice and rats, she added. This was such a relief as Iaposd been feeling really anxious. You have to keep everything sterile with a newborn and I knew that was going to be very dficult with a rat infestation. My baby was six days overdue and it was a dficult birth but we’re all OK now. My daughter is really hands on with him, she loves him, brings him his dummy and helps to change his nappy.” Sian and her two-year-old daughter had fled their home with just the clothes on their backs in September. They ended up staying in a refuge until they were offered a two-bedroom, end-terrace house near Birmingham city centre in March. Unable to view the property due to Covid restrictions, the mum accepted the house and was devastated when they moved in. Not only did she find rats, she discovered broken floorboards, no carpets, limited skirting boards and a rotten loft. What little furniture and white goods they had were destroyed by the rats. The council has already paid compensation to Sian after her fridge stopped working when rats chewed through the electric cable.  The upstairs had to be rewired due to the fire risk caused by rats gnawing through the wires. In July, a judge ordered the council to pay compensation to Sian for her damaged bed and sofa, but she is still awaiting the payment. A spokesman for the council said that her compensation claim had been received and that they were in the process of asking for additional supporting evidence. He said: We are pleased that the tenantaposs property is now rodent free following treatment and have apologised for the distress caused. The Council acknowledges the receipt of the compensation claim, and are in the process of asking the customer for additional supporting evidence. Sian has had to scrimp and save to replace her furniture and try to carpet the bedrooms. The judge ordered that the council pays me compensation for my sofa and bed and I filled in the forms in July but they’ve still not paid it yet, she said.  I ended up having to go out and buy new ones because I couldn’t face bringing a newborn into my home without a sofa or a bed. My daughter and I had been cooped up in my bedroom for so long and I knew that health visitors would be coming round and I would have nowhere for them to sit. I still have bare floorboards in my daughter’s bedroom. I’ve put a rug down next to her bed so that she doesn’t have to tread onto the rough floor when she gets up. I’m paying a carpet company a weekly amount to get it done and hopefully that will happen at the start of October.” Sian has done all of the work to her home so her newborn will be comfortable, but she still wants the council to move her. She said that she will not be classed as high priority unless she moves out and declares herself homeless - something sheaposs not prepared to do with a newborn and a toddler. “I’m not going to stay in this house, she said. My daughter’s room is too small for her to share with her brother. “When I’ve been here a year, next spring, I’m hoping to swap with someone .

Now proceedings are set to be dropped ahead of an imminent sale. The seven-bedroom Chalet Helora in Verbier was bought by the Duke in  for £.million, but she alleged they missed the final instalment on January , .Now on the market at a highe asking price of £.million, she has agreed to drop proceedings, The Sunday Times reported.The luxury chalet costs up to £, a week to rent. Prince Andrew and his ex-we bought it with a mortgage and private funding from the Queen as a ‘long-term family investment’, sources claimed.  When the sale is complete, Andrew will no longer own any property, it is believed. While the Duke appears to have settled his Swiss case, he will reportedly strongly contest the sex abuse claims made in the US by Virginia Roberts, . The duke has repeatedly denied her allegations. The ongoing legal battle currently playing out in New York had been mired in arguments over whether the royal had been properly served with Ms Giuffreaposs lawsuit.  The prince and his accuser have since agreed that service was effective as of September , according to a joint filing with the US District Court in Manhattan. Subject to court approval, Andrew has until October  to formally respond to her lawsuit. The agreement ended a monthlong effort by Andrewaposs legal team to block Ms Giuffreaposs lawsuit at the outset, rather than have the -year-old prince defend against it.  The Duke is accused of having sex Ms Giuffre around two decades ago, when she was underage, an allegation he denies. Ms Giuffreaposs lawsuit also alleges Andrew abused her at Epsteinaposs mansion in Manhattan and on the late billionaire financieraposs private island in the US Virgin Islands. Andrew has not been charged with any crimes.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Prince Andrew, Duke of YorkVirginia RobertsUS District CourtRoyal FamilyCrimeBillionaires\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Harry and Meghan famously quit the royal family - in a split dubbed aposMegxitapos - to move to the US and carve out new lives. They have since levelled a number of criticisms at the Firm in interviews, including claims of racism. Do you have a story  Email webnews@mirror  But one Palace insider has alleged that the couple are still following the royal model - and could be trying to establish a rival court to Prince William and Kate Middleton.They told the Sun : There are going to be some very nervous glances from the Palace because Harry and Meghan are effectively following the royal model. The Palace will be anxious the causes they support and people they hang around with does nothing to embarrass the Queen.Kate and Wills show how the job of working royals is done. They won’t be impressed with Harry and Meghan acting as quasi-royals and courting publicity after claiming they quit for privacy. Omid Scobie, the author of the biography Finding Freedom, about the Sussexes, said last month that the couple were entering a new era of visibility.

They need to be on the ground.They say that the proof is in the pudding, and what we are about to see is that pudding. The coupleaposs current tour saw them address a crowd of , people in the Big Apple. They took to the stage at Global Citizen Live to push for the Covid vaccine to be made more readily available around the world to poorer nations. Meghan said: “Every single person on this planet has a fundamental right to get this vaccine but thataposs not happening. “It is wrong that so much of the vaccine supply has only gone to just ten wealthy nations and not everyone , itaposs just not OK.” Harry added: “Guys, we have what we need to vaccinate the world.”Since moving to the US last year, the Sussexes have embraced their celebrity status, by taking part in regular interviews on American television and penning deals with Netflix and Spoty.But they have also been criticised for regular attacks on the royal family, and from some quarters for preaching to people on subjects like equality from their position of privilege. In their latest charitable cause, they attended the Covid concert with Harry putting his hand on Meghan’s shoulder and saying: “My we and I believe that where you’re born should not dictate your ability to survive.” Representatives for the Sussexes and Buckingham Palace have been approached for comment by the Mirror.

Meghan Markle after she threw a tiara tantrum has been retold by a royal expert in their new book.Andrew Morton, author of Meghan: A Hollywood Princess, claims the Duke and Duchess of Sussexes behaviour in the lead up to the wedding earned rebuke from the Queen.In six new chapters of the book that was first published in , Mr Morton says The Times reported how Meghan threw a tiara tantrum shortly before the wedding.He writes: In November , just days after the couple ed from their successful tour Down Under, The Times reported that Meghan had thrown a ‘tiara tantrum’ shortly before her wedding because the tiara she wanted to wear was not available.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign upHer prima-donna behaviour apparently earned a rebuke from the Queen herself, who told Harry: ‘She gets what tiara she’s given by me.’ In Mr Mortonaposs bombshell piece, he also claims Prince Harry was irate when Meghan did not get her way.Mr Morton continues: The Queen’s formidable dresser Angela Kelly, who isof Her Majesty’s jewellery, is said to have informed the irate Prince that certain security protocols had to be adhered to in order to access the priceless piece.Harry would have none of it, telling anyone who would listen: ‘What Meghan wants, Meghan gets.’ His ringing phrase did her no favours. It comes as Mr Morton also claims the Sussexes were driven out by Prince Williamaposs bullying attitude. It has always been strongly denied that William bullied his family members. Last year, the brothers said they were deeply, deeply unhappy about bullying claims. Prince Harry was reported to have said he felt pushed out by his brother, but the pair spoke out blasting the offensive claims.The rare joint statement read: Despite clear denials, a  story ran in a UK newspaper today speculating about the relationship between The Duke of Sussex and The Duke of Cambridge. “For brothers who care so deeply about the issues surrounding mental health, the use of inflammatory language in this way is offensive and potentially harmful.”It comes as reports have suggested the Sussexes are keen to visit the UK after quitting as senior royals and moving to Calornia early last year.Harry has only ed to the UK twice since the move, while Meghan and two-year-old Archie have not been back so far.The royal brothers have only reunited a few times this year, at Prince Philipaposs funeral and at the unveiling of a statue to their mum, Princess Diana, at Kensington Palace on what would have been her th birthday.Comment MORE ON Meghan MarkleAngela KellyAndrew MortonThe QueenPrince HarryPrince Philip, Duke of EdinburghPrincess DianaPrince WilliamKensington PalaceThe TimesMarriageRoyal FamilyMental healthJewelleryBullying\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But since her illness Ellisha has suffered nerve damage in her nose, a condition known as parosmia, which means the foods she used to love now make her want to vomit, reports WalesOnline.Ellisha, from the Cynon Valley, South Wales, said onion, garlic, chocolate, eggs, meat and coffee now make her physically sick. She said: The only way I can describe the taste and smell of them are like chemicals, rotting garbage and petrol all mixed into one, she said.Have you been affected by Long Covid  Get in touch with us at webnews@mirror As itaposs something Iaposve never experienced before itaposs really hard to describe it to people - but itaposs the most vile taste and smell youaposll ever experience. Ellisha first realised something was wrong when eating Nandoaposs at home with her friends. It just tasted like it had gone off - but no-one  thought it had. Then over the next few weeks the parosmia just got progressively worse until I was hardly able to eat anything, she said. Ellisha says the condition has seen her quality of le and mental health deteriorate over the past six months. When I first started showing these weird symptoms I was terried as the GP basically told me it was all in my head, my friends and family told me I was being dramatic and I was nearing a bad breakdown, she said. The doctor initially offered me antidepressants, which I refused, and then they gave me calorie shakes just so I could have calories in my body. There was a week where I donapost think I ate anything at all.  Ellisha said everything in the shops seems to contain an ingredient she cannot stomach. Garlic and onion are the worst - I canapost have anything with them in it. I canapost even buy a packet of crisps as they have garlic or onion powder on them. I canapost go to the shop and buy a ready meal or pizza - itaposs crazy. I have to cook everything fresh myself. Ellisha said trying to teach her classes became almost unbearable due to the dferent smells from the childrenaposs lunches. When I say unbearable, I mean me standing in front of a class full -year-olds crying my eyes out because the smell of their food is making me physically sick, she said. But the school has been incredibly supportive. During lunch hour they would let me leave the building and eat in my car, and all the tables would be wiped down. Over the past few months Ellisha has only been able to stomach a few dferent types of food, including freshly-baked bread, cheese, plain pasta and rice, and some fruits and vegetables. She has lost a stone-and-a-half and experienced vitamin deficiency. If I go into a Costa or a Starbucks I have to hold my breath - and I used to absolutely love coffee. I think thataposs why Iaposm tired all the time as Iaposm not getting my coffee fix. I was having terrible acid in my stomach as my body wasnapost getting the nutrients it needed. Ellisha called NHS  to speak to the Covid helpline who put her in contact with a charity called AbScent which helps people rediscover their loss of taste and smell.They were my absolute saviours as they directed me to a Facebook group where there is close to , members who are all experiencing parosmia too. It was so helpful as people were able to suggest safe foods that I was able to try.I am slowly healing. Nobody can tell me exactly when the nerve damage will heal but average times can range from  months to three years. Iaposm praying itaposll be  months for me. I currently take zinc and B vitamins as people in my support group say this has helped them, and I also do smell training twice a day. The smell training involves snfing four essential oils for  seconds each. This is supposed to fire up the nerves in my nose to promote quicker healing. This has definitely helped as after six months I am finally starting to eat some meats again. Ellisha believes the Covid jab may have initially triggered the condition, but added that being diagnosed with the virus in the first place is the root cause. She said she has spoken out about her condition in this third wave of the pandemic to show that other people with parosmia are not alone.

Iron cages were found around some coffins to stop body snatchersAn iron cage protects a coffin from body-snatchers Image: Highways EnglandByKelly-Ann MillsReporterAngus Young:,  Sep Updated:,  Sep | comments A huge -month long archaeological excavation has uncovered the remains of almost , people.During its peak more than  iniduals were being found each week as  staff got to work to uncover the secrets at the site in Hull. The site was originally consecrated in July  as a solution to an emergency situation at what was then Holy Trinity Church in Hullaposs Old Town where available space in the medieval graveyard was rapidly running out.The new burial ground was used for burials until  and during that time over , burials were recorded on the parish register, Hull Live reports.Project manager Stephen Rowland said: Although it is known that some of those people were interred in the original medieval cemetery located immediately around the church, the majority are thought to lie within Trinity Burial Ground on Castle Street. At our peak of the excavation work, around  staff were working on the project in a iety of roles and the remains of approximately  iniduals were being excavated each week.  Further analysis of the findings, and the remains of around , people who have been carefully and respectfully excavated will continue before they are reburied. The reburial is taking place into an excavated trench which lies within part of the burial ground and lies outside the footprint of the road. While the physical work of digging deep into the history of the former Trinity burial ground is mainly over, experts from the project team Oxford Archaeology North will soon begin detailed desktop data studies on their finds. Mr Rowland said his teamaposs work at the site over the last  months had already uncovered a wealth of information about Hullaposs population as it started to increase rapidly in the later part of the th century. The most orderly burials lay in several rows close to a path emanating from the main entrance in the central eastern part. These are thought to be wealthier iniduals, some of whom had well-furnished coffins replete with a panoply of decorative fittings and occupied brick-built tombs of ying designs. In several instances we identied devices, known as mort safes, that had been installed to prevent body snatching, a common contemporary practice and attested at Trinity Burial Ground by ious historical sources.  Most of these comprise simple iron strapping placed around the wooden coffin but one burial demonstrated the use of more extensive measures. William Watkinson was buried by his fellow engineers after a boiler he was inspecting fell on his head. A piece of boiler plate was incorporated into the gravestone, and three iron boiler plates were placed in the grave, above the coffin, which was wrapped in an iron cage. Although such structures have been found where in the country, these have rarely been found archaeologically in the north of England. Mr Rowland said numerous artefacts had also been recovered, many featuring a direct connection with burials. Most common were simple copper-alloy pins used to secure shrouds, coffin linings, clothing and hair to ensure that the corpse was presentable during viewings. There were numerous dress fittings and items of personal ornamentation, including buttons of many designs and ious materials, hair combs, pieces of jewellery and Dutch coins.  There was also a plethora of more unusual items. We were rather surprised to find a conch shell - maybe it was a souvenir from travels overseas  An unassuming blue glass bead was also identied as a trade bead. These are frequently found in European colonies and Africa, where they were part of a suite of goods traded for slaves. These are not often recognised in UK contexts and some may have been confused with earlier beads of the Saxon and Roman periods, when found as isolated objects. Several plate burials were also found, which is exactly how it sounds – the inidual was buried with a ceramic plate. It is possible that these plates once held salt, believed to have protective properties and be a symbol of eternal le and several examples of these have been found in post-medieval burial grounds in London and Birmingham. Mr Rowland said laboratory work at the site was now finished with analysis of the osteological data about to start. This will investigate themes such as mortality patterns across the population, and patterns of health and disease, he explained.  However, preliminary observations made during recording do suggest a high prevalence of deficiency diseases, such as rickets and scurvy, a high incidence of nasal fractures in adults, poor dental health, and presence of diseases such as tuberculosis and syphilis. Some of the skeletons also displayed examples of some of the surgery used during the period. Mr Rowland said: Healed amputations and a rare example of a healed hole which had been drilled into a skull provided evidence of surgical procedures. There was also evidence of autopsy, chiefly in the form of craniotomies, where the skull was cut open post-mortem to observe the brain. One coffin contained the remains of three anatomised iniduals where extensive post-mortem cuts to the bones indicated these were probably cadavers used for teaching.

A woman, understood to be Sabinaaposs sister Jebina, was supported by a family liaison officer as she read some of the cards left to the “brilliant” -year-old. She also collected a white box with a picture of Ms Nessa on it from vigil organiser Annie Gibbs. It had been used after the memorial to collect notes of condolence written by attendees.  Ms Nessa had been walking to meet a friend at a pub near her home when she was attacked in Cator Park, Kidbrooke, on September . Her body was discovered by a member of the public the next day, having been hidden under a pile of leaves, it was reported. On Friday evening, hundreds of mourners including tearful relatives gathered for a candlelit vigil in memory of the Rushey Green Primary School teacher, who was just  when she died. Ms Islam broke down as she addressed crowds. She said: Words cannot describe how we are feeling, this feels like we are stuck in a bad dream and canapost get out of it - our world is shattered, we are simply lost for words. No family should go through what we are going through. Today Ms Gibbs, who shared an emotional embrace with Ms Nessa’s sister, said of Friday’s service: “I think it really honoured Sabina. It was very respectful. I believe there was possibly as many as , people who attended which was incredible. “Everyone came there with the same heart. They just wanted the family to feel loved and supported and that was achieved.  “We really wanted to make sure we got the message out there that we want justice and this is not something that we expect in our community. But it’s not going to ide us. “We’re going to keep fighting until we find who has done this. I was really delighted this morning to see an arrest has been made.” Ms Gibbs fears some people are forgetting that there is a family grieving losing a much loved sister and daughter at the core of a case promoting global discussion about wider issues. She added: “At the moment, we need to focus on the fact there is a family who has lost someone. Changes will come later. “All this political stuff and organisations capitalising on it is just really not needed right now and it is wrong at this time. It is too soon. Barely a week has passed. “This is a time for us to remember Sabina, not blaming or politics. Let’s respect the family. Let’s focus on Sabina and her loved ones.” Meanwhile police have said the man arrested in East Sussex today is a -year-old man. On Thursday evening, investigators released CCTV images of a man they urgently wished to speak to, and one of a silver car they believed he had access to. The Met said on Saturday evening that the balding man is believed to have been carrying a reflective red object that he may have been trying to conceal up his sleeve. He was captured on CCTV as he walked through Pegler Square in Kidbrooke, south-east London, where Ms Nessa had been heading on the evening she died. Scotland Yard would not confirmthe suspect was the man in the footage. Detective Chief Inspector Neil John, from the Metaposs Specialist Crime Command, said: Sabinaaposs family have been informed of this signicant development and they continue to be supported by specialist officers. Two other men aged  and  were previously arrested and released under investigation. Today a car thought to be connected to the inquiry was taken from a compound in Eastbourne used by Sussex Police.

Victoria MacDonald, , and Scott Ross, , owned a lovely three-bed house, which even had its own ballroom, but they werenapost enjoying their careers. They sold their detached home, in Cruden Bay, Aberdeenshire, Scotland for £,, which had formerly belonged to the Colmanaposs mustard dynasty, after buying it for £, in June .But knowing they werenapost planning to have kids in the huge -room villa, and feeling increasingly unhappy with their jobs, they began thinking about a change, the Daily Record reports. Victoria, a former purchasing administrator in the oil and gas industry, had been suffering from depression, and Scott was working in grounds operation at a heliport company before injuring his back in the workplace in June .  In March this year they put their house up for sale and it didnapost take long for it to be snapped up for £,. The couple then bought a Citroen Relay  campervan for £, but it needed work doing to it - so they moved into a croft in Muir of Ord, Highlands, for two months. They installed a proper kitchen and a solar-powered shower - a process which Victoria admitted she found horrible. Now they run an online marketing travel company and work remotely from some of the most scenic views in Scotland with their dogs. They got a puppy, called Colle, who is a border collie Labrador cross, aged eight months, and their seven-year-old Lab, Callie, also sleeps in the bed with them.

Victoria, from Inverness, has since come off antidepressants after four years, finding the great outdoors makes her high on le, and Scottaposs back has improved with more exercise. Victoria said: It was a cracker of a house, it was historic. It had  rooms in total, including a double-roomed basement, and an old ballroom. It was too big for us though. It was a dream house when we bought it, but we never settled. We bought it for £, and sold it for £,. We both decided to move on from the house as it was too big. We didnapost know where we wanted to move to. We came up with the idea of moving into a van and taking our work on the road. So thataposs exactly what we did. We put our house on the market in March  and it sold within three days.  Victoria and Scott, who is from Old Meldrum, Aberdeenshire, have been together for a total of seven years. Around five years ago the pair were signed off from work and launched a blog about their enthusiasm for travel. Their hobby has since turned into a full time occupation, and they both now work with VisitScotland to promote tourism - and say they have never been happier. Victoria said: I was ill with depression, so I left my work, and around that same time, Scott injured his back so required to take leave. During our time away from work, we came up with the idea for the website and the blog, and just went for it. Our friends were not surprised and our family was the same, no one was massively surprised. We havenapost done the nine to five le for years now.  The couple have found ditching materialism has given them a new lease of le, and describe their new lestyle as aposfreeingapos. They spent £, on their mobile home which they fitted out with specications such as a Swedish oven. Victoria said: We bought an old van, a Citroen Relay , for £,. It needed a lot of work done, so we moved into a croft in the Highlands while we worked on it. We spend £, on the conversion. It was horrible. Iaposve made no secret of the fact I did not enjoy the conversion process. It took a couple of weeks planning, but no matter how much you plan for it, you donapost find out how much is needed to be done until youaposre right in the thick of it.  It has solar  on the roof, at  watts. We have a hob, and an Omnia, which is a Swedish oven. We have a fridge, and we built a bit for food storage. At the minute we have a solar shower, that you can hang outside and it heats water up through solar energy. They now spend their time driving around Scotland, visiting new places and writing reviews. Victoria said: One of the best things about it is itaposs so freeing. Itaposs amazing how much stuff you do not need. Thereaposs something about being so ingrained into nature. I wake up every day to an unbelievable view out my window. I was on antidepressants for four years and now Iaposve been off them since we started our new le. Scottaposs back is getting stronger, due to the amount of exercise he is getting every day. The two dogs are loving it as well, although they are constantly knackered since they are outside all the time. We have not missed or regretted selling the house since we got on the road.

This has led to people panic buying petrol and the government have been forced to suspend competition law Image: Getty ImagesByBenjamin Lynch:,  Sep | comments The UK is suffering the effects of panic buying petrol and competition laws have been suspended. The business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng announced the move in order for the fuel industry to resupply the areas that need it most, where petrol and diesel is running short.A shortage of HGV drivers led to fuel shortages. Reports of this led to panic buying by motorists and long queues leading up to petrol stations, many of which are running empty. Queues continued on Monday morning and the government have been forced to suspend competition law across the country.This measure was made to ensure petrol stations would receive a regular supply of petrol, alongside announcements that the government will offer temporary visas to lorry drivers, lasting until Christmas Eve.What is competition law  Competition is good for business.Ratied under the the Competition Act , it forces companies to find better ways of becoming more innovative in improving costs, so that the consumer can be charged less. When one company charges less for one product, it forces others to do the same and become equally innovative. However, larger companies that are the main producers or sellers of one product could, in theory, make agreements between each other to keep prices high without competition law. This could cause companies to take advantage of the need and demand for one product and make agreements to keep prices high. Or they may choose to keep production low, which drives up prices. As a result of competition law, communication - or the particular type of information shared - between companies in the same industry must be kept to a minimum.Why has competition law been suspended  In special circumstances, competition law can be suspended, so companies are able to talk to each other about what areas need to be resupplied.Competition law was also briefly suspended when shortages arose during the Covid- pandemic. When there are oil supply problems, the government can trigger The Downstream Oil Protocol, in order for petrol companies to be able to liaise with each other and help each other resupply. Competition law dictates that they would not normally be allowed to do this. The business secretary said: While there has always been and continues to be plenty of fuel at refineries and terminals, we are aware that there have been some issues with supply chains. This is why we will enact the Downstream Oil Protocol to ensure industry can share vital information and work together more effectively to ensure disruption is minimised.

These are just some of the issues, HGV drivers face.But, the pressures in the haulage industry in North East Lincolnshire will be overcome, according to one transport expert, Grimsby Live reports.The regionaposs lorry drivers have long held a tradition of being masters of their profession and successfully adapted to the many changes in the industry, historian Ray Newcomb explains.He has experienced the ups and downs of the industry, as his father Dennis had a lelong service in the transport industry.Ray now brims with confidence that the current issues with shortages will be overcome to continue the long-standing traditions of the local industry.  His family and their colleagues played a key role in the success of one of the biggest transport operators in Grimsby, Humber McVeigh. The merger over  years ago of Humber Warehousing and McVeigh Transport created the biggest transport operator in Grimsby with around  vehicles,  trailers and around , drivers. The late Ralph Rouse was one of the pioneers of the industry in Grimsby. He began working for McVeigh Transport, which later became Humber McVeigh. Ralph became a general foreman with the firm with a huge fleet. Sons John and Mike took their apprenticeships with the firm which was one of the biggest in the UK with a vast fleet and over  trailers. Today there are more than , lorry drivers locally. But many complain of the disrespect towards their profession and the poor quality of service at truck stops.  That is beginning to be addressed, Ray said, with better working conditions and greater safeguards at work. The construction of the M  years ago and its A extension were key factors in the growth of the regionaposs haulage industry. The biggest change, however, came with the containerisation of lorries. That was a major improvement for the fishing industry in Grimsby and its food processing industry. It boosted pride as Britainaposs Food Town. The new roads speeding things up, Ray said. But when containers came in it changed everything. You could load a container in China and it would be here on boats or taken all over the world and could be put on a ft lorry. It saved firms huge amounts and put an end to pilferage. The industry has seen so many changes and it will adapt. It just needs a Government who can keep up. Wages will also have to go up and the Government needs to ensure drivers have adequate places to stay overnight.  There are places that you can get for £-a-night and maybe a free meal. But most drivers have had to put up with appalling conditions and stop in laybys. They use a bucket with a bin liner for a toilet and some just sling that in the ditch. There are some who use bottles to pee in even when they are driving. That has to stop and conditions improve. What many in the industry want to see are shuttles. So you can have two containers pulled by one lorry on a motorway and ending at a hub, where another lorry will take it to its destination. If they can halve the number of lorries that will ease part of the problem, Ray said. He said the industry needs to attract more drivers with improved conditions. Most people when they have finished the job go home to their family, but for lorry drivers, it is not the same, Ray said. They are away so much of the time and need to be better looked after. We have had all the changes with infrastructure on roads, motorways, weight limits, trailer s and now we need to look after the drivers.

After mistaking her symptoms for a pregnancy, she was diagnosed with Stage  Hodgkin Lymphoma and Stage  Thyroid cancerMia Mackin pictured in hospital during her chemotherapy treatments Image: MDWfeatures   Mia MackinByLiana JacobChiara Fiorillo:,  Sep | commentsA woman who thought she was pregnant found out she actually had two types of cancer at the same time. Mia Mackin, , signed up for a health check carried out by a company she worked for in October . She noticed her heart was beating at a faster rate than usual and was confused by what it could be as she has always led a healthy le, without smoking and rarely drinking alcohol. The woman, from Belfast, Northern Ireland, initially thought she might have been pregnant, so she checked into AE to find out what was wrong. After  hours of negotiating with doctors, they sent her for a chest x-ray and the results showed a large shadow around her heart. The doctor told Mia it could be an infection, but to be sure they did a scan in the morning and told her to go home and rest. Meanwhile, they did two biopsies to find out what was going on. The next morning, Mia had a CT scan and after a few hours, one of the doctors delivered the devastating news that she had a large mass between her heart and lungs. The following day, a doctor told the woman she had Stage  Hodgkin Lymphoma and Stage  Thyroid cancer. In November , she underwent four rounds and eight treatments of chemotherapy that lasted for two months.  Doctors were stunned to find that during the treatment she did not lose her hair. In January , Mia had a PET scan which revealed that she is cancer-free.Throughout her journey, she has been sharing every moment with her , followers on Instagram and feels that their support has kept her going.She said: In October I went to the hospital on a whim after a work health check showed my resting heart rate was a lot higher than normal. If Iaposm being honest about the situation, I was ninety-five per cent sure I was pregnant. The health check at work was the last straw.  I left work and went straight to the hospital hoping they would just give me a blood test and put my mind at ease. After twelve hours in AE, baffled doctors, and a lot of tears later they agreed to send me for a chest x-ray and within twenty minutes, my results were back. It showed a large shadow around my heart. The doctor said it could merely be an infection but just to be sure, they would do a scan in the morning. He told me to go home and get some rest. She added: The next morning, I set off back to the hospital where I had my CT scan I remember vivily sitting in the waiting room, reading a book. I noticed a young doctor poke his head around the corner, he looked at me, then spoke to his nurses. They called my name and as I walked into the room, the doctor sat in front of me and the nurse pulled her chair beside me asshe was going to hold my hand. aposItaposs not good news, Mia,apos he uttered to me. aposYou have a large mass between your heart and lungsapos. I remember staring at his name tag in a daze. They bounced around the cancer word. When the doctor left the room, I begged the nurse to be honest with me, aposdo they think I have cancer apos I was in work the day they called to tell me I had cancer. I remained calm. I said my goodbyes to my co-workers and left to start making a plan. After they confirmed it was cancer via a biopsy, they sent me for a PET scan, a thirty-minute scan where they scan your whole body looking for disease. Two weeks later I was diagnosed with two dferent cancers thyroid cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma. It was at that point I knew death was something I needed to come to terms with. In fact,I hadnapost gone to the hospital that day, as the cancer closed in on my heart and lungs, I likely would have died from a heart attack. Hodgkin lymphoma, also known as Hodgkinaposs disease, is a cancer of the lymphatic system.Around , people are diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in the UK each year, Macmillan explains.It is one of the most common cancers to affect people in their teens and early s. Thyroid cancer is a less common type of cancer and is mainly seen in women. Mia said: Iaposve only ever cried twice through it all I cried when I got told I had cancer for a few minutesand I cried when they told me I was cancer-free. The moment was something I really canapost put into words. I was so incredibly proud of myself. Grateful for le, happy and ecstatic. I spent the day alone I wanted to take it all in. Straight after the phone call, I filmed an Instagram story, crying my eyes out to my followers. They had been so supportive and still are. I wanted to tell them first. Being open and honest about my cancer journey on Instagram has given me purpose this past year. I love helping people. I love sharing positivity and showing people that no matter what le throws your way whether thataposs cancer, the loss of a parent, weight gain, hair loss, orce, you can get through it. We are strong enough to deal with anything. Itaposs all about your mindset. I soon realised that sharing my journey and helping others made it all worth it. Showing other young women that they are not alone in their battles. That was my goal.For more insight into Miaaposs journey with cancer, visit her Instagram page @all.things.mia Comment MORE ON CancerHodgkins lymphoma\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Announcing the foundation on social media, he wrote: aposNo one should have to find their child on their own,apos he said. aposWe are creating this foundation to give resources and guidance on bringing their children home. aposWe are looking to help people in similar situations as Gabby.apos At the end of the post he wrote #gabbypetito with a link to the foundation. On the websiteaposs landing page is a picture of Gabby with angel wings and doves flying around her legs.  The family also noted on the site they are asking for donations to go towards the foundation in lieu of flowers following their daughteraposs death. A week ago a search team discovered Gabbyaposs body at the Spread Creek campground near Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming. The tragic find came several weeks after she disappeared while on a cross-country road trip with her fiancé Brian Laundrie. Police are still investigating the cause of her death but have ruled it was a homicide.  In the days since, cops in Florida have combed a swampy nature reserve after Laundrie was spotted entering the alligator-infested area with a backpack and his car. The FBI have issued a warrant for his arrest after he allegedly made a transaction with Gabbyaposs bank card after she went missing.Yesterday, a woman claimed she picked up Laundrie while he was hitchhiking last month and dropped him off at the site where Gabbyaposs body was discovered. Norma Jean Jalovec said she gave Laundrie, , a ride in Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming, on August , two days after Ms Petito, , was last seen. She said Laundrie had got into the front seat of her jeep at about .pm after she saw him “walking backward and holding out his thumb” in an attempt to hitch a ride. While she drove, Laundrie told her he had spent time hiking and seen elk and moose, and that he had a fiance, she said.  After asking her to drop him off at the gates of the Spread Creek Dispersed Campground, he reportedly became agitated and tried to “get out of the moving car” after she offered to drop him off closer to the campsite.Speaking to Fox News, Ms Jalovec said she did not make the connection until after seeing a TikTok video by Miranda Baker in which she also claims she and her boyfriend had picked Laundrie up in the park on the same day.Laundrie is the subject of a federal arrest warrant for events following the death of Ms Petito, whose body was found at the Spread Creek Dispersed Campground on Sunday. The couple had been travelling together on a “van le” trip through Kansas, Colorado and Utah when she disappeared. Witnesses last saw Ms Petito on August  as she left a Salt Lake City hotel. She posted her final photo the next day and was reported missing by her family on September . In identying her remains, Teton County medical examiners ruled Ms Petitoaposs death a homicide but did not make the cause of her death public. Laundrie is suspected of using a debit card and PIN for accounts not belonging to him for charges of more than ,sometime between August  and September , according to the indictment. Ms Petito’s family have announced that a memorial visitation open to the public will be held at a funeral home in Holbrook, New York this Sunday.

Kelly Andrade is suing Michael Esposito for allegedly installing a spy cam in her bedroom. She claims that the Staten Island dad secretly recorded “hundreds” of nude videos of her. He then tried to break down her door as she cowered in fear after she found the hidden camera in her bedroom, Ms Andrade claims in a lawsuit.  The nanny was so terried her employer might be armed with a gun that she jumped out of a window to escape, according to court papers. The -year-old “immediately” reported the dad to police, who arrested him on March  on a felony charge of unlawful surveillance. The Colombian native trained as an au pair in her home country before moving into Tottenville home of Esposito and his we Danielle, New York Post reported. She was given a bedroom to sleep in while caring for the familyaposs four children. Ms Andrade claims that she kept catching the dad in her room fiddling with the smoke detector on the ceiling. She said the safety device “was constantly being repositioned,” according to the Brooklyn Federal Court lawsuit.  After less than three weeks in the job she checked the smoke detector and found a camera inside, Ms Andrade alleges, with a memory card containing videos of her nude. Minutes after finding the camera Mr Esposito showed up at the house, according to the nanny and the court papers. “He seemed very nervous and he seemed very worried when he arrived to the house,” she recalled. When she heard banging on the door she went into “fight or flight mode,” she said. She hurt her knees in the leap from her first-floor window, which was over an above-ground basement. Ms Andrade said she ran until she felt safe enough to stop before looking up the nearest police station where she reported the incident and handed over the memory card. “I felt very afraid on top of what had just happened, now I don’t have a place to stay, I’m in a completely unknown country, I’m alone, she said. I don’t have any money, I don’t know what I’m going to eat, I don’t know what I’m going to do tomorrow.” Mr Espositoaposs lawyers claimed at the time of his arrest that the cameras were installed for security reasons, according to the Staten Island Advance.

We all have our methods - with some as simple as chucking some frozen roasties in the oven - and thereaposs no shame in that. But the country is united on how they should look at the end - crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Many claim you need goose fat, while others swear you should add semolina for the ultimate crisp. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter hereNow one food expert has shared her view - after chatting to the Daily Star about the matter. Author Rebecca Wilson, who has , followers on her Instagram account, says you DONaposT need to parboil after all. And you can use goose fat, sunflower oil or olive oil - but look for all-rounder potatoes in the shops, such as Kind Edward, Maris Piper or Rooster Potatoes. She said: When cooking your roast potatoes, make sure you boil them until theyaposre pretty much cooked - donapost parboil them. This will give them a soft texture. After turning off the stove, you should then drain them and let them sit so the moisture can evaporate, then shake them to crisp up the edges. Finally, coat your potatoes in your chosen oil and place them in a hot oven - but donapost forget to turn them over a couple of times. Her cracking recipe for golden roasties is in her new book Family Comforts - which is already been on topping the bestseller list on Amazon. Her book also features quick-cook snacks and midweek meal ideas that can be prepared in minutes. For those looking for something healthier, recipes for delicious treats are included that are low in both salt and sugar but full in flavour, according to Rebecca. She added: The recipes are all suitable for tots who are from months old, but you donapost have to have children to enjoy the recipes - theyaposre perfect for anyone!

In one video, Stephen was asked to show what the tills look like when an employee takes your order.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. The man shared a clip of the screen showing a small picture of every item McDonald’s sells, with each menu category getting its own section. He said: “We start with breakfast, now we are going to cycle to breakfast two, and then lunch.” While in another post, Stephen spoke about the ways some customers get free food at his store – as he sometimes foots the bill for unsuspecting customers who seem like they’re having a bad day. He explained: “Sometimes I like to randomly make somebody’s day. “The other day somebody’s car broke down at the drive thru. “A couple of co-workers and I went out and pushed their car into a parking spot. “I knew they were already having a terrible day, so I went in and just took care of their meal for them. “Occasionally when somebody’s card declines, I’ll take care of that as well. “I know getting free food can change the outlook on your whole day.” In other videos, Stephen claimed the premium wraps are the hardest items on the menu to make, as he called them “time-consuming” to put together – but said they taste amazing. And the employee believes the most underrated item on the entire McDonald’s menu is the fillet-o-fish. He said: “Seeing as it’s the only sandwich that comes with a steamed bun, it’s like every single bite you take out of it is like out of a little cloud.” Stephen also confirmed McDonald’s do use real eggs in their breakfast items, and said the branch he works at gets so busy they serve around , cars every day through their drive thru.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON McDonaldsViralTikTok\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

That’s what happened to one mum when she slipped into her brand-new jumpsuit from Zara and found there was an issue with the zip which meant she couldn’t pull it any further up, and couldn’t unzip it either.The woman’s daughter, Isabel Robins, who posts under @isabelrobins, uploaded a video of her mum’s plight on TikTok.And she revealed that instead of forcing the zip on the jumpsuit and potentially breaking it, they drove all the way back to the Zara store while still in the outfit to tell the staff in the store. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. In the clip, Isabel wrote: “Mum got trapped in her new outfit by a faulty zip and drove to Zara for them to let her out.” The video has received over , views so far, and more than , likes. Some viewers were confused why the mum would ask the employees at Zara to undo the zip rather than doing it herself - but others explained that by proving the zip was faulty at the store in person, the mum was more likely to be able to get a refund or an exchange on the product. One person wrote: “How is that Zara’s problem  They shouldnapost have helped her.” And someone  responded: “It’s their product. If itaposs within thetime, and a manufacturing fault, they have to replace or refund.” Many of the other commenters praised the mum for being “iconic”, and poked fun at the amusing video. One comment read: “Your mum’s so glam!” While another said: “What an absolutely iconic lady.” And a third posted: “Shame coz it looked awesome on her.”Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON ViralTikTokZara\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

For nearly  years Mauro Morandi was content with a le of solitude on the Sardinian island of Budelli, where he lived in a former second world war radio station. He had few possessions and his only companions were birds and cats. However, his monastic lestyle was interrupted by marine park authorities planning to turn the isle into an environmental observatory and evict Budelliaposs only resident. In May, Morandi accepted his fate, moving, at the age of , to the nearby inhabited island of La Maddalena.  The Italian has used his pension from his former le as a teacher to buy himself an apartment with all the luxuries his le was missing before. After years of solitude, Morandi is working on his communication skills and utilising social media to exchange views and post photos, while writing about his experiences.For a long time I have lived alone, and for too many years after I first landed on Budelli I didnapost feel like talking to anyone, he told CNN. True, I cannot enjoy the islandaposs solitude anymore but my le now has taken a new turn, focused on communicating with others and being near other people. Morandi, who was originally from Modena in northern Italy, settled on Budelli in  by accident, while attempting to sail from Italy to Polynesia. He fell in love with the island’s clear waters and beautul landscape and became its caretaker of sorts. The island had the occasional visitor during his time there, but he had largely lived alone. Posting images online from Budelli saw him connect with a virtual community in recent years. While the pensioner said he misses the silence of Budelli, he has enjoyed swapping the quiet for a real community.  Perks of his new home include a brand new, fully equipped kitchen, a bedroom with a kingsize bed and a shower. Morandi has also connected with a former love interest from his youth. He said le on Budelli had become hard, especially during his last winter there when cold and dark conditions meant his solar-powered fridge failed to keep food fresh and necessitated a reliance on canned food. His new appreciation for crowds offers a change of view from last year, when he told the media he was ready to do all he could to stay on Budelli. I wouldnapost know where  to go live, certainly not back home in the north, nor what to do, this is my le, he had said at the time. Since , Budelli had been owned by La Maddalenaaposs National Park, which rendered Mirandi’s caretaker role obsolete.  Authorities said they were simply upholding the law by “restoring the illegal structure” in which Morandi lived. They said he had no title to stay on the island, which was no longer private. Morandi, who made global headlines with his battle to stay on the island, has written a book on his castaway island le, and was planning a second one. He will now settle down for good in La Maddalena and onlyto Budelli for day trips.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON \" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

His grandfather owned a number of factories, mines and retail chains, and the young Serbian quickly became used to the le of a playboy - throwing glamorous parties in the familyaposs private yachts and villas.Get the biggest news delivered to your inbox.for the Mirroraposs free newslettersMoving to Germany to study law, Popov was appalled by the growing popularity of Adolf Hitler, and would debate state-sponsored activists trying to spread Nazi propaganda at the University of Freiburg. Dusko despised Nazism, biographer Larry Loftis writes, and since he wasnapost German, he believed he owed no allegiance to Hitler or the state. Eventually, his outspoken views landed him in hot water with the Gestapo, who accused him of being a communist, and he was only spared jail due to his fatheraposs powerful connections. When a close pal was forced into working for the German secret service, however, Popov decided to get in on the action - with a twist. Contacting British intelligence, he was hired as a fearless double agent. He convinced the Nazis he could pass them crucial UK military secrets - communicating by code and invisible ink, while actually giving bogus details. Described in declassied records as an intelligent, cultured man, Popov was instrumental in two of the waraposs watershed moments. At one point loaned out to the FBI, he warned Hoover that an attack was being plotted on Pearl Harbour months before the December  strike, but was ignored. He also misled the Germans on the planned location for the D-Day landings, paving the way for the operation that would ultimately lead to the Nazisapos demise.  For all his crucial roles in the war effort, however, Popovaposs extra-curricular activities meant he was often kept at armapossby worried officials. Alongside his secret communications, his files are also full of letters to his girlfriends - sent On His Majestyaposs Service - and notes from exasperated handlers. As one letter puts it: He has personality and charm and would feel at home in society circles in any European or American capital, being much the usual type of international playboy. In peace time, he spends a month or more of every year in Paris as he is very fond of the society of attractive women. aposObjectionableapos spyaposs kinky love le angered FBI Popovaposs promiscuity knew no boundaries, to the point where his penchant for threesomes earned him the nickname aposTricycleapos. While stationed in the US, he even put his cover at risk by dating the Hollywood star Simone Simon.  When Hoover learned of the romance, he complained about the objectionable agent to MI. Security service files reveal the spy - who had a regular room at the Savoy in London - was not only wooing actresses, but also renting penthouse Park Avenue apartments and going on skiing breaks on the company dime. Throughout his stay in the United States he lived the le of a playboy, one handler wrote. He seeks to excuse his extravagance on the grounds that he had to acquire suitable social contacts from whom he would be supposed to obtain information. The excuse is a bad one as he obtains no information himself and the contacts upon whom he spent his money, such as Simone Simon, are not of interest to a spy as such. The note added that after ing to London, Popov truly appeared to have fallen for his film star love, but soon shook it off. It said: Tricycle and Simone Simon appear to have been genuinely attached to each other and he obviously missed her greatly on coming to England, although he was not long in seeking to console himself where. Audacious casino bet inspired Bond novel While Popovaposs womanising sounds straight out of the Bond playbook, it was in fact he who inspired Ian Flemingaposs famous creation. During the war, the writer worked for British naval intelligence, and in  he was stationed in Lisbon for several weeks.  Fleming often whiled away the hours at Casino Estoril, a smoky haunt for fellow spies, aristocrats and wealthy eccentrics. His visit coincided with Popovaposs visit to Portugal - and naturally, the flamboyant spy found the casino to be a home away from home. One night, a rich merchant named Bloch turned up at the gambling table, boldly announcing that the stakes were unlimited. Armed with , belonging to Her Majesty’s Government - the equivalent of nearly a million dollars today - aposTricycleapos thought the newcomer arrogant and casually placed his entire wad on the table.  “Players and onlookers gasped,” Loftis wrote in his biography Into the Lion’s Mouth. “The amount was more than  times what most people made in a year. The casino fell silent. Dusko glanced at Fleming, thinking he might be pale. He wasn’t. His face was green.” Bloch swtly backed down and Popov swept his winnings off the table. “I hope the management will not permit such irresponsible play in the future. It is a disgrace and annoyance to serious players, he reportedly said. The astounding incident was later reimagined in Flemingaposs  novel, Casino Royale, in which Bond is assigned to bankrupt the ruthless, arrogant murderer LeChfre. More than  years later, the scene also popped up in Craigaposs debut outing as the secret agent. After the war, Popov ed to his le of luxury, throwing his anchor down in the south of France. Marrying and swtly orcing, he eventually settled down with a -year-old Swedish girl, with whom he had three children. Before his death in  at the age of , he was tracked down for an interview by the , who asked him what he made of . A spy who drank like Bond would be drunk the first night and dead the second, he noted, in a deadpan, Bond-esque quip. Yet undoubtedly, even today the fictional agent still owes a debt to the real-le spy with a licence to thrill.Got a story  Get in touch by emailing alex.bellotti@reachplcComment MORE ON James BondJames Bond filmsDaniel Craig\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" for the latest news on James Bond and No Time To Die and join the  fan clubSign UpInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

One-year-old Leon had his finger ripped clean off and it was impossible to get back from the predator at the Taigan Safari Park in Crimea, mum Anastasia said.The -year-old said: I took Leon into my arms. We were standing behind the fence, and there is a distance of about cmbetween the fence and the net that separates visitors and animals.Everything was perfect - until I suddenly realised there was blood bursting, and my son had lost his thumb.”  Witnesses said the tiger reached over a barrier and swiped at the child. Leonaposs mum said: “My boy was yelling, crying, screaming. “I was in such shock I couldn’t think. I ran to get help with him in my arms.” She rushed to the parkaposs First Aid station to a nurse, and an ambulance took the boy to the hospital in Simferopol, Crimea.  The mum added: I didn’t hear any sounds like a roar, or anything to alert me to danger. “Other visitors who saw it said that a tiger jumped from somewhere above, and pulled my son’s arm with one of its claws.” She claims the gap between the bars was big enough for the tiger to poke its paw through. The Taigan safari park has not commented on todayaposs events.  Law enforcement has suggested the mum went beyond the safety barrier, which she denies, and the tiger bit her sonaposs thumb not clawed at it. The park is run by Oleg Zubkov, who allows some visitors to “safely” mingle with untethered big cats. He is regarded as a legendary lion whisperer and has been featured by the media around the world. The mum says she will make a claim against the park for negligence. Last month, a young woman was mauled to death by a tiger in a safari park after colleagues failed to tell her the door to the tigeraposs cage she was cleaning had been left open, it has been reported. Ecotourism graduate Catalina Ibarra, , was killed by the big cat at Safari Rancagua in the central Chilean city of the same name on Friday. Catalina, , was working at the safari park at the time and was sent to perform cleaning duties when the fatal attack occurred. The tiger leapt on the woman, bit down on her neck and she died instantly, according to reports. According to her colleague Leonardo Maluenda, she was not told the tigeraposs cage door was open.

Many of these are linked to previous and devastating trauma and are only made worse by the circumstances they are forced to live in.Part of our work at Crisis is to ensure our clients have the psychological support they need to establish a le away from homelessness. Keeping this going through the pandemic has been a real challenge and Crisis staff have been finding all sorts of creative solutions.In the early days of the pandemic our coaches worked rapidly to provide phones, tablets, laptops and data to our clients who needed it and adapted our services, including our psychological support, so we could provide a continued leline over the phone and online.With lockdown and restrictions now eased, it is a relief for our clients to feel less of the added mental pressure that we#ve had from the circumstances of the last year and for face-to-face support to be more of an option again.Whether in person or online, all our work is only made possible by the fantastic people and organisations who support us, meaning we can continue to help people across the country to leave homelessness behind for good.On behalf of Crisis and the thousands of people we support each year, we would particularly like to thank the players of People’s Postcode Lottery, across Scotland and where, who have helped fund the vital work of our clinical psychologists in such dficult times.Peter Oakes, lead clinical psychologist at CrisisSir,Recent disruptions with our ferry service from Islay to the mainland have once again shown us just how much we depend on a fit-for-purpose service with reliable, newer vessels in operation.Unfortunately this is currently not the case as our ferry fleet has been underfunded for many years,not decades, as a result of decisions made by urban-centric central government.Our frontline CalMac ferry crews and port staff are hard-working and an asset to our island and mainland communities, however they can only work with the tools they have at hand.The -year-old MV Hebridean Isles is one of the oldest in the state-owned fleet and while it was no doubt good in its day that day has passed a long time ago. Problems with our Islay ferry service have also been exacerbated with the continued poaching of one of our ferries in the summer months for other areas that CalMac operates in.On numerous occasions, distillers on Islay said they were facing major problems in transporting whisky to the Scottish mainland because of a capacity crisis on the ferry links.The feeling amongst many of my constituents is that it is we on Islay, Jura and Colonsay who always end up getting a raw deal.This simply cannot be allowed to continue.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,Thanks to funding from the Scottish Power Foundation, an Argyll and Bute scheme is offering young people a new route to gaining employment and skills in heritage.Heritage Horizons, run by the Culture, Heritage and Arts Assembly, Argyll and Isles , and Argyll and Bute Heritage and Museums Forum, aims to address the issue of an ageing workforce in the heritage and museums sectors by offering skill-building opportunities for young people.The project will work with Argyll heritage venues in areas of high unemployment, developing  accredited placements for young people. Participants will discover traditional building skills, learn how to guide visitors, or #takeover# the social media accounts for a museum: all with the aim of improving their future employability.The project, which runs until May , has three main strands of work: providing work experience placements for young people aged - who will study for a Trinity College Arts Award accredited workshops and events and a series of school visits.For more information, contact project co-ordinators Kirsty MacNabat kirsty@chartsargyllandisles.org or Pamela Campbellat pamela@chartsargyllandisles.org.Seymour Adams, Culture, Heritage and Arts Assembly, Argyll and Isles Board"},{"url":null,"title":"fiona celebrates double wins","story":" Updated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowLochgilphead golfer Fiona McLeod completed a unique double, winning Dunaverty Golf Club#s R.N.L.I Open Event with a net score of .Fiona#s victory added to her previous success in winning Dunty#s Holiday Open back in July with a net score of .

St Peter#sSt Peter#s win - on penaltiesRed Star welcomed St Peter#s to the Ropework last Saturday for their Scottish Cup first round tie and were disappointed to exit the competition after an even contest ended - after  minutes.There weren#t many chances created by either side despite the best efforts of the players with defences largely on top.Star’s best efforts came from distance with Fraser Talbot going close to opening the scoring on a couple of occasions.St Peter’s most likely route to goal was from set-pieces which caused Star a few minor problems early on, but left Jake Weir largely untroubled in the Star goal.The sides exchanged goals late in the first half.Star took the lead from a typically wicked Craig Aitken corner which caused a mixup in the St Peter#s defence and the ball bundled in off a visitors# defender.Star couldn’t hold the lead till the break and St Peter#s were back on even terms after a rare lapse in the Star backline Jake Weir did well to save the initial effort but the St Peter#s winger reacted sharpest to score from close range. -.The second half was once again proving to be a tight affair with neither keeper really being troubled and it was no surprise that the game ended up going to penalty kicks.It was the visitors who edged the shootout with Coll McCallum and Craig Aitken being the unfortunate players to see their kicks saved after Andy Weir and Lee MacLean had scored.St Peter#s made no mistake with their four kicks and booked their place in the next round of the cup.Although disappointed to go out, Star will be delighted to finally play a League game for the first time in  months tomorrow as they travel to Parklea to face Port Glasgow OBU."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor september 10 2021","story":" Updated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowMore Commercial TreesSirI refer to the letter from Mick Bottomley of Forestry and Land Scotland in the August  edition of the Advertiser, where he puts forward the case for more commercial trees.I am very respectful of the timber industry#s important place in the Scottish economy and understand the need to pursue and develop such commercial opportunities in this area for landowners businesses.To balance the growth of the industry of trees for timber I would, however, hope that in turn greater respect is paid to the impact on the landscape the way the land is left after felling and the way the logs are transported.To take the A for example, a road that is promoted for tourism by government marketing initiatives and signs indicating a scenic route .Along the way, you pass and see great swathes of Sitka Spruce or, worse, ugly and bleak areas of devastation where they have been felled.This is while you avoid oncoming log lorries, at times along a very narrow road or, indeed, get stuck behind one.I would suggest thatwe need more commercial trees , we also need greater sensitivity shown and responsibility taken regarding the locations used, the management of the areas and transport.A start would be the edging of the road and forests with mixed deciduous trees so screening areas, particularly when felled,  and to take as much of the transport of logs off lorries and onto the water.Such steps would show some respect to the touristand to the local population.Name and address suppliedSirNew NHS Scotland workforce statistics published on September  show nursing and midwery vacancies have been at a record high since March, with more than , posts unfilled.The statistics show that, as of June , , nursing and midwery posts were vacant, this represents .% of all posts.They also show that in the previous quarter , ,posts were unfilled.

Academics agree that a sustainable level of material use, which would still allow for a high quality of le, is about eight tonnes per person per year.Zero Waste Scotland is advocating for mindful shopping, encouraging Scots to buy smarter and adopt reuse, repair and renting behaviours as well as embracing second-hand shopping.When finished with an item, it is calling on people to dispose of items responsibly by donating, reselling or recycling.With global climate change discussions at an all-time high and COP coming to Glasgow this November, the topic of responsible consumption in relation to the climate crisis has never been more timely.Everything we buy has a carbon cost and we are urging Scots to think dferently about what we buy and how we consume.Changing our own consumption habits is the single biggest thing we can all do to play our part in tackling climate change.Now is the time for action and we want people to bin less and buy better, seeking out items which will last longer.Responsible consumption isn’t on the COP agenda so we wanted to ensure it is top of the consumer agenda.To learn more about the campaign, please visit www.howtowasteless for further details.Iain Gulland, chief executive, Zero Waste Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters does genetic tolerance aid wild swimmers","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWild swimming has become increasingly popular during lockdown, but in general people are ided into those who love swimming in cold water and those who think that it’s complete madness.Now scientists have found a possible explanation for this ision related to a muscle protein called alpha-actinin- .We have two types of muscle fibres # type  and type .Type  fibres provide fatigue resistance important for prolonged, submaximal activity like marathon running, while type  fibres produce a rapid and powerful force for short-burst, vigorous activities such as sprinting.The two types of fibres respond dferently to cold exposure # type  fibres produce an involuntary, low-intensity, continuous increase in muscle tone, while type  fibres give bursts of high-intensity activity causing overt shivering.ACTN is only active in type  muscle fibres, and deficiency of this protein is caused by a non-ing ACTN gene.This occurs in - per cent of the world’s population, around . billion people, and is most common in Europe and Asia.These people lack type  muscle fibre activity and although this is compensated by having larger type  fibres, it adversely affects muscle , impacting on athletic performance, particularly in sprint and power activities.Now scientists have investigated the role of ACTN in cold tolerance .Male participants,  with ing and  with non-ing ACTN, were immersed in water at °C for -minute periods interspersed with -minute rest periods at room temperature .The ordeal ended either after a maximum of six immersions or when participants’ body temperature dropped to .°C.The scientists found improved cold tolerance in those with non-ing ACTN, some  per cent of whom maintained body temperature above .°C compared to  per cent of those with al ACTN.So those lacking al type  fibres had better cold tolerance, suggesting that cold-induced increased muscle tone is more efficient at generating heat than overt shivering.Improved cold tolerance probably gave our ancestors an evolutionary survival advantage after their migration from Africa to colder climes in Eurasia, so explaining the high frequency of non-ing ACTN in today’s northern populations.It would be interesting to investigate how many Scottish wild swimmers carry this genetic iant.

He recalled: ‘We were out on a day sailing on the Dasher when she blew up and sank. They lost more than  men that day. And I lost my tools.’It was after the second world war that Peter realised his ambition of running his own electrical company.He had started his electrical apprenticeship in  at the age of  with the Campbeltown and Mid Argyll Electrical Supply Company, and by  he was ready to set up shop in Argyll Street, moving to Colchester Square in the s by which time he and his business partner Davie Wilson employed  members of staff,  working from Campbeltown to Strontian and on Islay, Mull, Coll and Tiree.Peter recalled the start of his career: ‘I used to leave at am, get my rolls in the morning before travelling up to get the ferry to Craignure on Mull,  then I’d take a bus to get the ferry over to Iona and then make the trip back home again. It was very hard work but it’s just what you did back then.’It was also at the end of the war that Peter married a woman he had met while working at the Clyde shipyards. His we Anne was from a family of  children brought up in Kilmacolm.Speaking at Peter#s birthday celebration, his daughter Margaret Loughran said: #My dad, his parents and his sisters Maria and Netta were given a really warm welcome when they moved to Lochgilphead in the s.#There were hardly any other families from outside Scotland living here at that time so they were always really grateful to have been accepted into the community.#I think that#s why Dad worked so hard over the years to support the church and the community more generally.#"},{"url":null,"title":"new argyll shop local gift card set for launch","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowA new gt card is coming soon to help Argyll businesses emerge from the pandemic with the help of local residents.The Argyll and Bute love local gt card will allow holders to enjoy a fantastic range of products, services and experiences on offer across the area, including hotel stays, gts, clothing, dining, household goods, groceries and services such as garages and accountants.Businesses are being encouraged to register for the Scottish Government-backed scheme to stimulate increased local spending and help protect jobs across Argyll and Bute.A map and listings of all registered businesses will appear on a dedicated Argyll and Bute webpage on the Scotland Gts Local website when the card launches next month.The gt cards will be sold online via the Scotland Gts Local , which allows people from all over the world to order a card.An ever-growing number of Argyll and Bute businesses are signing up, including cafes, bookshops, opticians, tourist attractions, gt shops and supermarkets.The scheme is being delivered by Scotland’s Towns Partnership , which is behind the Scotland Loves Local Campaign with funding from the Scottish Government and endorsed by Argyll and Bute Council.Visit www.lovelocal.scot gtcard to find out more about the Scotland Loves Local gt card, including details on how to sign up.Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for the economy and rural growth, said: #The gt card scheme presents an excellent opportunity to support our local businesses as they continue to recover from the impact of COVID.#It has the potential to generate signicant spending across Argyll and Bute’s economy, helping secure jobs and build a more sustainable future for the region’s communities.#We would encourage all businesses across Argyll and Bute to sign up # this is the perfect way for people to show their support for their local traders particularly in the run-up to the Christmas shopping period.#Scotland’s minister for community wealth, Tom Arthur MSP, said the Scottish Government was #delighted to be backing this innovative scheme#, adding: #The gt card is a quick and efficient way to encourage spend and drive sales growth in our local economies.#The Argyll and Bute gt card is one of , unique to each region of Scotland, and can only be spent in businesses located in the region.[Would you box the following please and set in body of copy ]"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week september 24 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowI had the wonderful privilege the other week of holding a new grandson for the first time.Isn#t it amazing how a new-born infant can grab hold of your heart  I was filled with so much love and pride and I prayed that his le would be blessed.It so happened that the Gospel reading set for the Sunday after I met my grandson was, in part at least, about a little child.​Mark tells us Jesus was walking ahead of his disciples on the way to Capernaum. When they got there Jesus asked them: #What were you arguing about along the way #They couldn#t answer, for they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest. They were silent, because they#d been caught out.Then Jesus took a little child in his arms and said to them: #Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me, welcomes not me but the one who sent me.#Greatness, Jesus was saying to them, is found in welcoming and receiving into our arms someone vulnerable, powerless and dependent, regardless of age.Greatness is found not in what we have accomplished but in what we have done and given to #the least of these#, the hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, and imprisoned: the symbolic children in each of our lives.Greatness never makes itself superior over another. It is not about me, my job, my reputation, my status.

There simply isn’t space to accommodate everybody, so there is a degree of compromise.#There are opportunities for season tickets, but that does come at a cost as part of the council process. There are proposals for permits for businesses as well as residents.Councillor Lorna Douglas said there was #real concern# where staff who were not on high salaries could have to pay for a permit costing more than £.She added: #Luss is not an easy place to get to. I know people who work there and do car pools, but to me, £ for a permit is massive.#Stuart Watson, the council’s traffic and development manager, replied: #Businesses can get two permits which can be for staff as well.

We were delighted to welcome them to Argyll for their first performance as a quartet and for three of the four performers this was the first time they had performed in more than a year.The quartet # Andrew, Dean, Jack and Richard # introduced each piece, giving background to both the role of the saxophone and the composer, with many of the pieces arranged by the group themselves.Purcell’s #Festival Rondeau# was the dramatic opening, a work well-known across all age groups, so a perfect start to the concert.Following this was a work composed specically for a saxophone quartet in  by Jean-Baptiste Singelée, a friend of Adolph Sax who invented the saxophone. We were treated to the traditional Andante before moving onto the exciting Allegro.The third selection of pieces were all by Debussy. This was a surprising choice as the saxophone is not really associated with the Impressionist period, however, it showed the versatility of both the saxophones and performers. #Arabesque No.# was followed by #The Little Shepherd# which was delightful, calm and serene with only the sound of the river flowing through the trees and birds singing along. The jaunty #Cakewalk# completed this ied section.#Air on a G String# by Bach and known to many as a TV advert was the next offering. The opening descending bass line showed the depth and quality of the baritone saxophone in much more than just a supporting role. This music predates the invention of the saxophone by more than  years.Gershwin and a selection of show tunes from the swing era were just what we needed after the relaxing #Air#. The four musical songs, all showcasing dferent styles, certainly had the audience smiling, toe-tapping and singing along. In the final piece #I Got Rhythm# we were all moving to the music, including the quartet. Closing your eyes, you could imagine you were relaxing in a jazz club anywhere in the world.The next piece, #L’Arlesienne Exhibition#, is a collection of highlights for the saxophone in an orchestral situation. The music was composed by Hiroki Takahashi, with many familiar themes from film and TV # including The Apprentice # all thoroughly enjoyable.Gershwin’s #An American in Paris# portrays the many sights and sounds that Gershwin experienced there in the s. While it was composed for an orchestra which included saxophones and car horns, the music played by the quartet didn’t include any car horns # just skilled and imaginative saxophonists.A change of pace to enjoy some relaxed, laid-back music from West Africa followed with Will Gregory’s #High Le#. The repeated rhythms with the peace of Kilmory, the cooling air and the gentle river flowing was almost hypnotic and brought the concert to a finish.The audience cheered, clapped and blew their cars horns to ensure the quartet provided an encore. #Witch Hunt# by Ulrich Schultheiss was the encore # a dramatic and fiery work challenging all the performers and bringing a fantastic concert to a close.The quartet members themselves didn#t feel the cars were a barrier and said they #had a blast at a unique and special event#.MAAA thank the th Argyll Scoutsfor helping with the car parking. Traffic cones and hi-vis waistcoats were loaned by MacLeods and the wagon we used as a stage was from Ferguson#s Butchers. Picnic boxes were pre-ordered from Lucy’s Ardfern.

especially when it comes to the impact of proposed sites on traditional fishing grounds # poor site maintenance and monitoring which can lead to instances of vessel entanglement and also the environmental impact of the sites on both commercial and non-commercial species.The group believes that while the sector has made many advances over the past decade, increased transparency and oversight are needed to ensure the aquaculture sector can better co-exist with the fishing industry.The initial aim of the group would be to ensure that there is a proper analysis of localised fishing and follow up with clear and sensible communication between the two sectors to ensure that with expansion does not come conflict.It is a timeous idea, which will hopefully reassure fishermen that they will not simply be displaced by fish farming but will be respected for their own produce.The group will cement a policy to assist the fishing industry deal realistically with the fish farming industry and the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation.Simon Macdonald, chair RIFG Aquaculture Work GroupSir,NFU Scotland is calling on the UK Government to address the nation’s growing labour crisis, which is undermining all parts of the food and drink supply chain, leading to signicant losses on some Scottish farms and resulting in a growing number of empty shop shelves.Last week#s #BackBritishFarmingDay on September  came as a UK Government announcement of a free trade #agreement in principle# between the UK and New Zealand is believed to be imminent.Having agreed in June to provide unfettered access in the future to Australia, the cumulative impact of another deal with a major exporting nation has huge signicance for Scottish farmers and crofters.With so much to celebrate about the quality and standards of our food and drink, #BackBritishFarmingDay was a fantastic opportunity to thank the nation for their incredible support throughout Brexit and Covid-.NFU Scotland, both independently and in conjunction with the Scottish food and drink industry, has written several times to UK Government calling for measures that address the shortfall in both seasonal and permanent staff.Should it fail to do so, I have absolutely no doubt that the situation will deteriorate further.It is galling to hear that the UK Government is on the verge of signing up to another free trade deal that will permit a growing level of imports while delivering very little to our food and drink sector in .The blunt fact is that neither deal has been afforded any kind of proper parliamentary scrutiny as the government’s promised Statutory Trade and Agriculture Commission has yet to be established.Safeguards against market disruption are also promised, but the cumulative impact of these deals will be profound for UK farming.If handled badly, these may make it impossible for some of our family farming businesses to continue to compete with high levels of low-cost imports produced to standards that would not be allowed here.Martin Kennedy, president, NFU ScotlandSir,National audits of diabetic services have shown that only around  per cent of people with type one or two diabetes have nine key annual checks to help prevent long-term diabetic complications.The pandemic has made this situation dficult because many routine checks and face-to-face appointments have not been available.The InDependent Diabetes Trusthas published a free new booklet which explains the nine key tests.It helps people look after their health by ensuring that they know what checks they need from health professionals.Get your copy of Diabetes care #

The GHK Goal Keeper was kept on her toes and made some valiant saves from the aggressive Reivers frontline of Katie Macdonald, Maartje de Zoeten, Mackenzie Crick and Felicity Walls.On the stroke of time another breakaway from GHK saw them complete the game with a - victory and all three points going to the Glasgow Team.Game two against Grove Menzieshill was a completely dferent story. With a reshuffle of players in positions, the Reivers girls looked far more composed and confident. By half time the Reivers had slotted three away through Naesi de Zoeten, Felicity Walls and Lily Byers.Second half saw more of the same with another two balls finding the net through Lily and Mackenzie.

Other companies include EG ndash which also owns Asda ndash along with Esso, BP, Shell, Tesco, Sainsburyrsquos and Morrisons.ndash What have they been saying about the shortages EG introduced caps on spending per driver, limiting fuel purchases to pound in order to support its supply. Others, such as Esso, have apologised to customers after some pumps ran dry of petrol and diesel.A statement by Shell, ExxonMobil and other industry bodies said the pressures on supply were the result of ldquotemporary spikes in customer demand.ndash Why is demand so high Following reports last week that BP had warned the Government that it would not be able to fulfil all deliveries due to HGV driver shortages, motorists became concerned and rushed to the pumps. This caused a panic and led to a spike in demand, which further exacerbated the supply worries.ndash Is there enough petrol and diesel to go round Yes. There is no issue with the amount of fuel going through refineries. Oil giant ExxonMobil, which operates Esso forecourts and runs the UKrsquos largest refinery, said it is operating as normal and has ldquostrong supply to distribution sites.The problem is getting it to the pumps and reacting to the latest surge in demand. The rising demand led the Petrol Retailers Association to warn that as many as two thirds of its membership of nearly , independent outlets were out of fuel on Sunday.ndash What are the causes of the problems vw,vw,px, px\"A Shell petrol station in Bracknell, Berkshire, which has no fuel A global HGV driver shortage has left logistics firms scrambling to fulfil deliveries. Before the fuel issues arose, supermarkets had been warning for months that deliveries were struggling to get through. The Government attempted to take a firm line, saying companies should be training up British drivers, rather than relying on EU ones, as they had done before. However, logistics firms pointed out that training takes several months and the DVLA had a huge backlog of people wanting to take a test.ndash Is Brexit to blame Partly. The HGV shortage is global but the UK has felt the pain more acutely because thousands of drivers from the EU left the country during the pandemic and did not . Brexit rules prevented them from taking up vacant positions. The Road Haulage Association estimated last month that , EU drivers left during the pandemic, with only around  of these ing.Some argue that being part of the EU meant wages in the sector were depressed for several years, as supermarkets squeezed suppliers.ndash What other factors caused the shortage Covid- closed HGV testing sites, causing a backlog in those looking to take the test. There is also an ageing workforce and the long hours with low pay ndash compared with rates where in Europe ndash have also contributed.ndash What happens next Forecourt owners will be hoping the initial rush to the pumps will soon ease and supply can get back to manageable levels. Operators have suggested that drivers can only stock up on a limited amount of fuel. This should allow the shortage to subside more quickly than the supply problems seen at supermarkets at the start of the pandemic.The Government has said competition laws will be scrapped temporarily, so companies can better liaise to deal with any shortages. Reports had also suggested that drivers from the Army could be drafted to help with deliveries, although although this was swtly rebuffed by the Environment Secretary George Eustice.ndash Will fuel shortages remain longer term It is unlikely. Although some have said the Government was too slow to deal with the HGV driver shortage, several changes have been brought in, which ministers hope will streamline the process and get more drivers qualied and on the road. The sector has already started paying drivers more and signing on bonuses.

the situation in Scotland Long queues and pump closures have wreaked havoc across the UK, but the problems arent actually related to a fuel shortage \"at the source\".Heres what you need to know...Why are there fuel shortages at petrol stations There are numerous reasons for the fuel shortages at petrol stations, but the good news is that there is no fuel shortage \"at the source\" in the UK.Instead, it was alack of HVG drivers that initially meant fuel could not reach a small number of petrol stations around the UK.BP told the UK Government last week that due to a lack of lorry drivers available to deliver fuel, it would prioritise motorway services and limit fuel delivery to keep the supply chain running.As a result, fuel was not delivered to some stations, causing the closure of some pumps.This ledto long queues and then panic buying, with supermarket Sainsburys reportinga surge in demand for fuel over the weekend as people rushed to fill up there cars.According topresident of the AA Edmund King, the shortages could pass in a few dayspeople only filled their cars when they needed and avoided panic purchasing.\"The good news is you can only really fill up once ndash yoursquove got to use the fuel, so this should be a short-term thing,\" he said.\"Itrsquos not like the fuel crises in the past when the supplier was hit by strikes, etc.\"So, once people have filled up, they wonrsquot travel more than they normally travel, so this strain on the system should ease up in the next few days.\"He addedthat there\"is plenty of fuel at source\", a statement which has been reiterated by UK Transport Minister Grant Shapps and Scotlandsdeputy first minister John Swinney.Speaking on Sunday, Shapps said there \"is no shortage of fuel\", whileSwinney said there is an \"adequate supply of fuel to meet normal demand\" in Scotland.What is the government doing to deal with the fuel shortages According to reports, the UK Government is considering easing restrictions on immigration to allow more foreign lorry drivers to come and work in the UK on a temporary basis.A shortage of HVG drivers has been causing problems in dferent sectors over the past few months, with supermarkets also hit.The reported plans have been met with mixed reaction.Tony Danker, the director general of the Confederation of British Industrydescribed the expected change in rules on visas as a \"huge relief\" but said it was a \"shamethe government needed queues at pumps to move\".However, critics of the plan suggest the government cant expect workers who were forced to leave to rush back on a temporary basis.Andy Prendergast, national officer of the GMB union, told the PA news agency: \"Five years ago this country basically told European truck drivers to get on their bike.\"Now wersquore in a crisis and we are desperate to welcome them back with open arms. Itrsquos no surprise they arenrsquot queuing up to come back to the country that slung them out.\"Changing immigration rules or relaxing driversrsquo tests is not the way to solve the HGV shortage. Paying drivers what they know they are worth, and improving appalling conditions in the industry, is.\""},{"url":null,"title":"leader september 3 2021","story":"REWD Group#s commitment to invest £, into the  Campbeltown properties it has just purchased for £. million is welcome news.Some of the homes are in such poor condition that they require the level of investment that only bigger property companies such as REWD are able to offer to bring them back into use.The company assured the Courier it is a caring landlord with a desire to provide up-to-standard homes while helping solve the housing crisis.With buildings in desperate need of renovation and people crying out for homes, REWD#s investment is win-win for Campbeltown.Good luck to the successful S students who have been appointed to the roles of school captains, vice captains, sports captains and sportscotland Young Ambassadors.These positions mean far more to these inspirational young people than just something to add to their CVs.During the application process, they were asked to give three words to describe what sort of captain or ambassador they would be and many said words like enthusiastic, compassionate and organised.From speaking to them, it is clear these impressive youngsters are dedicated to improving the ethos and facilities at the school and giving back to their community."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week september 3 2021","story":"In the Bible, there is a story of Jacob, who was going through the biggest crisis of his le so far.God visited him, but Jacob did not realise it was God until next morning.Then Jacob said: #Surely the Lord is in this place, but I knew it not.# Sometimes you can only see and understand when you look back and reflect.Time and time again I see the Bible was written down by people who experienced real le, with all its ups and downs.People who experience good times, yes, but also illness, death, bullying, debt, cheating, hunger…you name it.Just like us.One Bible writer states: #All peace and prosperity have long since gone…I have forgotten what enjoyment is.# Some people have felt like that these last months of the Covid pandemic.

Try and get evergreens planted by the end of the month.Dormant roses are now available at local nurseries and garden centres and are very good value for money.You can easily create a rose garden for the coming year that will provide beautul flowers and fragrance from early summer through to autumn.Before planting, mix in some good quality compost and make sure the plants are watered well once planted.It#s an excellent time to plant coners as well. Coners are cone-bearing seed plants and include cedars, cypresses, firs, junipers, larches, pines, spruces and yews.While being practical and useful, coners are also visually stunning and can transform a garden into something quite magnicent.They are a wonderful way of adding colour and shape to your outdoor space, particularly as many coners change colour throughout the year.With several hundred ieties available in the UK, there is one to suit every type of garden, and they are easy to look after.They need good drainage and water to get them established, but once growing will need little attention as they are pretty disease resistant and maintenance free.In addition to coners, another way to bring colour to the garden at this time of year is with autumn bedding plants.One of the most exciting group of plants to brighten up any part of the garden is heuchera.Native to North America, heucheras were originally grown for their flowers – dainty spikes of red, pink and white

sun, in well composted soil and are fairly pest resistant.They can be established as ground cover in many garden situations like under trees where grass could struggle.October is often a time spent

As a result the gardens are home to an exceptional array of hand-crafted summerhouses and pavilions.HighlightsBefore it was restored, the four-acre walled garden was a derelict space, filled with scrub and weeds. Now it is a productive organic vegetable garden where pumpkins ripen in the autumn sun and the last of the sweet peas scramble over trellises.Manure for the flower and vegetable beds comes from the estatersquos organic farm and in summer the lower part of the garden contains an impressive display of delphiniums, a favourite flower of Prince Charles who played such an important role in saving the estate for the local community.Near the entrance to the walled garden water cascades from a huge fountain shaped like a thistle and a range of elegant glasshouses contain scented-leaf pelargoniums and other hot house plants.At the far end the Kauffman Education Garden offers school children the chance to get hands-on experience of growing food.Donrsquot MissThe Rothesay Garden is filled with sedums and hydrangeas that provide colour into autumn while in front of the house lies a giant parterre filled with roses.

At times, such was the turmoil and ineptitude on display, you would not have left this crew in charge of a rubber duck, never mind a nuclear-powered submarine.Precision was not the point though, this being a piece of fiction. In its favour, Tom Edgersquos drama had a solid gold cast and a strongoccasionally baffling script .Above all, Vigil had pluck and ambition. While this was a tale made for the small screen, the action scenes could have passed muster in a cinema.: No Line of Duty but Jones makes impactWhen we left Amy Silvaat the end of episode it looked as though the jig was up for the DCI.Lamped by a sonar operator who turned out to be an agent for the Russkies, Amy had been stuffed in the same kind of missile casing that had been Martin Compstonrsquos home for the past five weeks. She would have been a goner in the first ten minutessomeone had not walked in on the villain just in time. A lot of that went on in the final hour.Entombed in a tube, all Amy could do was scream for help and think back to the love she had driven away, fellow copper Kirsten , and the daughter who had lost her fatherin a car accident.Eventually, Amy remembered she knew Morse code. As luck would have it, there was someone in the control room who could interpret the messageand with one bound, and a quick vomit, Amy was free to nick the villain.But she had to avoid him killing her first. The chase through the submarine was heart in the mouth stuff, the corridors bathed in red, lights fizzing and flashing.Amy, lithe and muscular, sweating for Scotland in her vest, looked positively Ripleyesque as she hunted the alien presence in her midst.Meanwhile, water was pouring into the boat courtesy of the bad guyrsquos earlier handiwork - he had been a very busy boy - and HMS Vigil was heading for Davy Jonesrsquo locker. The unluckiest submarine in the world looked to be about to meet its fate.But onboard and on shore, the women were not going to let that happen. Though men were predominant, especially at the boss level, it was women who made the key moves, much as in Line of Duty .The men squared off and honour was saved, the anti-Trident MP agreeing to keep quiet ldquothis time. Not before he had a mini rant about getting nukes out of Scotland within his letime, however.It had all been a Russian plot to make the nukes in Scotland seem unsafe and steer MPs into cancelling a replacement deterrent, which sounded a bit rum. Who was to say it would not have had the opposite effect : Was Vigil filmed on a submarine There was no time to worry about any of that because there was hair to be stroked and a relationship to repair. Amy and Kirsten, with their shared love for justice and nice coats, had some talking to do.The last word went to our Martin, which was only fair given he had been stuffed in a tube for a month and a half . As poignant music played he banged on in his last video testament about what a wonderful world it was.The Russkies were back in their box and the planet was safe once more, albeit courtesy of enough explosive power to blow us all to kingdom come. Never mind such details for now, this had been a blast."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13009094.jpg?type=article-full","title":"autumn-walks-ten-amazing-woodland-trails","story":"Find ten more walks, from the Herald Magazinehere.Killiecrankie, PerthshireThe Pass of Killiecrankie knows how to show off its autumn clothes, as, at this time of year, its leaves turn through their many rich shades. One way to take them in is on the walk from the Killiecrankie visitor centre to Soldierrsquos Leap, the spot where a Redcoat soldier jumped across the raging River Garry, fleeing the Jacobites. This, of course is the site of one of the goriest battles in Scottish history, but it is also more than that. The National Trust for Scotland, which cares for it, describes it as a site of special scientic interest for its semi-ancient woodland. The Gaelic name for Killiecrankieis thought to translate as wood of the trembling trees, referring to quaking aspens.Loch Garten Trails, AbernethyAnyone who has watched Springwatch or Winterwatch will know the Abernethy National Nature Reserve very well, since itrsquos the spot in the Cairngorms where the showrsquos team based themselves over several years. The reserve encompasses one of the largest remnants of Caledonian pinewood. As Chris Packham once put it, ldquoIf yoursquore into wildle in the UK, itrsquos an absolute Mecca. Itrsquos a magnet for me. When you are a kid and into natural history, a lot of the sexiest stuff is there. Among its best trails are those around Loch Garten. There, a half-mile, Big Pines trail takes the hiker past some of the forestrsquos tallest trees, its massive ldquogranny Scots pines.Smeaton Estate Arboretum, East LothianSmeatonrsquos arboretum is a bit of a secret treasure, hidden away near the coast in East Lothian. Created in the s, and continued and conserved by the Gray family, it has such a ied collection of trees it has earned a place in the National Tree Collections of Scotland list. A short walk round a small lake takes you past giant redwoods, a sweeping sycamore, lime and ash. A delightful nursery is also housed in the walled garden, selling plants and trees, and a tea room offers lunches and treats.Dog Falls trails, Glen AffricGlen Affricrsquos pinewoods represent one of the largest and last remaining fragments of native pinewood forest in the UK and it was declared a national nature reserve in . But its story even before then is remarkable. Forester Finlay Macrae took a pioneering approach to managing it in the mid twentieth century. Rather than cover it in dense plantations of commercial trees, he collected Scots pine seed and grew the on, ultimately planting some  million trees. From the car park at the Dog Falls picnic area, itrsquos possibly to take one of three routes, a viewpoint trail, a circuit of the loch and a visit to Dog Falls itself. Whichever you choose yoursquoll find yourself wandering between gnarled granny Scots pines, silver birch and oaks covered in beards of grey lichen.: great Scottish woodland walks to colour up your autumnAriundle oakwoods, ArdnamurchanIn remote Ardnamurchan, near the rushing Strontian river, you can walk through the kind of oak woods that once cloaked Europersquos Atlantic coast. Itrsquos just the trees themselves that are a wonder but the abundant bioersity these woodlands support. Over  species of lichen have been recorded, some rare and scarce. A circular walk takes you through a woodland rich with liverworts and mosses. You are trekking through the lush wonder that is Scotlandrsquos rainforest.Carrran Wildwood, MoffatThe woods at Carrran are still young, so donrsquot expect grand, ancient trees. The oldest yoursquoll find here is the lone rowan they call ldquothe survivor, which projects out over the hillside and which inspired the Carrran Wildwood project to plant a million native trees and bring forest back to the Southern Uplands which was once, before the arrival of sheep, a wooded landscape. A walk through it, though, is an inspiration. The planting here is the work of a volunteer group and is one of southern Scotlands most important sites of ecological restoration. Start from the Carrran Wildwood car park and follow the rough and informal paths.Dollar Glen, OchilsNear Dollar is a spot in the Ochil hills where two streams, the Burn of Care and the Burn of Sorrow, run down, converging in a dramatic tree-lined gorge, just below Castle Campbell. The trail here, a .km loop, takes you under a canopy of trees, over bridges and to views over cascading waterfalls. Itrsquos also a site of special scientic interest due to the  species of moss and over  species of lichen it hosts. Autumn brings bright berries to its rowans, hazel nuts scattered over the ground and a shimmer to the leaves of its birch.Chatelherault Country Park, HamiltonIf you want to put le in perspective, then Chatelherault Country Park is the place to do it. Its Cadzow oaks are some of the oldest in Scotland at over  years old and worth pausing as you contemplate the changing times theyve seen. Chatelherault, however, has more to offer than these gnarled ancients ndash a wooded gorge, giant redwoods, badgers, otters, bats, and  miles of walks. To see the oaks, head for the also fascinating Cadzow earthworks, though to date back even further, to at least the th century.:Fellowship of the rings: Why we must protect our ancient treesBeinn Eighe woodland trail, Loch MareeBeinn Eighe, the UKrsquos first National Nature Reserve, offers several dferent trails starting at its visitor centre, and its shortest the woodland route is an easy gem, rising high enough though for some spectacular views over Loch Maree and up to the towering peak of Slioch. The pines at this reserve, some of which are over  years old, have been found to be genetically dferent from those in the central Highlands.

The route can be accessed from the Lodge Forest Visitor Centre in Aberfoyle and is designed to accommodate wheelchairs and buggies. The park boasts  dferent species of coner alongside remnants of ancient oaks, as well as red squirrels, pine martens and water voles.

On st April , Lachie was appointed as the first member of staff and director and went on to become the chief executive officer.: #At that time, the association had built four houses for affordable rent in Glendale. It now has a housing portfolio of  affordable rent and  shared equity properties.#In addition to the affordable housing stock, Lachie has expanded the association’s range of services beyond our tenants to the wider community by taking over the responsibility of the care and repair service from Shelter and establishing the handyperson service — the first in Scotland # to assist our elderly folk in Lochalsh and Skye remain at home for as long as is reasonably possible.#He also established our innovative energy advice service for the wider community to reduce household fuel costs.#He added: ”Through Lachie’s leadership, the association has grown from one to  members of staff who all have the highest regard and respect for this man.“I have never heard a bad word said about Lachie, either from the staff, the board or within the community in which he serves.#While unaware of Mr McIvor#s praise, Lachie was quick to commend his colleagues for their important contributions to those achievements.#We have a fantastic staff team # we really are blessed. None of this is down to me, it is down to working as a team.“In that I include the board which over the years has been absolutely fantastic in supporting ideas.#If the board didn#t think that taking on a handy person project or setting up care and repair, or energy advice service was good, these things wouldn#t have happened — they have been very open about the role that the association could play as a community anchor.”He added: #Some of the things that we do I think are fantastic and have been copied where in Scotland # because the notion that we would have handyperson employees installing telecom devices in people#s homes throughout the whole of the Highlands just wouldn#t have been thought of.#I have been really lucky with the quality and flexibility of the people I have worked with # both the board and the staff members.#Commenting on his successor, he went on to say: #Neil Clapperton was until recently the chief executive of Grampian Housing Association through in Aberdeen # so it is a relief to be able to hand over to an experienced person rather than someone from another discipline to be trained up by the existing staff and board.#I think with the senior management now led by Neil and with keeping the same people such as Iain McIvor as director of investment, and our new director of finance services, Graeme Coull, and of course Angus MacLennan as our technical manager — that#s a really powerful team to take the organisation forward.#I#ll miss the people, they are absolutely splendid.#Reflecting on his time, Lachie said: #The housing system in the Highlands and Islands has never been in a better position.“My ambition was to wipe out homelessness in Skye and Lochalsh before I retired, and while I have not quite achieved that we have made huge strides towards dealing with that dficult issue.#I am quite optimistic that I am leaving the sector in a good position and ready to meet the challenges that they have ahead.#Looking ahead to retired le, Lachie said:#My three children and my grandchildren are all resident in and around Glasgow, they are all busy people but I want to spend signicantly more time with them, and also my family from Uist # I have sisters and lots of relatives over there so I#ll have a lot more time to visit them.“And I want to carry on my work as a board member with Am Fasgadh .#The only bit of advice I#ve had about retirement that someone said to me was #When you retire do nothing, and then do something’. I will take a rest and recharge my batteries but then I will have a look at what the future holds.”Mr McIvor added: #On a personal note, I am proud to have known Lachie for over  years as my director and then chief executive officer.#He is also a true friend, as are his family, and through his guidance, support and good humour, I am a better person for knowing Lachie MacDonald.#I have no doubt in my mind that this could be said by anyone who has met this remarkable and modest man.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Flora-Mac-Innes-with-husband-Norman-and-other-family-members.jpg","title":"hebridean history families reunited by the sound of a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineIn one astonishing example, that happened just after the launch of Tobar an Dualchais, a man whose father had died in the Second World War before he was born was able to hear his father’s voice for the first time.For most of us, we can only imagine what that must have been like: strangely recognisable phrases and subtle mannerisms or turns of phrase, along with deeper thoughts of how things might have been dferent…Whatever the case, we can be sure that for those who are able to reconnect or gain greater insight through the recordings of friends and family members long after they have passed is truly extraordinary and deeply personal.My mother, IsabelMacKenzie, had one of these experiences when she attended an event hosted by TAD in Lochboisdale in ..She of course immediately recognised her voice, although it had been some  years since her mother’s death.I never got to meet my grandmother. She died on Good Friday in  in the Sacred Heart Hospital in Daliburgh, South Uist. I was born six months later in the same hospital.I’ve always felt a special connection to her because I was named after her, although this almost didn’t happen.My motherthought she would name me ‘Fiona’. However, when our doctor, the highly regarded Dr Alasdair MacLean , asked what I was to be called and was told, he replied abruptly and conclusively declared that I was instead to be named after my grandmother. And that was that!It is a joy for me to be able to listen to my grandmother’s recordings. Her singing voice is quite similar to my mother’s, and through listening, I get a sense of the person she was..!Flòraidh was certainly hardy, like many women in those days.She gave birth to  children and my mother was the youngest of the ten that survived. She described her eleventh child as “gille mòr snog” . He was stillborn, and very little mention was made of him after his birth. until he was carried out by my grandfather who, with the other children in the family, took him to the cemetery in Baile, Eriskay.Already grateful for the opportunity to hear these recordings of my grandmother, I was truly amazed when I found recordings of her mother – my great grandmother, Mary Johnston.Although attempts had been made by family members over the years to locate these recordings of her, no one had succeeded until I happened upon them quite by accident.She was recorded in , shortly before she died, by Father Angus John MacQueen who was collaborating with John Lorne Campbell at the time and helping to build what now constitutes the ‘Canna Collection’.Mary Johnstonor ‘a Nì’ as she was known to her family, was born in Barra in  and was the daughter of Michael MacNeil of Castlebay and Anne Steele of Boisdale, South Uist.At the age of around four her mother passed away and she was taken to Uist to live with her auntie, whilst her father worked at sea..She tells how after her grandfather’s death her father was given an ultimatum:home to the family croft on Bernerayor it would be handed over to someone .Michael ed, promptly re-married, and Nì was sent back to live with him and her new stepmother..What isn’t mentioned in the recordings is that she was sent to the recently founded Orphanage for Roman Catholic Children in Bute where she trained as a cook.On herto Barra she met Ronald Johnston from Eriskay who was working in a shop in Castlebay and soon after they eloped to Glasgow. The fact that they were of a similar age to one another was considered undesirable at the time more conventionally, women tended to marry men a fair bit older than them.They had eight children together four girls and four boys – two of whom were killed in the Great War.The German aristocrat and photographer Werner Kissling took two marvellous photos of Nì during his famous filming trip to Eriskay in . The photos somehow manage to at once capture conflicting expressions of happiness, sadness, restlessness and contentment. A neat and handsome lady, she nevertheless seems considerably older than the  years she had already lived when Kissling visited.She is remembered as a kind woman who spoke often of le in Barra and the Barra Head islands, though she never set foot on any of them again after her marriage.It means a lot to me that I can listen to recordings of these two women on Tobar an Dualchais. Hearing their voices and listening to them sing songs and give descriptions of the places they lived gives me a stronger sense of who I am.are women, women’s voices are so proportionately under-represented. No one is to blame for this it is just a reflection of the time in history when so much of this material was collected.Looking at the present and to the future, I can see that there is a precious opportunity to speak with my own mother about her le, about themes more related to women, and to motherhood in particular.She herself gave birth to seven children in the s whilst working part-time as a physiotherapist. She was straddling a very traditional world while also trying meet the growing, and often conflicting, expectations of a modern professional woman.She, like so many other women of her generation, has an important story to tell and important insights to give."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG-20210918-WA0002-1.jpg","title":"glory game kinlochshiel lift shintys camanachd cup for the first","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineKeith MacRae struck a hat-trick to seal a deserved victory in front of a bumper crowd # the bulk of whom had made the journey from the west.It might have been Shiel#s first Camanachd final in  years, but their players rose to the challenge in all areas of the pitch to edge out a Lovat team who were making their fourth appearance in the sport#s showcase in six years.After a cagey opening the west-coasters seized the initiative in the th minute # MacRae lashing home on the backhand from  yards after his brother John had pounced on a shanked hit-in from Lovat#s Drew Howie.Shiel grew in confidence after the opener and it took a magnicent ing save from goalkeeper Stuart Macdonald to deny John MacRae a second before Lovat rallied towards the end of the half.And with the interval fast approaching Greg Matheson found space on the left to send a rasping finish high beyond Josh Grant, the Shiel keeper, to square the match.The Kiltarlity side pressed hard in the early stages of the second period, but Shiel#s defence stood firm.And on the hour mark they broke swtly to restore the advantage. MacRae raced onto Jordan Fraser#s lofted pass and as MacDonald advanced the Shiel attacker kept a cool head to deftly clip the ball home and make it -.The goal knocked the stuffing out of Lovat, who struggled to create much in the way of clear chances thereafter. And deep into injury-time MacRae completed the fairy tale with another adroit finish for the hat-trick.There were no shortage of contenders for the Albert Smith medal for man of the match # but the award, now in its th year, went to defensive lynchpin Conor Cormack.After the match the -year-old hat-trick-hero, who previously feared he might have to quit the game after a succession of knee injuries, said: #It#s not really sunk it yet # at the final whistle we had people running to us and crying. It will take a while and maybe it will be a few days before it all hits home.#It#s something we all hoped hadn#t passed us by # you need a good run of games, and fortunately it has worked out for us this year. It#s an amazing feeling.#Kinlochshiel manager Johnston Gill, who has now led the club to the Premier League, MacAulay Cup and Camanachd Cup, added: #Lovat gave us a hard time of it, but we had Keith MacRae on fire today # the whole team were brilliant. #It was nip and tuck after they came back to - but I think we shaded the game as a whole.#We knew the threat they carried, but Fraser Heath was well marked by Finlay MacRae and Conor did a great job against Greg Matheson. #We got our tactics right and used our subs well # they were all outstanding.#It#s a fantastic day # most of the community is here with us in Oban # they are great for us, and give us fantastic backing. We will all enjoy it!#Meanwhile, earlier in the day Skye Camanachd also had a victory to savour as their under- team lted the Ken MacMaster Cup.Goals from Seonaidh MacLeod and Alasdair Stewart sealed a - win over Fort William."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4097188.jpg--.jpg?1632220580000\n","title":"ni businesses showcase their produce and services at london exhibition","story":"DOZENS of Northern Ireland businesses have showcased their products and services at an exhibition in London.The Westminster event is part of the Northern Ireland Offices centenary programme.Business leaders also attended a reception at Downing Street last Wednesday hosted by the prime minister.The government said it would provide businesses with an opportunity to network with international companies and investors.The exhibitors represented a cross-section of sectors within the Northern Ireland economy and included  start-ups.

We ended up going to the same university in Stoke-on-Trent. We’ve been together for almost seven years.“Stoke-on-Trent is very famous for narrowboats and we lived beside a canal. We walked along it every day for work and seeing the narrowboats go past when you’re on the bridge is a lovely idea.“A close friend of ours from America bought a really cheap boat to live on during his uni years. We told him he was an idiot who would get frostbite, but we started to get curious and looked up videos of people living on them. It became our fascination for three or four years,” she said.

Enter email address   This field is required  Sign Up      Josh, who is from the Loughgall area, and Sophie, from just outside Richhill, both work in marketing — Sophie works from home on their narrowboat while Josh works locally.They also have new side businesses — Sophie started Econabee with her mum, selling reusable, handmade eco products and Josh set up a beard care business called Cosy Beard, selling beard balms and oils.In their spare time, they are busy promoting their new way of le on social media  TikTok, where they have , followers.Their jobs helped them raise the £, they needed to buy the boat after spotting it on boating website Apollo Duck following a long search.“We saved money through working during uni, we made money through our respective businesses and also I had a marketing freelance job that helped me generate income during lockdown when businesses were trying to adapt,” said Sophie. “We used money we saved from when we were children that we were going to use for a car or a home,” The couple don’t have a mortgage and pay mooring fees of £ a month, which includes metered electricity.“When we’re cruising, we’re off-grid so we use our diesel engine which also heats up and provides electricity for the boat when we’re not moored up properly. If you want to cruise around you can do so for free as long as you don’t stay in a public area for more than  hours.”While they are moored permanently for their first year of owning a narrowboat, Sophie said they’re looking forward to further exploring once they’re a bit more comfortable.“We’d love to head down towards the Shannon and travel around some more of the waterways in Ireland,” she said.They have now been living on Qisma, an Arabic word meaning fate or destiny, for almost two months. However, Sophie warned that the narrowboat way of le isn’t for everyone.“The eco part of it, being sustainable, was important to us but so was small-living. When Covid hit, we had to pack up all our possessions in a car and we managed to fit everything in and it wasn’t even full. I haven’t bought first-hand clothes for three years — that’s our way of living, we just don’t want to consume,” she said.“With narrowboat living, you have to really think about what you put into the environment. Our water waste is in the environment so we don’t use bleach. Waterways Ireland want to encourage people to keep the water clean and your average anti-bac is harmful. We don’t use washing-up liquid to wash dishes, we use a bar of soap.“To live on a narrowboat, you also have to think seriously about space,” Sophie added. “If you walked on Qisma you’d find she’s very small, only ft wide but ft long, so the space is distributed dferently. Many people like to hoard and have big garages or gardens but on a narrowboat you can’t do that.”Despite the concerns raised by others about the coming cold months, Sophie said she and Josh aren’t worried about winter after giving one of their heat sources a dry run. “We’ve just heated up the wood-fired stove for the first time and it was so cosy but also boiling — the narrowboat heats up so quickly. Once we did that, I realised winter wouldn’t be so bad along with our central heating,” she said.You can follow the couple at @cruisingqisma.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadNI voucher scheme: Patience urged as applications open – how to get yoursBangor gran loses £, after getting knocked out by rack of floor mats in Poundstretcher shop‘Beast of Bangor’ paedophile Gary McNeill dies suddenly after jail releaseMajor drug dealer flees Lisburn home to avoid armed criminals from Dublin collecting £k Kinahan debtFamily demand inquest into mum’s death after Belfast care home probe uncovers mistakes and raises questions over Covid diagnosisTop VideosPlayReaction: Barry#s in Portrush closes for goodPlayVideo: Will Belfast spend the high street voucher wisely PlayWoman narrowly avoids oncoming train after ignoring closed barriersLatest Northern IrelandEx-MP who bullied Northern Ireland victim not expected to speak at Labour conferenceConor Murphy repeats warning that peace funding could be lostO’Neill calls on DUP to end ‘unacceptable block’ on welfare legislationDUP MLA brands Executive Covid- decisions ‘draconian and undemocratic’Amy CochraneOpinionMonday mornings never saw such excitement, but trust Stormont to serve up ‘bad gateway’ with high street voucherLatestUlster assistant coach Dan Soper hopeful that John Cooney won#t require long lay-offQatar Airways announce £ billion losses amid pandemicLoose Women’s Denise Welch ‘relieved’ after man admits stalking herEx-MP who bullied Northern Ireland victim not expected to speak at Labour conferenceMP Claudia Webbe made naked pictures threat over jealousy, court told,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There’s rocker Gary Lightbody, world-famous Catholic priest Fr Martin Magill... and, of course, The Man Above.But it wasn’t always like that, and you’d probably never guess that this highly respected man of the cloth was once an atheist.Then again, the Co Antrim native has never been one for fitting societal stereotypes.“Going back a few years, I was even scruffier than I am now, and I had an earring no one believed what I did for a living,” he told the Belfast .“One customs officer just wouldn’t accept that I was a minister. He was about to ask me what the four Gospels were…”After yet another disbelieving customs officer handed back the long-haired cleric’s passport, he said to her: “You don’t think Jesus had short back and sides, do you ”Such unshakeable faith wasn’t a staple of the younger Stockman’s psyche.

Enter email address   This field is required  Sign Up      “When I was in lower sixth and looking at jobs, I wanted to be a sports or music journalist,” he said.“I wanted to be the one asking the questions. I remember making up radio shows for English class and writing a youth club magazine.”Believe it or not, he also “went through a decade of atheism from age seven to ” — starting the year he crossed another ide by switching from supporting Manchester United to Manchester City.“I was waiting for the football to start one Sunday afternoon when I was seven and during the programme before it, an interviewer asked his guestthey believed in God,” he recalled.“I thought that was an interesting question and decided quickly that I didn’t.“I don’t know what my reasons were for not believing but they were very strong. I wasn’t a passive atheist I used to argue with Christians that there was no God.”But Steve, who has been based at Fitzroy Presbyterian Church for the last  years, now believes that “might have been the moment that God started nudging me to the question”.Ultimately, it was the rock music fan’s friends who helped change his mind about God’s existence when he was .“I was hanging around with Christians and asking the question, ‘If God doesn’t exist, then why are these guys so committed and so at peace with their world ” he said.“So I started to pray and study the Bible... and then I sensed that God was very much in my le.”There were ‘signs’ too.“I was sitting in front of my album collection and the rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd were at the front of it,” he revealed.“One of their albums — Street Survivors — has them standing in flames and I remember saying, ‘Well,you’re so great and almighty, you can take the flames off that album cover’.“Nothing happened. But three months later — and I’d come to faith at this stage — I was in a record shop in Canada looking through albums and I found the Lynyrd Skynyrd one — this time with a cover minus the flames.“That was the only album in my -strong collection where the cover was dferent in Canada than it was here... things like that were adding up at the time.”Steve, who was chaplain at Queen’s University, Belfast for  years, doesn’t believe happiness is “a deal that God gives us”.“Happiness is a kind of Hollywood th century idea that I’m not sure many people who follow Jesus down through centuries experienced in the way we describe it,” he said.“The happiness we seek is almost an entitlement of having things — the right address, the right car etc.“I don’t think that’s what God was about. The God of the manger, the donkey and the cross is a humble God, out to make other people’s lives not necessarily happy but better.”Steve is probably best known for the  Corners Festival and for his peace process collaboration with Clonard Monastery.There’s also his friendship with Falls Road priest Fr Magill, who made global headlines two years ago for his angry homily towards Northern Ireland’s politicians at the funeral of murdered journalist Lyra McKee.Both men turn  this year — and both asked for charitable donations in lieu of presents. Their modest target — £, — for Embrace NI, an interdenominational organisation that helps refugees, was reached within a couple of days and quickly readjusted.Although Steve lives in Belfast, it’s a house he has owned in Ballycastle for  years that he calls “home”.Despite growing up in a deeply ided Ballymena, the Gracehill Primary School past pupil wasn’t affected by sectarianism.“I was aware of its existence but never involved in it nor did it touch me in my own psyche,” he said.“I became what I would call a member of the Venn diagram where I think there’s a part of me that’s British and a part that’s Irish. I’m still very comfortable being both.”Although famed for peace process collaboration, he admits that “growing up in Presbyterianism, ecumenism was almost a bad word”.“You might have talked to Catholics but you certainly didn’t worship with them or think about doing things with the Catholic Church,” he said.“My drive, which includes a bit of ecumenism, is peace making... Fr Martin and I can be who we are in our own identities but we can come together for the common good. We can be good friends without agreeing on every theological issue.”He added: “I came to faith because I thought Jesus was really cool and wise and sensible and you should love your enemies.”So, were Catholics the enemy “I wouldn’t call it ‘enemy’, I would call it the other... where they’re dferent, you have to reach beyond, you have to cross the boundary to be friends. I think that’s what Jesus was about.”But Steve, who will be  on October , then added that he “stayed away from it on a practical level for  years until I met Martin. Prior to that, I was still talking about it but not really doing it.”That defining friendship came about in  — a year before they founded the festival.“Martin wanted to do Irish lessons and had a zany idea of doing it with Catholics and Protestants,” he said.“He knew that Protestants weren’t likely to go to Lenadoon, where he was at the time, but Fitzroy had an Irish service once a month. He rang me and askedhe could borrow Fitzroy.“I told him he could — and offered to lend him my we’s cousin, an Irish teacher.“We met for a coffee and I went away thinking that it wasn’t the end of the friendship, just the beginning.”The  Corners Festival has hit the headlines more than once.There was Steve’s interview with Snow Patrol’s Gary Lightbody before that, an event featuring Brighton bomber Patrick Magee and Jo Berrycaused a riot outside the Skainos Centre in east Belfast in .“Some people didn’t like a Brighton bomber on the Newtownards Road... that got us front page news... so that was bigger than Gary Lightbody,” he said.“We’d already done Ricky Ross from Deacon Blue, Ian Archerbut Gary was the best known.“He was amazing. He had my back. He’s a wonderful human being. That was great fun.”So where did the idea for his blog Soul Surmisecome from “Radiohead played a gig in the Mandela Hall at Queen’s in  it was low key at the time,” he said.“When the BBC did a th anniversary special on that gig, the only review they could find in the world was on my website.“I was one of the first to have a web page because a friend had shown me how to do it. When we got  hits after three months we thought we were the biggest thing in the world!“He advised me to change that to a blog in , which is what we have now.”Steve has written two books — including “one on U which got to number  on the Amazon chart” — and helped a charity founder write his memoir.He’s also written poetry compilations for dferent charities, as well as songs.But since he moved from QUB to Fitzroy, he doesn’t have as much time as he used to.He cites his we Janiceas the biggest influence on his le.The pair have been married for  years and have two daughters — Caitlin , a recent graduate from Stranmillis, and Jasmine , a student at the University of Reading.“We met in her church when I was doing a mission in  but we didn’t start going out until  and then we were married in ,” he said.“Janice has been there in every turn, she encouraged me to be me and that’s all I ever wanted.“She allowed me to be myself and even likes my long hair...”That may have something to do with the outer-worldly nature of their first encounter.“We’re convinced that the first time we spoke, she was standing on the spot where her father asked her mother to marry him — a kitchen in a church hall at Old Park Presbyterian.”Given the importance of his relationship with Janice, I asked him how he feels about clerics from the Catholic faith not being able to marry.“Janice is trying to get that sorted — she’s going to write to the Pope,” he replied..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadNI voucher scheme: Patience urged as applications open – how to get yoursBangor gran loses £, after getting knocked out by rack of floor mats in Poundstretcher shop‘Beast of Bangor’ paedophile Gary McNeill dies suddenly after jail releaseMajor drug dealer flees Lisburn home to avoid armed criminals from Dublin collecting £k Kinahan debtFamily demand inquest into mum’s death after Belfast care home probe uncovers mistakes and raises questions over Covid diagnosisTop VideosPlayReaction: Barry#s in Portrush closes for goodPlayVideo: Will Belfast spend the high street voucher wisely PlayWoman narrowly avoids oncoming train after ignoring closed barriersLatest Northern IrelandEx-MP who bullied Northern Ireland victim not expected to speak at Labour conferenceConor Murphy repeats warning that peace funding could be lostO’Neill calls on DUP to end ‘unacceptable block’ on welfare legislationDUP MLA brands Executive Covid- decisions ‘draconian and undemocratic’Amy CochraneOpinionMonday mornings never saw such excitement, but trust Stormont to serve up ‘bad gateway’ with high street voucherLatestUlster assistant coach Dan Soper hopeful that John Cooney won#t require long lay-offQatar Airways announce £ billion losses amid pandemicLoose Women’s Denise Welch ‘relieved’ after man admits stalking herEx-MP who bullied Northern Ireland victim not expected to speak at Labour conferenceMP Claudia Webbe made naked pictures threat over jealousy, court told,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Enter email address   This field is required  Sign Up      Earlier on Monday, Economy Minister Gordon Lyons expressed doubt about the use of mandatory vaccine passports in Northern Ireland.His comments suggest the issue may become a point of friction for parties within the Executive, given Sinn Fein has made clear it would be open to vaccine certicationthe move was recommended by health chiefs.The SDLP last week called for the introduction of a scheme as a way to boost vaccination rates.While authorities in England have shelved plans for vaccine passports, the administrations in Scotland and Wales are introducing schemes next month.A scheme to gain entry to pubs and restaurants in the Irish Republic, which has been credited with driving up vaccination rates among young people, is set to end on October .Mr Lyons said he wanted to see social distancing measures removed as soon as possible, because of decreasing Covid transmission and hospital admission rates in Northern Ireland.But he said did not believe vaccine certication was an appropriate way to mitigate the removal of the restriction.“I don’t think that we are in that space anymore,” he told BBC Radio Ulster.“We’ve almost got % of our adult population vaccinated and you are now seeing the impact that that is having on the rate of transmission and hospitalisations as well.”Mr Lyons said the scheme would present “legal and human rights issues”.Sinn Fein deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill has also raised human rights concerns about such an initiative.However, last week she suggested she would still be “very open” to a passport schemeit could be demonstrated it could contribute to the “greater good” of tackling the spread of Covid-.Four further deaths of patients who had tested positive for Covid- were reported in Northern Ireland on Monday, along with  new confirmed cases of the virus.On Monday morning, there were  Covid- patients in hospital, with  in intensive care..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadNI voucher scheme: Patience urged as applications open – how to get yoursBangor gran loses £, after getting knocked out by rack of floor mats in Poundstretcher shop‘Beast of Bangor’ paedophile Gary McNeill dies suddenly after jail releaseSecurity concerns raised over Easyjet flight to Belfast with passengers kept on plane for two hoursFamily demand inquest into mum’s death after Belfast care home probe uncovers mistakes and raises questions over Covid diagnosisTop VideosPlayReaction: Barry#s in Portrush closes for goodPlayVideo: Will Belfast spend the high street voucher wisely PlayWoman narrowly avoids oncoming train after ignoring closed barriersLatest Northern IrelandExecutive considers ending social distancing at outdoor venues with mitigations in placeNegative portrayal of NI Protocol is ‘fake news’, Assembly toldEx-MP who bullied Northern Ireland victim not expected to speak at Labour conferenceConor Murphy repeats warning that peace funding could be lostO’Neill calls on DUP to end ‘unacceptable block’ on welfare legislationLatestExecutive considers ending social distancing at outdoor venues with mitigations in placeMore than , requests on first day of high street voucher schemeJohnny Ramone’s guitar sells for more than £, at auctionMother pleaded with police to save daughter, Arena inquiry toldFTSE finishes higher as rising crude prices lt oil majors,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

With the furlough scheme set to end this week and a number of Covid- restrictions remaining in place, he argues until businesses can operate without restrictions the scheme should be retained. At the beginning of the pandemic in March , immediate thoughts turned to how businesses could stay afloat and how jobs and incomes could be protected. googletag.cmd.push The UK Government, to its credit, moved rapidly and put in place the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, better since known as the furlough scheme. As of this month, over . million workers across the UK have been furloughed at one time or the other, with the government supporting up to % of their wages in order to protect jobs and avoid widespread destitution. Sixty-six billion pounds has been spent by the Exchequer on the furlough scheme, a testament to the government’s commitment to protecting livelihoods and protecting businesses. However, the decision to wind down the scheme this month and remove the furlough safety net appears premature and may leave businesses and employees in the lurch. With coronavirus restrictions still in place in Northern Ireland, and no date set in stone yet for the removal of all remaining restrictions, businesses here are not operating with full freedom and full flexibility. If pandemic restrictions persist, then pandemic protections should also. Executive Ministers, including the First and Deputy First Ministers, have recently made confusing and contradictory comments about the future of the pandemic and restrictions in Northern Ireland. While the Economy Minister has shown an urgency and willingness to set a date for the lting of all remaining restrictions, the First Minister recently dampened these expectations while the Deputy First Minister refused to rule out future lockdowns or so-called ‘circuit breakers.’     The continued confusion and uncertainty over restrictions is bad for business, bad for employers, bad for workers, and bad for the wider economy. The last thing the business community needs after  long months is the threat and anxiety of another deeply damaging lockdown. Until we get to a stage where we can fully operate and live without restrictions, however, pandemic protections like the furlough scheme must remain in place.

With the furlough scheme set to end this week and a number of Covid- restrictions remaining in place, he argues until businesses can operate without restrictions the scheme should be retained. At the beginning of the pandemic in March , immediate thoughts turned to how businesses could stay afloat and how jobs and incomes could be protected. googletag.cmd.push The UK Government, to its credit, moved rapidly and put in place the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, better since known as the furlough scheme. As of this month, over . million workers across the UK have been furloughed at one time or the other, with the government supporting up to % of their wages in order to protect jobs and avoid widespread destitution. Sixty-six billion pounds has been spent by the Exchequer on the furlough scheme, a testament to the government’s commitment to protecting livelihoods and protecting businesses. However, the decision to wind down the scheme this month and remove the furlough safety net appears premature and may leave businesses and employees in the lurch. With coronavirus restrictions still in place in Northern Ireland, and no date set in stone yet for the removal of all remaining restrictions, businesses here are not operating with full freedom and full flexibility. If pandemic restrictions persist, then pandemic protections should also. Executive Ministers, including the First and Deputy First Ministers, have recently made confusing and contradictory comments about the future of the pandemic and restrictions in Northern Ireland. While the Economy Minister has shown an urgency and willingness to set a date for the lting of all remaining restrictions, the First Minister recently dampened these expectations while the Deputy First Minister refused to rule out future lockdowns or so-called ‘circuit breakers.’     The continued confusion and uncertainty over restrictions is bad for business, bad for employers, bad for workers, and bad for the wider economy. The last thing the business community needs after  long months is the threat and anxiety of another deeply damaging lockdown. Until we get to a stage where we can fully operate and live without restrictions, however, pandemic protections like the furlough scheme must remain in place. Other countries like Germany and the Republic of Ireland are extending their wage subsidy schemes well into . At a time when global finance and borrowing rates are extremely cheap for national governments, this is not the right point to be unwinding supports for businesses or workers.

And successful apprentices walked straight into full-time jobs. “As well as being responsible for a pound, truck and high value cargo, a driver needs to know the traffic laws of the country theyre driving in, EU driver hour regulations, road transport regulations, hazardous goods legislation and licences, working time directive health and safety regulations and the driver Certicate of Professional Competence.” Cllr McKinney said wages were obviously important. He added: “The average is around pound per hour, unless you have specialist freight.     The hauliers arent totally to blame for this because in the past the client dictated the haulage rate and to a small haulier every penny counted. It was sink or swim. If we want to keep goods moving, haulage and drivers rates are going to rise  - unfortunately for the consumer.” Describing infrastructure in this part of the world as abysmal, Councillor McKinney added: “Its an embarrassment that we still dont have a motorway dual carriageway between Belfast and the North West. “For example,  I have to take a load from Birmingham to Gweedore Industrial Estate in Donegal, I join the M motorway to Scotland. I take my breaks in motorway services with proper facilities. I get the ferry from Cairnryan to Belfast and continue to Gweedore. “I have to have a full daily rest of minimum nine hours. So, where are the facilities between Belfast and Gweedore   It’s scandalous that drivers must put up with the lack of facilities in Northern Ireland.  “Where are the proper facilities where a driver can sit down, eat a meal in comfort, with proper shower and toilets, and park my truck in a secure area.” “And facilities are even worse for female drivers.” Concluding, Counillor McKinney said: “Actions, please - not just words.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derrys Millennium Forum - ‘A place of hope’  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Coastguard helicopter arriving at Altnagelvin Hospital following this evenings incident.Local NewsCasualty airlted to Altnagelvin Hospital following jet ski incident on River Foyle overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsPolice deploy stinger during County Derry car chase overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Emmett McConomy speaking to the crowd at Derrys GuildhallDerry NewsYou do not speak for the people of Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A lack of lorry drivers the main cause for empty shop shelves, Alliance Councillor Philip McKinney has said.Derry NewsLack of drivers the cause for empty shelves, says Derry truck driver overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsPortal opens for High Street Voucher Scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The families have rallied together in a stand against the UK Government’s intended amnesty for all those who committed conflict-related offences. googletag.cmd.push Emmett McConomy, brother of ten-year-old Stephen, killed by a plastic bullet fired by a British soldier, spoke to the crowd: “Nearly  years later, we have the British Government, namely Boris Johnson and Brandon Lewis, telling us and all the other victims of this conflict that he’s doing us a favour. “He’s drawn a line under the past for us. This he says will help the healing process and move us further along the road to reconciliation. “Well, I have a clear message for you, Mr Lewis and Mr Johnson, how dare you try and speak for me and try and tell me what is best for our family. Do not speak for me and my brother. Do not speak for Stephen and you surely do not speak for the people of Derry.” The proposed government amnesty would prevent prosecutions for conflict-related offences and close down present and future police and Police Ombudsman investigations, civil actions and legacy inquests. Other rallies were organised in protest of the amnesty today both North and South of the border. See Mondays paper for full coverage.

Rosemount Resource Centre hosting a range of events in support ofInternational Older Peoplersquos Day on  October.Reporter: Nicole Lang Sept   addthis, In May this year, The Rosemont Resource Centre opened the doors of its brand-new building, funded by the Department for Communities. Since then, they have hosted a range of activities and events and provided supportive services to those who need it within the community, particularly the elderly. Jean Martin, Project Manager at the centre says the services are vital to the community, especially the elderly community, “Covid has caused a lot of social isolation within the elderly community. A lot of older people feel left behind. googletag.cmd.push “The world is changing and so much is online. We are hoping to support as many older people as we can, eventhey just need a pint of milk or a friendly face to talk to.” The centre is currently carrying out a pilot scheme called ‘Good Morning Rosemount,’ in conjunction with St Joseph’s Secondary School. The pilot scheme has ious programmes which include a Walking Group every Monday night at pm, Chair Aerobics which starts  October at am and ArtTherapy whichwill begin Thursday  October at am. The centre is also hoping to support those applying for the pound High Street Voucher Scheme who do not have the means to apply online. Jean continued: “We are in the process of establishing a Men’s Group, a Ladies Group, Mediation Sessions, Reflexology and restorative yoga. “We have our community gym, gardening project, Mental Health and Well-being support, and Slimming World on Saturdays with Shelly McLaughlin. “Everything we do is subject to funding but there is so much potential here.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derrys Millennium Forum - ‘A place of hope’  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Coastguard helicopter arriving at Altnagelvin Hospital following this evenings incident.Local NewsCasualty airlted to Altnagelvin Hospital following jet ski incident on River Foyle overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsPolice deploy stinger during County Derry car chase overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Emmett McConomy speaking to the crowd at Derrys GuildhallDerry NewsYou do not speak for the people of Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A lack of lorry drivers the main cause for empty shop shelves, Alliance Councillor Philip McKinney has said.Derry NewsLack of drivers the cause for empty shelves, says Derry truck driver overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsPortal opens for High Street Voucher Scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Counties are currently instructed to provide team sheets to the relevant organising body for match programme purposes no later than am on the Thursday before a weekend fixture. However, several counties communicate their line-ups with the proviso that they are not to be issued to the public until they themselves publish them. When they do, a number don’t include their  substitutes. googletag.cmd.push The GAA are to release the team and substitute lists more than  hours before the first matches as a means of promoting the games as well as cutting out the possibility of leaks. It is envisaged the move might prompt counties to announce their line-ups before Friday. The Thursday morning registration, which prevents counties from making th-hour changes to their squad unless in an emergency, was voted in at Congress in Paacuteraic Duffy’s time as director-general as a way of combatting dummy teams. Penalties for not providing the -man list included the withdrawal of sideline privileges for the manager for one match and a fine of up to €, for the county board. Forfeiture is the punishment for fielding a player who has not been registered on the list provided to the referee. The lack of consideration in the rules for late injuries and sickness has been regularly condemned by managers and there have been some instances where less than  players have been available as the deadline for personnel changes had passed and injured men have togged out with no intention of being used.     Match regulations state for non senior inter-county championship games the teams are to be issued to the committee in charge for the official programme and media four days before the game although it is rarely respected, while for league games, the home county must receive team selection from the visitors no later than Wednesday prior to the fixture. For Saturday games, several of the leading counties in both codes make their team disclosures the night previous.

The financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here are two examples of how companies have been helped, and what support is available. googletag.cmd.push NORTHERN IRELAND IN NUMBERS , jobs furloughed through the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme up to May  , claims amounting to pound million through the Self- Employment Income Support Scheme up to May  Across the whole UK  per cent of those eligible for SEISS made a claim. The average value of a claim is pound, Source: Her Majesty’s Treasury CASE STUDY  SHNUGGLE  Planning, forward-thinking and invaluable help from the UK Government has enabled a Northern Ireland firm to ersy and remain solvent. When Covid- struck, Newtownards baby product manufacturer Shnuggle’s owners Sinead and Adam Murphy were prepared thanks to advice from their export colleagues in China. Sinead said: “We reduced our out-goings, put on pause our marketing spend in the business. We just tried to protect the cash that we had. “The first impact was our customers that we sell to in Asia. They all went into lockdown so our orders and sales to them stopped. But also a lot of our production happens out in Asia so our factories went into lockdown. “Luckily we had bought a lot of stock beforehand. We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base. Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online. All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon. But our online sales actually grew because everyone was at home and maybe an element of panic buying.”      CASH HELP: The Shnuggle team Shnuggle took advantage of the furlough and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemeschemes. Sinead said: “We furloughed five out of our  team, and were able to access the Business Interruption loan through Ulster Bank. “We were relieved to get the money in quickly, so we weren’t worrying about paying wages or our biggest overhead was our suppliers in China who were calling in all of their debts. “That was our biggest headache and stress, we owed signicant amounts of money to them and we didn’t have the cash as we needed time to sell our products.” Shnuggle also received a pound, Small Business Grant. Adam said: “Furloughing was brilliant, and the CBILS was the one that was the best for us because it meant that we could keep all our suppliers happy. “So even though we had a temporary dip in our sales, and obviously the inventory was sitting there ready to sell, it just kept us solvent and the cash flow moving. It’s really going to help us trade out of it, andall goes well, we should be able to get back into a reasonably strong cash position within the next six to  months. The loans coming in helped us to sleep at night.” The Government schemes also gave Sinead and Adam the freedom to ersy into the PPE market and the development of HeroShield Ltd, enabling local firms to unite to develop a protective face covering for key workers. This non-profit company designs, produces and distributes reusable visors.   ‘It’s surprisingly easy and money arrives quickly’ CASE STUDY  Q-MASS An unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff. Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced. It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to pound, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October. Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.” He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.” Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.  ‘SURPRISINGLY EASY’: Q-Mass director Ronnie Robertson praises the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme “We’re just ticking over. We’re trying to cover our costs every month, trying to break even, to stay still. We’re looking at it thatwe can stay still we’re doing very well.” And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff. Ronnie said: “It’s been really easy. We’ve got a big workshop with wide corridors and we’ve got a lot of the doors propped open internally so no-one has to touch doors or handles. We’ve got a few toilet areas with restrictions on them and a couple of one-way corridors, but the offices are open plan, so there’s no real need for people to be near each other. The workshop’s a big, wide-open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.” Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future.

ONEILLS DERRY SFC ROUND  Slaughtneil -Swatragh - The -point winning margin saw Paul Bradleys side finish in second spot behind Lavey, with the Davitts dropping to third on score dference.With ongoing maintenance on their main pitch at Davitt Park, Swatragh have been playing on their training pitch and while it was in pristine condition, its tight confines made it dficult to find space.Swatragh were more aggressive on their press and limited Antoacutein McMullan to just one short kick-out and a  percent first-half retention rate. A possession won by Fionnbharr McGuigan was the only break won with the rest coming from frees awarded for pushes in a congested middle third.At the other end, Sean McNicholl had marginally more freedom and kicked excellently throughout, losing just two kick-outs over the hour.Kevin Madden handed Michael Friel a first start of the championship and stationed him at corner forward, where he was picked up by Brendan Rogers. Karl McKaigue went across to Francis Kearney, with Peadar Kearney on Fintan McGurk.Oisin McWilliams wore number , but started at midfield where Chrissy McKaigue lined up against him. In the reshuffle, Cahal Murray started at centre forward where he pulled to the wings and the centre of Slaughtneils defence was manned by the rotation of Patsy Bradley and Padraig Cassidy.It left Slaughtneil needing a high concentration level to balance a compact centre with Cassidy getting forward to punch holes in Swatraghs defence. Brendan Rogers also had a major impact on the game and got forward at every opportunity.At the other end, Sean Francis Quinn picked up Christopher Bradley, who played slightly ahead of Shane McGuigan and Brian Cassidy. Sean Tad Cassidy and Seaacuten Oacute Caiside were alternating on Slaughtneils right wing against James Kearney and Niall Coyle. Oacute Caiside was later forced off with a suspected torn cruciate ligament injury.On the other wing, Keelan Feeney got on enough ball to keep Sean Martin Quinn out of the game. His case wasnt helped by not having a gumshield and Barry Cassidy let him re-enter the fray with one in situ.Feeney and McGrath combined on the left wing for Shane McGuigan to get a run on Diarmuid Dillon and fist over the first score of the game and the Emmets doubled their lead with a confident Sammy Bradley point at the end of a Rogers foray upfield.Midway through the first-half, a McMullan kick-out was punched back into the Slaughtneil defence where Chrissy McKaigue saw black for taking down the galloping Oisin McWilliams.Three minutes later a Diarmuid Dillon body check on Brian Cassidy also saw him in the sin-bin and it opened the game up.A close-range Meehaul McGrath goal after the water break put Slaughtneil - to - ahead. After Rogers and Padraig Cassidy ran at the Swatragh defence, McGrath was calm enough to sidestep in a crowded penalty area before slotting to the net.Slaughtneils game of closing down the midfield involved players dropping off to the closest man, but when Sean Cassidy lost his footing Sean Francis Quinn came forward to kick a point with the outside of his right boot.Peadar Kearney, who escaped an earlier yellow card, was walking a fine line after another foul on Fintan McGurk who was Swatraghs most potent forward. James Kearney missed the free, but when Conor McAtamney won the next kick-out, McGurk went through to make it a three-point game, - to -.The Swa then had a goal chance, started by Francis Kearney and involving McGurk, that saw Kearneys low shot blocked by the feet of Rogers. Oisin McWilliams and Francis Kearneyalso missed chances to eat into the lead before half-time.Friel started the second-half at centre-forward and after an early Christopher Bradley wide, Francis Kearney hit Swatraghs only point of the second-half from a free.Seven minutes into the half, a well-worked move involving Rogers, McGrath and Sammy Bradley saw Shane McGuigan in on goal, where he was fouled and referee Cassidy awarded a penalty. Sean McNicholl saved McGuigans first attempt, but only into the Slaughtneil man path and he finished the rebound to the net.McNicholl worked the kick-out short and an Oisin McWilliams run up the right flank pulled Slaughtneil out of position and when the ball was squared, Cahal Murray palmed to the net at the far post, making the score - to - in the visitors favour after  minutes.Swatragh had a spell with the McWilliams twins inside, but Murrays goal was their last score of the game. With limited space, the diagonal ball wasnt an option and anytime it was played in straight, Rogers was able to come from behind to turnover the ball.McMullan was able to poke some of his kick-outs to Feeney and slowly but surely Slaughtneil got a firm grip on the game. Rogers got forward to kick a point, followed by a Christopher Bradley point after Seacute and Shane McGuigan linked up on the left wing.When Francis Kearney kicked the ball over the sideline, and with Swatraghs defence open, Cormac ODohertys cross field ball found the run of Shane McGuigan who thumped the ball high, confidently and straight between the posts for a - to - lead to rubber-stamp Slaughtneils rampant third quarter.With the eight point winning margin in sight and with the game firmly in their clutches, Slaughtneil hit five unanswered points in the final  minutes on their way to a commanding win. googletag.cmd.push SLAUGHTNEIL: Antoacutein McMullan Peadar Kearney, Karl McKaigue, Brendan RogersSeaacuten Oacute Caiside, Padraig Cassidy, Keelan Feeney Patsy Bradley, Chrissy McKaigue Sean Cassidy, Cormac ODoherty, Meehaul McGrathChristopher BradleyShane McGuigan , Brian CassidySUBS: Fionnbharr McGuigan for S Oacute Caiside , Seacute McGuiganfor B Cassidy , Francis McEldowney for P Kearney , Ronan Bradley for M McGrath BLACK CARD: C McKaigue YELLOW CARD: P Bradley  SWATRAGH: Sean McNicholl Aaron McGuckin, Diarmuid Dillon Sean Francis QuinnBrian Diamond, Tiarnaacuten Walsh, Niall Coyle Conor McAtamney, Oisin McWilliams Sean Martin Quinn, Cahal Murray , James KearneyMichael Friel, Francis Kearney , Fintan McGurk SUBS: Lorcan McWilliams for J Kearney , Patrick Turner for B Diamond , Liam Kearney for N Coyle , Niall McAtamney for C Murray BLACK CARD: D Dillon YELLOW CARDS: M Friel , O McWilliams  REF: Barry Cassidy     ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derrys Millennium Forum - ‘A place of hope’  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Coastguard helicopter arriving at Altnagelvin Hospital following this evenings incident.Local NewsCasualty airlted to Altnagelvin Hospital following jet ski incident on River Foyle overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsPolice deploy stinger during County Derry car chase overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Emmett McConomy speaking to the crowd at Derrys GuildhallDerry NewsYou do not speak for the people of Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A lack of lorry drivers the main cause for empty shop shelves, Alliance Councillor Philip McKinney has said.Derry NewsLack of drivers the cause for empty shelves, says Derry truck driver overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsPortal opens for High Street Voucher Scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Cllr Heaney, who represents the Foyleside ward, hailed the decision as “an important move” in helping motorists to transition from traditional fossil fuels – such as petrol and diesel – towards electric power. googletag.cmd.push The Parking Strategy for Derry City and Strabane District identied the need to review the current electric charging infrastructure and quanty the council’s future needs as one of its proposed strategic options. It is hoped that by changing the electric vehicle charging infrastructure in its off-street car-parks, the council is removing any potential barrier to visit and stay in the city Cllr Heaney said: “At the council meeting, we agreed to explore further the possibility of getting new and improved electric charging points for electric motor vehicles into all council car-parks throughout our city and district. “It is an important move as the council plays its part in tackling the climate crisis as we encourage and incentivise as many motorists as possible to move away from fossil-fuelled cars and into electric cars. We want to see this progressing soon. “I was delighted to support this proposal at the council’s Business and Culture committee. Recent figures have revealed that only . per cent of electric vehicles in the north are owned by residents of our council area. “The lack of modern and efficient electric vehicle charging points within our council boundaries is clearly a factor influencing this low figure.     “Council officers have now been tasked with scoping out how charging points can be installed in all council car parks which will massively increase the charging infrastructure, encourage the purchase of more electric vehicles and further decrease the carbon footprint within our city and district.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derrys Millennium Forum - ‘A place of hope’  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Coastguard helicopter arriving at Altnagelvin Hospital following this evenings incident.Local NewsCasualty airlted to Altnagelvin Hospital following jet ski incident on River Foyle overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsPolice deploy stinger during County Derry car chase overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Emmett McConomy speaking to the crowd at Derrys GuildhallDerry NewsYou do not speak for the people of Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A lack of lorry drivers the main cause for empty shop shelves, Alliance Councillor Philip McKinney has said.Derry NewsLack of drivers the cause for empty shelves, says Derry truck driver overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsPortal opens for High Street Voucher Scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Reporter: Staff Reporter Sept   addthis, The Churches Trust celebrated four years of their flagship youth project ‘Community of Homes’ this week with the launch of a very colourful ‘Creativity and Wellbeing’ book. The book depics the wonderful work of the young people involved and showing how creative pathways contributed to personal development in what has been trying times over the past  months. googletag.cmd.push Held at St. Columb’s Park House, the Mayor, Graham Warke, representatives from Department for Communities, Derry and Strabane District Council, local community groups and schools who took part, all listened intently as Churches Trust CEO, Fiona Fagan praised the young people who took part in the project and described the four year journey as ‘one that has been enriching for all involved.’ ‘This successful programme of creativity and well-being is a celebration of four years hard work by these young people especially through the dficult Covid period. It is also testament to their resilience as we, hopefully, come out of the pandemic and see brighter days ahead,’ commented Ms. Fagan. The project was funded by Department for Communities within their ‘Uniting Communities’ programme which funds projects that promote good relations and reconciliation through sports and creativity by addressing barriers to community participation. Churches Trust worked in collaboration with The Art Smyth, Ardnashee School and College, St. Joseph’s Boys School, and Lisneal and St. Mary’s Colleges. The celebratory event was funded by the Northern Ireland Community Relations Council through the Community Relations and Cultural Diversity grants programme. Fiona also thanked core funders Community Relations Council, Derry City and Strabane District Council, and Inner City Trust. Speaking after last week’s event, Kathryn Hill, Director of Active Communities in the Department for Communities commented:     “I was delighted to have been invited along today to join in celebrating the launch of the Churches Trust’s Community of Homes, Creativity and Wellbeing book. “The Department has funded the Community of Homes project in recent years though our Together: Building a United Community Uniting Opportunities grant scheme, a good relations programme delivered through the medium of sport, physical and creative activity. “This project has engaged young people in a unique range of creative activities that brings communities together, addresses barriers to participation and increases social skills. “I want to thank Fiona and the Churches Trust for successfully delivering this project and most importantly the young people that have taken part.” Showcase Wednesday’s book launch also included the showcasing of seven youth projects involving over  young people each year from local schools, churches and communities. Many of the youth project are structured using the creative pathways: all projects are underpinned by good relations, personal development and skills development. Projects range from ongoing one-to-one mentoring programmes, to summer camps, to small groups working on themed ad hoc projects and to larger groups who engage in three-six month programmes. Speakers at the event included the Mayor, Graham Warke Kathryn Hill, Department for Communities, artist Sinead Smyth, Faustina Starrett, North West Regional College, and the Churches Trust’s own Catherine Coyle who delivered an address on the success of the four year programme.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derrys Millennium Forum - ‘A place of hope’  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Coastguard helicopter arriving at Altnagelvin Hospital following this evenings incident.Local NewsCasualty airlted to Altnagelvin Hospital following jet ski incident on River Foyle overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsPolice deploy stinger during County Derry car chase overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Emmett McConomy speaking to the crowd at Derrys GuildhallDerry NewsYou do not speak for the people of Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A lack of lorry drivers the main cause for empty shop shelves, Alliance Councillor Philip McKinney has said.Derry NewsLack of drivers the cause for empty shelves, says Derry truck driver overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsPortal opens for High Street Voucher Scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Reporter: Staff Reporter Sept   addthis, The Churches Trust celebrated four years of their flagship youth project ‘Community of Homes’ this week with the launch of a very colourful ‘Creativity and Wellbeing’ book. The book depics the wonderful work of the young people involved and showing how creative pathways contributed to personal development in what has been trying times over the past  months. googletag.cmd.push Held at St. Columb’s Park House, the Mayor, Graham Warke, representatives from Department for Communities, Derry and Strabane District Council, local community groups and schools who took part, all listened intently as Churches Trust CEO, Fiona Fagan praised the young people who took part in the project and described the four year journey as ‘one that has been enriching for all involved.’ ‘This successful programme of creativity and well-being is a celebration of four years hard work by these young people especially through the dficult Covid period. It is also testament to their resilience as we, hopefully, come out of the pandemic and see brighter days ahead,’ commented Ms. Fagan. The project was funded by Department for Communities within their ‘Uniting Communities’ programme which funds projects that promote good relations and reconciliation through sports and creativity by addressing barriers to community participation. Churches Trust worked in collaboration with The Art Smyth, Ardnashee School and College, St. Joseph’s Boys School, and Lisneal and St. Mary’s Colleges. The celebratory event was funded by the Northern Ireland Community Relations Council through the Community Relations and Cultural Diversity grants programme. Fiona also thanked core funders Community Relations Council, Derry City and Strabane District Council, and Inner City Trust. Speaking after last week’s event, Kathryn Hill, Director of Active Communities in the Department for Communities commented:     “I was delighted to have been invited along today to join in celebrating the launch of the Churches Trust’s Community of Homes, Creativity and Wellbeing book. “The Department has funded the Community of Homes project in recent years though our Together: Building a United Community Uniting Opportunities grant scheme, a good relations programme delivered through the medium of sport, physical and creative activity. “This project has engaged young people in a unique range of creative activities that brings communities together, addresses barriers to participation and increases social skills. “I want to thank Fiona and the Churches Trust for successfully delivering this project and most importantly the young people that have taken part.” Showcase Wednesday’s book launch also included the showcasing of seven youth projects involving over  young people each year from local schools, churches and communities. Many of the youth project are structured using the creative pathways: all projects are underpinned by good relations, personal development and skills development. Projects range from ongoing one-to-one mentoring programmes, to summer camps, to small groups working on themed ad hoc projects and to larger groups who engage in three-six month programmes. Speakers at the event included the Mayor, Graham Warke Kathryn Hill, Department for Communities, artist Sinead Smyth, Faustina Starrett, North West Regional College, and the Churches Trust’s own Catherine Coyle who delivered an address on the success of the four year programme.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derrys Millennium Forum - ‘A place of hope’  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Coastguard helicopter arriving at Altnagelvin Hospital following this evenings incident.Local NewsCasualty airlted to Altnagelvin Hospital following jet ski incident on River Foyle overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsPolice deploy stinger during County Derry car chase overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Emmett McConomy speaking to the crowd at Derrys GuildhallDerry NewsYou do not speak for the people of Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A lack of lorry drivers the main cause for empty shop shelves, Alliance Councillor Philip McKinney has said.Derry NewsLack of drivers the cause for empty shelves, says Derry truck driver overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsPortal opens for High Street Voucher Scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council were last night meeting to discuss the future of Portstewart Town Hall after an audit earlier this year raised questions over its ownership. googletag.cmd.push In April, the Council reported that the NI Audit Office was unable to raty its   accounts, citing ownership issues over three buildings in the Borough. “In recent days, we have been made aware that Councils financial statements include signicant buildings that the Council has no proof and title to,” said an Audit Office statement read at a meeting. Council agreed at a Land and Property Services Committee meeting in February to hand the building back to its historic landowners the Montagu Estate, and had taken legal advice on the issue. A special meeting due to take place tonight will see the public excluded from viewing proceedings, with a decision taken to hold the meeting privately in committee. The decision has disappointed local residents group Portstewart Community Association, who have launched an online petition to persuade the Council to pause all legal action. “We have been challenging the decision taken by councillors to hand Portstewart Town Hall back to the Montague Estate, who have claimed historical ownership of the building,” they said. “We are disappointed that the council do not appear to have challenged this claim, despite the council being in possession of Portstewart Town Hall since .     “Following a request from Portstewart Community Association, the Council is meeting on Monday  September to discuss the matter of Portstewart Town Hall. “Unfortunately, this meeting is being held in committee, meaning that we, the public, will be unable to listen to or participate in this meeting. “We are again asking councillors to vote to pause all legal proceedings in relation to Portstewart Town Hall. “Without this vote, the legal proceedings will continue as per the previous Council decision, and the Town Hall will be lost to the people of Portstewart.” The petition has been signed by  people to date, with the Council due to meet this evening at .pm.  Council accounts ratication delayed by ownership issues  Cllr Aaron Callan has said work is underway to address the issues.    Sinn Feacutein councillor denied permission to speak after fool comment  A point of order was called by DUP councillors Adrian McQuillan and William Duddy.

However, Mr Durkan noted his disappointment that the Bill as it currently stands fails to protect people vulnerable to gambling related harm. He has demanded regulation both North and South to protect , problem gamblers. googletag.cmd.push Speaking ahead of the Second Stage of the Betting, Gaming, Lotteries and AmusementsBill, the Foyle MLA said: “Gambling addiction has been a scourge within our communities. “It has destroyed iniduals and their families with its far-reaching implications – not just the financial impact but the toll this addiction has on people’s mental health, wellbeing and the hold it can take over lives. “While I welcome steps taken to address gambling related harm within the gambling legislation, it’s clear that it falls short of what is needed and does little to protect vulnerable people here. “The North has the highest rates of problem gamblers across the islands – it is critical that gambling laws now are as robust as they need to be.” Mr Durkan also hit out at Sinn Feacutein for not pushing the same line in the North as they have done in the Republic. He added: “This issue is not isolated to the North but rather is a problem for the whole of this island. “I note with interest that Communities Minister Deirdre Hargeys own party has contributed to a similar debate in the Daacuteil calling for all the bells and whistles we would like to have seen within this legislation in a  counties ‘Gambling Strategy’: a gambling regulator, online regulation and self-exclusion regulation.     “My question is, why has Minister Hargey opted to deviate from Sinn Feacutein policy here in the North  Surely, we should be pushing for an all-island strategy.

We desperately need regulation both North and South. “The Minister and by extension the Executive cannot run the risk of missing the opportunity now to implement a fit for purpose gambling strategy when given the chance.”  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derrys Millennium Forum - ‘A place of hope’  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Coastguard helicopter arriving at Altnagelvin Hospital following this evenings incident.Local NewsCasualty airlted to Altnagelvin Hospital following jet ski incident on River Foyle overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsPolice deploy stinger during County Derry car chase overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Emmett McConomy speaking to the crowd at Derrys GuildhallDerry NewsYou do not speak for the people of Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A lack of lorry drivers the main cause for empty shop shelves, Alliance Councillor Philip McKinney has said.Derry NewsLack of drivers the cause for empty shelves, says Derry truck driver overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsPortal opens for High Street Voucher Scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Mid Ulster District Council have called on Minister for Infrastructure Nichola Mallon to withdraw a Planning Advice Noticeissued last month. Chair and Deputy Chair of the Councils Planning Committee, Cllrs Kyle Black and Sean McPeake, have written to DfI after aspecial meeting of the Planning Committee agreed that the new ‘Planning Advice Note for Development in the Countryside’ would have serious ramications for rural communities and the Council’s ability to make planning decisions which accommodate rural dwellings. googletag.cmd.push The issue centres on a new definition of buildings which can be taken into consideration when assessing a planning application for development on a farm and proposes that a group of buildings which include a house and domestic garage should not be included. The new policy advice would, according to the Chair of the Planning Committee, Councillor Kyle Black, be so restrictive as to prevent many people from getting a perfectly sustainable rural dwelling: “In Mid Ulster, the proportion of new dwellings allowed in the countryside is lower than the proportion of people living in the countryside, he said. “There is no need, therefore, to place any additional limitations on development in rural areas. “In fact, I would argue that there is a need to explore policy to provide additional sustainable opportunities for Mid Ulster’s existing rural dwellers. “This policy would effectively tie our hands when it comes to making decisions tailored to, and based on, the needs of local people, which is what the transfer of planning powers to local council was all about”.     Deputy Chair of the Planning Committee, Councillor Sean McPeake, said the area had the space required. “While other councils may face pressures in terms of accommodating rural development, we in Mid Ulster have the capacity to absorb new dwellings, he said. “To address the issue with a ‘one size fits all’ approach is not appropriate, reasonable or fair. “We are also concerned that the guidance could prejudice our ability to progress our Draft Local Development Plan which has been, rightly, developed to ensure that we take account of the very specic planning needs of our rural communities”. A letter has been issued to the Minister detailing the Committee’s objections and asking her to withdraw the planning advice guidance.

Opel’s ground-breaking powertrain technology and architecture means that the low, flat battery gives the Vio-e a stable centre of gravity and maximum cabin space. Designed from the ground up with both diesel and electric powertrains in mind, the Vio-e is based heavily on the Opel Corsa-e and its driveline fits comfortably between the chassis rails of the new Vio-e.     Power comes from a kW motor producing Nm of torque for smooth, swt and linear acceleration. The kWh battery is made up of  modules consisting of  inidual cells, while the larger kWh battery has  cells split over  modules.Cooling for the batteries comes from the van’s own in-cab cooling system, which Opel says helps to increase their range and letime. All Vio-e models come with three driving modes and switchable regenerative braking as standard.The standard on-board charger is a .kW single phase unit, while DC charging of up to kW is also supported.Trim and Body Options         Trim levels in the new Vio-e  van consist of Edition and Sportive models, both of which come with standard features such as driver and passenger airbags, electric parking brake, cruise control, full size spare wheel, .” colour dashboard display, remote central deadlocking, two side loading doors, electric front windows, electrically adjustable and heated door mirrors, -speaker audio with a USB inlet, Bluetooth, steering-column remote audio controls, and a DAB radio.Top-spec Sportive trim brings with it air-conditioning, ” colour touchscreen with smartphone projection, body coloured bumpers , LED daytime running lights, front fog lights, rear parking sensors, automatic lights and wipers, electrically folding door mirrors, acoustic windscreen and full-size wheel covers.Available with two body s and two roof heights, the Vio-e is just as flexible as a diesel van with a load volume of up to .m. Because the batteries are between the chassis rails, the total capacity of the load space is completely unchanged, allowing ,mm s in the L model and up to ,mm in the L when using the load-through bulkhead.Otherwise, the standard maximumcapacity of the van is ,mm for the L and ,mm for the L.Payloads are equally impressive, as replacing the engine and transmission with batteries and a motor doesn’t signicantly harm it’s capacities.All Vio-e vans have a gross vehicle weightof .-tonne, and depending on spec you can get a maximum ,kg payload out of a L standard roof height van with the kWh battery.Specying the larger kWh unit brings that figure down to ,kg.Those figures are just kg less than a diesel-engine Vio — a far cry from the disadvantage that battery electric vehicles used to have when compared to diesel-powered vans in the past.Test VanMy test van was a new Vio-e SportivekWh finished in stylish Moonstone Grey metallic paint. The three-seater Vio-e has storage under the passenger bench, while the driver’s seat comes with an adjustable armrest and -way seat adjustment. Being an electric van where the full amount of torque is available from just rpm all the way up to ,rpm, it is exceptionally quick off the mark.Unladen, the Vio-e accelerates with impressive urgency, and I have no doubt it would still prove fast even with a full payload on board.The top speed is limited to km h in order to preserve the battery range, but this is something that should not be of any concern to Vio-e drivers, as the van is more than capable of overtaking slower moving traffic with great ease.The regenerative braking system in the Vio-e is selected by pressing the ‘B mode’ button beside the gear selector, and this applies enough braking to activate the brake lights and slow the vehicle down before the driver presses the brake pedal.I loved the fact that the Vio-e is very car-like to drive, and the selectable Eco, Normal and Power driving modes ensure that there is a mode to suit every type of driver and every type of load. The Vio-e remains composed and comfortable when driven over rutted road surfaces, while body lean through bends is very well controlled.The Vio-e pulls away in silence, with just a hum from the on-board sound generator that is designed to warn others of your presence at low speeds, with just minimal levels of tyre and wind noise noticeable at higher speeds.Charging TimesCharging the Vio-efrom a domestic socket can take up to  hours, but this drops dramatically to . hours when charged from a .KW wall box charger .However, DC rapid charging from a kW sourcetakes just half an hour for the kWh battery and  minutes for the kWh version.Verdict  PricingOverall, the new Opel Vio-e is a genuinely impressive van to drive, easy to live with on a daily basis, offers fast-charging options and it is a good looking van too.In my opinion, this is the class-leading  van in the all-electric light commercial vehiclemarket right now, and deservedly so too.

The Formentor’s design inside and out is something quite dferent to what we have seen before, and brings with it a new dimension in style and sophistication. Being part of the Volkswagen Group means that Cupra has access to cutting-edge mechanicals and technology, and this has enabled the new Formentor compact SUV to hit the ground running, so to speak.  googletag.cmd.push   There is a lot of money and confidence behind the Cupra brand, and that is evident in the bold product plan promised by the company.Engine  Trim OptionsThe Formentor sits on the familiar MQB set of chassis components that also underpins other crossovers such as the Seat Ateca and VW Tiguan. Petrol engine options in the Formentor consist of a .-litre TSI with bhp and a .-litre TSI unit with a choice of ,  or bhp. The . TSI engine is available as a -speed manual or -speed DSG , while the . TSI comes with a DSG transmission as standard, with Cupra’s Drivesystem standard in bhp guise. A . TDIEVO engine is available with bhp and can be mated to a -speed manual or -speed DSG transmission, with the latter coming with Drive as standard.     Additionally, a .-litre e-Hybrid powertrain is available with a choice of bhp or bhp, both of which are mated to a -speed DSG transmission with promised fuel consumption as low as .l km on a combined WLTP driving cycle.There is a choice of two trim levels in CUPRA’s new compact SUV — Formentor and Formentor VZ — with the latter being the Cupra Formentor’s most powerful trim, named in reference to the Spanish word ‘Veloz’, meaning ‘fast’.The Formentor VZ trim offers high-performance powertrain options. Coming with ” alloy wheels, a ” Navigation system, autonomous assistance technology and performance bucket seats as standard.         Test CarMy test car was a Cupra Formentor . TSiDSGwhich was finished in stylish Graphene Grey Premium metallic paint with optional ” Exclusive Aero Black and Copper alloy wheels for an added dose of visual drama. Producing bhp and Nm of torque, the ,cc engine propels the Formentor from a standing start to km h in just .-seconds, on its way to a top speed of km h .Key standard features include full LED headlamps and Daytime Running Lights, rear ‘coast to coast’ light with welcome ceremony, front fog lamps with cornering , heat-insulated and tinted rear windows, leather-wrapped multi- heated sports steering wheel, dark aluminium glossy interior package, textile sport seats, keyless unlocking and ignition system, .” Digital Cockpit, ” Media System with DAB radio, Connect Online infotainment , rain and light sensor, heated front seats, adaptive cruise control, park assist, rear view camera, Drive Profile Selection, and auto high-beam assist, along with a suite of advanced safety systems.Optional extras fitted to my test car included premium metallic paint, black leather bucket seats, ” alloy wheels, hands-free electric tailgate, Dynamic Chassis Control, and Safe  Drive “L” . The sweet-revving petrol engine in my test car produces bhp and Nm of torque, enabling the car to sprint from -km h in .-seconds, with claimed fuel consumption as low as .-l km .As in other VW Group models, the .-litre engine is commendably quick to drop onto two cylinders to save fuel when cruising, and the process of cutting out and back in again is hard to detect. Composed and predictable handling is admirable, as is the Formentor’s ability to soak up road imperfections with ease.Impressive Sporty InteriorTake a seat behind the wheel of the CUPRA Formentor and you could be forgiven for thinking that you are in a hatchback rather than a compact SUV. The seating position is low, as is the base of the windscreen, so you feel like you sit much closer to the road — as you would in a performance-focused car.Selectable driving modes in the Formentor consist of Comfort, Sport, Cupra and Inidual, with each mode bringing a greater degree of aggression and engine noise that gets pumped through the cars speakers.Cabin space in the Formentor is excellent, with adults over six foot tall still able to sit comfortably in the rear seats. You could even sit three abreast thanks to the shallow transmission tunnel. The use of quality materials, with a grainy metal finish in the middle of the fascia, makes the cabin of the Formentor a pleasant and comfortable place to be, while bronze Cupra highlights on the air vents add a sense of occasion to every journey. The boot capacity of -litres in the Formentor . TSI can be expanded by dropping the rear seatbacks, allowing for even greater practicality when called upon.The Formentor scored a full five star rating in its Euro NCAP crash test, thanks in part to standard safety systems such as lane-keep assist, forward collision warning, predictive cruise control and driver alert warning.The new Cupra Formentor offers a more exclusive, contemporary vision of sportiness, which is instilled into an exquisitely sleek and bold design.

Mega Draw excitement is building ahead of Friday night’s extra special EuroMillions promotional event which has a guaranteed jackpot of € million. Since the EuroMillions game launched in Ireland in , there have been  Irish EuroMillions jackpot winners. If tomorrow night’s staggering € million jackpot is won in Ireland, we could see a new Irish winner added to the roll call of jackpot wins. googletag.cmd.push The National Lottery has advised players dreaming of winning big in the th September draw to continue to follow public health guidelines andplaying in retail, to buy their tickets early to avoid queues which will inevitably build in the hours leading up to the cut-off for ticket sales at .pm on Friday evening. Meanwhile, the Lotto jackpot roll continues and is now set to hit an estimated € million. The current Lotto jackpot has been rolling for over three months since Wednesday th June. So far this year, there have been five Lotto jackpot wins by players in Limerick, Kilkenny, Westmeath, Cork and Galway. In the history of the Lotto game in Ireland, only one jackpot in excess of € million has ever been won which was in June  when the Dan Morrissey syndicate from Carlow scooped a whooping €,,. A single winner of Saturday night’s le-changing € millionjackpot would find themselves at number two on the list of all-time highest wins since the game launched in Ireland in .     A National Lottery spokesperson said:“What a weekend we have ahead of us! We could potentially see two hugely le-altering amounts being won by National Lottery players in Ireland. Tomorrow night’s Mega Draw EuroMillions event with a guaranteed € million jackpot is creating incredible excitement amongst our players. If a player in Ireland scoops this astonishing amount, it would bring to , the number of Irish EuroMillions jackpot winners since the game launched in Ireland in . And of course, there is a huge buzz around this weekend’s Lotto draw with the jackpot heading towards an estimated € million, the spokersperon said. The current Lotto jackpot has been on an unprecedented roll without a winner since June and is now edging very close to reaching the current jackpot cap. The Lotto jackpot is currently capped at €. million and this represents the record breaking Lotto jackpot win by the Dan Morrissey syndicate in Carlow in June . Once the jackpot exceeds the cap, no more money will be added to the jackpot prize until it is won. The funds that would normally go to the jackpot will be distributed to the next lower prize tier at which there are winners. If the jackpot is won at an amount higher than €. million, that amount will become the game’s new jackpot cap. “With two incredible jackpots in both EuroMillions and Lotto just a day apart, we are encouraging players to purchase their tickets early as we expect there to be a big uptake in sales ahead of the draw times. We are reminding players that the cut-off time for sales for EuroMillions tickets is at .pm on Friday evening while the cut-off time for sales for Lotto tickets is at .pm on Saturday evening. Tickets can be purchased in-store, on the National Lottery app or atwww.lottery.ie, the spokesperson said.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derrys Millennium Forum - ‘A place of hope’  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Coastguard helicopter arriving at Altnagelvin Hospital following this evenings incident.Local NewsCasualty airlted to Altnagelvin Hospital following jet ski incident on River Foyle overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsPolice deploy stinger during County Derry car chase overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Monday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Emmett McConomy speaking to the crowd at Derrys GuildhallDerry NewsYou do not speak for the people of Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  A lack of lorry drivers the main cause for empty shop shelves, Alliance Councillor Philip McKinney has said.Derry NewsLack of drivers the cause for empty shelves, says Derry truck driver overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsPortal opens for High Street Voucher Scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Pic by George Sweeney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Sept Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Derry City  Longford Town  Goals from Jamie McGonigle, James Akintunde and Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe earned Derry City a comfortable win over Longford to move within three points of Sligo Rovers in third place. In a one-sided game, the Candystripes were too strong for the visitors. A fairly low-key start at the Brandywell ended when Derry City took the lead on  minutes. It was entirely preventable from a Longford point of view as Eoin Toal’s high ball forward was flicked on by Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe into the path of defender Joseph Manley. The centre-half hesitated however and Jamie McGonigle took advantage, charging the ball down and racing clear to finish past Lee Steacy for his second goal in a week. googletag.cmd.push It was all Derry City and they doubled their lead just before the half hour mark. This time McGonigle turned provider, as his ball in from the right picked out Will Fitzgerald in the area, and his touch set up James Akintunde, whose shot from  yards took a big deflection off a Longford leg to wrongfoot Steacy who could only watch as the ball rolled past him into the net. The Longford goalkeeper got his own slice of luck moments later as the Candystripes threatened to finish the game as a contest. Junior looked a touch ambitious when he lined up a free kick  yards from goal, but it was spilled by Steacy into the path of McGonigle, who would surely have made it - had an awkward bounce not taken the ball away from him at the crucial moment. The dynamic of a comfortable game almost changed just minutes into the second half when Darragh Nugent burst forward from midfield, into the area and around Nathan Gartside, but shanked his effort wide and over of the open goal.     That was as good as it got for Longford however, and Derry got their third goal nine minutes from time. Evan McLaughlin’s pass picked out the run of Danny Lafferty in behind the visitors’ defence, and although his volley was brilliantly parried by Steacy, the ball fell for Junior, whose shot into the ground bounced over the goalkeeper and into the net for -.  DERRY CITY: Gartside, Lafferty, McJannett, Toal, Boyce , Harkin , Hery , Fitzgerald , McGonigle , Akintunde, Ogedi-Uzokwe.

Any chemistry student is automatically tutored in such hazards, the campaignersrsquo letter continues.ldquoThis is not a new subject and CIL , had it been so worried about it, should have acted decades ago on the mercury issue. Your concerns now ring hollow and you are using the issue to pursue your own interests in the modernisation of lighthouses.Campaigners have asked CIL to provide evidence of what training was given to lighthouse keepers in mercury usage and what so-called Material Safety Data Sheets on mercury were and are supplied to lighthouses in its jurisdiction.They say they are not impressed with CILrsquos progress when it comes to environmental heritage matters, pointing to the many changes which have taken place at St Johnrsquos Point over the years, including a reduction in use of the borm Fresnel lens to single lens and the removal of the original mechanics that powered the rotating lens.Other changes highlighted by campaigners included the abolition of keepers and attendants and the planned reduction in maintenance of the Killough stationrsquos walls and outbuildings.The letter continues: ldquoWhilst several of these changes may be understandable, you go too far with the removal of the heritage rotation system and in the employment of LED as the light source. You must surely be aware of thegrowing concerns in the environmental community worldwide about LED lighting.ldquoThe Lecale Lightkeepers will further resist your plans for St Johnrsquos Point, but we urge you to take note of the facts and of the strong local opposition to your plan.Campaigners say they are prepared to cooperate with CIL and others in developing suitable preservation plans for the historic lighthouse, including the engine room, while the organisation maintain itrsquo important role as an Aid to Navigation.Their letter adds: ldquoKeeping the existing lens rotation system and a health and safety review of your LED plans are, however, prerequisites to our cooperation..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22September2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Downe U3A members enjoy fun day out  ","story":"MEMBERS of Downe UA had a marvellous and unusual day out at Crawfordrsquos Rock, near Kilkeel, recently.Local businesswoman Michelle Wilson took them, armed with collecting bags, on a foraging trip along the shore.She pointed out the dferent types of seaweed, telling which of them are best for cooking, which are ingredients of skin care products and which she recommended for a healthy seaweed bath.With their collected seaweeds the group then retreated to a gazebo on the shore where they were served up some shlauch mdash or shlucht mdash seaweed with seaweed bread and cod roe.This was followed by many courses of local produce, langoustines, mussels, crab toes, haddock landed fresh in Kilkeel that morning, then steak, potatoes, seaweed and chilli chocolate, ending with Crawfords Rock Seaweed Companyrsquos award-winning peppermint and kombu tea.The group agreed that it had been a day to remember.

legal and financial reasons, developing the facility at this location was simply not a viable option.If the council forged ahead with the plan for Dunleath Park, it would have to pay compensation to Dunleath Estates, based on the current commercial value of the land required to house the new cinema and associated parking.Alternatively,the existing lease is amended to allow the construction of the cinema, around one third of the income would have to be paid to Dunleath Estates with the remainder of the cash used specically for the playing fields, in keeping with stipulations laid down by the

now has no idea what the future hold and fears what may happen when winter sets in and he has no help to light his fire in the morning.Local community worker Billy Walker, who is fighting the decision to remove Mr Heaneyrsquos home help assistance, said the pensioner cannot believe he has been singled out for such unfair treatment.The community worker said he understand the Down Lisburn Trust is strapped for cash to provide a number of community care services, including those aimed at specically helping elderly people.STRANGFORD mdash Pensioners have finally been granted free travel across Strangford Lough following a drawn out campaign by local politicians.Regional Development Minister Gregory Campbell announced the decision to include the Strangford to Portaferry crossing in the free

Championship campaign with an impressive win over last yearrsquos runners-up Carryduff on a sun-drenched Saturday evening.Despite being considered slight underdogs before the contest, the green and white outfit proved they were anything but as they found the back of the net three times in the opening half.Goals from Oran Cunninghamand captain Conor McGrady put the Hoops too far in front at the interval, with the Carryduff men left frustrated at their missed chances.There was a notable turnout at the Darragh Cross venue, with waves of supporters from both sides allowing their voices to be heard throughout the duration of the match.Despite Carryduff winning the throw-in, it was Downpatrick who opened the scoring through a Jarlath Brannigan free after three minutes had been played.Brannigan doubled his tally just two minutes later in what was a determined start from the Hoops.However, this would be no stroll in the park as Josh Connery dummied his marker to send Carryduffrsquos first effort over the bar after some silky work from team-mate Owen McCabe.Downpatrick goalkeeper and joint captain James Deeny displayed pin-point accuracy with his kick-outs countless times throughout the match but perhaps needed the opening minutes to settle any nerves.A wayward punt upfield was gobbled up by Carryduffrsquos Pearse McCabe who relayed the ball quickly to Cian Clinton to level the scores.Caolan Mooney made his presence known with his usual rapid pace and precision. The former Rostrevor and current county player drew a foul before Conor McCarron calmly converted to put Downpatrick back in front.It was Carryduffrsquos turn to showcase their county talent as Daniel Guinness again levelled the tie with an emphatic point before captain Joe McFlynn swung the match back in their favour.However, with a minute to go to the first water-break Downpatrick got the reward for their relentless work in the middle of the park.McGrady and Mooney swarmed the Carryduff midfield with a barrage of tackles before some quick passing allowed the ball to enter into the hands of Downpatrickrsquos young forward Oran Cunningham.The Downpatrick number  made no mistake in blasting his effort past opposing lsquokeeper Mark Hynes to give his side a two-point lead.This advantage didnrsquot last until the quarter as Carryduff replied with two well-taken scores to bring the contest even.A few wides from both sides were observed after the water-break before Conor Doherty curled his left-footed free in-between the posts for Downpatrick.With  minutes played on the clock it was Cunningham again who would prove the major dference after his long-ranged effort looped over the head of Hynes and into the back of the net to double his tally.Hynes could be excused for this as Cunninghamrsquos effort struck most around the pitch as a cross rather than an attempt at goal.Nevertheless, Carryduff kept plugging away and answered with a James Guinness point.Conor McGrady saw his effort at goal crowded out by the determined opposing defenders before Gerdie Collins saw his effort drt over the bar to restore Downpatrickrsquos four-point lead.Mooney pointed again for the Hoops before McGrady added his sidersquos third goal of the half after the green and white forward line took advantage of a defensive mix-up.Daniel Guinness tried to rally his team as best as he could, soloing past three RGU shirts before registering the final point of the half. Half-time: Downpatrick - Carryduff -.Whatever the management team of Paddy Doherty, Shane OrsquoNeill and DJ Morgan told their Carryduff side during the interval must have struck a chord as they started the second half with clear intent.Despite a James Guinness wide, points from McCabe and McFlynn chipped away at the deficit for the purple, gold and black side.Cunningham was unlucky not to hit a hat-trick of goals after his lobbed effort was fantastically cleared of the line by Daniel Coogan.RGU followed this up with two efforts which both veered wide, before McFlynn again pointed for Carryduff leaving the score - to - in favour of the Downpatrick side at the second water-break.It was clear that legs were beginning to tire in the final quarter after a gruelling physical showing from both teams meant more and more chances went begging.Downpatrick finally registered their first point of the second half through another Doherty free.Carryduff refused to go quietly and were given added encouragement when RGUrsquos Tim Prenter was shown a black card with five minutes remaining.However, the frustration continued for both Carryduff and James Guinness as his effort veered wide of the target again.Deeny was rewarded for keeping his concentration after making an impressive save with his feet to deny Carryduff a certain goal in the dying moments of the game, although he could do nothing about the converted free a minute later.Mooney fisted over the bar in the next run of play for Downpatrick before Carryduff substitute Joe Tunney completed the scoring in the last passage of play.After the match, Downpatrick manager Aidan Robinson reflected on his sidersquos winning performance.ldquoIn the first half we worked incredibly hard, we turned the ball over a lot at the halfway line which we got a lot of scores from and we managed to get the goals, he said.ldquoWe built a good  for ourselves and spoke at half-time about kicking on from that, but we didnrsquot really manage to.ldquoI think in the third quarter of the game we were pretty flat and Carryduff got back into the tie, but we got over the line and we will learn from that.He added: ldquoIrsquom very happy with the result and very happy to be in the next round.Downpatrick: J Deeny, E Rooney, A Doherty, R Murphy, T Smyth, J Bell, C Doherty, D Turley, C McCarron, T Prenter, G Collins, C McGrady, J Brannigan, P Turley, C Mooney.Subs: A Og Robinson, M Fitzpatrick, O Cunningham, S Bell, T Loudon, T McNeill, N Cunningham, D Brannf, T Savage, C Boyd, R Og Quinn, C Farrell, R Quinn.Carryduff: M Hynes, D Coogan, C Cassidy, C McCullagh, L Toal, J Connery, D Guinness, B Cox, P McCabe, O McCabe, J McFlynn, C Clinton, S McGonigle, R Beatty, J Guinness.Subs: T Connery, M McGrath, P McConnell, C Sherry, R Reilly, C Cunningham, R Boyle, J Tunney, M Lawson, C Rooney, J Henry, D Connelly, D Connor.Downpatrick -Carryduff -MORGAN FUELS SFC ST ROUND.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22September2021-Joanne.jpg","title":"Joanne organising event to thank Air Ambulance staff  ","story":"A LOCAL show jumper is organising a fund-raising campaign as her way of saying thank you to the Air Ambulance.Joanne Clough was airlted to hospital after suffering a serious head injury. A year on, she has launched the lsquoHorse Powered Take Offrsquo campaign and competition to raise vital funds for Air Ambulance NI.On September  last year Joanne was competing in a show jumping competition at Ardnacashel Equestrian Centre near Comber, when a serious accident meant she needed urgent medical care.Joanne was warming up on her horse, Juno, when the horse seemed to become spooked and jolted, then began bucking uncontrollably, throwing her from the saddle. As she fell to the ground, Joanne hit her head on a brick wall.Joanne, who lives near Crossgar, said: ldquoI have no memory of the event and apparently lost consciousness. Having spoken to others, I know that the show at Ardnacashel was then stopped, and the organisers along with first aiders on site came to my side and called for an ambulance.ldquoEveryone was really supportive and helpful to ensure myself, my horse, my helper and my seven year-old daughter, Erin were looked after.The Air Ambulance carrying the Helicopter Emergency Medical Service Teamlanded in the fields beside Ardnacashel. The team treated Joanne at the scene before transferring her to the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast.Joanne remained in the hospital for the next  hours, having tests for potential brain injuries, which were even more pertinent as Joanne had undergone brain surgery to remove a tumour in August .Joanne sustained three fractures to her cheek, damaged the iris of her right eye, resulting in blurred vision, and lost her short-term memory for a couple of months due to severe concussion.It has been a long road to recovery, but now Joanne is starting to feel back to normal. She said: ldquoThe scars and fractures on my face have healed, along with the fatigue, weakness and confusion, but my balance remains something that I am continuing investigations for as my eyesight remains imperfect.ldquoMost importantly for a horsey girl, Juno has been treated for pre-existing injury in the sacroiliac joint in her back, which had caused her to react the way she did on the day. After a sincere apology from her, I am slowly gaining trust and confidence in her again in the saddle.Joanne continued: ldquoThere are no words to describe the gratitude I feel for the assistance of the Air Ambulance NI team and crew that day. Had they not acted so quickly, treated me with such level-headed efficiency and taken me to the hospital so swtly, I have no idea how I might have ended up.ldquoA head injury cannot be underestimated and to have been saved from potential disaster by the medical team in this way is a miraculous success. I owe them my everything and to demonstrate my gratitude, I am running a nationwide equestrian campaign and competition to raise awareness and funds for Air Ambulance NI.

Due to the restrictions in place, actors only metthey were in the same scene.Declanrsquos cousin, Aroacuten Holden from Downpatrick, was the editor for the film who helped piece each scene together. Aroacuten also introduced Declan to a number of others who assisted in creating the short, and therefore was referred to as ldquoan invaluable help by the young director.The short continues to enter numerous film festivals in the hopes of adding more honours, including ceremonies in England, Scotland and the USA.Meanwhile, Declan is currently directing a new featurefilm based in Belfast named lsquoThe Trick Roomrsquo, which entails the story of a cross-community cricket team.To keep up to date with the latest news surrounding Shine, visit @shine_shortfilm on Instagram or check out https:www.imdb title tt ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22September2021-Jockeys.jpg","title":"Locals among the prizes at Downpatrick meeting  ","story":"IT was a good day for local owners and trainers at Fridayrsquos penultimate meeting of the year at Downpatrick.They were successful in three of the seven races on the card, that featured four over hurdles, two chases and a bumper.

Newcastle harbour doesnrsquot exist in isolation as it is a massive part of the vibrant local community.Cllr Mason said it was ldquovital that any plan for the future of Newcastle harbour must be delivered in partnership with the community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22September2021-Portaferry.jpg","title":"Portaferry singer Jonny goes to No1 Down Under  ","story":"A DEBUT album from a Portaferry musician has gone straight to the top Down Under.Jonny Reidrsquos album, Another Le, came out two weeks ago and went in at number one in Australian country charts and number three on the iTunes album charts.A former luthier at Lowden Guitars in Downpatrick for six years, Jonny released the title track from his album on July .He has been living and working as a full-time musician in Perth for the past nine years.While he has not been home since before the global pandemic started, the  year-old has had help from his home town with his new album.ldquoI recorded my album here in Australia at Scudley Records in Perth and also with the help from home via Portaferry multi-instrumentalist and country star Stephen Smyth in his Loughside Recording Studios who we sent tracks back and forward to so he could add his magic, said Jonny.ldquoTherersquos songs on the new album about travel and experiences from Ireland to Australia.

There is also the potential to add morethey are required.While three options have been drawn up, members of the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee favour one that involves reconfiguring a meeting room and foyer into one large, open space with a new extension to the front to a  square metre multi-purpose room.In addition, two changing rooms are to be knocked into one with a  square metre kitchen area.A third changing room is to be converted to provide a so-called changing places toilet and there is also a store area for the meeting area.Asking the public for its view mdash which must be submitted online by Wednesday, September  mdash council officials say they recognise there is a need renovate the existing centre to meet current demands and services the community expects.In addition, Rowallane area councillors have highlighted concerns that currently, only one activity can take place at the centre at a time due to the current layout. They also recognise the need to offer additional space for extra activities.As part of the consultation process, residents are asked to complete a small online questionnaire, with all information used by the council to determine the best way forward.News of the proposal to upgrade the community centre comes after the local authority was asked to address its under investment in the market town and ensure that enhancing leisure facilities was a critical component of its future investment plans.Earlier this year, the need for ultra-modern leisure provision topped the agenda during an online meeting between local politicians and senior council officials who were asked to examine the potential of extending and upgrading the existing community centre at Windmill Street or a complete new-build, potentially on available land at the townrsquos Langley Road or at the Newcastle Road.Major new leisure provision has recently been provided across the council area, including Downpatrick, Saintfield and Newry, with plans in the pipeline for signicant investment in new leisure services in Newcastle.Politicians say that while Ballynahinch has missed out on major local authority investment over recent years, the organisation needs to address this now to cater for the needs of local people and sporting organisations.They argued that the current community centre needs major improvement or potentially replaced and that funding must be earmarked to allow this to happen.Politicians say itrsquos vital that Ballynahinch is a key part of any future council strategy when it comes to leisure activities.Several councillors believe the current Ballynahinch Centre requires signicant investment to meet the needs of local people and while many favour a new-build, they recognise that this is unlikely in the short to medium term.Moving forward, they say Ballynahinch cannot be left behind given that it has missed out on major funding for a signicant number of years and that ratepayers in the town and surrounding area deserve nothing less.The consultation closes at pm on Wednesday, September  and to take part, log on at https:tinyurl uejtmpc.

Please try again later.Submitting...There was nothing like that when I was a child. It was enjoyable enough to clamber up the vast, then state-of-the-art, combine harvesters that they had on display.It was good to see Balmoral having expanded in such ways.It was grey and at points drizzly at Balmoral yesterday yet the atmosphere was happy — perhaps due to the yearning of people to be able to get back to such gatherings. I was struck by Balmoral’s Covid requirements: either proof of full vaccination, or proof of a recent negative NHS Lateral Flow test, or proof of antibodies from PCR test.These seemed to be to be responsible requirements for an event of many people in close proximity. Indeed they seemed to me to be a minimum, because proof of a negative Lateral Flow test on its own is not a strict requirement, due to the possibility of ‘ negatives’ .I agree with Colum Eastwood, SDLP leader, on vaccine passports.A curious feature of Covid is the bitterly ided way in which many people approach the topic.Hardcore anti lockdown believers morph into anti vaxxers.Zero Coviders want severe shutdowns and dismiss any attempt to assess the overall cost of that tactic.And both sides seem to be, at best, selective in use of statistics.For example, I have been since the beginning a mild lockdown sceptic. This was not because lockdown doesn’t work — it obviously doesyou deprive people of all human contact. My concern was whether coronavirus was worth such drastic measures. This is still not clear, because we still do not know the exact societal cost in loneliness, mental illness, impact on non Covid NHS treatments, impact on economies, ruined livelihoods, impaired education and so on.In particular the enduring inequality of it all. The way the public sector is untouched and politicians won’t even countenance, say, a % pay cut to non frontline public sector workers to help fund the devastated self employed.Or the inequality of much of the population living through confinement in houses with ample outdoor space, and others stuck in flats with no garden. These are among reasons we must avoid third lockdown. Yet hardcore lockdown supporters rarely seem to acknowledge these problems. They dismissed the importance of statistics that showed the massive age gradient to Covid, in particular the almost non existent risk to the under s. Yes, the Delta iant has somewhat changed that, and there is a worry with long Covid, but even so it is overwhelmingly fatal only for people who are already gravely ill or nearing end of le.But those of us who accept that reality should be embracing vaccine requirements, and yet many lockdown sceptics are anti such an approach, talking of freedom of choice rather than compulsion. But they should embrace compulsion, in order to ensure freedom of action and freedom of movement!The value of the vaccines is clear in Northern Ireland hospitals intensive care stats. Some % of people in ICUs are entirely unvaccinated, while only % of the adult population is without even one jab.Yet these statistics are turned on their head. It is said that % of people in ICU are double jabbed which proves they don’t work. In fact, given that % of adults in NI have had both doses, it shows you vaccinations slash risk of a severe response to Covid . I was slow to get double jabbed because, in my s, I felt at low risk and the vulnerable people I care about had already had both doses before I became eligible. I soon realised that I was not thinking hard enough about my possible role in spreading infections. I have had both jabs since summer, and think it is a fair bargain for society to open up extensively but give preferential access to people who have two doses.I understand the dismay of people who have loved ones in care homes, and who got their double doses so that they could safely visit, and yet are seeing that resident potentially cared for by staff who have not protected themselves against Covid in the way the relative has.This is all the more painful given how people were not able to see visit home residents for so long.It is a tricky issue because there is already a shortage of care staff. Even so, England is right to move to compulsion for such carers in the coming weeks.• Ben Lowry: A sunny autumn day in Co Down banishes some of my equinox gloom• Ben Lowryis News Letter acting

The next day the party agreed with Mr Johnson a Brexit plan for Northern Ireland which the then DUP leader described as \"a serious and sensible way forward\". Up until October   the DUP had resolutely opposed a regulatory border in the Irish Sea. Their change of position was a catastrophic mistakeDUP politicians have in this newspaper repeatedly spoken asthe party never agreed a regulatory border in the Irish Sea Peter Robinson  praised the DUP’s latest position on the NI protocol and he criticised other unionist responses to it. Lord Dodds  wrote that the DUP “pointed out all along” the dangers of a “regulatory border”.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Letter to the editorLord Morrow  said “it should have been obvious that almost no unionists could support a border in the Irish Sea”.Indeed earlier this year Lord Dodds  took issue with the suggestion in a News Letter editorial, that the Democratic Unionist Party, “did agree a regulatory Irish Sea border in early October ”. There are other times when the party has pushed back on such a claim. On Saturday January , Arlene Foster, writing in the News Letter, stated that “some also claim that the DUP consented to a border in the Irish Sea in October . This is nonsense and not grounded in fact”. Given that the allegation is being repeatedly denied by the party, and given that no-one seems to be looking into the history of DUP decisions at the time, it is worth recapping on what happened.Lord Dodds claimed in March that the  arrangements which the DUP supported would have ensured that Northern Ireland was out of the single market with the rest of the UK, but it is clear from the prime minister’s letter to Jean-Claude Junker on October   that the proposal provided, “for the potential creation of an all-island regulatory zone on the island of Ireland covering all goods including agrood”. If true, the allegation that the DUP agreed a regulatory Irish Sea border could represent probably the single greatest mis-judgement by a unionist political party in recent history, it is important that such an allegation is not unfairly repeated by party political opponents. Either way people have the right to know the truth. This matters because at the time it was suggested by the media that the DUP’s position represented an unprecedented u-turn by the party and by political opponents as an error of judgment. Up until October   the DUP had resolutely opposed any regulatory border in the Irish Sea. This was one aspect of its justication for opposing Theresa May’s backstop proposals which involved a softer form of Brexit.It was disappointing that Lord Dodds in March appeared to attempt to ‘close down’ debate on the matter by saying it was time to, “end the blame culture” and claiming that the allegation, “serves only to sow the seeds of ision in the campaign within unionism to oppose the Northern Ireland protocol through concerted legal and political action”. Such a position does not fill the reader with confidence that the analysis offered by the DUP is going to bear detailed scrutiny. Lord Dodds claimed that there has been a, “rewriting of recent history to wrongly apportion blame within the unionist family”, seemingly oblivious that the DUP’s support for Boris Johnson’s October   proposals were, rightly or wrongly, widely condemned by other unionist parties at the time. In response the then DUP leader said that these proposals were, “a serious and sensible way forward”. Those who wish to read the details for themselves and make their own assessment can find them in the government document link below. Lord Dodds claimed that these arrangements would have ensured that Northern Ireland was out of the single market with the rest of the UK, but it is clear from the prime minister’s letter to Jean-Claude Junker on October   that the proposal provided, “for the potential creation of an all-island regulatory zone on the island of Ireland covering all goods including agrood”. The elimination of all regulatory checks for trade in goods between Northern Ireland and Ireland would be achieved by, “ensuring that goods regulations in Northern Ireland are the same as those in the rest of the EU”. This would have involved checks at Northern Ireland ports and airports relating to the single market to ensure goods comply with EU regulations. These are essentially the same as the regulatory checks which are now being required and described by all unionists as a border down the Irish Sea. The DUP’s sole justication for this is that the October   arrangements would have provided for, “democratic consent for any specic alignment between Northern Ireland and the EU – and therefore any regulatory ergence with Great Britain – both before they entered force and thereafter on an ongoing basis”. While this defence is worthy of detailed consideration, I regard it as unsatisfactory for the following reasons. Many unionists regard the potential creation of such a regulatory Irish Sea border as constitutionally unconscionable and politically unacceptable as a matter of fundamental principle and a development which should not have been countenanced under any circumstances. Arlene Foster previously claimed, “it’s been very clear all along that has been our one red line – that we cannot have either a customs border down the Irish Sea, or a regulatory border because that would make us separate from the rest of the United Kingdom”. She also stated, “Northern Ireland must leave the EU on the same terms as the rest of the United Kingdom. We will not accept any form of regulatory ergence which separates Northern Ireland economically or politically from the rest of the United Kingdom”. It is beyond dispute that the deal the DUP supported on October   did not satisfy the then DUP leader’s ‘blood red lines’. While ‘prior’ consent was theoretically required before the Irish Sea border would come into force, it was never seriously suggested by the DUP, having supported the prime minister’s proposals, that such initial support for the new arrangements would be withheld. Indeed, to withhold initial consent would have made a mockery of what had been proposed. This initial consent was therefore no more than a mere formality by which unionists would provide the impression of having a veto when it did not meaningfully exist. At a conceptual level it is hard to see how unionist acquiescence for undermining our position in the United Kingdom makes this situation any more acceptable. The notion of an ongoing consent role for the Northern Ireland Assembly is also misconceived. Having granted initial consent there would have been no further meaningful role for the Northern Ireland Assembly for the next four years. During this time Northern Ireland would have been subject to a wide range of laws in relation to the single market for goods. Meanwhile over this period Great Britain would not have been subject to this EU law and during this period would have erged from the EU and Northern Ireland. Moreover eventhe arrangements would not have continued after four years, given the assembly’s cross community voting arrangements there is no obvious assembly route to realignment with GB regulations against the opposition of nationalists. Perhaps even more importantly at a practical level, the cross community consent provisions which would theoretically have given unionists in Northern Ireland a veto in four years time never stood the slightest chance of being accepted by the EU. They represented the opening position by the UK government and were always going to be watered down in negotiations. Inevitably this is exactly what happened. Mark Devenport, BBCNI’s Political Editor at the time, writing on October   proved prescient when he stated, “the nightmare, from the DUP’s perspective would be , having conceded on the principle of aligning with the EU, the mechanism of consent agreed by the UK did not deliver a unionist veto”. The BBC also reported that Raoul Ruparel, a Brexit advisor to Theresa May suggested, “the DUP made a mistake by accepting there could be regulatory dferences between NI and the rest of the UK. He said one of the reasons Boris Johnson got a deal with the European Union was due to the DUP’s move”. If there is a distinction between the DUP agreeing a regulatory border in the Irish Sea and agreeing to proposals which,implemented, would almost inevitably lead to a regulatory border in the Irish Sea, it is not much of one. It was obvious at the time and it is even clearer with the benefit of hindsight that the DUP leadership made a catastrophic mistake in backing the prime minister’s proposals on October  . Acceptance rather than denial of this fact might start the process of a much needed rebuilding of confidence as they face into the challenges which lie ahead.

You might think that your car failed because your examiner was over zealous. You might even wonderhe or she was harsher because they did not like the look of you. But you cannot think you were failed because the tester wanted your business.However, the NI MOT system has at dferent points over the years been subject to delays that make it hard to a book a test in time for your road worthiness certicate’s renewal date. A recent upgrade of the booking system did not help.One of the worst such delays to testing has been caused by Covid. The slowdown in testing capacity during lockdown was alleviated by a temporary extension in the time interval between mandatory tests from one year to two.The testing system is now said to be back to normal.This is good because had it been thrown badly out of kilter, resulting in permanent delays, it might have brought our sound MOT procedures unfairly into disrepute, leading to a clamour for GB’s inferior private system.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Photo: Kelvin Boyes   Press EyeEconomy Minister Gordon Lyons said he did not think using vaccine certication to gain access to events or hospitality venues was the right policy for the region.His comments suggest the issue may become a point of friction for parties within the Stormont Executive, given Sinn Fein has made clear it would be open to vaccine passportsthe move was recommended by health chiefs.The SDLP last week called for the introduction of a scheme as a way to boost vaccination rates.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...The policy has been identied as one way to mitigate a relaxation of the one-metre social distancing rule that still applies to indoor hospitality and entertainment venues in Northern Ireland.While authorities in England have shelved plans for vaccine passports, Scotland and Wales are introducing schemes next month.A scheme to gain entry to pubs and restaurants in the Irish Republic, which has been credited with driving up vaccination rates among young people, is set to end on October .Stormont ministers are meeting on Monday evening to discuss the social distancing rule amid calls from the business sector for the restriction to be dropped.Mr Lyons said he wanted to see social distancing measures removed as soon as possible, because of decreasing Covid transmission and hospital admission rates in Northern Ireland.But he said did not believe vaccine certication was an appropriate way to mitigate the removal of the restriction.“I don’t think that we are in that space any more,” he said.“We’ve almost got % of our adult population vaccinated and you are now seeing the impact that that is having on the rate of transmission and hospitalisations as well.”Mr Lyons noted that the scheme was coming to an end across the border and the plan had been dropped in England. He also flagged issues with the initiatives planned for Scotland and Wales, including a legal challenge against the Holyrood government’s plan.“I’m not convinced that this is the right policy for a number of reasons,” he told BBC Radio Ulster.Mr Lyons said the scheme would present “legal and human rights issues”.“I think it is important that we take those on board and look in particular at who that’s most likely to affect,” he said.“I think we also have to look at how this would be implemented as well – would this become a permanent feature, would it be extended beyond indoor events to other public events to hospitality “What about people then who work in those sectors. If you have a job would you need to have a vaccine passport as well  What systems would need to be in place for it to happen, what additional burdens would there be for business ”Sinn Fein deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill has raised human rights concerns about such an initiative.However, last week she suggested she would still be “very open” to a passport schemeit could be demonstrated it could contribute to the “greater good” of tackling the spread of Covid-.Her party colleague Chris Hazzard told the BBC: “We’ve always been clear that we want to follow the medical and scientic advice andthat advice is that the best way forward is to look at that , then we’re absolutely willing to look at that.“It has never come forward as an option as far as I understand from the CMOto be able to look at that.“Sothat’s on the table then we’ll be more than happy to do so.”  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularBrothers’ ‘emotional’ meeting with RUC man they saw ‘killed’ as children in  by IRA sniperSinn Fein plan for strict bonfire regulations in Belfast moves a step forwardUUP leader Doug Beattie explains why he is standing firm against unionist electoral pactsMan and woman hit with bottleTributes to Ronan Kerr at Omagh’s first ‘Pride’Most PopularNorthern Ireland High Street Voucher Scheme: Start date to be announced on Tuesday, September , Henry McDonald: For all the gushing attitudes to the European Union in Dublin, Brussels cannot rely on the Republic of Ireland to help it with an EU armyNorthern Ireland centenary service will be all the better without republicans, be they President Michael D Higgins or Sinn FeinVaccine passports: NI ‘no longer in the space’ to justy action Killer of prison officer Adrian Ismay seeks to overturn conviction                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kTUwUJ sc-dqBHgY ciFbrr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Firstly, a permanent resident within the property needs to be in receipt of one of the following benefits, such as:Armed Forces Independence PaymentAttendance AllowanceCarerrsquos AllowanceChild BenefitConstant Attendance AllowanceDisability Living AllowancePension Guarantee CreditIncome-related Employment and Support Allowance Income-based Jobseekerrsquos Allowance Income SupportIndustrial Injuries Disablement BenefitMobility SupplementPersonal Independence PaymentSevere Disablement AllowanceTax Credits Universal CreditWhat is EC  Funding The Energy Company Obligation or ECO is the name given to the UK Governments programme to make houses more energy efficient on a nationwide basis.The current ECO scheme, ECO, is scheduled to run until  March  and is focused exclusively on lower-income households, a wide range of benefit recipients qualy for improvements in their homes energy efficiency, with measures including new heating systems and boiler upgrades, external insulation, internal insulation and loft insulation as well as double glazing and more.What does the process involve First, fill in the Grant Eligibility Survey to seeyou qualy for the free boiler. Providing you are eligible, the team at First Choice Energy Ltd will speak to you on the phone and then come out and survey your home. This will include things like measuring your floor space, checking the thermostats on your radiators, identying the brand and model of your current gas boiler and asking some general questions regarding your property. A survey generally takes no longer than an hour.When itrsquos time to install a new boiler, your previous boiler will be replaced with a new gas-fired condensing boiler and the floor insulation will be fitted by a carpenter. Although the process sounds messy and time-consuming, on average it takes no longer than a day. And of course, the cost to install the boiler and install the floor insulation is covered by the grant.Will I need to pay any contributions Householders that are eligible for free boiler grants have no obligation to pay back any installments. Plus there are no terms and conditions to be met other than the basic qualying criteria.Why do I need a new boiler Your boiler may be on its way out, or not working properly, so now is the time to act. With energy bills more expensive than ever, your boiler needs to be heating your home for the lowest possible cost. A boiler installed around  years ago will most likely be around -% efficient. So, by upgrading this old boiler to a new one, the carbon savings will be signicant enough to warrant the cost and therefore will qualy under the free boiler scheme.Boilers installed in the UK are required to be condensing boilers. These are far more efficient than traditional boilers as they release gas at just  degrees Celsius , therefore requiring less energy to generate the same amount of heat.What happensI am not eligible The team at First Choice Energy may be able to help you with other grant schemes or offer advice and guidance on how to help with any problems you could face.For more information visit First Choice Energy Ltd or email: Firstchoiceenergylimited@gmail article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Brought to you byFIRST CHOICE ENERGY s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityRecent years have seen increasing numbers of the Grey seal population breeding in and around the lagoon and spotting them is an exciting wildle encounter that many visitors wonrsquot forget.However, the combination of the Blue Lagoons high visitor numbers, and its sheltered nature which makes it so attractive to seals, creates a situation where there is a high potential for disturbance to seals.The time seals spend resting on land is vital to their health and that of their pups as they are digesting a recent meal, socialising, and feeding their young.Blue Lagoon to closeIn order to provide them with a safe environment to raise their pups, National Trust Cymru will be closing the Blue Lagoon to visitors from September  through to November .Visitors will still be able to watch these wild creatures in their habitat from the coastal path and coasteering activity providers who have signed up to the National Trustrsquos Coasteering Agreement and undertaken specic training on how to operate around seals, will still have access to the lagoon with groups of visitors who have booked in advance.Mark Underhill, National Trust Cymrursquos Countryside Manager, Pembrokeshire said: ldquoThere are two species of seal that can be found in Britain the Common seal and the Grey seal. Only Grey seals occur regularly in Pembrokeshire, where they are present all year around.ldquoAbout half the worldrsquos population of Grey Seal breed on our coastline and the total number in West Wales, mostly Pembrokeshire, is estimated to be about ,, with some , pups being born each year.ldquoThe breeding season is vital for our seal colonies here in Pembrokeshire, and we ask that visitors do not access the Blue Lagoon and that they follow the guidelines laid out by the Seal Alliance and Pembrokeshire Marine Code when on the coastal path.Paul Renfro from the Pembrokeshire Coastal Forum said: ldquoThe Pembrokeshire Marine Code recommends remaining at least m away from the seals, though they can be disturbed at any distance so itrsquos important to be responsive to their behaviour.     ldquoIf a resting seal looks up or turns to looks at you then you are close enough at whatever distance you are at. Seals can be particularly sensitive to disturbance after periods of stormy weather and during the breeding season so we recommend giving them extra space at these times.How to avoid disturbing sealsTo avoid disturbing seals at this very important time of year, National Trust Cymru recommends adopting the following strategies:Sssh, stay quiet: Channel your inner David Attenborough and speak with a low voice and encourage your children to do the same. Noisy dogs can frighten seals soyour four-legged friend is a bit chatty, please leave them at home when you visit a seal breeding area.Donrsquot get too close: Ensure you stay at least  metres away from sealsand never come between a seal and her pup, or a seal and the sea. Doing so will cause distress to both the mother and pup.Keep dogs on a short lead: Keep your dog on a short lead. Do not allow them to run loose or play with balls, frisbees or sticks anywhere near a breeding colony as this will cause them distress.What to doyou see a seal in distressIf you spot a lone seal pup on a beach itrsquos probably not in distress. Seal pups are often left alone on the beach whilst its mum goes off to catch dinner.Never approach the seal. It will cause further distress and may be dangerous for you and the Seal.Look to see how many people there are about. In most cases when seals are in distress itrsquos due to contact with curious and well-meaning visitors.If you are still concerned, contact conservation group Welsh Marine Le Rescue   or   who will be able to offer you further guidance. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
