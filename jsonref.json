I also want to honour the incredible staff at The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital.\u0027The insertion of metal rods is one way of treating children with the condition.

generally include back, shoulder and neck pain, limited mobility and uneven hips and arm and leg lengths. In addition to surgery, scoliosis can also be corrected with special bracing.  The condition commonly occurs between the ages of ten and 20 and impacts about three percent of the population worldwide.  X Factor 2018 spoilers: Who are the final 16 and when are the live shows?EuroMillions

Argento did not dispute Dove\u0027s claims in that tweet, and instead accused the model of deflecting, before adding: \u0027Don’t call me love. All that is left of your answers is treachery and deceit.\u0027She later closed out her attack by writing: \u0027You can’t help yourself but keep lying, can you? You never sent me or showed me any documents. And remember, there was a witness.\u0027Dove went offline at the exact same time, but not before posting a few final remarks.\u0027Ok, through the gates of Hell I walk willingly with You if only for the truth to see the light of the fire,\u0027 said the model to Argento in one post.Dove then said in a final tweet: \u0027Fair for U to be angry- U are trapped and want to take everything down with U. I am not afraid of what is coming. But the truth still remains You slept w Jimmy Bennett. You lied when You demand others accused of sexual assault to be honest. This hurts victims’ voices everywhere.\u0027The model is a new acquaintance of Argento, whom she met through McGowan.Dove started dating the actress earlier this year in the wake of McGowan\u0027s rage-filled rant at a transgender woman at a New York City book signing for her memoir Brave that many found to be transphobic.In the wake of that incident, Dove offered to help the actress repair her image.Dove said that she released the texts with McGowan\u0027s blessing, and also sent her exchanges with the actress to the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u0027s Department. "},{"url":null,"title":"Eugenie Jack make getaway Aston Martin DB10 James Bond movie Spectre","story":"    The car was waiting for Jack and Eugenie outside Windsor Castle.

Double the rum ration and prepare to meet thy marriage maker.Flagship programme This Morning sprang into action with a sophisticated plan for a swelegant, finely tooled show that would encapsulate everything delicious and de-lovely about the marriage of Princess Thingy to Jack Bloke in front of dozens of spectators. Obviously that was never going to work, so they got Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford to host it instead.I love Eamonn and Ruth, but I’m not sure if having the king and queen of daytime television commentating on your wedding is anything for a blood princess to boast about. On the snob-o-meter, it’s the equivalent of hoping for Edward and Wallis Simpson, but having to settle for Homer and Marge instead.Yet while Eamonn might not have the gravitas or presence of a vintage Dimbleby, he wasted no time in establishing hitherto unknown credentials as a millinery expert of rare refinement.‘Where’d she get those chopsticks that go through that hat?’ he wondered, when the Duchess of York first appeared in her leprechaun-themed finery. Where indeed?          Princess Eugenie of York walks down the aisle with her father, Prince Andrew the Duke of YorkThis was a minor royal wedding played in a major key, presenting our telly hosts with the dilemma of somehow finding the right tone without alienating viewers. Too reverent would have been wrong, too chummy would have been impertinent – although there were certainly moments of pure Ulster sauce.‘Is Queenie in that car?’ Eamonn would bellow in his Norn Ireland brogue, as he attempted several times to locate the whereabouts of the monarch.He sounded as if he was trying to find his missing dachshund. In the end, the couple settled on a kind of relaxed but upbeat jocularity, and it was a privilege to share their big day. Eamonn and Ruth I mean, not Eugenie and Jack. Did I say relaxed? Eamonn had the air of a man upon whom forceps were recently used to extricate him from his favourite La-Z-Boy recliner, while his darling wife appeared to have been up all night cementing her hair with max strength lacquer to combat the 40mph winds swirling around their temporary studio in the Lower Ward of Windsor Castle.‘It’s a bad bride hair day,’ she said, as the most extraordinary ragbag of guests began staggering down the hill in their wedding-day best. ‘Oh, top of Kate Moss’s head there,’ said Eamonn, helpfully. ‘Holly Valance, very stylish,’ noted Ruth, as the actress wife of property tycoon Nick Candy tottered past in pink heels.

She certainly didn’t get the memo that this was a plastic-free wedding, and drifted into the chapel with her usual waxen expression fixed in place.On and on they came Pixie Geldof channelling Halloween in her Corpse Bride pleats actress Liv Tyler appearing to have stepped from the pages of a Chandler novel in her blocky suit tiny Cara Delevingne in her top hat and tails, looking like the ringmaster of a toy circus.Among their number was a fruity cache of former druggies and good-time guys and gals, the kind of demi-famous derelicts who once put the ouch in louche. Who were these people?Along with Kate there was Naomi Campbell, Jimmy Carr, Jamie Redknapp, the pop star Ricky Martin, pop singer Ellie Goulding, professional posh wedding attender James Blunt, orcee Heather Kerzner, artist Tracey Emin, his eminence Stephen Fry, broadcaster Richard Bacon, heiress Tamara Beckwith, always-the-bridesmaid Chelsy Davy, the Bransons, the Pippas, Uncle Tom Cobbleigh and of course Robbie Williams and his wife Ayda, fresh from adjudicating on The X Factor.

Certainly, they all behaved nicely when Andrea Bocelli got up to sing, although they couldn’t have known that the first TV ad break featured a crass advertisement for his ‘first album in 14 years’.A stray ribbon of bad taste fluttered across the proceedings. Armani tweeted details of Robbie Williams’s suit and his wife’s outfit, while even the groom’s employers revealed details of the brand of tequila being served at the reception. Back in the studio, Eamonn and Ruth endlessly discussed the bride’s scoliosis, in a section called Princess Eugenie’s Health Battle.Do you know something? She is not the only one to have suffered. Take Eamonn, for example. ‘I was born with my hips in the wrong place. In my whole life I could never spread my legs,’ he said. Thanks for sharing, big guy.Still, it was hard not to be moved by the sheer happiness of the occasion. The rosy-cheeked bride who beamed with joy, the groom at her side who gasped for breath like a gaffed salmon, occasionally overwhelmed with the emotion of it all. Where was Queenie now? Just like Eamonn and Ruth, she did her duty and then she went home. "},{"url":null,"title":"Felicity Kendal tells women stop hysteria MeToo movement","story":"    Felicity Kendal (pictured on Wednesday) has told women to stop the \u0027hysteria\u0027 over the MeToo movementGood Life star Felicity Kendal has told women to stop the \u0027hysteria\u0027 over the MeToo movement.The actress begged women to \u0027keep calm\u0027 and stop being \u0027judgmental\u0027, claiming there has never been total equality.Kendal, 72, said: \u0027The thing about the MeToo movement is it\u0027s a bit like talking about feminism.

He thinks it will likely happen sometime during the Antarctic summer, which runs from December to February, when temperatures have been known to get as high as 50 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit.  Should the newly-formed iceberg stay in the water near where it breaks off, Lhermitte said that it will likely stay solid. But, should it drift north, towards warmer waters, it would melt.  The Pine Island Glacier is said to be calving icebergs at a higher rate than ever before.           Lhermitte said that if the entire 19-mile-long rift breaks off, the new starting line for the Pine Island Glacier will be four miles back from where it currently stands.

There was a calving in January 2001, with the next one occurring in November 2007, followed by a calving in December 2011.Comparatively, there were two calvings in the last three years — one in August 2015 and another in September 2017, which produced an iceberg that was 103-square-miles long. When this new calving occurs, the Pine Island Glacier\u0027s new front line could be where the rift began, nearly four miles back from where its edge currently is.While calving is seen as a natural process, it is said to be concerning that the Pine Island Glacier is calving so frequently, as Lhermitte said that ice shelves help stop glaciers from flowing unimpeded into the ocean.   Without ice shelves, enormous amounts of Antarctic ice would flow into the ocean, potentially resulting in the sea level rising by yards, Mashable reported.The Washington Post reported that the Pine Island Glacier loses 45billion tons of ice each year, resulting in a sea level rise of .03 inches every eight years. Should the glacier completely melt, sea levels would rise by 1.7 feet. A 12-inch sea level rise would lead to chronic flooding of coastal cities and communities, as well as drive salt water further inland, contaminating drinking water and impacting farming, according to How Stuff Works. Higher sea levels are also said to result in stronger storm surges and more severe high tides.Huge Iceberg Poised to Break Off Antarctica\u0027s Pine Island Glacier - Scientific AmericanA new 19-mile-long crack opened up on the vulnerable Antarctic coastWhat if sea levels rose 12 inches? | HowStuffWorks"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/11/17/0002C91D000001F4-0-image-m-28_1539276240188.jpg","title":"Digital music giant Spotify exposed booking profits outside UK","story":"    DJ Annie Mac performs at the Spotify Opening Gig - the firm has been booking three-quarters of its revenue to an entity in Sweden, allowing it to pay just £891,425 a year in UK taxIn total, Spotify generates £444million revenue in the UK, according to its group accounts.

How Meghan rolled her eyes and appeared to give the fidgeting Prince a subtle telling off at Eugenie\u0027s wedding in a rare moment of conflict between the loved-up pair They\u0027ve been basking in that newlywed glow for months, but it seems that Harry and Meghan may have experienced a rare moment of discord on Eugenie\u0027s big day at St George\u0027s chapel. As the pair waited for the ceremony to begin in St George\u0027s Chapel, the Duchess of Sussex seemed to be telling off her husband as a fidgeting Harry interrupted his wife as she chatted to Zara Tindall. She fired a few words back at him and briefly gesticulates before turning away from him to continue speaking with Zara.Lip readers\u0027 accounts of the conversation were inconclusive due to Harry turning his head to the side as he spoke to Meghan.At one point the couple appeared to be discussing the chapel, the same one they were wed in, as Harry said: \u0027Everything\u0027s different\u0027.To which Meghan snapped back: \u0027Yes, of course, that\u0027s the way.\u0027She then appeared to gesture with her hands at how full the venue was as she said: \u0027Fill up as much.\u0027But Body language expert Judi James noted their strained poses and facial expressions.She told Femail: \u0027Harry appears to be anxious and fidgety when they sit in their pew seats, rocking about and fiddling with the tails of his jacket.     Meghan gesticulates at her husband before turning away to speak with Zara Tindall\u0027Meghan looks calmer and politely sociable, chatting in a much more demure way to Zara in the seat in front.Harry starts to talk to her and she performs a subtle eye-dart to her left, a bit like a mother whose kid is trying to interrupt her grown up conversation. \u0027She turns to Harry and seems to have a slightly firmer conversation, raising her hands and then bringing them together and using a small head-baton gesture for emphasis.\u0027Meghan leans back towards Zara, resuming her polite social smile along with their conversation. \u0027Harry rubs his face, chews his lips and leans into the side of his seat like a child that has just been told to sit still.\u0027    Price reaches £1,000 for Eugenie wedding goodie bags containing £15 worth of treats including shortbread, magnet and biodegradable poncho being sold on eBayPrincess Eugenie\u0027s wedding goody bags - containing spoils such as shortbread, chocolate gold coins and ponchos - are being sold for as much as £1,000 online.As well as special memories, the 1,200 members of the public invited to celebrate in the grounds of Windsor Castle walked away with the bags containing £15 of treats.But while many of the guests at the royal nuptials were delighted with their luxurious maroon cotton souvenirs, others decided to cash in on the exclusive gift.             Prince Andrew looked a little tired this morning as he went for a ride at Windsor Castle after his daughter Princess Eugenie\u0027s star studded wedding bash, which went on until the early hours of the morning in the grounds of his home, The Royal Lodge             The Duke seemed fresh-faced while on his ride in the grounds in cool autumn air after the wedding of his daughter yesterday   The royal wedding\u0027s most glamorous guests?

How Princess Diana inspired royal wedding outfits worn by Kate Moss, the Duchess of Cambridge and Fergie\u0027s half-sister Princess Diana was a  style icon whose fashion choices are still admired 21 years after her death, so it\u0027s no wonder guests at Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding yesterday decided to take inspiration from her royal style book. Some of the looks were more of a subtle nod to Diana, whilst others near enough wore replicas of some of Diana’s most famous looks.Sarah Ferguson’s half-sister Eliza Ferguson near enough copied one of Diana’s classic Royal Ascot outfits, from the 1986 event in a green polka dot wrap dress with a matching hat, as Diana had in 1986.Meanwhile, the Duchess of Cambridge, Ellie Goulding and Holly Candy also seemed to give a nod to the late princess\u0027 iconic style with their outfits.      Fergie\u0027s half sister Eliza Ferguson (right) mirrored one of Diana\u0027s most famous looks from 1986, when she had worn a green dress to Royal Ascot (left)    Diana favoured the polka dot look and wore this black and white dress to a polo match in 1987 (left).

The loose fitting dress was belted, and the star paired the look with some dance floor-ready white heels.Princess Diana wore a similar dress in 1983, but had of course accessorised with a tiara. The princess had sported the David and Elizabeth Emanuel dress at a banquet in New Zealand.Former pop princess Holly Valance stunned the crowds in an elegant pink ensemble complete with a cute pair of gloves with bow detail.This dress was similar to an outfit Diana had worn in 1983 during a visit to Maitland, New South Wales Australia. The dress had been made by designer Catherine Walker.Aside from pop royalty, fashion royalty Kate Moss also jumped on the band wagon when she arrived wearing a demure polka dot two piece. Kate ditched her usual smoky eyed look and went for a more neutral palette to attend the ceremony at St George’s chapel.

I’d expected to be among, let’s face it, be-Union-Jacked fruitcakes and a few passing Japanese tourists for this, the wedding of a radiant but minor Royal.I can’t help but laugh when the woman next to me, Sheryl Arredondo, who arrived last night from Michigan and is sporting Union Jack nail polish, tells me the presenters on ITV have been debating how to pronounce the bride’s name: ‘Is it EUgenee or EuJANEee?’No one’s ever said it much, I tell her. I’m someone who has found it hard to distinguish Eugenie from her older sister, Beatrice.‘When I told my co-workers I was coming over for the wedding, they had no idea who she was,’ Sheryl says. ‘Until I said that Fergie’s her mum.’ So why on earth has she travelled all this way? ‘I’m 66. This might be the last Royal Wedding I get the chance to see.’As more people arrive, and ooh and aah at the castle, it becomes clear the reason we’re here is to be able to say we were part of history we were there.It’s not just another society knees-up, so many people – young and old – tell me: ‘The bride is the Queen’s granddaughter.’Even if we don’t know everything about her, there’s huge affection washing around, keeping us warm: ‘Eugenie is one of the quieter ones,’ admit Julie and Malcolm, now expats in Sydney. ‘We miss all this,’ they add, taking in the pomp and the pageantry. I meet Alexis and Sol, both 20, here from the US. ‘I love the fact Eugenie has a job!’ says Alexis.  All eyes were on actress Demi Moore, left, and singer Robbie Williams and wife Ayda FieldAs someone who is not just a little obsessed with celebrities, I keep brandishing my phone and pointing out to people in the crowd the latest star to have disembarked at the church. But, to my huge surprise, no one’s interested not even 25-year-olds Lewis and Sydney, here on a date. They only have eyes for the Windsors. ‘I think Kate looks tired,’ says a mum with a screaming toddler in a pushchair.As I bring up each famous face on my screen, my little group squints and grimaces. At Naomi Campbell: ‘Let’s hope no one p***es her off!’ At Cara Delevingne, who has turned up in top hat and tails: ‘Has no one told her, today isn’t all about you!’ At Ricky Martin, there’s a simple: ‘Why?’The most opprobrium comes from Rav Singh, a 57-year-old former IT worker, currently caring for his dad. He thinks the Royals who court celebs are playing a dangerous game.

If you’re photographed next to him, what does that say about you?’ I tell him Posh and Becks are a no-show, but that Jimmy Carr is here. ‘You see?’ he says. ‘Tax avoiders. They need to be careful. It looks like the Firm are fawning over famous people. They should stick to inviting European dignitaries, not models.’I counter that the British Royal Family has always courted the famous. Diana was friends with Elton John and Gianni Versace. Several women give me an ‘off with her head’ stare. No one is allowed to utter a bad word about Di. ‘She was always much more famous than anyone else,’ I’m told. ‘Eugenie is in danger of being eclipsed.’In fact, throughout the whole day, the only people I meet who are keen to glimpse James Blunt, say, or Robbie Williams – who turns up chewing gum! – is a group of horsey ladies, here rather noisily from the Cotswolds. ‘We went out to the farm shop where they were supposed to be uploading stars on to coaches, but we didn’t even see Ellie Goulding!’ Are they upset? ‘Nah! As long as we see Zara Phillips. We love her!’We watch the ceremony on someone else’s phone, as mine has died. As Eugenie says her vows, ‘I’m shedding a few tears,’ says a 50-year-old former PR who has dealt with her share of selfish, unruly pop stars. ‘It was so romantic and traditional. So English, with those rosy cheeks.’          MISCHIEF: Prince George and his cousin Savannah enjoying themselves at Eugenie\u0027s wedding          Prince George  reacts as he arrives with bridesmaids at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor CastleAs the ceremony draws to a close, everyone straightens and cranes for the moment the carriage containing the couple will flash past. Don’t we think Eugenie is making a bit too much fuss, I whisper to a woman from Wales.‘Every girl dreams of a fuss. She’s spent her life being carer to her parents, she deserves today. I hope they will be happy.’ My goodness, this crowd is generous. What about the £2 million spent on the police? ‘It’s less than was spent on Trump!’When at last the carriage passes the crowd, now four-deep but as bald as William’s head in places, I’m puzzled no great cheer goes up, just a weak titter.‘That’s because we were all taking photos on our phones,’ says a misty-eyed lady.Of course, the stars had been invited, and seemed thrilled, but they will have spent considerable time over the years grooming the young princes and princesses, slicking their own events with magisterial magic. They seem to think they are ‘better’ than the Royals, and by that I don’t just mean better looking.In church, most stars’ eyes swivelled towards Demi Moore, not the Queen. Celebrities always do as they please, too (which I doubt is a luxury Meghan can now enjoy), thinking rules don’t apply to them, which is why some sneakily posted on Instagram from inside the church. Whatever happened to respect?The other wedding that took place on Friday morning was one between celebrity and Royalty. It was a marriage of convenience, one guaranteed to reap the most coverage and viewers, but where will it lead?It implies, with the positioning of the gum-smacking Robbie Williams and his wife so near the Queen, that the famous and the Royals are equal. That they belong to the same club. The one that digs up basements and annoys neighbours, lives in faux Georgian mansions, has affairs and runs out of money. This young batch of Royals (‘they are so good for PR,’ one 55-year-old woman proudly wearing a £5 Eugenie and Jack scarf tells me) have only just got the Firm back on track. Let’s not derail it now.          Even the choice of car to carry the couple from the reception – an Aston Martin made for the James Bond film Spectre – pays homage to fictionThe Royal Family are different, and if they’re not, then why are we paying for them? If Euge! and Jack are no better than Posh and Becks, why should we revere them and wave to them in glass carriages? We will turn into America, where money, not history or duty, rules.I’m sure the Queen has famous friends, but I doubt they snort coke. I wonder, too, at Beatrice’s choice of reading, from The Great Gatsby. It’s a book about spoilt, rich, empty idiots who destroy everything and trample over everyone around them. That’s not the Royal Family. That’s Hollywood.Even the choice of car to carry the couple from the reception – an Aston Martin made for the James Bond film Spectre – pays homage to fiction. There’s a danger the bona fide glamour of the Royals will be tarnished by this constant clamouring for the faux. They will become a chimera, as easy to erase as a Pixar cartoon.Oh, and by the way, Williams was no longer chewing when he emerged after the ceremony.

And the medium is the message in the exquisite weft and warp of Bauhaus weaver Anni AlbersOskar Kokoschka fell in love with the composer Alma Mahler in 1912. When she left him after three years of jealousy, he had her recreated as a life-size mannequin. Kokoschka lived with this doll for years, stroking its fur-covered body, taking it to parties and eventually chopping off its head in a rage. But he couldn’t kill the real woman, her memory resurgent in many tortured drawings and paintings.Even one of which would have been a valuable, not to say vital, exhibit at the Barbican Art Gallery. But instead we are presented with a couple of fans clumsily painted for her as a present. Kokoschka, Mahler and their relationship are despatched in a summary wall text and some dubious souvenirs. And that, alas, is how the show goes.Modern Couples is a staggeringly ambitious anthology, taking in nearly 50 avant-garde couples, from the inevitable – Ben Nicholson and Barbara Hepworth, Robert and Sonia Delaunay, Pablo Picasso and Dora Maar – to less familiar figures, including the Czech artists Toyen and Jindřich Štyrský, whose enthusiastically pornographic drawings are shown in a curtained side room. But it cannot decide what to do with all these names. There are tales of three-ways, intimate jottings and any number of fervid letters, but much less in the way of looking. The show cannot decide between art and biography.The premise is collaboration the agenda equality, especially between male and female artists. This is easy to see in the terrific partnership of the Russian constructivists Alexander Rodchenko and Varvara Stepanova, all their heartfelt graphic genius bent to a revolutionary purpose. But it is quite a stretch in the case of Picasso and Maar. She is the model for several paintings, notably Weeping Woman, and she photographed him adoringly many times. But there is no real parity, and the idea of collaboration is hardly supported here by a shot of his face over which she has scribbled a lion’s mane, or a flaming halo (is anybody even sure?).The creative collaboration between Marcel Duchamp and the sculptor Maria Martins seems even more tenuous, unless you count the casts he made of her genitals. Their seven-year affair was clandestine, as Martins was the upper-crust wife of the Brazilian ambassador to New York. Only one of her overwrought sculptures is on show. But his bronze and plaster casts of her perineum now seem far more fetishistic: objects for Duchamp to grasp in the hand and fondle.I wish I hadn’t seen Lee Miller posing as a naked murder victim for Man Ray’s camera, or submissive in a metal collar and their S\u0026ampM movie is a shocker. Though for sheer viciousness, nothing in this show compares with Miller’s own photograph of two severed breasts from a hospital mastectomy served up like liver on a plate.Miller’s own bare breasts are, of course, famous – photographed, painted and sculpted by more than one lover. Any amount of space is taken up here, predictably, by the surrealists and their sex games. The women are naked, the men always dressed it’s one long Déjeuner sur l’herbe. And while the works of surrealists Leonora Carrington and her lover Max Ernst are given equal prominence in this show, as they should, the choice of Carrington’s self-portrait as a frozen white horse feels sad and bathetic. She is a Disney ice sculpture to Ernst’s wizard in furs, coming along to melt her.Still, they get more space than Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, whose tumultuous history as lovers and collaborators – which would make a whole show in itself, given their mutual belief in an art for the people, and an autobiographical art at that – is restricted to two small works and a cursory text. The organisers might just as well have mentioned their names on the wall and left it at that.Which is more or less the case with Lilly Reich and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. It’s obvious that their celebrated German Pavilion for the 1929 Exposition can’t be recreated here, but just a couple of lines and one Barcelona chair?With so many couples to get through, there is no room for exploration and no pause for thought. Yet even in these conditions the choices are odd. Tamara de Lempicka is here – partnerless – because she once painted a pair of tubular belles thought mildly Sapphic. Dalí and Lorca are partnered, though a homosexual relationship is at best speculation. Toyen and Štyrský didn’t even have an affair.Art comes to the fore mainly when the budget permits. So there is a perfectly condensed retrospective of Claude Cahun’s eerie self-photographs from Jersey, and gorgeous loans of various artists from St Ives. The Delaunays’ exultant abstractions are beautifully presented – and readily available: this show is a co-production with the Centre Pompidou Metz – so that one sees how their ideas merge, their colours communicate and the brush of one painter seems to pick up (like sentences) from the other.But this is a serene marriage with little strife to discuss. So on we go to Edward Weston’s complex relationships with fellow photographers Margrethe Mather and Tina Modotti. There might have been some fruitful consideration of mutual influence here: who actually held the camera, for instance? But photography dominates in any case. Painters, writers, musicians, sculptors: they all photograph one another too. It’s the one sure convergence between art and biography.Modern Couples has dramatic discoveries – the wild costume-cum-sculptures of German artists Lavinia Schulz and Walter Holdt, which might have been choreographed into an antic film had she not shot him, and then herself, in 1924. But the experience is of some garrulously overcrowded party in which no one can hear themselves speak. The nadir is a room of paintings by Kandinsky, his lover and two fellow artists so garishly mediocre they might not ordinarily be reunited except that they were, literally, painted at a house party.Anni and Josef Albers, Bauhaus weaver and painter, are a surprising omission from this show, given their great and mutual experiments with colour. But Tate Modern is giving Anni Albers (1899-1994) the retrospective she has long deserved. This is a stunning exhibition, from its first black-and-white abstraction, the silk warp and weft performing shimmering shifts of tone in variegated squares, to its last room full of fizzing three- and four-colour weavings where the eye can scarcely see how the wool is making its enthralling journeys above, between, below and round the vertical warp.Albers is a revolutionary with a handloom, using this mechanical device, so simple and ancient, to make avant-garde art. She worked with jute, tissue paper and cellophane to create scintillating silver fields with cellophane and cotton to weave cloth of gold. Fine cotton and thick raffia, white and green, suggest snow-covered pastures. And in one magnificent work, the size of a billboard, she magically implies dying red light infusing a landscape of black trees at sunset. This is hard enough to achieve with paint, never mind the geometry of interwoven wool.And this is a different kind of art in every respect, or at least Albers makes it so. She also worked with conventional tapestry looms, but not, like so many weavers, to produce pictures, patterns or textile hangings. She is always reflecting on the medium itself. A Lurex thread, coming and going through black wool variations, implicitly compares weaving to the movement of a tiger through darkness. There are analogies with drawing, dancing and music, especially in her rhymes’ notations. But most exquisite are the works that simply speak of colour and light – a field of flickering scarlet stitches, like tiny flames, and, most exhilarating of all, bubbles of pure colour that appear to rise in the airy brilliance of her warp.Star ratings (out of five)Modern Couples ★★Anni Albers ★★★★★• Modern Couples: Art, Intimacy and the Avant-garde is at the Barbican Art Gallery, London, until 27 January• Anni Albers is at Tate Modern, London, until 27 January"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03502c3f01f95bcde9868d4758376d5db0b3998b/0_1876_3382_2029/master/3382.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2ff1245c0ec66cb1099a25d0a539ee0","title":"new takes human condition photographers pick new photographers tom hunter dayanita singh alec soth","story":"Alec Soth, Dayanita Singh, Tom Hunter, Takashi Homma and Vanessa Winship choose new names to watch – from an artist who’s ripping female portraiture apart, to a Japanese observer of German society and a slum-dweller turned Delhi archivistby  Kathryn Bromwich,  Killian Fox,  Nosheen Iqbal and  Kate Kellaway“It’s a publisher’s idea of hell,” laughs Tom Hunter, the renowned British artist-photographer best known for his staged tableaux referencing old master paintings. He’s talking about Lacuna, an extraordinary new photography book by 25-year-old Londoner Katie Bret Day. “Usually, photographers try to make books as cheaply as possible, as many as possible, then get rid of them and make a profit. Whereas she’s hand-stitching all these things together, hand-printing every picture. When you pick it up, you’re really intrigued by it: what is this? It breaks all the conventions. It sets up a whole new language.”Bret Day brings along a copy of Lacuna – one of just 50 – when we meet at a cafe in Hackney. It’s a busy week for her. She’s getting ready for a show at Photofusion gallery in Brixton, south London, her biggest to date, and has recently got back from Switzerland, where she was artist-in-residence at the Institut Le Rosey for a year. Meanwhile, she’s about to start a photography MA at the Royal College of Art, continuing a fascination that began when she first picked up a camera at the age of 10.“Man Ray is the obvious one,” she says when I ask about her influences. “He was one of the triggers for me getting into the darkroom and thinking: this is so cool, it’s way more than just clicking the shutter.” The darkroom remains a central part of Bret Day’s practice – she’s fascinated by what happens when traditional printing methods are brought to bear on photographs that are taken digitally. Much of this she does at home, with basic developing kit and a blackout blind. “I really like being able to have an idea and execute it immediately,” she says. “And also not having to go out and spend a fortune.”Hunter, who taught Bret Day at London College of Communication, is impressed by her approach. “Katie’s part of that generation that’s bored of Photoshop, that wants to get their hands dirty and really explore the medium for themselves, not just touching buttons on a screen,” he says.Lacuna has taken her more than a year to put together and, flicking through it, I begin to appreciate why. This is no straightforward collection of photographs: the materiality of the text is just as important as the images. The first thing you notice is the variety of surfaces Bret Day has used, including tracing-paper, mirrors and sheets of acetate, which can be lifted to reveal a variant image underneath.On one page, a partial image of a face – Bret Day’s own – is meshed with thick scar-like lines, as if the photograph has been torn up and reassembled to accentuate the ruptures. “This is printed on an emulsion-coated acetate with watercolours added on top,” she says. The lines across the face could be seen as a net, conveying an idea of entrapment – a recurring theme in the book – or, Bret Day suggests, you could view them as human cells, a reminder of “how we’re made up of many different things”.She’s fascinated by human physicality, and her photographs have a visceral quality that can be quite unsettling. When it came to shooting Lacuna, which is full of disembodied heads and headless torsos, she used the closest model to hand: herself. “At university, I became aware of what it means to be photographing other women and what it means to be a woman photographer,” she says. “By using myself, I’m trying to gain complete control of that gaze, that body, that image. It strengthens my voice.”“She’s exploring her sexuality and body image but she’s doing it for the female gaze,” says Hunter. “She’s not letting men tell her how to present herself. Some of the pictures are incredibly beautiful, almost sexual, but at the same time they’re really disturbing. She’s ripping the sugary gloss off female portraiture.” Killian FoxInterventions \u0026amp Interruptions, a group show featuring work by Katie Bret Day, is at Photofusion, London until 16 NovEven Mayank Austen Soofi’s name is an “art work”, enthuses the acclaimed photographer Dayanita Singh, as she praises the 38-year-old photographerwriter (aka thedelhiwalla) who has made Delhi his subject on Instagram – his sympathetic, witty posts (topping 20,000) as regular as daily bread. “Ask him about his name,” she urges.“Mayank means ‘moon’ in Sanskrit,” he begins. “It is the name my parents gave me.”His childhood was privileged, his father a government engineer who worked all over Uttar Pradesh. Everyone in his family proved engineer material except Mayank himself (who still wakes “in a sweat” dreaming of maths lessons). Rebelling against his family’s expectations, he found work as a waiter at the Radisson Blu in Delhi and lived in a slum behind the hotel. That was 12 years ago, and a desperate time – he was close to suicidal.But then, in 2007, Mayank started a blog: his first picture was of a funeral procession “from old Delhi to a new part of the city” in mid-winter. It was a moment in which “nothing happened, yet so many things did”. He was “very moved” to witness the final journey of a stranger, and caught the horse-driven cortege on camera. Taking photographs is “like reading”, he says: you see the story.Austen, the second part of his name, is a homage: “because of my love for Jane”. Literature, he says, saved – saves – him: “Books give you joy and oxygen.” Other literary idols include Emily Dickinson and Marcel Proust. But it is to a living novelist, Arundhati Roy, that he is most indebted – his cover photo for her bestseller The Ministry of Utmost Happiness, of a white marble grave with faded rose and dead fly as ornaments, was his first conspicuous coup. The day we speak, he is celebrating the appearance of his portrait of Arundhati Roy on her next book, My Seditious Heart.Singh – best known for her beautiful photo-books exploring the poetic possibilities of sequencing – makes huge claims for Soofi, believing he is redefining photography itself: “He is blurring the lines of what we think of as a photograph – more than he realises. He is Delhi’s self-appointed archivist.”Every day he takes numerous photographs – images of every section of society –on his iPhone8 Plus and often uploads them directly onto Instagram with captions. Today, his pictures include a man sleeping on his hands and on his flip-flops a ragged, flowery sofa he playfully suggests might have belonged to Emily Dickinson a little Indian girl, pensively grooming a Barbie doll, captioned Her Experiments with the Caucasian World. As Singh observes: “You never feel he is sneaking up on people there is always a connection.” What makes him original is, in part, that his hyperlocal narrative is ongoing, unending. It is missing the point, Singh argues, to single out particular works to praise.Soofi’s work is characterised by such affectionate, humorous solidarity that it comes as a surprise when he declares Delhi to be a “terrible” city. “I walk in the early morning and late into the night. You pass through many continents in a single day, you see all aspects of the street and its inequalities.” As we discuss one image, The Hawker of Other People’s Happiness, of a street trader standing stoically with a bicycle loaded with hessian bags and a handful of red, yellow and lime-green helium balloons above his head, he says the city is full of people who do not choose what they do.Soofi himself is not among their number. Every day, he writes a story about Delhi for Hindustan Times (“I don’t know who gets space like this!” Singh exclaims). He worries that the stories might dry up, but they never do. Nor does he: his engaged, engaging torrent of talk is as beguiling as his writing. He is not ambitious, yet when the server for his blog temporarily crashed, in 2015, he found it “tragic, like losing a close friend”.He enjoys Delhi’s literary mafia, comparing its “bitchy gossip” to a Proustian salon, but remains apart from it. He is, Singh implies, an independent spirit. And that brings us to his last name, Soofi.“I love the Sufi shrine in Delhi of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya, a 14-century saint. I feel at home when I lounge in its courtyard.”For Mayank Austen Soofi is street-spiritual as well as funny, engaging and wise. Kate KellawayMayank Austen Soofi will appear in an exhibition curated by the artist Subodh Gupta, featuring 10 artists from across the world, as part of the Serendipity Arts Festival, 15-22 December, Panaji, GoaPop culture hasn’t traditionally been kind to the American midwest. Lacking the romantic grit of New York and the light-dappled glamour of Los Angeles, the vast expanse of country from Ohio to Nebraska often gets a raw deal, lumped together as a homogenous bloc of flyover states synonymous with rural conservatism and Roseanne Barr.“There are a lot of preconceptions about the midwest,” says Nathaniel Grann, “which is crazy because it’s so huge.” The 28-year-old photographer grew up “in the middle of nowhere” in Minnesota and his beautifully understated photography project Midwest Sentimental serves as both an exploration of the notion of family – quiet domestic dramas, compelling portraits of his own parents – and an affirmation of what that means in small-town America.“I’ve always been fascinated by folklore,” says Grann, going on to explain the appeal of Minnesota’s folk hero lumberjack Paul Bunyan as analogous to his own work. “Even though it ends up being a myth, it’s also very much a type of self-fulfilling prophesy.”In the case of Midwest Sentimental, which Grann shot on film over three years, nostalgia creeps through in both the set-ups and the style: a cousin’s “man cave” accented with deer heads, a bulky TV flashing grey fuzz, Grann’s father snoozing on a velvet La-Z-Boy.Alec Soth, the revered American photographer and fellow Minnesota native who made his name with his 2004 book Sleeping by the Mississippi, was drawn to Grann’s eye for “subverting banal cliche” and rendering it “compelling, quiet – it’s understated but it works hard”. The pair met when Soth visited the University of Hartford in Connecticut, where Grann was studying, as a guest lecturer on the photography MFA. Soth, much like the late photojournalist Michel du Cille, who hired Grann as a picture editor when he was director of photography at the Washington Post, has been key to encouraging him to pursue his ambition.Grann shot more than 6,500 photos for Midwestern Sentimental, of which 36 made the final edit for the book. “My stepmom first taught me to use a camera when I was around nine,” he says. “She was a nature photographer she got me interested and I would use her Nikon F4.” In high school, Grann developed a thing about war photographers – “I very much had that activist notion of how photos can change the world” – but it was time studying at the Danish School of Media and Journalism in Aarhus that proved the real “gamechanger” for him.The Danish experience inspired him to slow down, which became essential to the tone and “a lot of the self-reflection” that came from spending three years observing and shooting his own family.“One of my approaches was staged portraits, which, clearly, are give-and-take situations with family members.” Patience and understanding were needed on both sides of the camera to make his images work. “I have a very early memory of my mother in a fur coat and of her carrying me in it through the snow, but my take on that coat was completely different from my mother’s. She remembered it as a leftover from the end of her orce.”Grann’s parents both remarried and the elements of his blended families have become central to his work. Eighteen months ago, he moved to Los Angeles and has been working in the day as a picture editor. “I always joked the project would only come to an end when I moved out of my mom’s basement,” he laughs. “But there is something to be said about the perpetual summer of California.” Nosheen IqbalPhoebe Kiely is at a “weird crossroads” in her life. The 27-year-old photographer from rural Lincolnshire quit her retail job in Manchester in June, moved away from the city and has since been travelling. During this time she has photographed Glasgow, Verona, Sicily (“I wanted to be by the water”), and is now stationed in Budapest until the end of the year, where she is relishing the city’s green spaces and pastel colours.Before this odyssey, Kiely’s subjects were rather more monochrome: her first book, They Were My Landscape, published in May by MACK, is a collection of elegiac black-and-white photographs, named after a quote in Sylvia Plath’s The Bell Jar. They capture a range of urban scenes – a young man smoking at a bus stop, cracked concrete walls, a decomposing pigeon – alongside more lyrical compositions: a delicate swan the sea’s gleaming waves a silver birch tree emerging from the darkness. The thread running through these images is Kiely’s eye for chiaroscuro, which imbues the images with contrast and drama.“It’s all very instinctual,” she says. “Something aligns – whether it’s light, shade, pitch. If I walk down a street today and the sun is incredibly bright, there are certain images I’d take, and on a gloomy day, if I walk down the same street, I’d probably take completely different images, but they would still be, hopefully, as valid as each other.” So far her eye has served her well: Kiely graduated from Manchester School of Art in 2015, and in quick succession was exhibited at Liverpool’s Open Eye gallery, included in the British Journal of Photography’s 2016 Portrait of Britain exhibition and nominated for MACK’s First Book award.Kiely was 14 when she got her first camera, a cheap digital device from Aldi, and although she never considered photography as a career – “I didn’t know it could be, I didn’t really know any photographers” – taking photos became a compulsion. While staying at her parents’ this summer she found an old diary where she had written about wanting to exhibit her work at the village gallery. “I’d never even been to a photography show at that point,” she says, “but I knew that was the dream, to have a show, which would have been atrocious probably. But it’s something that’s embedded in me. Photography is the first thing I think of when I wake up it’s the last thing I think of. It sounds terrible – it’s doomed all my previous relationships. It’s all-consuming.”For this feature, the acclaimed British documentary photographer Vanessa Winship – who won the 2011 Henri Cartier-Bresson award and had her first major UK show this summer at London’s Barbican Art Gallery – singled out Kiely for the beauty and simplicity of her work. “It feels thoughtful, and we need thoughtful work,” says Winship. “It doesn’t feel like it’s following a trend. It’s work that asks questions, I believe, about who we are, who she is. It describes a state of being which feels very relevant in Britain today: a quiet disquiet.” Another thing that attracted Winship to Kiely’s work was that, when she saw a few of her photos in a studio, she recognised them straight away as prints developed in a darkroom.The darkroom is an important part of the process for Kiely, although the first time she used film at university she felt terrified: “I remember being so scared of the pictures not coming out, of the film getting wrecked. There are so many possibilities of things going wrong with film and, to an extent, I’m still scared of that. But that’s probably the magic of it.” When she was living in Manchester she processed the prints herself now the building has been knocked down, and on her travels she has to rely on others. Despite this, she’s unlikely to go back to digital. “It’s just not the same: there are so many digital images and I don’t personally want to contribute to that.”Other aspects of Kiely’s work, though, are still evolving. After her beloved Hasselblad camera broke she switched to a Yashica and is now exploring new European vistas with an expanded colour palette. “I don’t want to be known for just one body of work,” she says. “I was tired of Manchester – I needed a clear break. I purposefully wanted to go somewhere I’d never been, somewhere completely new and foreign to me. It’s a complete change-up.” Kathryn BromwichOn a Sunday night in August 2011, photography student Hayahisa Tomiyasu saw a fox sniffing around a lawn in Leipzig, Germany. It relieved itself, turned around, and stared at him before walking off. In the next few days, Tomiyasu searched for it in vain, until one day he looked out of his dormitory window and saw the fox passing by a ping-pong table. He never saw the fox again instead, he turned his attention to the ping-pong table.Over the following five years, Tomiyasu kept his eye – and his camera – on the table, photographing passersby and social gatherings around it. People occasionally played table-tennis there, but that wasn’t what he was looking for. He wanted to find the object’s potential. “It shows how many possibilities the table has in itself, which you don’t know before you see it,” he says. “I’m interested in photographing an object you see every day, and how people behave around that object in a public space.”Slowly, the project took over his life. “It was very strange – most things seemed to happen if I had something to do. If I was going out and people came to the ping-pong table, often I had to cancel my appointment. I tried to be there always, every day, also at Christmas and New Year, to not miss what was happening.” He amassed a prodigious number of images: perhaps 4,000.The project turned into a book, TTP – or Tischtennisplatte, German for ping-pong table – released earlier this year and winner of the prestigious 2018 MACK First Book award. The renowned Japanese photographer Takashi Homma, whose highly influential book Tokyo Suburbia was published in 1998, nominated Tomiyasu for this feature. Homma says: “I’m interested in fixed-point photography because I’m also doing that. Hayahisa Tomiyasu does the best fixed-point observation I have ever seen – I’m jealous.”What Tomiyasu discovered with TTP was that people can be creative. In the book, two shirtless teenage boys box each other as a long-haired girl looks on, transfixed. A man does his washing in a bucket on the table, his shirts and blankets drying on a nearby railing. Various nappies are changed. Two girls have a night-time picnic. A child sits on the table, alone, a toy gun cradled to his face. In the dark, a man naked except for his socks and shoes squats on the table, a beer bottle perched precariously at his side.Another motivation for the project was cultural observation. As a Japanese student living in Germany, Tomiyasu found it difficult to learn the country’s social codes. “I was living in a student dorm where we didn’t talk to each other often, not even a greeting. So, as a foreigner, it gave me a way to understand how people think and behave. For me, it was: ‘Ah, OK, yeah.’”Brought up in Chigasaki, Tomiyasu originally wanted to become a professional footballer: he trained intensely every day until, aged 18, he turned his attentions to his secondary interest, photography. He studied in Tokyo, then an exhibition made him fall in love with German contemporary photography. “What fascinated me was that it was another approach to reality. The eye for German photography is sometimes – in a positive way – cold, objective. Many photographs in Japan are taken in a private room, from a private point of view, and therefore very subjective.”He moved to Leipzig in 2008, partly to study in the class of Peter Piller, whose archive-based work influenced his own. Now 36, Tomiyasu lives in Zurich and is working on a street photography series looking at objects that people have thrown away.On one of the last pages of TTP, a photograph seems to cast a new light on everything before it: a couple are seated on the table, and the man appears to be pointing towards the camera. Did people know the camera was there? Were they putting on a show? But they didn’t know, says Tomiyasu: the image was placed there to stimulate debate about voyeurism, performance and artifice. The sequence of images in the book suggests a narrative of sorts, moving through the seasons, finding meaning in juxtaposition and contrast.“I arranged the book according to association, to similarities,” he says. “I did not order it chronologically but like a tale: I wanted to see if you could create a small history out of reality. It’s not a normal photo book, but like a novel that you can read.” Kathryn Bromwich"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64e3c57d85368a5290e26abbc38b16da0c2ad1f7/0_259_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc113dcac2bd29f2a9c905f4e085c4e4","title":"british brutalist buildings in pictures","story":"The postwar years, says photographer Rob Clayton, were a unique period for architecture in Britain.

One customer who bought £380 of goods has found himself in a similar ordeal to the thousands of unhappy customers who lost out when the “old” company went into administration.Harps Singh, from Birmingham, paid £380 for three pairs of designer jeans in late September, just days after the store relaunched its website. They arrived as expected, but as they were not suitable he decided to return them.He presumed his parcel would be accepted back and his £380 refunded. But he has been told by Royal Mail that it is among the thousands of other parcels stacked up in a Wellingborough warehouse full of goods returned by customers of the “old” House of Fraser, which the company is refusing to refund.His repeated requests that his refund be processed have drawn no response. He has been told he can’t return the items to a store, as staff have been told not to process web-order refunds.Singh must have been one of the first people to use the relaunched website, which was offline for about a month after Sports Direct’s Mike Ashley’s controversial buyout. At the time, Ashley pledged the store would become “the Harrods of the high street”.Singh says: “I’d always been a happy House of Fraser customer, and fortunately wasn’t one of those caught up in the collapse. I was happy to pay the new delivery charges because it meant I didn’t have to go shopping, but now I discover my returned items can’t be found among a sea of parcels.“No one can tell me what’s going on – it’s ridiculous. I certainly won’t be ordering again any time soon, and others who were thinking of doing the same need to be aware of what’s going on there.”The original department store’s £1bn collapse left thousands of consumers out of pocket. Many had placed orders for items that were not delivered, and unwittingly became creditors of the old company.The Observer understands that there may be better news for the 25,000 holders of the original House of Fraser gift cards.After the takeover, House of Fraser asked card holders to send in their cards, promising a replacement. Some of these have also been returned unopened, and most customers assumed they had lost their money – in some cases as much as £750. This week, it emerged that some customers have received letters telling them they will be issued with replacement e-vouchers that will be valid until 31 January 2019. Further gift cards can be sent back until Wednesday 31 October, it states. The company has, typically, made no formal statement.Signs in stores state that the company is only accepting Post Office, One4all gift cards and House of Fraser reward vouchers.Furious customers have taken to social media to vent their frustration at the lack of information. Several longstanding clients have had enough and promised they will never shop in the chain again.The company had originally promised to refund customers who had online orders cancelled and then reneged on that offer. Last week, the firm’s former directors and senior managers were sacked.Yvonne Fovargue MP, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on consumer protection, says the debacle has demonstrated the need for a consumer ombudsman with “real teeth”. She adds: “Mike Ashley made a number of promises to customers when he bought the business last month, and these should be honoured. He certainly has a legal duty to fulfil, or at least refund, orders placed since he took over. His silence here is unacceptable.”When contacted by the Observer, House of Fraser told us: “Our website is now functioning normally and we are not aware of any significant backlog of returns relating to orders made after 10 August. If customers experience any isolated issues, we recommend they contact customer services in the normal way.”A House of Fraser customer who paid the last instalment on a £1,280 sofa on the day the company collapsed – and was told he’d lost his money – has described his shock at being called last week by the store and asked if he wanted to buy the sofa they’d refused to supply for a discounted £750.James Mohan was told he would have to join the long queue of creditors with only the slimmest chance of seeing any of his money again. When his wife gave birth to their first child there was no sofa to sit on and no money to buy another.“The salesman told me they had called other customers and the majority of people do actually repurchase an item they have already paid for,” he says. “It seems a despicable way to do business.”Mohan was lucky in that he had paid the final £6 instalment with his Asda credit card. This enabled him to claim the £1,280 back from the card provider – Creation Financial Services – using section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. House of Fraser denied it had been calling customers in this way and said the call must have come from a supplier “who was tying to be helpful”.Anna Tims"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a619380532d67ddba216b3c0ca070ce7475cf91d/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c14db0e4c1e8dc64913b1e7dfee801b0","title":"britain must hold saudis to account for jamal khashoggi emily thornberry","story":"Imagine how this government would have reacted if last weekend either Russia or Iran had abducted – and in all likelihood murdered – one of their dissident journalists within the sovereign territory of another country.In fact, we do not need to imagine it. We need only look back five months to the faked assassination of the Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko on the streets of Kiev. It took the then foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, less than 24 hours to issue an official statement not only saying how appalled he was, but leaving no doubt that the Russian state was responsible and saying it must be held to account.Roll forward to the disappearance of the Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi from his country’s consulate in Istanbul. From the time he went missing on 2 October, it took Johnson’s successor, Jeremy Hunt, seven days to issue a tweet saying he was seeking urgent answers from the Saudi authorities, and that “if media reports prove correct, the government will treat the incident seriously”.That is the definition of far too little, far too late. But that is the pattern when it comes to this government’s relationship with the current Saudi regime, led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, so feted and fawned over by Theresa May when he visited the UK this summer. And yet this man is the architect of the war in Yemen, directly responsible for the deaths of thousands of civilians as a result of airstrikes and humanitarian blockades, including the dozens of children killed on their school bus in August, someone who, by any reasonable standards, should be the subject of an investigation for crimes against international humanitarian law.He presides over what is projected to be the biggest year of beheadings in Saudi Arabia’s history, including forcing those brutal executions on women and men simply for protesting for greater civil, political and religious freedoms. He is the prince so sensitive to criticism that he is forcing through a law that will punish any inidual distributing satire on social media that “mocks, provokes or disrupts public order, religious values and public morals”, with prison sentences of up to five years and fines of up to £623,000.And he is the so-called diplomatic genius who last year lured the prime minister of Lebanon to Riyadh on the pretext of taking a bonding camping trip, then had him beaten up and paraded in front of the cameras to make a forced televised resignation, thankfully later rescinded.This man has no respect for human rights, no respect for the rule of law and no respect for territorial boundaries, so is it any wonder so many commentators are convinced he had no hesitation in ordering the abduction and murder of Khashoggi? And yet this government apparently urges us to forget all of that because Bin Salman has committed himself to allowing women in Saudi Arabia to have the right to drive their own cars. And, more importantly, as far as it is concerned, he will give us a good trade deal after Brexit so we can continue exporting the arms he is using to prosecute his brutal war against the people of Yemen.Well, I am not having it, the Labour party is not having it and I don’t think the British people are having it either. We should not be in league with a brutal dictatorship that beheads its own citizens for standing up for their rights, which rains down airstrikes on civilian areas in Yemen with no concern for innocent children, and that thinks it can assassinate dissident journalists in other countries with impunity. We must apply the same standards to countries such as Saudi Arabia, Israel and Egypt that we apply to Iran, Russia and Syria.Where any of them abuse human rights and breach international humanitarian law, we must be prepared to call it out in the same measure, rather than treating it as one rule for our supposed friends and another for our supposed enemies.When Robin Cook set out to apply an “ethical dimension” to British foreign policy just over 20 years ago, it was arms sales to countries in the Middle East that he had in mind and when he was forced to drop that policy a few years later, to his great sadness, it was in part as a result of pressure over the impact on exports to Saudi Arabia.The next Labour government, under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, will not make that compromise. It is time to end Britain’s blind spot on Saudi Arabia until Saudi Arabia is genuinely ready to change its ways.• Emily Thornberry is shadow secretary of state for foreign and Commonwealth affairs"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bfba946b166e255f8a32236a4547a122ec26e89/0_84_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb8f6bfed06504a5d7e425ea8e60fca4","title":"universal credit hardship tories","story":"Loading the burden of austerity on to low-income parents and their children is morally reprehensibleIf a political party were to stand today on a platform of cutting financial support for low- and middle-income parents in order to pay for tax cuts for the more affluent, it wouldn’t get elected. It’s this reality that explains the paradox at the heart of modern British conservatism. Tory prime ministers and chancellors since 2010 have insisted they understand the struggle many families face in a time of anaemic wage growth and rising prices, and have promised that these families will be relatively protected from the deep spending cuts they have wielded.But their deeds betray their words: every independent analysis of budgets since 2010 shows such promises to be lies. By 2021, Conservative chancellors will have delivered more than £80bn of tax cuts a year, including £22bn a year in income tax cuts. The bulk of the proceeds have found their way into the pockets of the most affluent half of families. Meanwhile, billions of planned cuts to tax credits and benefits mean low-income families and disabled people stand to lose eye-watering sums. The poorest fifth of families with children will, by 2020, be more than £3,000 a year worse off on average as a result of tax and benefit changes since 2010, while some of the most affluent families with children will find themselves £500 a year richer.And it’s in the crosshairs of this great Tory redistribution, from the struggling-to-get-by to the comfortably affluent, that the government’s flagship benefit reform has got caught up. Universal credit, which combines six existing benefits into one new one, had two original aims. First, to simplify a horribly complicated system in which people could be in receipt of several different benefits at the same time, administered by different government agencies and means-tested in different ways, which made it almost impossible for anyone to work out what they were entitled to.The second aim was to improve people’s incentives to increase their earnings. In the old system, a minority of people on benefits saw their income increase by less than 10p for every extra pound they earned, as a result of multiple benefits being withdrawn simultaneously as their earnings increased. By being more generous – by withdrawing benefits more slowly as people’s earnings increase – universal credit was supposed to fix this.The much-delayed rollout of universal credit has also been plagued by serious design flaws and implementation problems. The six-week delay between making an application and receiving a first payment has pushed huge numbers of families into debt and rent arrears, with many people fearing they would be made homeless as a result.Such a significant benefit reform was never going to go completely smoothly, but a staged rollout over several years should have provided the opportunity for the teething problems that have caused huge hardship to have been swiftly fixed. Instead, it has taken the government years to reduce the six-week wait to five, despite repeated and insistent warnings about its pernicious effects. There are many other issues on which it has been utterly unresponsive, including the heavy administrative burden it puts on applicants, with punishing financial consequences if they get things even slightly wrong.Claims by former Conservative ministers that universal credit could be a poll tax moment may seem like hyperbole. But John Major is right. Around a million households are currently in receipt of universal credit, but by 2023, when full rollout is complete, it will be 7 million, including more than half of all families with children. Not only is it wrong-headed to make millions of families thousands of pounds a year worse off while delivering tax breaks that largely benefit the more affluent, it is politically crazy.The National Audit Office is right that it is too late to drop universal credit – turning the clock back would be hugely complex and expensive. But it urgently needs a massive cash boost, funded by halting the further unnecessary income tax cuts planned in the next few years and a redesign to ensure it works with the ebb and flow of real-world lives.Tory chancellors have repeatedly refused to change tack in the face of arguments that loading the burden of austerity on to low-income parents and their children is morally reprehensible. We can only hope that the fact it increasingly runs counter to their political self-interest will be what saves millions of families from this cruel, government-imposed hardship."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e3be3fdc39607b22b71b6329c2a4412abb77c12/0_588_7206_4324/master/7206.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5dc68ea7629a0d3c63d1cb2443de0ab","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"A rhinoceros hornbill and a white moray eel are among this week’s pick of images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca454fbc7faf6cbac3e9c07e40f126760c1e4198/382_358_4323_2594/master/4323.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0af1bae9d30f7b77ab4b572f0b98592","title":"makeup for men beauty trend","story":"Tom Ford and Chanel have launched male cosmetics, and foundation is the norm on TV shows from Love Island to Bodyguard. But does a bit of eyeliner work for everyone? One writer put it to the test…I’m looking at the man in the mirror. And he looks great, to be honest. It’s how I feel I should look, when I am at my most optimistic. There’s a smooth sheen across my cheeks. My eyes are bright, my brows orderly.Women know, obviously. For the last century, makeup has been mostly the preserve of just half the population. Even as society has become more feminist, and less ruled by gender binaries, women’s cosmetics use has become even more prolific, while men have continued to go au naturel, occasionally boshing on a bit of moisturiser and hoping for the best.But that may be changing, as brands from Chanel to Tom Ford launch male cosmetics lines, which is why I’ve asked for a makeover. My “before” photos leave no doubt as to where the disaster zones are. I’m youngish, but the skin under my beard is parched, there are red blotches across my face equator, my squinty eyes are sunken and there’s lots of white flakiness in the deep valleys between the shaft of my nose and the foothills of my nostrils.My new “natural” look involves about 11 different products. The first round of five or so I recognise: toners, moisturisers, a calming face mist. Nothing girly about that, I think. This is just skincare my bathroom cabinet is full of this nonsense. Then comes the foundation, filter, powder, two different kinds of colour correction, concealer, eyebrow brush and lip gloss.As with the boom in female beauty, the charge is being led by ordinary teenagers making videos in their bedrooms. James Charles from upstate New York was 16 when he launched his first makeup tutorial on YouTube. In it, he demonstrates how to do a complex contoured look with a deep blue eye-shadow glow, completely transforming his face. By the age of 18, Charles had amassed 8.5 million subscribers and become the first man to model for makeup brand CoverGirl.Both Thompson and Charles are model-like, and their makeup looks are full-on and feminine: lots of contouring, bronzer and colour. Both are gay queer culture has always appropriated elements of femininity, particularly makeup. As Thompson says, “Makeup connects with queer culture – it’s such a powerful form of expression.”The question, though, is whether the Towie boys and the high-profile vloggers doing deals with mainstream beauty brands could signal a tipping point where male makeup becomes more commercially viable. I have my reservations, not least because we’ve been here before. In the kohl-and-cocaine mid-00s, front pages were dominated by the fabulous lashes of Pete Doherty, Noel Fielding and Russell Brand. Piggybacking on that trend, Superdrug tried to launch a “guyliner” and “manscara” in 2008. Both products flopped.Bunny Kinney, editor of Dazed Beauty magazine, tells me he’s starting to hear major brands talk about male makeup, but that there’s a long way to go before blokes in towns across Britain start powdering their noses before a night out. “In spite of all the amazing, radical progress that’s being made with regards to gender nonconformity, beauty still very much exists on that mainstream binary. For things like male foundation, getting rid of that stigma is going to be hard.”Back in the makeup chair, I ask Cooper to give me a slightly more full-on look: eye shadow, contouring, glow on my cheekbones (pictured above). How do I look? Yes, my eyes are “popping”, but it’s extremely noticeable and I feel uncomfortable. I keep the makeup on, and later bump into some friends. “You’re wearing makeup,” they say by way of a hello. I don’t know the unspoken rule that you don’t touch your face when wearing makeup by the time I meet my girlfriend an hour later, everything has smeared. What do you think, I ask? She looks at me with undisguised amusement – a vain melting goth in the middle of St Pancras station. “I’m surprised by how unashamed you are,” she says.One brand believes it can beat the kneejerk unease men have about makeup. It’s called MMUK. On sale exclusively through Asos, it has grown to become the biggest male-focused makeup brand in Europe, with a turnover last year of £1m.MMUK is based in Brighton, where I meet its founder, Alex Dalley. After watching plenty of beauty vlogs, I have certain preconceptions, so I am surprised to be greeted by a man in a plain white T-shirt and black exercise shorts that expose his tree-trunk, rugby-player legs. He calls me “fella”.Dalley says his interest in makeup started when he was a teenager: he is blind in one eye and had terrible acne, and would regularly miss school because he didn’t want anyone to see his visible disability. “I’m surprised I ever left my bedroom,” he says.On the night of the lower-sixth prom, his mother convinced him to try foundation. The result was life-changing. “I remember looking in the mirror and feeling like myself again,” Dalley says. It kickstarted a fascination with bronzers and concealers, although he remained too frightened to buy anything himself, sending his mum off to Boots to shop for him.While studying business at Sussex University, he did some market research and was surprised to find there weren’t any male beauty brands. He began developing a business plan, and when he left university, tried to make it a reality, setting up a website and using his overdraft to buy up cheap, discontinued Calvin Klein women’s makeup, which he then marketed at men.Straight away, Dalley was making more than £1,000 a month by convincing men they were buying male makeup when they weren’t. He included tutorials and guides, showing men the basics of foundation, powder and concealer (his site was also the first that came up if you Googled “makeup for men”). Eventually, he ran out of the Calvin Klein stock, so he started investing in his own products. Dalley initially assumed the primary interest would be from gay men, and took out adverts in Attitude and Gay Times. But he quickly found that gay consumers made up only a quarter of his customer base.MMUK changed the tone of the language on the website, and took out references to nights out and “wingmen” to make it appealing to all age groups, and watched the business grow. In 2017, it got a distribution deal with Asos Dalley now plans to expand into 12 new territories next year.He says the success of the products is down to their formulations, which are different from women’s brands. They need to last longer, because there’s no way men will keep makeup in their bag or touch up in the bathroom (many of MMUK’s customers request the makeup to be delivered in plain packaging or addressed to a female name). Most importantly, each product is essentially designed to be invisible. The foundations are matte and come in a wide range of skin tones and types. The lip glosses are clear the bronzers aim to make you look tanned, rather than to glow.I wonder how Dalley feels about the market expanding, with bigger brands muscling in on his turf. “I think Chanel, Tom Ford – they’re tokens. It’s all just marketing. They’ve just added the word ‘boy’ or ‘for men’. They haven’t had the balls to say, ‘Let’s really step away and create a whole range.’”Thompson, who vlogs mostly about using women’s makeup to achieve his looks, agrees, adding that, just as female ranges have for decades given women of colour few options, these nascent ranges for men don’t cater for darker skin types. “With Chanel, it’s amazing that they are doing a men’s makeup range, but those shades? Why even bother if you don’t cater to all the men around the world?”I’m interested by Dalley’s offering. Until now, my skincare routine has involved picking up free samples at airports. So, heading off to a night out at a Frieze art fair afterparty, I pick up a bag of MMUK’s makeup. Already I see a problem: I need somewhere to apply it. I try a few bars, but the men’s toilets are busy and I don’t feel comfortable standing by the sink applying foundation while men in suits urinate behind me. Eventually, I settle for a toilet cubicle in a train station pub and try my best with the mirror in the compact.Having watched Cooper, I feel as if I know what I’m doing, but I quickly phone my girlfriend to make sure I’ve got the order right (I haven’t). I start with the foundation, which looks good until I get some on my beard, creating a horrible tartare-sauce look that is difficult to get off. After that, it’s concealer and powder and I try to fix my eyebrows, too.At the party, I meet up with some of my oldest friends. I expect them to bring it up immediately, but no one does when I mention that I’m wearing makeup, they say my skin looks glowing. Still, it doesn’t really make me feel more confident I worry that I’m coming across too Towie at a party that’s much more Broad City.One man who wants bring makeup out of the shadows is Jay Jay Revlon. After completing a nail technician course earlier this year, he set up the only male nail salon in the UK, as a popup in the corner of a pub. The technicians were men, and people could order a pint while they had their nails looked at.Like MMUK, Revlon found that he was getting a range of customers. “Nail biters were my key clientele,” he says. He’d give gel extensions for a natural look, as well as offering black or glitter nails the salon also gave manicures to those who just “want their hands sorting out”.Revlon says the long-term aim is a permanent space, “where men come and get their nails done, but can also do other stuff. It can be a social space, a safe space for LGBT people.” His dream is to have a salon where men can go to get their makeup sorted.There is a brand of socially conditioned masculinity that might stop me having a cupboard full of products, or powdering my nose in the loos of a commuter-friendly Wetherspoons. But would I pop to a male makeup bar and get my face done before a big night out? I already go to the barbers, where my eyebrows are plucked, my hands massaged and my beard trimmed to the millimetre. If they chucked in a little foundation and some colour corrector for the weekend – well, I wouldn’t say no. • Commenting on this piece?

A new Labour government had come to power on the promise of defence cuts. Swingeing job losses were soon to follow. Desperate workers at one Birmingham factory – Lucas Aerospace – fought to save their livelihoods, not by downing tools but by transforming from weapons-makers into one of Britain’s first eco-manufacturers, with early designs for wind turbines and hybrid cars.The extraordinary story of what became known as the “Lucas Plan” is now being told in a documentary, The Plan that Came from the Bottom Up, that screens for the first time this week at the BFI London film festival.“It was a silent revolution, it took place inside the factories not on the streets. There weren’t the battles with the police that we saw with the miners and the dockers, it wasn’t dramatic like that,” said director Steve Sprung, who described what happened inside the Lucas factory as a “significant but forgotten” event in British political history. “But what these workers did was incredible,” he told the Observer.Drawing on archive material and interviews with surviving workers, now in their 70s and 80s, the film juxtaposes present-day images of war and environmental damage, and asks what might have been if the “Lucas Plan” had ever seen the light of day.“The workers realised they were on the brink of massive redundancies and were trying to save lives,” said Sprung, whose documentary charts their story in two parts over three-and-a-half hours.The workers set up an unofficial trade union body, known as the Combine, to represent employees across the company’s 17 factories. They took their grievances to the then secretary of state for industry, Tony Benn.“He told us that he couldn’t bail us out or include us in nationalisation,” said Phil Asquith, a research engineer at Lucas Aerospace at the time. “Instead, he told us to ‘plan what you would make instead of weapon systems’.”The workers knew that this was their moment, Asquith says. They sought ideas from university academics on suitable alternatives to weapons. But after receiving scant replies, they turned instead to their own 18,000-strong workforce.“We said, your jobs are under threat – if you don’t make weapons what else would you make? The response was patchy to begin with but then we got a torrent of ideas. It was amazing,” Asquith said.They whittled down the suggestions to 150 products, each one deemed to be socially useful and environmentally friendly.The ideas included drawings of wind turbines, energy-efficient heat pumps and hybrid power packs for cars – commonplace now but virtually unheard of in the 1970s.“It was tough, and we argued, and sometimes there was almost blood on the floor, but what was coming through in terms of impact and support and ideas was truly exhilarating,” said Asquith.The plan took on a powerful momentum of its own. What had started as a bid to stave off job losses turned into something with a much wider political and ethical agenda.Mike Cooley, a Lucas engineer and member of the Combine, summed up the mood of the time: “It was an insult to our skill and intelligence that we could produce a Concorde but not enough paraffin heaters for all those old-age pensioners who die in the cold.”There was a surge of interest from around the world, Asquith said “because it was the first time a group of workers said, well, let’s devise our own alternative to the company’s corporate plan. Some people said it was like a 20th-century version of the industrial revolution!” The plan was even nominated for the Nobel peace price in 1979.Predictably, perhaps, company managers rejected the ideas from the outset, lampooning the suggestion of wind and solar power, in one instance, as being “in the realm of the brown bread and sandals brigade”, according to a document in the film.Asquith conceded, too, that the group never believed that the company would make their products, but emphasised that during the four years the plan was running, the company “didn’t dare declare any redundancies”.“In the end, we got done over by the Labour government, some of the union officials and then Thatcher,” he said.Lucas Aerospace was sold off bit by bit, and none of the eco-products was ever made. “I tell you what though, if I had my life over I wouldn’t change that Lucas experience for anything,” Asquith said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/047ad5d4f5325d5132bd904196e294f646ee07cb/100_1872_4718_2831/master/4718.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=257adc6b8b78b11a92b8706c347d41d6","title":"nigel slater drop scones recipes","story":"These easy old-fashioned comfort food classics are guaranteed to make your kitchen cosierThe kitchen roof has been letting in water for some time now, and repairs need to begin before winter sets in. I particularly appreciate the long, thin room – more of a galley, really – when the rain beats down on the skylights or a layer of snow sits on the glass, muffling both sound and light. It is then, with a cake in the oven or a deep pan of thickening polenta on the stove, that the kitchen is at its most cosy.It takes surprisingly little activity to turn a cold, leaky kitchen into a warm and welcoming space. You make a bowl of batter with flour, egg and milk, ladle little pools on to a hot pan, and in 5 minutes you have a batch of warm drop scones. It’s the sort of baking no one does any more but probably should. Traditionally they are spread with deep waves of clotted cream and rivulets of runny jam, but I prefer to add a handful of berries, so their juice stains the doughy cakes with streaks of purple.Making drop scones the other day, it occurred to me that I could tweak the recipe towards something savoury by ditching the sugar and introducing a punchy cheese. We ate the result, as homely as cheese on toast, for Sunday supper alongside a frying pan full of pumpkin hash with onion and rosemary. Suddenly the damp patches on the ceiling seemed a little less urgent. Injured it may be, but the kitchen is still doing what it does best.I use smoked bacon here, but pancetta will be fine, too, as would finer, air-dried prosciutto or even salami, finely chopped.Fry the bacon in a shallow pan until crisp, then drain on kitchen paper. Alternatively grill the bacon in a griddle pan or overhead grill until crisp. Leave to cool. Finely chop the parsley. When the bacon is cool, chop into small pieces, about the size of fine gravel.Put the flour in a large mixing bowl, add the baking powder and combine. (You can sieve the two together if you wish.) Break the egg into a bowl and beat lightly with a fork to combine white and yolks, and mix in the milk, then fold into the flour.Add the grated parmesan to the batter, then stir in the bacon and the parsley.Melt the butter in a small saucepan then remove from the heat. In a small, non-stick or well-used frying pan, pour a couple of tablespoons of the melted butter and let it warm over a moderate heat. Pour in a sixth of the bacon and parmesan batter, making a round approximately the size of a digestive biscuit. Repeat with 2 more then let them cook for 4-5 minutes, checking the undersides regularly for colour. When golden, use a palette knife to carefully turn each one over. Leave for a further 3-4 minutes then lift out and keep warm. A sound test for doneness is to touch the centre of each scone with your finger. It should feel lightly springy. Repeat with the remaining mixture. Serve the scones warm, with the pumpkin below.The endlessly useful and easily transported butternut can be used here if carrying an entire pumpkin home doesn’t appeal.Enough for 6Peel the pumpkin and cut the flesh into cubes roughly 3cm x 3cm. Peel and roughly chop the onions. Warm the butter and olive oil in a shallow pan, add the pumpkin and onions and let them cook, with a regular stir, for about 10 minutes. Chop the rosemary, add to the pan with a little salt and black pepper, then cover with a lid and leave to cook over a low to moderate heat for about 15 minutes.Check the mixture occasionally to make sure it isn’t browning too much. It is done when the pumpkin is soft and easy to crush between your fingers. Serve with the bacon drop scones (above).Most berries lend themselves to inclusion in a drop scone. Elderberries and blackcurrants can used from the freezer.self-raising flour 180gbaking powder 1 tspcaster sugar 1 tbspegg 1, large milk 220mlbutter a littleblackcurrants, blackberries or blueberries 100gMix the flour, baking powder and sugar in a large mixing bowl.

Stir the currants or berries into the batter. In a small, non-stick frying pan, pour a couple of tablespoons of the melted butter and let it warm over a low to moderate heat. Pour in a sixth of the batter, letting it form a round about the size of a digestive biscuit. Repeat with 2 more then leave for 4-5 minutes, checking the undersides as you go. It should never be more than pale gold. When done, turn the scones using a palette knife. Leave for a further 3-4 minutes then remove from the pan, check they are lightly springy to the touch, and keep warm. Repeat with the remaining mixture.

But little here suggested Martin O’Neill’s side will clamber off the bottom of their Nations League group by beating Wales at this venue on Tuesday, nor that a glorious future awaits just beyond that. Still, small steps and all that, and this one was in the right direction for Ireland. Or wasn’t backwards, at least.O’Neill tried things, the Irish fought hard, Cyrus Christie surprised in a central midfield role and the Preston North End forward Callum Robinson looked perky after being sprung from the bench late on. Those were the main positives. On the downside, Ireland’s execution of even basic ploys was mostly dreadful and the squad is grievously short of creativity. The sad thing as far as the spectacle was concerned was that Denmark were not much better. Christian Eriksen was the game’s most influential player by not being here.The absence through injury of the Tottenham schemer, who struck a brilliant hat-trick when the Danes shattered Ireland’s World Cup qualifying ambitions here in November, was merciful on Ireland. Denmark’s manager, Åge Hareide, said it also tested his players.“This team needs to play matches without Eriksen, we can’t rely on him all the time,” he said. On this evidence they need a lot more practice.Hareide was pleased with the draw, which allows him to watch Tuesday’s match from the top of the group. “When you get three teams in a group, you have to play tactically. One way was not to lose to Ireland and to leave it to Wales and Ireland to battle it out for three points. It will be a tight game and I wouldn’t be surprised if they drew.”O’Neill said his men will go into that game in a better frame of mind thanks to the solidity they showed here, which contrasted markedly with their fragility during September’s 4-1 defeat in Cardiff. “We have kept a clean sheet, which is very, very important,” he said. “It’s a rebuilding process. One stage at a time.”That process involved deploying his team with three central defenders, a system he trialled in last month’s friendly draw in Poland. O’Neill has never been one to bow to popular demand but he finally gave a first start to Matt Doherty, the Wolves defender who began here at right wing-back in the absence of Séamus Coleman. Christie was assigned an unfamiliar role in central midfield and did well, showing impressive tenacity and dynamism. “I think he was terrific,” said O’Neill. The Fulham man even had Ireland’s only shot on target, forcing a good save from Kasper Schmeichel with a rasping drive from 20 yards in the second half.There seemed barely any other hope of a breakthrough. Denmark were technically better than the hosts but also had no imagination. The closest they came to a goal was when Simon Kjaer met a corner with a firm header. Arter booted it off the line. From open play Pione Sisto threatened in the first half with a fine curling shot from 20 yards that skimmed the outside of the post."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b2cb827c03cfac864f99232b0515b8cfd1ac1bc/0_67_4768_2860/master/4768.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4014d73aa9b91cb0400f463c65ec4717","title":"eden hazard real madrid chelsea","story":"They don’t bother putting stars on Real Madrid’s shirt to signify all the times they have accumulated the sport’s most coveted trophies. For other clubs, those stars take the form of a status symbol. At Madrid, though, they go by the theory that all they need is their club badge to signify football royalty. No stars necessary – which is just as well because they would need to find space for their own constellation to reflect what makes them different to the rest.In total, they have had the European Cup in their possession on 13 occasions, including four of the previous five seasons. Milan are next on the list with seven wins and then it is Barcelona, Liverpool and Bayern Munich on five. Ajax are even further back, on four, with Manchester United and Internazionale little more than a speck in the distance, on three apiece. Madrid might have their faults, they might be arrogant off the scale, permanently riven with politics and difficult sometimes to love, but their captain, Sergio Ramos, summed it up neatly. “When you put on this shirt, you know you’ve arrived at the very top,” Ramos said. “There is no greater honour.”Nobody should be surprised, therefore, that a player with Eden Hazard’s gifts appears to suspect his career might never truly be fulfilled unless there comes a day when he gets to pull that shirt over his head, to feel the material on his skin and experience what it is like to represent a club that have several decades of authentic greatness as the origins for all that hard-won hauteur.Hazard is far from the first elite footballer in the English game to feel this way and, by now, we should know enough about the way Madrid operate to understand that if the attraction is mutual, as everyone assumes, history points to this ending only one way. Even when Sir Alex Ferguson promised he would not sell Madrid a virus, never mind Cristiano Ronaldo, we all know what happened. Madrid are not often disappointed. It is not quite true that they always get their man – Exhibit A being David de Gea – but it is certainly a rarity when they fail to get their own way.As such, Chelsea’s supporters should probably start preparing themselves to lose Hazard next summer and, though this next point might be a hard one to accept, can anyone really be surprised that their most effective player is wondering whether this might be an appropriate time to sever his ties with English football?Chelsea are a proud club themselves, as the only team in London to win the European Cup and the capital’s most successful side by some distance during the Roman Abramovich era. Hazard’s six years at Chelsea have brought him two championship medals, an FA Cup, a League Cup and the Europa League, and he always seems happily settled with his family in Cobham.At the same time, the bone‑hard facts are that Chelsea have never gone past the last 16 of the Champions League, including two non-qualifications, since reaching the semi-finals in his second season at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea’s status as an elite club is undermined by last season’s fifth-placed finish, 30 points back from the top, and the abandonment of plans to redevelop Stamford Bridge leaves them with a stadium that is smaller than those of Bordeaux, Saint-Étienne and Real Betis. Stamford Bridge’s capacity, 41,841, puts it 79th in Europe in terms of size and, when the new White Hart Lane is functioning properly, Chelsea will have only the ninth largest club ground in England and the fourth in London. It is barely half the capacity of the Bernabéu and, however much Hazard appears to be enjoying the early stages of the Maurizio Sarri era, who can begrudge him considering his options when Chelsea are currently on a season of Europa League sightseeing? Of course he is thinking there might be greater adventures to be had elsewhere. Of course the idea of Madrid must be attractive.They will be fluttering their eyelashes in his direction, too, particularly now they are finding out that it is even more difficult coping without Ronaldo than they might have anticipated. Madrid are on a four-game sequence without a goal and, to put that into context, their longest dry run during Ronaldo’s nine years at the club amounted to two matches – once in October 2009 and again in September 2011. Madrid’s first game of the post‑Ronaldo era was watched by their lowest crowd for La Liga in almost a decade, with only 48,466 inside the 81,000-capacity Bernabéu (admittedly a 10.15pm kick‑off on a Sunday did not help). Gareth Bale has managed only one 90-minute appearance all season and Madrid’s 12 goals from their first eight games is no more than Real Sociedad in ninth or Levante in 11th. Sevilla, the early pacesetters, have scored 18 times. Barcelona have 19. Even 10th-placed Celta Vigo, with 13 goals, have outscored Madrid so far.Early days, of course, but this all points to what Madrid should probably already have known: that there is no player in the world who could replace Ronaldo’s 50-plus goals every season. Hazard could, however, help the process immeasurably and the Belgian certainly appears to consider it a firm option, rather than merely a possibility. He has been making little secret of how he feels, openly talking about his aspirations to play in Spain, and adopting a slightly risky strategy bearing in mind football fans do not tend to appreciate their players talking about their temptations to join another club.At least he is being honest and, for the time being, he is playing with such brilliant vision and touch to get away with it. Nonetheless, it would be interesting to see if his form were to deteriorate later in the season. Hypothetical for now, perhaps, but a few iffy performances and, football being the hard-faced industry it is, questions would inevitably be asked about whether his heart is still in it.For the time being, all that can really be said is that English football should enjoy him while we can and, to give him his due, he also leaves the firm impression that if this is his final year at Chelsea he is determined to make it a memorable one. Hazard’s influence at Stamford Bridge is such that Chelsea even weighed up his feelings – disenchantment, primarily – before the decision was taken to sack Antonio Conte. His renascent form under Sarri is a triumph of the Italian’s man-management and when Hazard is playing this beautifully it goes without saying that Chelsea should try to explore every way of keeping him.On that front, they are prepared apparently to make Hazard the most financially endowed player in the club’s history with a deal worth around £300,000 a week. Madrid, one suspects, might be willing to go even higher and Hazard is correct when he says a move to the Bernabéu would enhance his chances of winning the Ballon d’Or. Abramovich’s seat at Stamford Bridge goes unused these days and at the end of this season Hazard’s transfer value will be depreciating because he will have only a year remaining on his contract.There is a common assumption about Chelsea sometimes that it is a money-no-object operation, but that is not true. They have already lost Thibaut Courtois to Madrid for a knockdown fee of £30m when, realistically, Chelsea could have sold him for twice that amount a year earlier. Again, they might have to take another financial hit, but there is no way they would even contemplate the other option of letting Hazard run his contract down and leave on a free transfer in 18 months. It is Madrid, as usual, in a position of strength and that is not just a shame for Chelsea but the Premier League as a whole.As much as I feel sorry for the bloke, I can understand why there was a certain amount of unease about the news Paul Gascoigne was among the public nominations to be inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame. All the same, what to make of the follow-up development that several board members of the Scottish Football Association – the organisation, lest it be forgotten, that would like everyone to forgive and forget when it came to Malky Mackay – were apparently planning to boycott the ceremony?None of those board members, I note, were willing to put their name to this leaked story and, as yet, nobody has felt confident enough to articulate what is actually a reasonable point: that Gascoigne’s previous is difficult to airbrush when it comes to celebrating his achievements.At the same time, you have to admire the double standards of an organisation that struck such a sympathetic and understanding tone when it came to those unfortunate text messages that Mackay – later appointed as Scottish football’s performance director and, briefly, interim manager of the Scotland team – pinged to a colleague, in the name of banter, when he was at Cardiff.As far as I know, these Hall of Fame events have never previously contained a good-behaviour clause, but it is the explanation from the Scottish FA that really makes you marvel at their selective memories.“It’s OK not to be OK,” the organisation announced on Twitter on World Mental Health Day. The announcement about the Gazza volte-face came within 24 hours and was based, according to an official statement, on various factors including “concerns over the state of Paul’s health”. Which is very sweet of them, I’m sure you will agree, and undoubtedly the kind of gesture that will make the subject of this heartfelt care feel so much better.The latest bulletin from the Checkatrade Trophy includes the lowest crowds in the history of Port Vale (601 v Burton), Oxford United (929 v Northampton) and Walsall (702 v Middlesbrough) and the worst attendance for a game at Cambridge United (469 v Southampton) since at least 1970, the same year they replaced Bradford Park Avenue in the old Fourth Division.Not for the first time, the thought occurs that maybe it is time for the Football League, rather than insisting the changes to this competition have “proved successful”, to drop the pretence and accept, in fact, they have made an absolute pig’s ear of it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08b80b5bc8df619d75a6ae259667b7010a5f81f9/0_553_1427_856/master/1427.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=244ccd4b607cdc319426bf3eeca90462","title":"stop and search is unjust unfair ineffectual david lammy","story":"I was 12 years old when I was first frisked, groped and harassed by the police. I was walking down Lawrence Road in Tottenham, rocking big hair and NHS prescription glasses, when I was abruptly ambushed by three police officers. Ferociously patting me down, they said I matched the description of a mugger. The reality was that they could not tell one black boy from another. Many years later, the fear and embarrassment of the first time I was stopped and searched for a crime I did not commit remains with me. Speaking to young black men in my constituency and looking at the statistics, it’s clear that nothing has changed.The fact that you are now over eight times more likely to be stopped and searched if you are black than if you are white, even though it is less likely for drugs to be found, represents a profound racial injustice. Grounded in the fictitious narrative that drug use is especially prevalent among black and minority ethnic groups, the current practice of stop and search entertains a racist fantasy. As we speak, there will be young, white middle-class men smoking a joint at a campus university or having cocaine delivered to their dinner parties, but the police will be nowhere in sight. We cannot have different policing for different communities. It is inherently unfair. Stop and search is an integral cog in a racially disproportionate criminal justice system.The disproportionate use of stop and search is not only born out of, but also perpetuates, a paranoid and generalised suspicion toward an entire community. The ingrained image of black men being searched by the police feeds into the collective illusion that black men everywhere need to be policed more than others. Crucially, the way in which the police’s huge discretionary power is exercised does not only fuel deep distrust toward the groups they target. The systematic profiling of black and minority ethnic groups inevitably leads them to lose faith in the very authorities that are meant to protect them. An institution that people depend on for their safety is transformed into one that is feared just as much as the threats it intends to defuse.As for the use of weapons searches, the evidence is clear: increases in the use of stop and search do not lead to any discernible drop in violent crime. Used as an antibiotic to a resistant infection, stop and search is overly prescribed to the detriment of its own effectiveness, squandering police time and energy that could otherwise be expended on protecting the wider community. In fact, it relieves us of the responsibility of engaging with the deeper problems that create the criminals it intends, but systematically fails, to apprehend. It wants to magically make the underlying roots of criminal activity disappear.To put it simply: “Nobody wins when stop and search is misapplied. It is a waste of police time. It is unfair, especially to young black men. It is bad for public confidence in the police.”Instead of relying on this ineffectual and racially unjust practice, we must stop stigmatising black men and search for more intelligent, long-term solutions to the problems that foster criminal activity in the first place. Ultimately, we must either abandon our reliance on stop and search or abandon any hope for a criminal justice system grounded in equality, impartiality and fairness.David Lammy is MP for Tottenham, and author of a government review into the over-representation of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) iniduals in the criminal justice system."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/807990ce501d091139939abb5dd7fc71d6b2f6d3/0_297_5824_3495/master/5824.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55fe1b4e3bb415bd6e8ac440b64364e4","title":"brompton electric folding bike this is all about easy city living martin love","story":"It’s no surprise there is a buzz about the new electric BromptonPrice £2,595Gears 2 or 6 speedRange up to 50 milesWeight 13.7kg, plus battery 2.9kg“Why does the word cheat always crop up when we talk about electric bikes?” asks Will Carleysmith, chief design and engineering officer at Brompton. “In Holland or Germany, they’re baffled by the idea. To them cycling is a pleasant, quick way to get around a city. It’s a transport solution. How can you cheat at getting to work?”But electric bikes can be heavy and unwieldy. It would be a nightmare lugging one up three storeys to your flat. Which is why Carleysmith believes Brompton’s folding e-bike could be a real game-changer.Brompton, as you probably know, is one of the great success stories of British cycling. Originally designed in 1975 by Andrew Ritchie in his flat in South Kensington, opposite the Brompton Oratory (hence the name), the little folding bike has become a massive hit – with both bike nuts and city commuters. A couple of years ago the firm moved into a bespoke, cavernous, state-of-the-art factory in west London. Brompton is now the biggest bike manufacturer in the UK, making about 50,000 frames a year – a shiny new folding bike rolls off one of the two production lines every 90 seconds.But going electric presented a problem. The Brompton is so precisely engineered that to add a motor, battery, sensors and computer control to such a compact frame proved a real headache. It could make it unfeasibly heavy or even stop it from folding – which, of course, is its raison d’être. To get the exacting technological fix they needed, Carleysmith started a project with the consultancy arm of the Williams Formula 1 team.“It was harder than any of us imagined,” he says, “but after three years we’ve cracked it.” One of the key breakthroughs was to separate the battery into a bother-free bag which seamlessly clips on to the front of the bike when you are using it. This makes the bike less of a theft risk and also makes it simple to charge. The powerful 250W motor is built into the front hub and only adds 1.9kg to the overall weight. You could ride the bike without the battery if you wished. But why would you? Remember, this isn’t about hard work, it’s about easy city living. Hop on, select one of the three power modes, and pedal. Immediately you’ll feel the motor getting to work. You whizz along at up to 15.5mph (the legal limit). The bike handles in the same, nippy, compulsive way Bromptons always have – but now those hills are a doddle. And don’t ever think you’re cheating.Floral, friction-free and fast.

Always-on behaviour is harmful to long-term mental health, and we need to learn to the hit the pause buttonIt is difficult to imagine life before our personal and professional worlds were so dominated and “switched on” via smartphones and the other devices that make us accessible and, crucially, so easily distractible and interruptible every second of the day. This constant fragmentation of our time and concentration has become the new normal, to which we have adapted with ease, but there is a downside: more and more experts are telling us that these interruptions and distractions have eroded our ability to concentrate.Nicholas Carr picked up on this again in an article in the Atlantic in 2008, before going on to publish his book The Shallows two years later. “Immersing myself in a book or a lengthy article used to be easy,” he wrote. “My mind would get caught up in the narrative or the turns of the argument, and I’d spend hours strolling through long stretches of prose. That’s rarely the case any more. Now my concentration often starts to drift after two or three pages. I get fidgety, lose the thread, begin looking for something else to do. I feel as if I’m always dragging my wayward brain back to the text. The deep reading that used to come naturally has become a struggle.”The impact of interruptions on inidual productivity can also be catastrophic. In 2002, it was reported that, on average, we experience an interruption every eight minutes or about seven or eight per hour. In an eight-hour day, that is about 60 interruptions. The average interruption takes about five minutes, so that is about five hours out of eight. And if it takes around 15 minutes to resume the interrupted activity at a good level of concentration, this means that we are never concentrating very well.Continuous partial attention – or CPA – was a phrase coined by the ex-Apple and Microsoft consultant Linda Stone. By adopting an always-on, anywhere, anytime, any place behaviour, we exist in a constant state of alertness that scans the world but never really gives our full attention to anything. In the short term, we adapt well to these demands, but in the long term the stress hormones adrenaline and cortisol create a physiological hyper-alert state that is always scanning for stimuli, provoking a sense of addiction temporarily assuaged by checking in.With our heavy use of digital media, it could be said that we have taken multitasking to new heights, but we’re not actually multitasking rather, we are switching rapidly between different activities. Adrenaline and cortisol are designed to support us through bursts of intense activity, but in the long term cortisol can knock out the feel-good hormones serotonin and dopamine in the brain, which help us feel calm and happy, affecting our sleep and heart rate and making us feel jittery.It would seem then that this physiological adaptation, fostered by our behaviour, is a predominant reason for the poor concentration so many people report. The fact that we are the cause of this is, paradoxically, good news since it hands back to us the potential to change our behaviour and reclaim the brain function and cognitive health that’s been disrupted by our digitally enhanced lives. And this may even be more important than just improving our levels of concentration. Constant, high levels of circulating stress hormones have an inflammatory and detrimental affect on brain cells, suggests the psychiatrist Edward Bullmore, who has written about the link between inflammation and depression in his latest book, The Inflamed Mind. Depression, along with anxiety, is a known factor in knocking out concentration.Put simply, better concentration makes life easier and less stressful and we will be more productive. To make this change means reflecting on what we are doing to sabotage personal concentration, and then implementing steps towards behavioural change that will improve our chances of concentrating better. This means deliberately reducing distractions and being more self-disciplined about our use of social media, which are increasingly urgent for the sake of our cognitive and mental health.It takes about three weeks for a repeating behaviour to form a habit, says Jeremy Dean, a psychologist and the author of Making Habits, Breaking Habits. Getting into a new habit will not happen overnight and adaptation can be incremental. Start by switching off smartphone alerts, or taking social media apps off your phone, then switching off the device for increasingly long periods.Practise concentration by finding things to do that specifically engage you for a period of time to the exclusion of everything else. What is noticeable is that you cannot just go from a state of distraction to one of concentration, in the same way that most of us cannot fall asleep the minute our head hits the pillow. It takes a bit of time and, with practice, becomes easier to accomplish.This is a simple way of learning to concentrate better. It goes like this: whenever you feel like quitting – just do five more – five more minutes, five more exercises, five more pages – which will extend your focus. The rule pushes you just beyond the point of frustration and helps build mental concentration. It’s a form of training as well as being a way of getting something accomplished.Sitting still would seem an easy thing to achieve. But it is harder than it sounds. It is akin to meditation, which can be a useful way to improve concentration. In this case, however, just get in to a comfortable, supported position and sit still and do nothing for five minutes. Use it as a pause between activities. Of course, if you already practise meditation, combine this with breathing for a quick “time out”.Switching off from both external and internal distractions does not come easily. Learning how to be more mindful, practising mindfulness or meditation, can all help facilitate greater concentration, not least because feeling calmer restores equilibrium and focus.Most of us breathe poorly: we tend to over-breathe, taking three or four breaths using only the upper part of our lung capacity, when one good breath using the lungs more completely would serve us better. This shallow breathing is very tiring, not only because we expend unnecessary muscular energy, but because we reduce our oxygen intake per breath.In its extreme form, over-breathing becomes hyperventilation, which can trigger panic attacks. In all mindfulness or meditation practice, breathing is key. So it’s wise to learn good techniques first. A daily practice, starting with 10 minutes and building on it, means that the ability to take some restorative “time out” will also be available to you:We all need to take time out, so set a timer to signal a break, or use an app such as Calm. Or you can just play a favourite music track, knowing that it will give you a set amount of time in which to press pause and do nothing.Another effective technique for boosting concentration is counting backwards. Counting backwards in sevens from 1,000 might sound like an exercise in exasperation, but it does require you to concentrate very hard: try it. It requires persistence and the use of different skills, which for some may include visualising the numbers as you count. Whatever it takes, keep at it for long enough to completely focus and you’ll also have the added bonus of finding that you have, temporarily, cleared your head of everything else for a few minutes.Similarly, spelling words backwards is a good way to focus: start with words that are easy: dog, box, cup, and then build up to longer words – including nouns and more abstract words – such as cushion, blonde, effort, number – increasing the length and complexity of the word. Again, this is an exercise that can be built on.Another way to focus is to sit in a comfortable position and find a spot on the wall to stare at. This works best when you have no conscious association with it to distract you – so, a black spot about two inches in diameter at eye level works well. Focus all your attention on this for around three minutes to start with (you can set a timer if this helps) and let any thoughts that arise drift away, constantly returning your focus to the spot.Anyone familiar with meditation will recognise this technique. If it helps to notice your breath, slow and steady this too, but always make your visual focus on the spot the priority. Practiced regularly, this can become so familiar it creates a resource on which to draw, enabling you to consciously refocus at will, even without the visual prompt.An old-fashioned clock face with hands and a second hand is needed for this. Starting with the second hand at the 12, focus intently on its progress around the clock face without allowing any distracting thoughts to intervene. Every time your concentration is interrupted by a stray thought, wait until the second hand is at the 12 again, and start again. It’s harder than it sounds and can feel very frustrating initially, but once the ability is learnt it’s easy to access again and again, whenever you need to create a more concentrated state of mind.We access so much information through what we see, but often we are not particularly observant about what we are looking at, leaving us with just an impression or feeling about what we’ve seen. In an effort to improve concentration skills, it’s worth considering how looking at and then visualising something, can reinforce concentration. Start by paying more attention, whether this is looking at a picture in an art gallery, or taking a bus ride, or just enjoying the scenery from a window. You don’t have to commit an exact graphic image to memory, but engage with it, notice details, reflect on it and, within a short time, you will be able to close your eyes and visualise it. There is no right or wrong way to do this, it’s just an opportunity to practise focus and improve concentration.There’s a huge difference between hearing and listening. Learning to listen well starts quite self-consciously but will also become a useful habit. You can use music to practise this, the length of a track giving you between three to five minutes (or longer) on which to focus. Really listen to the nuances of the music, its notes, cadences, instruments used, lyrics. Music is often just a background noise but real, complicated musical notation can be more than just pleasurable, it can be a real boon to helping relearn concentration skills.For any extended period of exercise – whether it be yoga, playing a team sport or dancing – the engagement of the brain with the body is also an exercise in concentration. Regular exercise also activates the body and this is beneficial for the brain.A Dutch study of schoolchildren published in the Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport in 2016 showed that interspersing lessons with a 20-minute stretch of aerobic exercise measurably improved attention s in the children that participated. Another 2014 study from the American Academy of Paediatrics, on the benefits of exercise in 7 to 9-year-olds, not only found that the children’s physical health improved as they got fitter, but also their brain function, cognitive performance and executive control.Poor sleep and being chronically under-slept affects concentration, while also reinforcing those stress hormones to compensate, making it a bit of a vicious circle. Improving sleep cannot happen overnight, particularly if it is a chronic problem, but taking measures to improve this will yield results over a period of weeks, rather than days.One place to start is clearing your bedroom of TVs, computers and other technology. Although any type of light can inhibit sleep, research has shown that light towards the blue end of the spectrum is especially effective at keeping you awake because it stimulates the retina in the eye and inhibits the secretion of melatonin from the pineal gland in the brain.Amber-tinted glasses can cut out glare, and it is also possible to fit screens with commercially produced blue-light blocking filters. Another solution, of course, is to avoid all electronic devices before bed in order to help avoid insomnia and improve sleep.One thing that many people who feel they have lost the ability to concentrate mention is that reading a book for pleasure no longer works for them. We have got so used to skim reading for fast access to information that the demand of a more sophisticated vocabulary, a complex plot structure or a novel’s length can be difficult to engage with. Like anything, single-minded attention may need relearning in order to enjoy reading for pleasure again, but close reading in itself can be a route to better concentration. To help that, read from an actual book, not a screen: screens are too reminiscent of skim reading and just turning pages will slow your pace. Read for long enough to engage your interest, at least 30 minutes: engagement in content takes time, but will help you read for longer.Somewhat ironically, digital apps may have their place in monitoring, managing or restricting digital time, but bear in mind that they still keep you connected to digital devices. Better perhaps to wean yourself away from excessive digital use by doing something alternative: read a book, go to a movie (where turning off phones is required), take a walk, eat a meal without checking … basically restore some sort of self-discipline through the benefit of alternate activities.But if you must turn to a digital solution to solve a digital problem, try these: track usage with Moment access Facebook limiter go Cold Turkey try Stay On Task use the App detox blocker or break phone addiction with Space.• Harriet Griffey is the author of The Art Of Concentration, published by Pan Macmillan at £10.99"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/980436e5e9f1eea9c3624d34e54c245db1daf05b/0_1155_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f766009d19687900153f79ae0b11b42d","title":"easy feasting spanish spiced roast rack of pork","story":"Smoked paprika and aromatic fennel add fire and flavour to a roasted rack of pork that’s low on effort, high on impact and perfect for sharingOutdoor late summer gatherings don’t always have to mean firing up the barbecue.

Authors Elizabeth Uviebinené and Yomi Adegoke explain how they got their big idea off the ground with working lunchesIt is often said that there is a book in all of us, but not all of us possess the grit, determination and means required to bring that book to fruition. By pooling their skills and working collaboratively, friends and co-authors Elizabeth Uviebinené and Yomi Adegoke were able to turn their book dream into a reality.Billed as a manual for modern life for a generation of British black women, Slay in Your Lane is an ambitious debut, ning topics from education to work, dating to health, and money to representation. But what sets this guide apart from its rivals is the fact that it’s built on collaboration, combining the experiences of not just Adegoke and Uviebinené but the insights of women in their own networks, as well as interviews with dozens of Britain’s most successful black women.Today, the duo are practising what they preach. It’s a sunny midweek afternoon in August, and journalist Adegoke and marketing specialist Uviebinené are doing what they so often do – thrashing out plans for their next business move over a bite to eat and a glass of wine. The venue is stylish wine bar and eatery Sapling on Dalston’s Kingsland Road and they’re joined by one of the many women they collaborated with for the book – Anne-Marie Imafidon. She’s co-founder of Stemettes, a social enterprise that inspires young women to progress in the science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) industries. The hot topic of conversation is the merits of creative collaboration.Uviebinené and Adegoke first met as freshers at Warwick University and bonded after noticing how few other black women there were on campus. Five years later, out of university and straight into the workplace, the issues of representation that first brought them together were more prominent than ever. It was after one particularly frustrating morning that Uviebinené rang Adegoke and suggested she write about their experiences. Adegoke replied with an emphatic “yes” and then an equally emphatic “but let’s do it together”.This signalled the start of a creative collaboration between the best friends, a mode of working that they both believe has been the secret ingredient to the resulting book’s success. For the two first-time authors with no publishing experience or connections to the industry, it was the decision to do it together that gave them the confidence to jump headfirst into the project. “Because there were two of us and we really believed in each other, the book went from being the twinkle of an idea to a physical proposal very easily,” Adegoke explains. “Doing it together meant we could constantly encourage each other.”Living together as they collaborated on the book meant that any time outside of their working schedules could be dedicated to dreaming up ideas for the project. Naturally, shared mealtimes became the optimum place to debrief on anything new. The pair definitely used to bond over food, Adegoke says, describing the “delicious, unusual” dishes Uviebinené would make for her: “Things like jerk salmon, pasta and seafood.” Often, friends would drop by and they’d enjoy a Thai feast and a bottle of wine. “Eating and debriefing is very much a highlight of my week,” Adegoke adds, “no-one’s ever too busy for a good meal, and it’s one of the few times in a week I can properly find out what everyone’s up to.”Beyond their own friendship group, the pair reached out to other women they knew to get involved, for help with everything from focus groups to photo shoots. Ideas were tried and tested over informal social settings, very often over food and wine. “A meeting room would feel too serious,” Uviebinené explains. “You eat, you relax and ultimately you let your guard down,” she says. “Dinner parties are always interesting, because a lot of friends have ‘side-hustles’ that they’re trying to get off the ground alongside their nine-to-five jobs. There are always a lot of ideas being bounced around over food and wine and lots of words of encouragement and advice.”The importance of women encouraging and supporting other women is critical now more than ever and Adegoke is refreshingly straight-talking on the topic. “We live in a world where most things work against women,” she says, “and on another level they work against women of colour, so it’s incredibly important for us to be there for each other.”Imafidon agrees, in her role at Stemettes she’s working to get women interested in fields too often focused towards male students. “There’s this saying: ‘You can’t be what you can’t see,’” she says. “I think it’s really important to set up environments where girls can see all the possibilities, and beyond them.”Between breaking open new industries and breaking bread with your trusted support network, collaborating on ideas and sharing advice is clearly on the menu for an increasingly social group of creative women.Made for sharingFrom delicious food and wine to music, art and words of wisdom, Campo Viejo believes that life’s better shared.

As a family, we’d eat around a little table in a room that I now cannot stand up in, heated by a peat-fired Rayburn and served next door by a composting toilet.My parents were often concerned for my nutrition, and did exceptionally considering their busy working lives. They’d manage to keep the cupboards stocked and cook warming classics from scratch – mince, steak pie, myriad brownish stews. They’d be served with potatoes, often from the garden, and at least one floppy green vegetable.My grandmother lived next door, and as well as secretly plying me with confectionery, from time to time she’d put on a roast. I still have a soft spot for vivid-green broccoli that Gran would boil with bicarbonate of soda until disintegration. Good for soaking up gravy, as well as for dentures.Since leaving the howling winds and isolation of the north for a story of my own, life still revolves around food. It has the amazing capacity to bring people together. Until very recently I was a junior doctor, and I’d unashamedly butter up my hospital colleagues with pastry. The theatre coffee room was always alight with talk of Bake Off and Masterchef, and filled with homemade cakes. It was the pressure from my wife, friends and colleagues who enjoyed my food that forced me into applying to Bake Off. We actually all watched it together, but they felt that it should be me who applied.Since Bake Off, there’s been a significant level of expectation on me when it comes to pudding. I sometimes feel like my wife and I compete in a dinner party league, in which we take turns to host friends in a disingenuous performance of informality.Not that I’d ever reveal the planning that goes into our apparently effortless cooking. But our extensive overthinking hides true incompetence. The construction of a wood-fired pizza oven in the garden over the course of a weekend was one such example. There was the obsession over the type of bricks and granite to use and the clay, which cracked and mildly exploded as soon as I lit the expensive seasoned wood I’d sourced and stacked inside. The result was, at least, only mildly ash-covered pizza.The gathering to eat transcends food, and the drink. I’ll admit that I remember flavours and smells better than I remember sounds or words or even people, but better than all is a feeling of being at ease and in the company of people you like. Following the peak of the pudding, the wine continues to flow. Colleagues and associates leave as new friends and, maybe, with a scrawled recipe or two. Scrunched in a pocket and tossed with receipts, it isn’t the recipe that matters.Makes enough to serve four very hungry Scottish peopleSalted or unsalted butter, for greasingFresh rhubarb, 600g Caster sugar, 150g1 bramley appleDried breadcrumbs, 50gFor the spongeSalted butter, 50gCaster sugar, 50g1 egg, mediumSelf-raising flour, 150g Baking powder, ½ tsp Milk, to loosenTinned custard, to serveI vividly remember standing on a stool to watch as Gran made perfect pastry with her worn hands.Baking was the intergenerational bond that we had between us, and those hours spent in her kitchen dusted in flour are still the memories that define my childhood. This charlotte recipe was one that Gran made to use up any leftovers – and the version I’ve given you here is foolproof baking.Her version wasn’t traditional – we didn’t use sliced bread to line the base and sides. We combined a simple sponge with stewed fruit and it was heaven – especially when warm. This version came about when there was too much pie filling (in retrospect, there’s no such thing as too much pie filling), or we’d overdone it on the sponge mix. It was easy to pick and stew some rhubarb, stick it in a dish and top with the leftover sponge.Gran was a big fan of stewing the rhubarb to oblivion, but this both adds an extra step and loads of washing up. I prefer slicing it thinly, and building it up layer by layer, sprinkling generously with sugar.Start by preheating your oven to 180C160C fangas mark 4. Use an ovenproof dish that isn’t going to leak. Those trendy blue and white ones are perfect. Give your dish a rub with loads of butter, all the way up the sides.Prepare your rhubarb – get rid of any leaves and the white bits towards the base of the stalk. Slice rather thinly – less than a centimetre, anyway. This helps them break down without stewing, and helps in the layering with the sugar. You can also peel and core your bramley apple, before slicing it thinly, too.\u0026nbspCover your greased dish with a layer of apple, first of all, to help absorb some of the moisture lost by the rhubarb. Sprinkle this with a thin coating of sugar, then layer up with rhubarb. Cover with more sugar, and then continue to layer until you’ve no fruit left.

Add in your flour (no need to sieve) and baking powder, and give the whole thing a gentle mix until there are no lumps visible. You should have a fairly gorgeous, smooth mix that ribbons as your spoon glides through it – if not, splash in a tablespoon or two of milk to loosen.Scoop the mix on top of your prepared rhubarb and carefully smooth it out with the back of your spoon. Once nearly at the edge all the way around, stick the whole thing in the oven and bake for about 30-35 minutes, or until the sponge is a deep golden brown and you can see signs of bubbling rhubarb escaping around the sides. Don’t stick a skewer in, but check the sponge’s doneness by pressing lightly with a finger. It should bounce back at you. If you leave a ot, give it another 5 minutes.

Any relief was shortlived, however, as it became apparent that banks were mostly not passing on the increase. It is estimated that less than a third of variable-rate savings accounts saw any rise.So what should savers do to try and get some returns?Getting good value may depend on going with a lender that you may not be familiar with – the high street tends to offer “pitiful” rates, according to Bowes.Rates favour those who wait. The best are available if you are willing to fix for as long as possible, says Charlotte Nelson from Moneyfacts. But, she adds, many savers are turned off by suggestions from the Bank of England that rates will increase more in the coming years.With good rates can come limits and restrictions. “Unfortunately, some of the best easy-access accounts are either accompanied by a bonus or a limit to the number of withdrawals a saver can make,” says Nelson. “Savers should note all the terms and conditions before opening the account so there are no nasty surprises further down the line.”Such high interest current accounts can have a limited life, warns Nelson. “Whilst these deals are attractive, they often only last for a certain period. This could appeal to those who are looking to move their money elsewhere if the market picks up,” she says. “Many providers offer exclusive saving deals for those who hold a selected current account. These tend to have slightly higher rates than the new customer product, so it is always wise to check.”There has been a sharp drop in the amount invested in cash Isas as a result of low interest rates. Changes to tax rules mean the first £1,000 of interest that an inidual receives from savings is now tax-free if they are a basic-rate taxpayer – another reason cited for their decline.However, Moira O’Neill of Interactive Investor, an online trading and investment platform, says they should not be ruled out. “They could spare you a future tax bill if your savings grow, or you earn more than the tax-free threshold. The more you are earning and saving, the greater the argument for sticking with Isas – again, you’ll need to find the best rates and switch when they slide,” she says. “If you can afford to tie up your money for five or, ideally, 10 years, it’s worth considering a stocks and shares Isa. You can start investing with as little as £25 a month and build it up.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ed290238fc965bfd574d6cc7b553b84382beaf1/0_79_2280_1813/master/2280.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8a17e64ffdfacf44628314c51a8df4b8 1400w","title":"has theresa may run out brexit options eu leaders","story":"A former Tory cabinet minister with decades of experience of epic parliamentary battles over Europe had this to say last week about Theresa May’s current Brexit conundrum: “I cannot for the life of me see how she can get any sort of deal done with Brussels that stands the slightest chance of passing through parliament.” Without a working majority, and reliant on the increasingly troublesome Democratic Unionist party (DUP) for support, he believed that the prime minister’s position was becoming more impossible by the day.He had lived through the Conservative party’s rows over the Maastricht treaty in the 1990s that ripped apart John Major’s government. But the current fissures were far wider and deeper. All discipline has disappeared. The issue of Europe has finally destroyed any remaining bonds of unity that had kept his party together down the years, and he worried for its very survival.“It could be terminal,” was his grim assessment. Two years and three months into her premiership, there are plenty of MPs on all sides of the House of Commons who believe Theresa May has run out of Brexit road. Whichever way she turns in her attempt finally to get an exit deal with the EU, she runs into seemingly immovable blocks of opposition back home.Another Tory MP likened her problem to that of a chess player on the brink of defeat after a very long game in which she had been slowly and progressively outfoxed. “Whichever move she makes now, she gets forced further into the corner. She has tried everything. Unless I am missing something, there is no other move left on the board.”On Wednesday evening May will sit down for dinner with EU leaders in Brussels to try to find a way through. The Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, may travel to the Belgian capital tomorrow to prepare the ground with EU officials and ambassadors. All the diplomatic stops will be be pulled out. The EU side is still optimistic that a deal can be struck. But Brussels officials acknowledge they may be underestimating May’s domestic difficulties - they are probably right.The prime minister’s task is twofold. First, she must get the EU to agree to a deal that will allow the UK to begin a two-year Brexit transition phase that has been planned as the way to smooth our path out, and during which talks on a long-term comprehensive trade deal with the bloc can begin in earnest. If that were her only problem, it could all be sorted out tomorrow. But it isn’t. Any deal the prime minister strikes must then pass through parliament later this year or early next if she is to avoid the havoc that would ensue from a no-deal Brexit outcome.The trouble is that what the EU is demanding in order to solve the knotty issue of the Irish border – the key unresolved issue in the entire process – is completely unacceptable to Conservative Eurosceptics in her cabinet and on her backbenches, and to the 10 DUP MPs. So unless something gives, May cannot win. “If she makes concessions to Barnier (the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator), she loses a large part of her own party and the unionists and cannot get the deal through parliament,” said an aide to a Tory minister. “But if she placates the hard Brexiters, she can’t get a deal from Barnier to put to parliament in the first place.”The matter that most ides the two sides before the crucial Brussels summit concerns the so-called backstop arrangement designed to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the republic. To make this work and to avoid any semblance of a physical border, May had proposed customs arrangements that would in effect keep the whole of the UK in the EU customs union until December 2021 - but not beyond. The trouble is that the EU will not sign off on a final withdrawal deal if the 2021 time limit remains in place. It wants permanent guarantees to protect the integrity of the single market for as long as they are needed.As No 10 desperately tried to devise a way out of the impasse last week, a group of cabinet ministers whose departments are most directly involved in Brexit was summoned to Downing Street on Thursday evening. They spotted that the time limit May had inserted on the backstop plan appeared to have been removed from the latest proposals. Several ministers, including foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt and environment secretary Michael Gove, voiced concern. Cabinet ministers who had not been invited, including international development secretary Penny Mordaunt and leader of the House of Commons Andrea Leadsom, were said to be “livid”. Any suggestion that the UK could remain in an EU customs union indefinitely meant being tied to the EU in perpetuity.This weekend, although Downing Street subsequently said it had no plan to remain indefinitely in a customs union, Leadsom and Mordaunt, as well as work and pensions secretary Esther McVey, are said to be “seriously considering their positions” before a meeting of the full cabinet on Tuesday where May will try to get her most senior ministers to unite.The DUP also chose last week to cut up rough over its worries that the backstop arrangement would mean Northern Ireland being more closely aligned to EU single-market regulations than the rest of the UK post-Brexit – something the unionists will not accept. As the DUP leadership briefed that it would be prepared to vote down the budget at the end of this month unless it received guarantees over the backstop, a sense that the crisis was widening beyond Brexit gripped Westminster.The DUP’s Brexit spokesman, Sammy Wilson, left no-one in any doubt that the DUP would be ready to pull the plug on support for May’s administration if she capitulated in the face of pressure from Brussels. “We will not be bullied into propping up a soft-touch government which gives in to the EU’s demands.”May also has to take into account the concerns of pro-EU Tories. Around two dozen or so of these would almost certainly vote against a hard Brexit deal if it was anything close to the kind of Canada-style free trade agreement that Jacob Rees-Mogg’s European Research Group is calling for.With Labour committed to voting against any deal May brings back unless it delivers the same benefits as full membership of the single market, and the SNP aware that Brexit chaos could well advance the cause of Scottish independence, it is increasingly hard to see where Theresa May can win enough support at home for a Brexit deal, even if she gets one in Brussels.Theresa May has relied on the support of the Democratic Unionist party’s 10 MPs since last year’s election backfired and robbed her of her majority. In return for its backing, however, the DUP drew up a series of red lines. Now it is threatening to vote down the budget and cripple May’s government if its demands on Brexit are not met. Above all, it demands that whatever deal is arrived at, nothing must compromise Northern Ireland’s status in the union or separate it in any way from the rest of the UK.The DUP dismisses the EU’s suggestion that Northern Ireland should stay in EU customs arrangements to enable trade to flow freely across the border and rejects the idea its regulatory regime could be more closely aligned to the EU than the rest of the UK. It will not accept a border in the Irish Sea. The steps the European commission regards as essential to retain the integrity of the single market, while avoiding a hard border would, the DUP says, undermine its position as an integral part of the UK. The DUP leader Arlene Foster said last week: “I am a unionist, I believe in the union of the United Kingdom, all four elements of the United Kingdom. We do not want Northern Ireland going off in a different direction from the rest of the UK.”While the diehard Eurosceptics pull from the right and want a Canada-style agreement, Tory Europhiles are applying similar levels of pressure on the prime minister from the left. Any hint of a Canada-style deal and they would vote against the agreement in parliament.They want to keep the UK in a customs union and as close to the single market as possible. It’s thought that at least two dozen Conservative MPs could vote against any deal that they regard as delivering too hard a Brexit.A new Europhile grouping, similar to the European Research Group, is being formed to coordinate parliamentary tactics.Tory Europhiles are trying to persuade May that, if she strikes a sensible soft-Brexit deal that keeps the UK in a customs union at the very least, she could well persuade dozens of Labour MPs who want Brexit done and dusted, but dread a no-deal outcome, to defy Jeremy Corbyn and back her in parliament to get her deal through.Some Tory MPs – including the former ministers Justine Greening, Phillip Lee and Anna Soubry – want a second referendum to give the public a chance to vote to stay in.While the DUP says it will not tolerate any Brexit that undermines the union, the Scottish National party sees a golden chance to use the chaos that surrounds it to promote independence. While polls do not suggest there is majority support for independence, the SNP knows a botched Brexit or a no-deal outcome could play into its hands. The party will not support any Brexit that does not involve full single market and customs union membership, both of which May has ruled out.May and the SNP could not be further apart. At her party’s annual conference last week Nicola Sturgeon adapted Winston Churchill’s famous saying when referring to Brexit, declaring: “Never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few.”She said she was “more confident than ever that Scotland will be independent”, and urged her party “to step up our work to update and strengthen the case”.The SNP also says it will back a second referendum on Brexit, but wants assurances that the Scottish people will have a second independence vote if they back Remain while the UK votes Leave.As the prime minister tries to persuade the EU to accept some version of her “soft Brexit” Chequers plan, which includes observing a “common rulebook” with the EU for goods and a “facilitated customs arrangement”, the hard-Brexit Tory right are stepping up efforts to kill off Chequers altogether.The European Reform Research Group (ERG) led by Jacob Rees-Mogg instructs its supporters to campaign to “chuck Chequers”. The disloyalty of the 21st-century Eurosceptics towards their own leader is worse, according to the former prime minister John Major, than that of cabinet rebels he branded “bastards” during Tory battles over Maastricht in the 1990s.The former Brexit minister Steve Baker, a leading Eurosceptic, says more than 40 Conservative MPs would be prepared to vote against the prime minister if she and the EU agree to a deal even remotely similar to the Chequers proposal.The ERG wants the UK to strike a Canada-style free-trade deal with the EU, which would allow for tariff-free trade on a large range of goods, but it could take years to negotiate. It would also not eliminate the need for border checks, and would not solve the Irish border problem. As a result many MPs say it would endanger peace in Northern Ireland.The European Union is determined to do a deal on Brexit – but not at any cost. As it comes to crunch time, it is giving little ground. The main sticking point after more than two years since the referendum is the Irish border.Last week the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier told May, in effect, that a deal was there for the taking if she would accept some form of customs union arrangement that would allow for trade to operate without friction between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.This is the area for real negotiation in the next few weeks.May has to find a middle way between what Brussels demands and what would be acceptable to enough MPs in the House of Commons.Barnier also says May’s Chequers plan, with its common rulebook on goods and a customs arrangement that would allow the UK to avoid border checks, while leaving it free to sign its own bespoke trade deals, would give British companies “a huge competitive edge” and would be “counter to our very foundations”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b5f71e00578fd9ae6220dd032dfd07a7b4c72c6/0_0_4276_2566/master/4276.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea07deecc35e808e6a4b921a0ec7d271","title":"leaked emails dup arlene foster no deal brexit most likely outcome eu","story":"Arlene Foster believes crashing out of EU is ‘most likely outcome’ while former Brexit secretary says Irish border plan ‘completely unacceptable’Theresa May has been told that the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, is now “ready” to trigger a no-deal Brexit and regards this as the “likeliest outcome” following a “hostile and difficult” exchange with the EU’s chief negotiator, an explosive set of leaked government emails reveal.Meanwhile, the former Brexit secretary David Davis has said May’s Brexit plans are “completely unacceptable” and urged cabinet ministers to “exert their collective authority”.With continued speculation that Leave-supporting cabinet ministers could resign if May presses ahead with the plan to keep Britain in a customs union for the sake of an open Irish border, David Davis said: “This is one of the most fundamental decisions that government has taken in modern times.” Writing in the Sunday Times, he said: “It is time for the cabinet to exert their collective authority. This week the authority of our constitution is on the line.”Foster emerged from a meeting last week in Brussels with Michel Barnier, the French official leading the EU’s negotiating team, convinced that the prospects for a Brexit deal were fading so fast that, given Brussels’ stance on Northern Ireland, an agreement had become the least likely outcome. Senior government advisers were swiftly informed that the DUP leader was “ready” for the UK to crash out of the EU without a deal.The official added in his email, circulated at the highest levels, that it was not clear whether Foster was seeking to threaten the government or simply inform it of her plans.Last week, the DUP, whose 10 MPs prop up May’s government, made it clear they would be prepared to vote down the budget this month, if the government pressed ahead with a Brexit deal that tied Northern Ireland closer to the EU than the rest of the UK. Losing a budget vote would plunge the government into crisis.News of the emails comes amid new infighting in May’s cabinet over Brexit. The prime minister will make a final appeal for ministerial unity on Tuesday at a cabinet meeting, amid rumours that more senior ministers could soon follow Boris Johnson and David Davis out of the government.Several cabinet ministers, including the leader of the Commons, Andrea Leadsom, and the work and pensions secretary, Esther McVey, are this weekend said to be “seriously considering their positions” because they believe May’s current negotiations would leave open the possibility of the UK remaining in the EU customs union for good.The ministers say that if this were to be the case, the UK would never fully leave the EU. One source said eight or nine cabinet ministers had serious concerns.The tensions have arisen because the EU has made it clear it will refuse to sign an overall withdrawal agreement – paving the way for a transition deal and the opening of talks on an EU-UK trade deal – if the UK insists on specifying a date by which customs “backstop” arrangements designed to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland must end.Eurosceptic ministers have insisted, however, that a date must be specified in any deal, to reassure people that the UK is serious about leaving EU structures. The Observer understands that the prime minister will try to get agreement for a compromise position, under which the UK’s intention to leave EU customs arrangements as soon as possible will be spelled out without naming a specific date.Government sources said rumours that the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, might quit were overblown. May will attempt to finalise the terms of a withdrawal deal at a summit in Brussels beginning on Wednesday evening.Meanwhile the difficulties the prime minister will have in pushing any deal she may secure through parliament are highlighted by new analysis that suggests she will have to rely on the support of more than a dozen Labour MPs to avoid her Brexit deal being torpedoed. According to researchers who examined sources including public statements, interviews and voting records of every MP in the House of Commons, May will need at least 14 Labour MPs to support her Brexit plans if they are to be passed in a vote expected to take place at the end of the year.That rises to at least 24 should the DUP end its support for the government, were May to sign up to a Brexit withdrawal agreement that treats Northern Ireland differently from mainland Britain.The stark research by the Edelman public affairs consultancy found that while May needs 320 votes to secure a majority, she can rely on the support of only 277 of the 314 Tory MPs and two former Tories who now sit as independents.It predicts that 18 of the 37 hardline Tory Brexiters are “potentially persuadable”.However, even with them on side, along with the DUP and another independent Northern Irish unionist MP, May is still 14 votes short of a majority.Pawel Swidlicki, the Brexit analyst who led the Edelman research, said: “The good news for the PM is that she has a narrow path towards a majority. The bad news is that this not only requires reconciling the DUP with the backstop, but also winning over a raft of strongly pro-Brexit Tory MPs and a handful of Labour rebels.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1d2114f54f2a25e3d659608228814a4ef2c721a/0_220_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=452794c65089274ac316da7135326d0c","title":"nicola sturgeon touts common sense brexit alternative","story":"Scottish first minister and SNP leader to press case for continued membership of single market and customs unionScotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, is to unveil a “commonsense” alternative to the UK government’s Brexit plans.A new Scottish government paper, due out on Monday, will reinforce the case for continued membership of the single market and customs union, Sturgeon has said.It will also argue the UK government’s “false choice” between a “bad, possibly blindfold” Brexit deal and a no-deal scenario should not be accepted.The release of the paper will come as the first minister and Scottish National party leader gives a speech at the Royal Society of Arts in London on Monday.Speaking in advance of the address, Sturgeon said: “The UK is scheduled to leave the European Union less than six months from now, but both a withdrawal agreement and a clear, detailed statement on the future relationship must be concluded much sooner.“As things stand, we still have no guarantee of a transition agreement or a detailed proposition setting out the future trading relationship between the UK and EU.“The UK government seems intent on presenting a false choice between whatever bad, possibly blindfold, deal they manage to conclude and a no-deal scenario.“However, the Scottish government will this week set out our commonsense, workable alternative and make clear why we believe there is now an opportunity to seize an alternative path.”“MPs and the wider public should not accept the false choice that is being presented. There is an alternative, and our proposals are the only way to truly protect our businesses, people and communities from the worst effects of Brexit.“Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU, and our duty as a government is to work as hard as we can to ensure that vote is respected and for Scotland’s key interests to be protected.“That means staying in the customs union and single market, which is around eight times bigger than the UK market alone.“With time running short, the UK government must take stock and listen to our proposals, which have the interests of the people of Scotland and the rest of the UK at their heart.”The intervention comes after Sturgeon in September warned that extending the timetable for Brexit negotiations must remain on the table if the UK is to “avoid an economic cliff edge”.Last week she closed the SNP’s annual conference in Glasgow with a claim that her party’s goal of independence for Scotland is “clearly in sight”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e582dc11979e39ab0756581ebadd070770078fa5/0_197_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=507a254108c1eba23be0a99486a34c95","title":"barbara ellen strictly sean katya kiss","story":"Seann Walsh and Katya Jones return to show after accusations fly online and in printIf there was tension oozing out of the dance routine performed by Seann Walsh and Katya Jones on this week’s Strictly Come Dancing, then it probably wasn’t of the sexual kind – any more. Performing a pizzeria-themed Charleston (rumoured to have been hurriedly changed from the planned raunchier rumba), the couple almost palpably crackled with nerves, perhaps over-compensating with the fizz and sparkle, while dancing significantly less well than they did with the previous week’s paso doble. Though perhaps this was understandable.Before last week, Walsh, 32, was known for comedy, while Jones, 29, a professional dancer and choreographer, was partnered with Ed Balls in 2016, and won last year’s Strictly with Joe McFadden. All this changed when Walsh and Jones were photographed kissing outside a pub. Jones is married (to the dancer, Neil Jones, who also works on Strictly), while Walsh was in a five-year relationship with the actor, Rebecca Humphries. “Was” being the operative word. While Walsh and Jones publicly apologised, Walsh didn’t apologise directly to Humphries, who ended their relationship in a now-infamous tweet. This relayed how she was left alone on her birthday on the night of the kiss, and that when she’d told Walsh she had suspicions, he “aggressively and repeatedly, called me psychonutsmental, as he had done countless of times when I’ve questioned his inappropriate and hurtful behaviour”. Humphries went on to implore women to “trust your instincts. It’s more than lying. Its controlling”.Obviously, no outsider knows the truth about Walsh and Humphries’ relationship. On the Strictly companion show, It Takes Two, Walsh said that their relationship wasn’t perfect, and “the people that know me most, that love me, they know that I’m not the person I’m being portrayed as”. However, while the nation took sides, some calling for the couple to be axed from the show, what became interesting was how the narrative kept getting dragged back to the kiss. The issue turned into whether – or not – some people were overreacting to a cheeky drunken snog? (Strictly judge, Craig Revel Horwood jokingly said that Walsh and Jones should be made to do “The dance of shame”.)There was also a lot of talk about the so-called “Strictly curse”.However, while the kiss“Strictly curse” would always have got some mileage, the game-changer here was Humphries’ tweet, which was about matters beyond the Strictly bubble, casting an unexpected grim shadow among the sequins and gles. Suddenly, it wasn’t just about stupidity, drunkenness, or the heady intimacy of dance training. This was a description of behaviour that suggested “gaslighting” – where someone has their view of reality distorted by a manipulative partner, and is made to feel hysterical, irrational, or indeed “psycho”. Forget the “Strictly curse” Humphries’ tweet was a Strictly image problem for the family light entertainment show (there were reports that domestic violence charities expressed concerns).Perhaps this explains the determined and occasionally somewhat brittle “Show must go on!” atmosphere on this week’s edition of Strictly, where Walsh and Jones finished fifth on the leader board, with their fate undecided until the results show. While the hosts, Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman made a couple of guarded references to the situation (“It’s been quite a week!”), the main impression this viewer was left with was “brand-protection”, not just for Walsh and Jones, but for the Strictly juggernaut itself. No one wishes to spark a witch-hunt against Walsh.However, it has to be disappointing a year on from #MeToo when a woman talking about an experience seems to be almost nationally “closed down”, or at least brushed over, and the supposed “prurience” of the public becomes the bigger story. Whatever the truth of this week’s events, let’s not pretend that this was ever really about people getting their knickers in a righteous po-faced twist about a cheeky drunken kiss."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17c3cffe783a5cc4be8a8ee9f7e784e6ddfb205c/0_221_3600_2159/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93b4b478c557e2303a1b59f3e69fbe0e","title":"netflix v amazon streaming tv top shows","story":"Netflix and Amazon have invested billions of dollars in producing original content for their streaming platforms. Here are some of their most notable shows.House of CardsA remake of a British classic, the streaming site’s first original showed its competitors that it meant business. The accusations surrounding Kevin Spacey’s alleged behaviour on set saw him fired from the show and leave its final season – which starts on 2 November – in the hands of his co-star Robin Wright.Stranger ThingsThe Duffer Brothers pastiche-athon was a massive sleeper hit for Netflix. Released in the summer of 2016 to little fanfare, it became a smash thanks to its 1980s-tinged nostalgia and straightforward storyline of kids in peril, which had nods to everything from The Goonies and Cujo to Carrie and Stand By Me.The CrownNetflix’s expensive royal drama stands out as one of its most accomplished originals. Lavish but not self-indulgent, brilliantly cast and delicately handled by creator Peter Morgan, it gave Netflix a bona fide top-drawer offering. After two seasons the royals have been recast, and with Olivia Colman and Helena Bonham-Carter taking the lead roles, its best days are probably still to come.BoJack HorsemanAn animated show about a depressed C-list celebrity horse trying to revive his career and life in Hollywood sounds far too odd to work. But Raphael Bob-Waksberg’s idiosyncratic show, now in its fifth season, has become a critical darling, praised for its presentation of mental illness, abusive relationships and the way it carefully critiqued #MeToo.Orange is the New Black One of the first batch of Netflix originals, Jenji Kohan’s prison dramedy, with its heavily black and Latina cast, was quietly revolutionary. Viewers quickly found that the most interesting thing about the show wasn’t necessarily its ostensible lead character. Instead, Kohan made critically adored television by delving into the backgrounds of the prison’s inmates. It has lost momentum more recently as the series competes for attention with other, bigger-budget Netflix shows, but OITNB showed early on that the streaming site was going to do things differently.TransparentJill Soloway’s semi-autobiographical story, about an LA family whose patriarch transitions, is Amazon’s best-known and most controversial original. Critically adored (eight Emmys and two Golden Globes), the show gave Jeff Bezos’s TV team what they needed: a respected prestige show. But allegations of on-set sexual assault by lead actor Jeffrey Tambor have made a fifth series increasingly unlikely.All or Nothing: Man CityAmazon followed Netflix’s lurch into European football after its competitor released the fluffy First Team: Juventus. All or Nothing started life as a warts-and-all NFL docu-series, and Man City gave access which showed the highly strung management style and approach of Pep Guardiola and his backroom staff. Released after the team’s record-breaking 2017-8 season, it was a success for Amazon and Man City.The Marvelous Mrs MaiselFew would have predicted seven Emmys this year for a series about a Jewish housewife who starts an alternative life as a standup comic, by Gilmore Girls showrunner Amy Sherman-Palladino. But the tight writing and compelling central performance from Rachel Brosnahan gave Amazon’s easy-to-overlook comedy a dedicated audience. The second season is due in November.The Grand TourThe vastly lucrative vehicle for Jeremy Clarkson and co was seen as a crucial part of Amazon’s TV – and overall – strategy. How do you get middle-aged men who don’t really watch TV to sign up for Prime? Give them a show that’s tailor-made to their demographic.

Will hopes be dashed as they were in 2016?by  David Taylor in Springfield, New JerseyIn a side-room at TGI Fridays off US Highway 22, the chicken wings are free, but the beer is not. The talk is optimistic, but the recent memories of vivid disappointment are right there under the surface.Above the bar, subtitled television pundits are previewing a tense night of winner-takes-all October baseball.And in the booths by the window, Democrats have come to meet the candidate they hope is part of a rising wave set to overwhelm Donald Trump and the Republicans in the midterm elections in November.“I’m still traumatised by 2016 we all are,” said social worker Christine Ribaudo, one of the first to arrive at the event to meet Tom Malinowski, the Democratic candidate trying to unseat Republican Leonard Lance, who has represented New Jersey’s seventh congressional district for 10 years. “I’m taking nothing for granted this time.”For months it had seemed that the political energy across the US was all with the outraged Democrats. First, there were strong special election results leaving a trail of clues in traditional Republican heartlands like Kansas, Alabama and western Pennsylvania. Then there was the emergence of a new wave of highly motivated leftwing candidates such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York winning primary contests to force out older, male and often more centrist Democrats.After two years of protest and activism, Democrats out for revenge began to dream of neutering Trump by taking back both the House and the Senate from Republican control in the 6 November elections. Each fresh Trump stumble seemed to drive the president’s hardcore supporters further underground and raise Democratic hopes.But the ugly battle over the supreme court confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh has changed the mood, given an energy boost to Republicans and left Democrats wondering if they might be heading for another soul-crushing result.For Democrats, the comeback has to start in places like this TGI Fridays in Springfield, New Jersey, – a district that goes from rural farmland in the west, via Trump’s expensive Bedminster golf club in the middle, to the built-up east, where commuters have a daily battle to reach New York City.“Exciting, isn’t it?” said Ribaudo. “It feels like we are in a very energized district.”The district has sent a Republican to Congress for 37 years, but it is one of 25 Republican-held House seats across the United States where Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential race. The calculation sounds simple: win 23 of them and the Democrats would have gained enough ground to take back control of the House. With control of the House, they would gain the power to block, investigate and even attempt to impeach Trump.Public confidence in polling has been sorely undermined since 2016, when virtually every pundit and poll failed to foresee a Trump victory. But in lieu of hard facts, every new poll that indicates a strengthened Republican lead in traditional strongholds like Tennessee and Texas heightens the impression that they have momentum.Add to the mix that Trump is back in full cry night after night telling his rallies about the danger posed to America by Democrats who he claims have become an “angry leftwing mob”.So, is the great Democratic surge about to collapse?“It’s not a naturally occurring weather event. We have to make it happen,” said Malinowski, the Democratic candidate in New Jersey 7, who once served in Barack Obama’s state department. “It’s not something any responsible candidate in a swing district can count on. We have to do it ourselves, one congressional district at a time.”Cautious and careful in his answers, the Polish-born former Washington director for Human Rights Watch thinks his race is first and foremost about economic issues. Trump’s tax reforms will hit this district of middle-class homeowners who face new limits on reclaiming their high local and state taxes.“No sane person with recent American political history in mind would be too confident. But it feels like a very close race and I think that also will inspire people to turn out. Most Americans live in a congressional district where they know who’s gonna win,” he said. “This is one of the few where the outcome is in doubt and therefore our votes count for more. There is a scenario where this district tips the balance in Washington. I think that will inspire people to come out.”Two fragments of evidence are encouraging Democrats to believe their voters are ready to turn out this November in numbers that make it feel more like a presidential election year.First, the number of registered Democrats in the district has increased by 33,000 since 2014. The same pattern is visible in at least 19 key seats across the countryThen there are the women.For most of the two years since Trump won the presidency, it has become obvious that women have been highly organised in their opposition to him and his policies. Many more women are running for office or finding direction and purpose through a network of grassroots groups that did not exist in 2016.Take freelance editor and mother of two Lillian Duggan. Five days after Trump’s win she set up a Facebook group in her hometown that has become a grassroots community advocacy organisation with a board of nine women, a weekly newsletter that goes to 450 people and more than 2,300 members on social media.Duggan had a modest history of activism – mostly phone calls in aid of Obama and Clinton campaigns, but has had her life taken over by the group, Westfield 2020, which has lobbied politicians at the state level, demonstrated outside Lance’s office, helped flip the Westfield town council to Democratic control and is now active in getting voters out.“We have a chance of winning,” she said. “The polls seem to be a dead heat but we are trying not to pay too much attention to that – polls can be wrong as we all learned a couple years ago.“We know it’s easy for us to feel the energy, see the signs up on lawns in our towns and feel very positive, but the reality is we’re not representative of the entire district. There are places that are more conservative.”In Warren county’s Washington Township, once a hub of musical instrument manufacture, the Washington Diner serves the American classics along with both CNN and Fox News on screens above the counter.But at the other end of West Washington Avenue, there was no such bipartisan spirit on show. Mena Shaddow, 70, and Jennifer English, 50, were staging a pro-life vigil outside a Planned Parenthood clinic where they intended to have a presence for 40 days as part of a global anti-abortion campaign.Both women voted for Trump. “There’s a lot of things he doesn’t need to say – he’s got a big mouth – but I think he genuinely cares for people,” English said. “He’s certainly not perfect, but I do believe his heart is in the right place – and he has stayed faithful to the pro-life cause.”Asked about the likelihood of a Democratic surge in November, Shaddow said: “I don’t think that is going to happen at all. The media see what they want to see – the reason Trump won has carried over,” she said, emphasising that he is a businessman and not a politician and has done in office what he said he would.“There’s a lot of us,” she said. “I’m sorry if that’s not what you wanted to hear.”In suburban parts of major US cities, college-educated women are seen as a potentially decisive force that could help Democrats make gains in the House, in governor’s races and in state legislatures.However, the Senate is a much harder proposition for the Democrats, even though Republicans hold a seemingly tenuous 51-49 grip on power.As Charlie Cook, editor of the Cook Political Report, put it: “It’s like there are two different elections taking place. One for House, governor, state legislature where there is a very clear blue wave out there for Democrats and I think Dems are gonna have a really, really good year.“In the US Senate it’s like that election is being held in a different country and a different year. You can have a really big wave but for that wave to reach West Virginia and Indiana, North Dakota, that’s kinda hard.”Cook is tipping the Democrats to make gains of between 25 and 45 seats to take control of the House.Money matters too, and Democratic candidates are outraising Republicans in dozens of House races – limiting the ability of secretive dark money from Super Pacs being used to overwhelm them.“This blue wave is turning into a green avalanche in that Dems are burying Republicans in cash. Their fundraising has shattered records,” David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report said.It turned out that Donald Trump was a better fundraiser for the Democrats than Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi ever were.”In Westfield, Lillian Duggan said dismay at Trump’s 2016 victory had created a new sense of purpose and community.“I have met so many people in my town I didn’t know before, or found people I didn’t know had similar values and concerns. People just didn’t talk about it then.”And if that blue wave does not materialise and November brings only another defeat? “Well, I think we rest up and collect ourselves and figure out how to address the issues.“If we don’t win this race, 2020 is not going away.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f021d5d158195249562ab3c772c6589da6d2c44e/0_316_3813_2287/master/3813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eecc7105eae582260c524015220b42b6","title":"armistice day 100 years on share your letters stories and photographs","story":"Whether your family members or friends were in active service, or in some supporting role at home or abroad, we’d like to hear their storiesSunday 11 November this year will mark 100 years since the armistice treaty was signed between first world war allies and Germany, bringing to an end four years of war in western Europe.On that day people in Britain celebrated by pouring out onto the streets and gathering in large places.

Half an hour before he arrived for his appointment, Turkish national staff working in the building were told to take the rest of the day off.As mobile phones are not allowed inside the diplomatic building, Khashoggi left his iPhone with his fiancée, Hatice Cengiz, who was to wait for him outside, and told her to raise the alarm if he did not emerge after more than four hours. He kept on his person an Apple watch synced to his phone, which Turkish officials have said is now a focus of the investigation.Khashoggi entered through the main door, was greeted by an official and ushered to the consul general’s office. Turkish officials have told Middle East Eye that two men then entered the room and dragged Khashoggi to another where they killed him. His body was taken to a third room where it was dismembered, the officials said. The hit squad reportedly brought a bone saw with them for the purpose.Several outlets have reported that Khashoggi was tortured before he was killed. Al-Jazeera said a consulate source in the building at the time heard screams and calls for help before a “sudden silence”.Cengiz waited outside until about 1am for Khashoggi to return.Sources have told the  that six cars with diplomatic plates were thought to have carried the Saudi officials and Khashoggi or his body to the consul general’s house on Meselik Street, 200 metres away. Staff at the house were surprised to be asked not to come to work that day.All of the cars spent several hours in a garage under the house. Four are thought to be of interest to the murder inquiry. Prosecutors are considering digging up the garden of the consular residence in the search for Khashoggi’s remains.Despite having booked rooms for three nights, the Saudi team collected their belongings and checked out of the hotels on Tuesday evening. The two private jets later left Istanbul Atatürk airport, one travelling via Cairo and the other via Dubai, with both arriving in Riyadh the next day.Saudi officials have said the many allegations are baseless. Riyadh maintains that Khashoggi left the consulate soon after he arrived and the authorities do not know where he is.Turkey began delicate inquiries into Khashoggi’s disappearance, requesting Saudi Arabia’s help and permission to search the six-storey consulate building.On Friday, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman said in an interview with Bloomberg in Riyadh that the Turkish authorities were welcome to search the consulate building. He declined to say whether Khashoggi was facing any charges at home, adding: “If he’s in Saudi Arabia, I would know that.”The Reuters news agency was given a tour of the Saudi consulate on Saturday to prove that the missing journalist was not being detained there. In the afternoon, Turkish prosecutors confirmed that an investigation had been opened.At about midnight, Turkish officials leaked to news outlets that their intelligence suggested Khashoggi had been killed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7bf23350d0e4c1fc52292146d3bf1c179f90319/0_141_4226_2535/master/4226.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b2c7de692c862794065dd174fee78d5","title":"merkel bavarian allies brace for bruising in state election","story":"Sunday’s poll likely to increase tensions within Germany’s fragile coalition government Angela Merkel’s Bavarian allies are heading for their worst state election result in more than 60 years in a regional vote on Sunday that is likely to increase tensions within Germany’s fragile coalition government.Voting stations opened on Sunday with sunny weather likely to help turnout. Broadcasters are expected to publish exit polls shortly after 6pm (5pm BST).This could complicate the efforts of the CSU state premier, Markus Söder, to form a stable coalition government in Bavaria.The splintered result could force Söder, who has ruled out a coalition with the AfD, into an awkward alliance with the Greens.Horst Seehofer, the CSU party leader and interior minister in Merkel’s federal government, could face calls to give up at least one of his posts following the Bavarian election as his hardline rhetoric against asylum seekers is likely to scare away voters.“We’ve lost trust because of the CSU,” Volker Bouffier, the deputy party leader of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU), told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper. He accused Seehofer of damaging the image of the CDUCSU conservative alliance. Bouffier is state premier in Hesse, where an election will be held later this month.Seehofer has been among Merkel’s fiercest critics following her decision in 2015 to welcome more than 1 million asylum-seekers. He has gradually shifted the CSU, the sister party to the CDU, to the right to counter the rise of the AfD.Divisions between the conservative allies have widened in recent months after an inconclusive national election last year forced them into a coalition with the left-leaning SPD. Merkel’s fourth and probably final government has already come close to collapsing twice, in arguments over immigration and a scandal over Germany’s former domestic spymaster.The parties are also at odds over how to phase out polluting diesel cars and whether to grant tax cuts for the rich.The Bavarian election followed a mass protest in Berlin on Saturday in which more than 200,000 people demonstrated against racism, xenophobia and the rise of the far right."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b944d0b16934e350b119ac23062972e52cd176b6/0_119_2952_1772/master/2952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88f62f99582a521ae758df04fc71f44a","title":"sinicisation of muslims in xinjiang must go on says chinese official","story":"Official warns of ‘infiltration of religious extremism’ amid crackdown on region’s large Muslim populationThe “sinicisation” of religion in China’s troubled north-western region of Xinjiang must be upheld to promote ethnic solidarity and religious harmony, a senior Communist party official has said.China’s state-run Xinhua news agency quoted You Quan, the head of the “united front work department”, which oversees ethnic and religious affairs, while on a visit this week to Xinjiang, home to a large Muslim population.“The party’s leadership over religious work must be upheld,” You said, adding that “the infiltration of religious extremism must be guarded against”.Sinicisation refers to non-Chinese societies being forced to conform to Chinese culture, particularly that of the ethnic Han majority.

Indeed many people view golf courses as unnaturally green, overly landscaped spaces which have replaced heathlands, parklands or farmland.But a group of golfers in the north Dublin golf links at Portmarnock are keen to dispel any perception of golfers as not being nature lovers. These amateur naturalists – Vincent Sex, Pat Byrne and golf links manager, Gary Johnstone – have produced an impressive illustrated guide to the flora and fauna of Portmarnock Golf Club to celebrate the club’s 125th anniversary in 2019.One of the oldest golf clubs in Ireland, the land at Portmarnock was originally owned by the Jameson whiskey-making family.“We were looking for a project,” says Sex, who sees the publication as a new approach to recording the species in our leisure environments. The close-up photographs of birds, insects, animals, plants and funghi in the book were donated by local photographers. Illustrations of flowers including orchids by the well-known botanical artist, Susan Sex (Vincent’s wife) are also included.“We observed species as we played golf, and this is something that could be replicated by other golf clubs around Ireland,” says Sex. “We can co-exist well with nature,” adds Byrne. To manage the costs, 350 hardback books were pre-ordered at €40 each. These sales covered the printing of 1,700 copies. The softback copies are available for €20 each to club members, friends and the wider community.Golf links (golf courses that link sea and land) such as that at Portmarnock have an interesting mix of habitats.Portmarnock Golf Club is accessed via the golf links road, which also has a public car park to the east of the village and includes more than 200 hectares of land on a peninsula with the Irish Sea on one side and Baldoyle estuary on the other. It incorporates a special area of conservation (Baldoyle Bay) and a special protection area for birds, monitored by the National Parks and Wildlife Services.“The estuary is important for migrating birds such as great crested grebes, egrets, curlews and sandpipers. We also see brent geese, terns and oystercatchers. Sometimes, we even get peregrine falcons feeding here,” says Sex.Johnstone describes the different habitats on the 27-hole golf course as he takes me around the course on a golf buggy. “There is a salt marsh and mudflats, mobile and fixed dune belts, grassland, scrubland and some Monterey pine trees, which were introduced to prevent erosion,” he says.Johnstone says some of the mown grass sections of the golf course can act as “environment corridors” that foxes, hares, short-eared owls and other animals can move freely across to get to the wilder areas on the golf links. He points to water holes on the course, the entirety of which is an aquifer between the estuary and the sea. Dragonflies and damselflies are often seen on the reed beds. Bird boxes and insect hotels have also been introduced in locations throughout the course.Originally from Aberdeen in Scotland, Johnstone has been the links manager at Portmarnock for 11 years.“Ireland, England and Scotland are famous the world over for their golf links, and Americans try to copy this type of course by introducing sand,” he explains. Other golf courses are usually constructed on parkland (with areas of woodland and grassland) or moorland or heath with bogs as part of the landscape.Managing the wild areas of Portmarnock Golf Course is not without its challenges. Over the years, the tidal flow has changed the boundaries on the sea side of the peninsula and rock armoury has been introduced at one point to prevent further erosion. However, in all, about 30 acres (12 hectares) have been gained over the past few decades, and you can see earlier tidal markers now landlocked.“About 35 per cent of the entire course is managed, but we also manage the wild areas to maintain the natural character as much as possible,” says Johnstone. For example, native slow-growing grass species are introduced to maintain the quality of certain surfaces, and sea buckthorn shrub – originally from New Zealand – is a particular strong invasive species that has to be cut back from time to time.Sex adds that Portmarnock golf course is a special environment colonised by many bird species and insects.“Most golf courses have an environmental policy now, but we have a specific obligation to look after the environment here because there are so many bird species. The secret of good green-keeping is that nothing interferes with the golfer if you do it right,” he says.Golfers and environmentalists don’t have to be arch enemies, according to those who belong to both camps. In the United States, members of the American Society of Golf Course Architects suggest that the most memorable courses are those that harmonise with their natural surroundings and use the restrictive conditions that the natural landscape offers to maximum benefit.An environmental approach to golf-course development will protect and restore wetlands, streams and wildlife habitats, avoid the felling of trees and preserve natural vegetation, minimise irrigation needs and protect water quality.Minimising chemical sprays, using rainwater harvesting as a water source for watering greens, leaving wild areas unmanaged and putting up insect hotels, bird and bat boxes will also encourage greater bioersity.Some experts point to the increased erosion on coastal golf courses in the UK and Ireland caused by storm surges and sea level rises.

The UK environmental charity, the Climate Coalition, says that every links golf course across the UK is in danger of disappearing in the next 100 years.Flooding of golf courses is another phenomenon which might convince the non-environmentally minded golfers that it is high time to put nature first if they want to continue enjoying their game."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3661355.1539349229!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"storm ophelia counting the cost of the devastation one year on","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSean Hogan, chairman at the National Emergency Coordination Centre, at a press conference to announce details of storm Ophelia. Photograph: Cyril ByrneThe Storm Ophelia caused almost €70 million worth of damage after it tore across Ireland on October 16th last year.The tropical revolving storm developed from the strongest eastern Atlantic storm in a century-and-a-half of records and brought wind speeds of 191 kmh to parts of Ireland.It left more than 385,000 homes without power, tore the roofs off many buildings and effectively shut down the country for two days as the majority of workplaces closed shop during the red weather warning.Ophelia also led to the deaths of three people in Ireland Clare O’Neill (58) was killed when a tree struck her car in Co Waterford, Michael Pyke (31) was killed when he was using a chainsaw to clear a fallen tree in Co Tipperary and Fintan Goss (33) was killed when the car in which he was travelling in was struck by a tree in Co Louth.One year on, we look back at how much money was spent to repair the damage left in its wake and who is still left picking up the pieces from its aftermath.The Department of Education allocated €898,000 for emergency repair funds while the ESB spent €15.6 million getting power back to houses and businesses across the country.Insurance Ireland estimates the cost of insurance pay-outs due to Ophelia-related damage at €45 million, while local authorities spent just over €7 million on immediate damage repairs.The Department of Transport spent €100,000 on repairs to the roof of the Red Cow Luas depot.Those figures add up to €68.6 million - but has everyone who was affected been able to get back on their feet?In January, Minister for Housing and Local Government Eoghan Murphy revealed the Government had given over €7 million to local authorities for immediate damage repair following Storm Ophelia.The biggest portion of this money went to Co Cork, whose county and city councils received a combined €3,479,303.This funding covered staff overtime and the hire of plant and contractors for immediate clean-up works, but did not cover any infrastructural damage - that would have to go through the relevant departments.The Department of Education was left with one of the biggest bills, allocating €898,000 for emergency repair works to schools.To date, the department has only spent €35,000 of this allocation, as it awaits the completion of a tendering process for the repair works.The largest project approved for funding is Douglas Community School in Cork, where the roof of its sports hall was ripped off during the storm.It was reported in February that the school had secured approval from the Department to spend €550,000 on the repair works.Efforts to contact the school to find out what stage the works were at were unsuccessful, however the Department said “the school authority in Douglas Community School has completed the design and specification stages of the project and is currently advancing the tender process”.Meanwhile, the ESB spent €15.6 million restoring power to 385,000 homes and replacing poles, transformers and cables which had been ripped up by the 190kmh winds.“The effort saw the replacement of 3,000 poles, 500 transformers and 700km of conductor cable – enough to stretch from Malin Head to Mizen Head,” the ESB said in a statement.Customers will see that their bills have risen this year after the ESB was given permission to recover their losses as part of the 201819 tariff.In comparison to other severe weather events over the last 10 years, figures from Insurance Ireland show that Hurricane Ophelia was on the lower end of the scale in terms of insured losses.Record-breaking arctic temperatures which gripped the country for over 20 days in January 2010 caused €297 million in insured losses, while similar conditions in December 2010 caused €224 million in insured losses.More recent weather events, such as the flooding caused by Storm Desmond and Storm Frank in December 2015 and January 2016, caused €70 million in insured losses.That said, the €45 million of insured losses caused by Storm Ophelia last year is the biggest figure seen since 2015.Turners Cross stadium in Cork city was one of many buildings to have suffered severe structural damage during the storm.Ophelia ripped half the roof off the Derrynane Road stand of the stadium and caused the remaining half of the roof to collapse.The stadium, which is owned by the Munster Football Association, reopened in March 2018 after €160,000 was spent repairing the damage.Gerard Delaney, the administrator for the Munster Football Association, said they received insurance money as well as a grant through the FAI and Uefa to cover the repair works."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3660278.1539269071!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit the truck driver and 20 tonnes of frozen chicken","story":"Simon Carswell travels with truck driver Stephen Heasley to find out how post-Brexit customs checks could affect food supplies. Video: Simon Carswell\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHaulier Stephen Heasley  at Manfreight  in Portadown, Co Armagh. Photograph: Liam McBurney for The Stephen Heasley carries out a few final checks at the back of the lorry to make sure the load is secure.As a cold mist drifts down over him from the minus-22-degree air inside, he pulls at a metal bar that will keep the 20-plus tonnes of frozen chicken in his refrigerated lorry in place for the 620km journey – lasting 12 bumpy hours – to the east midlands of England.The chicken has come from a processing plant in Dungannon, Co Tyrone and before that from Northern Irish farms. Our destination is a cold-storage facility outside Grantham in Lincolnshire. Grantham is probably best known as the birthplace of Margaret Thatcher, but it’s also one of the locations where Northern Irish chickens are dismembered, sent for repackaging and distributed to supermarket chains such as Tesco, Sainsburys and Aldi across the United Kingdom and Ireland.It is another type of dismembering that Heasley and other hauliers fear most: the chopping-up of delicately balanced supply chains. These ensure that animals reared in one island and processed in another can be prepared for customers across both jurisdictions, guaranteeing that products maintain the commercially viable shelf life of five to six days that keeps supplies flowing and money changing hands.The UK voted to leave the European Union 28 months ago and yet, with less than six months to go to “Brexit Day” (the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm British time on Friday, March 29th, 2019), British and European politicians have not agreed an exit deal. Such a deal would protect those supply chains while both sides hammer out a longer-term agreement governing future trading between the world’s second-largest economic bloc and its fifth-largest economy.Heasley – a 43-year-old from Lisburn, Co Antrim – knows the road ahead better than most. He has made the journey from Portadown, Co Armagh, across the Northern Ireland-Republic of Ireland Border and on to Dublin Port, Holyhead and then England many, many times in his two-decade career driving lorries.“Watch yourself, there’s a bump coming up,” he says, pointing into the distance to a ridge you still can’t see, minutes after we have pulled out of the haulage yard of Manfreight, the Portadown company he works for.You tend to feel most things on the road in a 44-tonne, 500-horsepower Volvo FH4 lorry, particularly with a load of between £40,000 (€46,000) and £60,000 (€68,000) worth of frozen chickens in the back.Heasley and hauliers like him feel Brexit more keenly than most of us, but they know too that the political road ahead is difficult to navigate.Transport companies such as Manfreight have developed decades-long supply routes, carefully managed on delicate profit margins and strictly regulated man-hours for the company’s 180 drivers. For these businesses, which rely on certainty, Brexit is chaos. Nobody knows what will happen, and planning ahead is complex.“There is nothing an average man or company can do because they don’t know what is going to happen,” says Heasley, 11 kilometres from what is right now an invisible border.“They don’t know what they can do. They just don’t want delays.”From Portadown, it is about 140km to Dublin Port. Heasley knows he can make the 8.40pm Stena Line to Holyhead in plenty of time. There is little traffic on the road this Wednesday evening.Less than an hour into our journey, as we approach the Border, the Volvo truck is powering ahead steadily at 56mph, or 90kmh. Suddenly, the continuous white line on the side of the road becomes a broken yellow one, and roadside signs turn bilingual, in Irish and English. Speeds and distances now appear in kilometres rather than miles. These are the only indicators that we have crossed the Border at Carrickcarnan, Co Louth.“Other than that, you wouldn’t know the difference,” says Heasley.Brexit has left a dark cloud of uncertainty over this border road and the rest of the 499km frontier from Carlingford Lough to Lough Foyle.While the EU and UK have said they want to avoid a hard border post-Brexit, they still have not agreed a plan to achieve this. Both have agreed that within the treaty covering the UK’s exit from the EU there must be a “backstop” – a guarantee to have no hard border unless and until a future trade deal offers a better solution to avoid one – but no backstop has been agreed.It has become the most intractable part of the Brexit negotiations, threatening to scupper an overall exit deal and heightening the pressure on EU and UK negotiators to agree some compromise for this week’s crunch EU summit in Brussels.“Nobody is actually sure what’s going to happen with the Border,” says Heasley, eyes fixed on the road ahead. “We’re hoping for transport companies’ sake and the customers’ sake that there are no border crossing checks and no security, because it will have an impact on us as drivers and the loads we are carrying.”He explains that under EU rules heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers must have a 11-hour rest every day, though it can be reduced to nine hours, three times a week. That means from the moment a driver starts driving, they have a 15-hour period – a “spread-over,” Heasley calls it – to get their goods to a destination.And there are plenty of goods heading to destinations on these roads. The Revenue Commissioners estimates that 13,000 commercial vehicles cross the Border every day. The UK’s Freight Transport Association has warned that a bad or no-deal Brexit could lead to “near-paralysis of freight” at the Border.Some Northern Irish hauliers have tried to Brexit-proof their businesses. Manfreight has opened an office in Clonshaugh, north of Dublin. Others are unwilling to invest without knowing what Brexit will likely bring.“It is that lack of clarity, people are unwilling to take a gamble,” says Seamus Leheny, policy manager at the Freight Transport Association in Northern Ireland.Driving across the Border, we have about an hour and a half to make the 8.40pm ferry. If we miss that boat, the next one from Dublin Port to Holyhead is at 2.15am. This would mean pulling out of the port at Holyhead on the other side of the Irish Sea at around 6.15am. With more than four hours driving still to go to reach Grantham – and with Heasley’s 15-hour spread-over expiring at 9am – he would not get there in time.“That is what a driver is up against,” he says. “If I was out of time, they would have to find another driver to lift that food. It might not be our man it might be a subbie. You have all that additional cost either way.”The margin of error is extremely narrow. Any kind of delay on the Irish Border after Brexit could knock a tight schedule for a haulier like Heasley out.“The boat waits for no man. It is not interested because some customs man kept me for an hour or two up the road,” he says.Heasley’s colleague Henry Totten, a 75-year-old who has been driving since he was 21, knows about delays at the Border better than most from his days transporting goods north and south at the height of the Troubles. Checks on the goods he was hauling had to be carried out by customs agents on either side of the Border, in both Newry and Dundalk, and then at the Border itself, adding up to five hours to a journey time.“You were wasting half a day no matter what way you looked at it,” he says.Carrying “groupage” – a mix of goods collected from different customers to create an economic full-load – made customs checks even more complicated, he recalls.“You could have sat there all day. The customs official could have said, ‘I want to see such and such an article,’ and you would have to take half the load off to get to it,” says Totten.Now he can complete a run from Northern Ireland to Cork and back in a single day.“It is the best thing since penicillin,” says Totten of the invisible border that has been in place for more than 20 years. “You have no stops to do.”We make good time to Dublin. There was just a two-minute slow-down at an M1 toll booth north of Dublin city and some light traffic heading into Dublin Port.Heasley drives into the holding lorry park at the port with 28 minutes to spare before the ferry leaves.The port is Ireland’s busiest for freight by some distance. Central Statistics Office figures show that 992,295 loaded freight vehicles and trailers passed through the port in 2017. It is a key transit point to access the UK from Ireland and over the so-called UK “land-bridge” to continental Europe.The Freight Transport Association estimates that 60 per cent of the 475,000 freight containers shipped to Britain have their final destination in Britain and that most of the remainder ends up being transported on to other parts of the EU.Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones said on a visit to Dublin this week that some 70 per cent of goods moving between Ireland and Britain pass through Holyhead and Pembroke Dock, the other Welsh port for freight transportation. “Any kind of delay is bad. It is not just bad in terms of being able to export from Ireland into Great Britain, but onward traffic going through Dover into the continent. This point has been made to me by Irish haulage companies,” Jones says.Any collapse in Brexit talks could hurt Ireland’s trade with the UK and the rest of the EU. There is lots at stake: Ireland exported €14.8 billion of goods to the UK in 2016 – 12.5 per cent of all the country’s exports, while it imported €20.5 billion – 28 per cent of all imports coming into the country, according to the Central Statistics Office.As Heasley drives his lorry into the port, an official tells him that all the “plug-ins” on the boat have been taken. This means he cannot plug into an electricity mains to keep his refrigerator running. Trucks are prohibited from running their own engines for the duration of the roughly 3½-hour sailing to Wales.Heasley’s chickens are frozen so it is not a problem on this trip, but if he was carrying fresh “just-in-time” products such as dairy items – yoghurts, ice cream and the like – or “something that is a bit vulnerable”, he would need a plug-in. Otherwise, “a lollipop would run off a stick,” he says.At the check-in hut at the port, Heasley discovers he is not booked onto the ferry. There has been a mix-up. He makes a phone call back to Manfreight and, a few minutes later, Heasley has our tickets in his hand.Eighteen minutes after arriving at the port – and with no checks of his goods on board – he drives onto the ferry at 8.30pm, the third-last lorry onto the boat with 10 minutes to spare before departure.Upstairs, we tuck into a meal of meatballs and chips in the Truckers’ Restaurant, surrounded by grey-looking drivers dressed in checked shirts, combat T-shirts and baseball caps.Heasley says that some of the chicken we are transporting will end up being served in fast-food restaurants back in Ireland after being processed and breaded in another factory before being distributed to customers. This is how circular supply chains work in Britain and Ireland. The economies are more closely intertwined than many consumers realise.He explains the meticulous choreography of supply chains: hauliers often have a set time to deliver food produce to a distribution centre in time for other lorries to transport it on to other processing centres.Brexit and border hold-ups could mean missing a crucial delivery window, landing additional costs on the haulier. Regular delays might even lead to the loss of contracts to suppliers operating closer to the distribution centre. It is all about maintaining the critical shelf life of products. Fail to do so, and costs could increase and availability of products could fall.“Down the line, everybody will pay for it,” says Heasley. “It is going to have an impact across the board.”A day before our journey, Heasley’s boss, Chris Slowey, Manfreight’s owner, explains that drivers are the biggest commodity in the haulage business, and a driver being delayed for one 24-hour cycle a week because of Brexit would mean a requirement for 20 per cent more drivers when there are shortages of drivers generally.“If each driver of ours loses a day, it would effectively mean we would have to renegotiate all our rates with our customers,” he says, explaining the havoc Brexit could cause freight operators.“From an exam to a marriage, you have a period of preparation because you know what is coming. With Brexit there are so many unknowns,” he says.On the ferry over dinner, Heasley explains other challenges lorry drivers face on the road: diesel stolen from tanks while drivers sleep in their cabs “curtain sider” lorries being knifed open and goods stolen toilet emergencies.An unintended consequence of Brexit-related delays at borders could lead to a boom in sales of Lucozade and Oasis drinks bottles, both popular with lorry drivers who have to answer the call of nature on the road. “They have a wider neck,” Heasley explains. He makes clear this is not something he resorts to himself.Four hours after driving onto the ferry in Dublin, Heasley drives down the ramp at Holyhead. Apart from a short delay as a result of congestion from hundreds of trucks disembarking from two ferries arriving at the same time in Wales, we are out of the port within 13 minutes. Only one piece of paperwork is handed in to a port official.“Everything’s smooth. Everything’s all right,” says Heasley as he heads for the dual-carriageway and the M56 to take us to the M6, the motorway spine running down the west of England from the Scottish border.Heasley explains that the majority of Manfreight’s traffic goes “over the top” via ports at Larne and Cairnryan, through Scotland and down into England. This route makes sense for deliveries in the north of England because there is less driving time required, but a lower speed limit in Scotland is a big downside.The strict limits on driving times determines everything, however.“Going through Dublin tends to be easier,” says Heasley. “If a man’s going to the south of England, it just means it brings you out in the middle of England so you have less driving time.”Barrelling down near-empty roads as we cross into England, Heasley says he was not among the 56 per cent of Northern Irish voters who elected to remain in the EU in the June 2016 referendum. He voted Leave along with other “lorry men” because of strict EU rules on drivers and their hours, and the heavy fixed penalties that enforce them.The damage he saw to lorries at Calais port in France during the migrant crisis also encouraged him to vote Leave. Information shared on lorry driver groups on Facebook about what was happening to the lorries and drivers helped to sway his vote, he says.“People never knew when they voted what the impact of Brexit was going to be,” he says.He points to the British morning TV interview with Brexiteer Nigel Farage the day after the referendum, when Farage admitted that the Leave campaign misled the public about EU money going to the health service post-Brexit.Does he regret voting to leave now?“Aye,” says Heasley. “I believe Brexit is going to impact on our cost of living, so I do. It is going to be more expensive for a man to run a haulage company now than it was previously. People don’t understand that. I never understood that at the time.”And if he had the opportunity to vote again? “I wouldn’t have voted Leave,” he says.As Heasley explains the challenges around the EU regulations, he grimaces – and it has nothing to do with the regulations. “That’s a rabbit I just killed there,” he says.Our early-morning discussion turns to roadkill, the perils of speeding, his advice for trainee drivers and his favourite route (dawn on the West Pennines, he says).“I killed a deer one time on the A75 in Scotland . . . bigger than a dog,” he says.Heasley pulls into a services stop near Crewe in England, still almost two hours from our destination in Grantham. He has hit his four-hour driving limit so, under EU regulations, he has to take a 45-minute break.Inside, we grab a tea and coffee and some chocolate. Heasley explains the dietary toll and the poor physical shape this gruelling work life leaves some lorry men in. Heasley sometimes likes to walk up and down factory yards for exercise after “tipping” his loads.After Heasley’s compulsory 45-minute rest-up and a quick check that the temperature around the chickens is still well below freezing, we are back on the road.Still in darkness, Heasley navigates a final dangerous junction, waiting a few minutes for a safe gap to cross two lanes of fast-moving oncoming traffic. The morning commuters are on the road. A little after 6am, we pull in to our destination: the cold store in Grantham.Heasley exchanges paperwork at a check-in hut and pulls around the back. He opens the back door for the first time since Portadown and reverses the six-axle lorry slowly up to a hatch for the chickens to be unloaded.It is completed in 19 minutes, leaving him with more than two hours still to go within his driving limit. That is enough time to head north and make his next collection point for his return back to Portadown “over the top” via Scotland.“Smooth and no delays,” he says of the 12-hour, 22-minute door-to-door trip.Brexit will likely make this journey rougher, he acknowledges, given the potential for delays at the Irish Border or at Holyhead once the UK is no longer in the the EU.“Come March it is a different story, all uncertain,” he says, before starting the next leg of his journey.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Tom HonanThe Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has made a number of new ministerial appointment on Saturday morning following the shock resignation of Denis Naughten last week.Richard Bruton has been appointed Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, replacing Mr Naughten.The appointment of Mr Bruton will be seen as placing a steady pair of hands at the helm of the department as it struggles to regain control of the €500 million broadband project. Government Chief Whip Joe McHugh has been appointed Minister for Education and Skills, replacing Mr Bruton. Minister of State Sean Kyne is promoted to Chief Whip and Minister for the Gaeltacht and the islands. Galway East Independent TD Seán Canney is to be appointment Minister of State at the Departments of Rural and Community Development and Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.The appointments are subject to the approval of the Dáil and the Cabinet.In a statement posted on Twitter, Mr Bruton said he was looking forward to working “on some of the most crucial issues currently facing the country”, in the new role. “I am committed to implementing the National Broadband Plan, which will deliver broadband to over 500,000 homes, schools and businesses across the country,” he said. While the changes do not alter the arithmetic for the Government – as Mr Canney has traditionally voted with it – giving him a ministerial portfolio solidifies his support. Political focus will now turn to whether political overtures are made by the Taoiseach to other Independent TDs in a bid to secure additional support. Galway West TD Noel Grealish said on Saturday that he would support the Government during a “critical” phase of the Brexit negotiations.Mr Canney was a former member of the Independent Alliance, before leaving the grouping in May this year. Under his new position he will be responsible for rural affairs and natural resources. The working majority of the Government was threatened this week following the resignation of Mr Naughten over a controversy which has thrown the future of the national broadband plan into question. Mr Naughten held four private dinners with David McCourt, the chairman of Granahan McCourt, the only remaining bidder for the broadband contract. A report into whether the procurement process has been compromised by the meetings is due to be carried out. Mr Canney was a former minister of state with responsibility for the Office of Public Works and flood relief, during his time in the Independent Alliance. He left the grouping following a dispute with his colleague Kevin “Boxer” Moran, over the terms of an agreement to rotate a junior ministry position between the pair in Government. Since leaving the grouping Mr Canney has voted with the Government as an Independent.Mr Canney told The  on Saturday his main challenge would be to “get balanced regional development” for rural Ireland. “Over the last week the one thing we cannot forget is the importance of the national broadband plan. That has to be completed, and all I can say is I will give Minister Bruton any support that I can on that,” he said. It was “essential for rural Ireland” that the procurement process to deliver the plan did not collapse, he said.

Photograph: AFPGetty ImagesThe Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster regards a no-deal Brexit as the “likeliest outcome”, according to a leaked email seen by the Observer newspaper.The newspaper said Ms Foster told Ashley Fox, leader of Conservative Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), over a dinner last week of her disappointment at a meeting with Michel Barnier, the French official leading the European Union’s negotiating team.The Observer said it was one of several emails it had seen that had been “leaked from the highest levels of government”.Earlier on Saturday, Ms Foster warned the British government not to make “the same mistake” with Brexit that late British prime minister Margaret Thatcher did with the Anglo-Irish Agreement (AIA) and override unionist concerns.Ms Foster’s DUP props up the Conservatives at Westminster through a confidence-and-supply agreement.However, this agreement has come under threat in recent days as Ms Foster has warned she will voted against any deal she believes undermines the union.She said Ms Thatcher had “deeply regretted” agreeing to the Irish government having a formal consultative role in the North.However, the AIA is widely regarded as leading to the peace process.Writing in the Belfast  on Saturday, Foster warned: “We do not want or need the regrets of another prime minister.“We want her to stand by her principles and instincts rather than accepting a dodgy deal foisted on her by others.”The DUP objects to a Brexit backstop which would see Northern Ireland treated differently to the rest of the UK.It does not want the region remaining in the European Union’s single market while Scotland, England and Wales leave.“I would not tolerate a trade barrier between England and Wales any more than I would tolerate on between Northern Ireland and Great Britain,” she said.“The dangers to the union and our single market were clearly demonstrated by how quickly the SNP demanded the same for Scotland as was offered to Northern Ireland.”Ms Foster accused the EU of lying over the backstop.“EU spin on offer suggested Northern Ireland would have the best of both worlds,” she said. “That is lie. We would not.”Ms Foster again warned that no deal is better than a “dodgy” Brexit deal.“I full appreciate the dangers of ‘no deal’ but the dangers of a bad deal are worse,” she said.British and EU negotiating teams are meeting over the weekend to try to agree text on the Northern Ireland backstop ahead of a summit in Brussels next week.Britain’s Brexit secretary Dominic Raab has said any backstop must be time-limited, but Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said the backstop, which provides for there being no hard border on the island of Ireland, cannot be time-limited. – Additional reporting: Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3658814.1539355373!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"welcome to bulgaria the world s fastest shrinking nation","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBulgaria’s Central Bank  in Sofia. While on average the top one-fifth of people in EU states earn 5.2 times more than the bottom one-fifth, in Bulgaria the haves make more than eight times more than the have-nots. Photograph: GettyBulgarians and visitors to their capital Sofia were offered a dazzling show of ancient and modern wealth earlier this year. The country’s national gallery, housed in an elegant former royal palace, displayed 62 glittering treasures dating back to 1,000BC in an exhibition called “The Golden Fleece. The Quest of the Argonauts”.It included 16 pieces that were on show for the first time, having resided in the well-guarded storehouses of the Thrace Foundation, a creation of multi-millionaire businessman Vassil Bojkov. The exhibition brought some cultural sparkle to Bulgaria’s six-month presidency of the EU, and may also have added a little lustre to Bojkov’s shadowy reputation.Established in 2004, the Thrace Foundation says it funds research and improves access to museums and protection of cultural heritage while caring for its founder’s collection of more than 3,000 precious artefacts.Bojkov, whose name is sometimes spelled Vasil Bozhkov, is thought to be Bulgaria’s richest man, with an empire ning construction to gambling operations that he built during his nation’s chaotic and sometimes bloody switch from communism to capitalism in the 1990s. With the Thrace Foundation perhaps the tycoon nicknamed “The Skull” is trying to give something back to the poorest and most unequal country in the EU.Some 11 years after Bulgaria joined the EU – raising hopes for a swift rise in prosperity, a more robust democracy and broader social justice – data from Eurostat in Brussels now make for bleak reading.Bulgaria has the lowest average salary in the EU (€575), the lowest minimum wage (€260) and the smallest average pension (€190).The upshot is that more than 40 per cent of Bulgarians are now at risk of poverty and social exclusion – twice the proportion of Germans who find themselves in the same predicament.In addition, while on average the top one-fifth of people in EU states earn 5.2 times more than the bottom one-fifth, in Bulgaria the haves\u0026nbspmake more than eight times more than the have-nots – without accounting for undeclared wealth.“There are three Bulgarian realities,” says Daniel Kaddik, the Sofia-based director of the Friedrich Naumann Foundation in southeast Europe.“People with an average salary don’t live a good life here, with prices for food, energy and other things that are comparable with elsewhere in Europe.”“Then there is a relatively small middle class who have their own bubble, and work in start-ups or international companies, and live in some areas of Sofia that are comparable with parts of Berlin, for example.”“Then there’s the upper class, which is detached from everything else. They have very fancy cars and private members’ clubs, and there is very often an overlap with shady business.”“I lived in Berlin and I never saw a Maybach,” he adds. “In Sofia I’ve already seen three.”The economy is growing at around 3.5 per cent, but the World Bank says it needs to expand “by at least 4 per cent per year over the next 25 years for Bulgaria to catch up with average EU income levels and thus boost shared prosperity”.Bulgaria leads the EU when it comes to one unpalatable indicator – the prevalence of corruption, and graft is draining the economy, scaring away foreign investors and serving to keep people poor.The country was the EU’s most corrupt nation in the latest Transparency International index, ranking in 71st place alongside South Africa and Vanuatu.Just as alarmingly, an EU survey found last year that only one-quarter of Bulgarians would trust the police to deal with a corruption complaint, and police and customs officers are seen as the public servants most likely to take bribes.The European Parliament estimates that corruption costs Bulgaria about 15 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and graft reaches into every facet of life – from rigged tenders, opaque contracts and kickbacks in multimillion-euro deals to the need for ordinary citizens to pay bribes to smooth their path through the country’s health and education systems and its Byzantine bureaucracy.All these backhanders, big and small, feed a grey economy in Bulgaria that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) found last year was equivalent to 29.6 per cent of its GDP, the largest such share in the EU.The result is a debilitating cycle of tax evasion and capital flight, depleted revenues for the government, sub-standard services for the public, and a grinding sense of injustice, grievance and mistrust towards officials and state institutions.An EU survey last year found that when it came to achieving success in life, more than twice as many Bulgarians believe that “knowing the right people” is a bigger factor than having a good education.This feeling that the game is rigged in favour of those with connections, and that poverty is permanent, is writ large in Bulgarian demographics - young people are leaving, couples are having fewer children and the population is falling fast.The UN says Bulgaria is actually the world’s fastest shrinking nation, with its current population of about 7 million people expected to dwindle to 5.4 million by 2050 and 3.9 million by the end of the century.Bulgaria has already lost almost 2 million people from a peak of nearly 9 million in 1989, revealing the massive and long-term impact of the transition from communism to capitalism on eastern Europe - where eight other countries are also expected to suffer a population decline of more than 15 per cent by 2050.The EU’s highest mortality rate, coupled with one of the bloc’s lowest birth rate and the emigration of tens of thousands of workers each year, leave Bulgaria with a headache over how to fund pensions and healthcare for an ageing population.It is no surprise that tens of thousands of Bulgarians seek jobs abroad each year, with Germany, Britain and Spain their favoured destinations, creating a chronic shortage of staff in country’s health service, schools and other major sectors.“There are now places where you don’t have doctor within radius of 50km. You have to bring own toilet paper to the hospital and these kinds of things. It’s a climate that lots of people just don’t want to live in anymore,” says Kaddik.While young professionals are leaving home in search of higher wages, better working conditions and a less corrupt environment, many Bulgarians do not even wait until graduation to start looking abroad for opportunities.About 17 per cent of Bulgarian students went to a foreign university last year, and some of the country’s top universities are now trying to fill hundreds of empty places for the new term.A glimmer of good news for people returning from abroad is that they will probably find the family home waiting. About 84 per cent of Bulgarians own the place where they live, compared to just 53 per cent in Germany.“People were given the apartments where they were living (when communism collapsed) and they are lucky to own their homes, otherwise they simply could not afford their housing,” says Kaddik.“A lot of Bulgarians, especially the elderly, rely on food grown on a little family plot outside the city. The family bond is strong here, and among friends and relatives there is a lot of exchange of small services and helping each other out – but it’s out of necessity because of a lack of good services.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3663039.1539501969!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit may faces possible tory mutiny and dup pressure","story":"British prime minister Theresa May faces a Tory mutiny and increased pressure from her DUP allies over Brexit as a key summit with EU leaders looms.As negotiations continue in Brussels ahead of a summit starting on Wednesday, the prime minister faces a political battle over a plan which could keep the UK in a customs union to avoid a hard border with Ireland.Former Brexit secretary David Davis said the plan was “completely unacceptable” and urged Cabinet ministers to “exert their collective authority”.Meanwhile Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster is reported to have said that a no-deal Brexit was now the most likely outcome after talks with senior figures including Michel Barnier in Brussels.Her party is opposed to any customs arrangement which would result in Northern Ireland being “annexed” or impose extra checks on goods travelling to or from Great Britain.With continued speculation that Leave-supporting Cabinet ministers could resign if Mrs May presses ahead with the plan, Mr Davis said: “This is one of the most fundamental decisions that government has taken in modern times.”Writing in The Sunday Times he said: “It is time for the Cabinet to exert their collective authority. This week the authority of our constitution is on the line.”The issue of the Border between Northern Ireland and Ireland is one of the last remaining obstacles to achieving a orce deal with Brussels, with wrangling continuing over the nature of a “backstop” to keep the frontier open if a wider UK-EU trade arrangement cannot resolve it.The European Union’s version, which would see just Northern Ireland remain aligned with Brussels’ rules, has been called unacceptable by Mrs May and is loathed by the DUP.Mrs May’s counter-proposal is for a “temporary customs arrangement” for the whole UK, but Tory Brexiteers are suspicious this could turn into a permanent situation, restricting the freedom to strike trade deals around the world.The Sunday Times said at least nine ministers want Mrs May to change course when the Cabinet meets on Tuesday.Speculation about possible resignations has centred on Andrea Leadsom, Penny Mordaunt and Esther McVey, but the newspaper also indicated that Scottish Secretary David Mundell and Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson could quit because special arrangements for Northern Ireland could fuel the case for Scottish independence.Mrs May’s own position also appeared in jeopardy, with as many as 44 letters demanding a vote of no confidence reportedly submitted to the Conservative 1922 Committee - just four short of the number required to trigger a ballot.The Northern Irish situation is politically problematic for Mrs May because her minority administration depends on the votes of the 10 DUP MPs.A leaked email reported in The Observer indicated Mrs Foster was ready to block a Brexit deal.According to a private email exchange between senior UK officials, seen by the newspaper, Mrs Foster gave her views during a dinner with the leader of Conservative MEPs, Ashley Fox.The leaked email said Mrs Foster described the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Mr Barnier as “difficult and hostile” and indicated “the DUP were ready for a no-deal scenario, which she now believed was the likeliest one”.Writing in the Belfast  on Saturday, Mrs Foster said she appreciated the risks of a no-deal Brexit but “the dangers of a bad deal are worse”.She added: “The DUP’s actions this week are not as some have suggested about ‘flexing muscle’. “This is no game.“Anyone engaging in this in a light-hearted way foolishly fails to grasp the gravity of the decisions we will make in the coming weeks.”A further demonstration of Tory resistance to Mrs May’s plans came from MP Anne-Marie Trevelyan, who wrote in The Sunday  that “the idea of remaining in the customs union - even it if is called a ‘temporary customs arrangement’ - after the end of the transition period, in to the 2020s, means simply delaying Brexit and causing the 17.4 million people who voted for it to lose faith in our democracy”.Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the European Research Group of pro-Brexit MPs, warned that when it came to the backstop proposal “temporary means eternal”. -

So, fulfilling his wishes has been tremendously important to me,” she told The Sunday .“It’s been amazing because my father was somebody who dreamed of steam engines and was so passionate about their preservation.“And so, those dreams have today continued even after his passing. I can’t quite believe it. It’s been very emotional.”British businessman Alan Pegler (1920-2012), new owner of the LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman steam locomotive, pictured standing in front of the engine at Kings Cross station in London prior to its last scheduled run on 14th January 1963 Alan Francis Pegler was born into a family of manufacturers from Retford, Nottinghamshire. During his childhood he played at being a porter at his local railway station at Barnby Moor, watching the trains on the Great Northern mainline.He first saw the Flying Scotsman at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley in 1924, when he was just four years old. And so began a love affair that was to define the rest of his life.The Flying Scotsman begins the climb up Stoke Bank on the East Coast Main Line with the \u0026#39Farewell to Alan Pegler\u0026#39 charterIn 1946 he joined his family’s business, the Northern Rubber Company, before serving as a Naval flyer and later the RAF in World War II.The Cambridge University graduate went on to join the British Railways’ Regional Board in a part time and non-executive role.Alan Pegler\u0026#39s daughter aboard the Flying Scotsman in London In January 1963, the 60103 Flying Scotsman retired from service having covered some 2,076,000 miles on its route between London and Edinburgh on the North Eastern Railway.The train, built in 1923 for the London and North Eastern Railway at Doncaster Works, was destined for the scrapheap where it would be broken up.With the age of steam drawing to a close due to the so-called ‘dieselisation’ of the network, Pegler bought the Scotsman in 1963 for £3,000.He restored the locomotive, with its striking apple green livery, to its former glory and brokered deals with British Rail to allow it to still venture out on the network.Passengers raise a glass in memory to Alan Pegler who saved the Flying Scotsman back in 1963Wearing his blue overalls, he was regularly interviewed and photographed on the footplate promoting the engine that had done so much for the age of steam.He also took it on tours to America, Canada and Australia, where it set a record for the longest non-stop run by a steam powered locomotive when in 1989 it clocked up 422 miles.Penny Vaudoyer, Alan Pegler\u0026#39s daughter, at the footplate where she saw her father\u0026#39s ashes scattered in the fireboxDavid Buck, chairman of the Steam Dreams Rail Company which organised yesterday trip, said: “I have been simply amazed by the sheer well of affection for Alan who is clearly the man the nation thinks of when talking about the Flying Scotsman and its post British Rail career.“From top to bottom throughout the industry everybody has come come together to make this possible and it has been a truly wonderful and emotional tribute to a great man.”The front of the Flying Scotsman on yesterday’s trip carried the signage saying ‘Farewell Alan Pegler’.Official royal wedding photographs reunite Duchess of York and Duke of EdinburghComment: The free market could help make private schools more affordable, if only Theresa May would let itComment: We will not waste £20bn cash injection for the NHSHammond faces all-party budget revolt unless he brings forward crackdown on fixed odds betting terminalsTheresa May facing growing rebellion over universal credit as 27 Tory MPs sign letterHarrow school at loggerheads with Sadiq Khan over new sports hall on green space10-way fight for \u0026#39coming-of-old\u0026#39 debut novelComment: Brexit on Theresa May\u0026#39s terms would be the worst of all worldsPeople in debt to be given six-week \u0026#39breathing space\u0026#39 from bailiffsPatients will be able to book and change medical appointments onlineBottle of Burgundy fetches record-smashing £424,000 at wine auctionRescuers intensify searches after Hurricane Michael\u0026#39s death toll rises to 15Donald Trump vows \u0026#39severe punishment\u0026#39 if Saudi Arabia murdered journalist Jamal KhashoggiComment: The MEPs\u0026#39 expenses scandal sums up everything that is wrong with the EURegulators show \u0026#39lack of focus and urgency\u0026#39 in tackling sexual harassment, MPs sayFormula One teams race to help beat Alzheimer\u0026#39sPlans to make new homes freehold unveiledNew sanctions to be imposed following Salisbury nerve attackOne dead and thousands of homes without power as Storm Callum batters the UK Strictly Come Dancing 2018 week four live show: Stacey Dooley tops leaderboard as Seann Walsh\u0026#39s \u0026#34charleston of shame\u0026#34 finishes fifthWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/13/TELEMMGLPICT000177610545_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq8W44mZEW0zcVUHYed3romhKi2sT3vi7ux2-RDZwC4QA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"inside school promises better future girls escaping boko harams","story":"Aisha Bukar, deputy head of the Neem Foundation\u0026#39s school in Maiduguri, Nigeria  Had she not panicked at the final moment, Aisha Aminu\u0027s last act would have been to kill herself and as many others as possible.Kidnapped last year by Boko Haram, the 15-year-old was conscripted into its army of child suicide bombers, with orders to blow herself up in a busy marketplace. But when her Boko Haram handler escorted her to the target, she recognised faces in the crowd as former neighbours. She hesitated just long enough for police to arrive.A year on, Aisha is among hundreds of ex-Boko Haram captives at a rehabilitation charity in Maiduguri, the dusty city in north-east Nigeria where the country\u0027s jihadist movement sprang up.Recovering from life in a group that treats women as either sex slaves or cannon fodder is not easy: Aisha was so traumatised that she was mute for the first few months, while others are plagued by nightmares, flashbacks and thoughts of suicide.Yet for Fatima Akilu, the NHS-trained psychologist who runs the charity, what is equally disturbing is that not every former hostage regrets their time with the group.In the remote, impoverished villages where Boko Haram has its strongholds, becoming a bush wife is the closest some women ever get to empowerment.A teacher holds a counselling session for boys at the Neem Foundation\u0026#39s school in Maiduguri, NigeriaIt isn\u0027t true of all cases, but some of the wives of senior Boko Haram commanders have told me that while they were with the group, they felt empowered for the first time in their lives, said Dr Akilu, a Nigerian Muslim is also a children\u0027s author.They\u0027d often be in command of a harem of women themselves, sometimes hundreds of them, and they\u0027d learn how to use weapons as well.They felt a power they\u0027d never have in their own communities, where they\u0027d usually get married aged 12, and where husbands would then dictate their lives.Counterintuitive though they may be, Dr Akilu\u0027s insights draw on a lifetime studying the murkier side of the human psyche.Educated at boarding school in Tunbridge Wells, she studied psychiatry in Britain and the US before working with young offenders, paedophiles and murderers, including John Hinckley Jr, the man who shot President Ronald Reagan.In 2012, Nigeria\u0027s National Security Agency asked her to devise a local equivalent to Britain\u0027s Prevent counter-extremism project, after reading articles she had written on the role of education in fighting radicalism.How the Nigerian government is fuelling Boko Haram\u0026#039s kidnapping industryAs Director for Behavioural Analysis, she ran prison deradicalisation programs for jailed Boko Haram commanders and their wives, before setting up her own charity, the Neem Foundation, in 2016. It aims to help the tens of thousands of other Nigerians who have spent time in Boko Haram camps, be it voluntarily or as hostages.The group, which has killed an estimated 20,000 people, remains a force to be reckoned with, despite losing much of its turf in the past three years. It still holds around 100 of the 276 schoolgirls snatched from the town of Chibok in 2014, and last month also killed one of three kidnapped local aid workers.But as well as the ongoing military struggle, there is now a hearts and minds challenge to re-integrate those once brainwashed by the group. There are thousands of these people now drifting back into cities and refugee camps,” Dr Akilu said. “They need help, otherwise the problems could last for decades.”At a compound down a backstreet in Maiduguri, the Neem Foundation provides a school for female ex-captives, which is often their first experience of a classroom.\u0026#34Amina\u0026#34, a 17-year-old former hostage of Boko Haram at the Neem Foundation school in Bakassi refugee camp in Maiduguri. She spent 18 months with the groupConducted in English rather than local languages, it is a rebuff to Boko Haram\u0027s mantra that Western education is sinful, although the syllabus goes beyond just the 3Rs. Diversity is an important lesson too, given the inter-tribal chauvinism that Boko Haram exploits.A lot of our pupils are brought up to believe that their own tribe is greatest, be they Hausa, Fulani or Kanuri (the latter the tribe of Boko Haram leader Abubakr Shekau), said Aisha Bukar, the school\u0027s deputy head. By getting them to swap tribes in role-plays, we teach them that Nigeria is a place of many tribes and faiths.Indeed, a few of the program\u0027s clients are unaware that Nigeria even exists as a country, thinking it represents just the wider area around their village.Such limited horizons make them easy prey for Boko Haram’s doctrines, which include the bizarre claim that the world is flat. It also lets the group present itself variously as a world-conquering jihadist force, a glamorous Mafia, and even a local version of the Boy Scouts.There\u0027s a whole range of reasons why people join up, mostly to do with lack of opportunity, said Dr Akilu. For some, it\u0027s the chance to be in a gang and carry a gun. For others, especially adolescents, it\u0027s just a chance to be part of something, to have an adventure. Then there some who join up because Boko Haram gave them money to start a business. It may be just cash to buy a wheelbarrow, but that means the world to people in communities that have nothing.She stresses that despite such blandishments, Boko Haram still has to recruit most of its followers by force. Yet stigma abounds.In a refugee camp where the charity runs another program, Amina Ahmed, 17, who was impregnated by her captors and then miscarried, told how even her own mother blamed her at first. She asked me: \u0027why did you accept?\u0027, and I told her it was because I had no choice, she said, a tear rolling down her cheek.

has said.The consumer group said the government\u0027s preparations for a no-deal exit suggested a reduction in consumer rights and choice as well as price hikes that would have a “direct and hard” impact in areas ranging from travel to food and energy.The watchdog, which based its conclusions on its assessment of the government\u0027s technical notices in preparation for the event of a no-deal Brexit, online forums and surveys, said two in five people did not understand the potential implications of a no-deal scenario.Health department cannot guarantee \u0027supply of medicines\u0027 after BrexitIn its report - Brexit no deal: a consumer catastrophe?

The worst thing we have to worry about is repetitive strain syndrome and drinking too much coffee. But there is a heroic hardcore who are willing to put themselves in the way of harm to tell the story.Writing about certain presidents and princes can be bad for your health. In Michael Scott Moore’s case, it was pirates. He was doing research into pirates, so like any decent reporter worth his salt he thought he should go and interview one. What happened next you can read about in his new book, The Desert and the Sea. The clue is in the subtitle: 977 Days Captive on the Somali Pirate Coast.What image springs to mind when you think of pirates? Johnny Depp? An eye-patch? A cutlass? For me, it’s more an adjective – “swashbuckling”. Criminals of the high seas, of course, but romantic daredevils, skilled swordsmen, daring nomadic outsiders, surely. Michael Scott Moore has finally put paid to any lingering remnants of the myth by way of being kidnapped by them and held hostage for nearly three years, driven to the brink of madness, malaria and suicide by “a stupid and self-aggrandising pirate society, a suicidal culture in which gunshots rang in the street and gunmen were winners”.UK investigates reports of looting of sunken WW2 shipsMoore was a surfer – and author of Sweetness and Blood, a history of American expansionism after the Second World War, seen through the turquoise lens of surfing –\u0026nbspwho naturally felt a certain rapport with the men who make their living off the sea. And he felt that piracy was not exactly unknown in American history. “North America,” Moore writes, “had evolved from an underdeveloped haven for pirates to an antipirate world power within three generations.”Hobyo (Courtesy of Michael Scott Moore)I saw him before he left for Somalia – hale and hearty – and I went to see him again recently, in a cafe in West Village, New York, several years later, after he got back, now 49, looking like a war veteran, wounded, skinnier, traumatised, but a survivor. Older and wiser. He had planned to write a book about Somali pirates that would be pure reportage, “but,” he says, “it became more personal from the moment I got kidnapped”.\u0026nbspWhen you’re held hostage your entire life up to that moment keeps replaying itself in your head. His father, Bert Moore, was an aerospace engineer and alcoholic who committed suicide when Michael was aged 12. His mother told him it was a heart attack. He only found out what really happened 30 years later when he asked for a copy of the death certificate that read: “Gunshot\u0026nbspto\u0026nbspleft chest”. He had been kicked out of the family home in the suburbs of Los Angeles by Mrs Moore. After a year of trying to get sober he shot himself. Mother and son went to live in Redondo Beach, where he started surfing.abc)When his first marriage fell apart, Mike left his old southern Californian life behind and set up in Berlin. Somehow he ended up writing about pirate activities for Spiegel Online International and attended the trial of 10 pirates in Hamburg, in 2011. It was the first trial of pirates on German soil for 400 years. They had been arrested after a gun battle with Dutch commandos while trying to hijack a German ship.“I was as full of pirate romance as the next American kid” says Moore. He knew that\u0026nbspPirates of the Caribbean was pure Hollywood. But still he wanted to find out what they were really like. Moore had been to the Horn of Africa before –\u0026nbspon a counter-piracy vessel, a Turkish warship.But in January 2012, supported by a couple of magazines and a grant from the Pulitzer Centre\u0026nbspon Crisis Reporting, he set off again, without a warship this time. To be on the safe side he had tried to get kidnap insurance and been turned down. But he wasn’t naive. He knew he was in “a country where no one could save me if things went wrong”. He had security. “Good security”, as he describes it. The problem was that at the crucial moment they “disappeared”. They sold him out. He was paying them well, but the pirates were paying them more. And they were part of the same clan. “That particular clan was supposed to be hosting and protecting me,” he says with an ironic grin.He interviewed a pirate called Mustaf in a flyblown restaurant in Hobyo where he had to pay $620 for lunch. He left a filmmaker colleague at the airport and was being driven back into town along “Pirate Road” when his car was stopped by a dozen men bristling with automatic weapons. He was beaten, his glasses were broken, and he was bundled into the pirate vehicle of choice, a Toyota Land Cruiser.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Demonstrators raising red painted hands and a placard reading we must change the system not the climate referring to the need to stop climate change during a march in Bordeaux, southwestern FranceSpanish Unionist demonstrators carry Spanish flags during a demonstration on Spain\u0027s National Day in BarcelonaRussia has halted all crewed space flights following the failed launch of the Soyuz  MS-10 rocket (pictured).

For a long while in captivity, he felt the pirates were right about that: “I was a tall, white man hoping to make friends with pirates. Crazy.”\u0026nbspBeing a writer meant that he was worth something. “I have seen you on the internet,” said one of his captors. “You are famous.”\u0026nbspHe denied it. Then they fished out a picture of him that had appeared in the New York Times. I had even contributed in a small way to adding to the price on his head by writing an enthusiastic review of his surfing book in that newspaper. The asking price was $20m. If only I’d slated his book it might have brought the price down by a few million. His friends soon learned he had been kidnapped but we were warned not to write anything. Every time his name was mentioned on the BBC his price went up again.He was regularly beaten, and threatened with torture, or being handed over to al-Shabaab, but one of the worst things about being held in captivity is not having anything to read. One of the highlights of his first few months was piecing together fragments of The Gulf News\u0026nbspwhich had been wrapping up samosas. Taken to a ship a mile offshore, the Naham 3 – a highjacked fishing vessel – he was given a Bible by one of his fellow hostages. A lapsed Catholic, he read it twice from cover to cover, having to squint all the while, but finding consolation in “the gritty survival ethic” of the Old Testament. He decided he was not so keen on crucifixion as such.There were a lot of guards on the ship, and a fair few sharks in the water too. And without glasses he could barely make out where he was going. But in the end he leapt off the ship in a bid for freedom. He didn’t make it and spent the next three\u0026nbspweeks chained up in solitary confinement. I read a story online about how he had been shot while trying to escape. This turned out to be a myth put about by the pirates themselves, with a notion of speeding up delivery of the ransom.Around this time Moore devoutly wished he had become an astronaut – or anything – rather than a writer. As a kid, his bedroom had been decorated with astronaut wallpaper, peppered with rockets and moons and stars. Now marooned on board a very terrestrial ship, he was tormented by dreams and rumours of a rescue that never came. But there was still one option available to him. He could try and shoot his way out. It would be the heroic thing to do. But it would also be stupid. The guards had a habit of leaving their Kalashnikovs lying about. There was zero chance of getting away but he could go out in a blaze of glory and bullets, and maybe take a pirate or two down with him. “I was angry enough to pick up a Kalashnikov,” he says.Rolly Tambara, who were held in captivity together (Seychelles Nation)The thing that stopped him was the memory of his father’s suicide. His logic was that he didn’t want his mother to have to bear witness to both the men in her life self-destructing. His mother becomes one of the heroes of the book. German in origin, Marlis was still playing tennis and golf, and was due to have lunch at a Mexican restaurant when five men in suits (unheard of in Redondo Beach) turned up at her door. Schooled by the FBI, she had to conduct ransom negotiations herself over the phone, driving the price down from $20m\u0026nbspto $8m, then down to $5m, and finally $1.5m. In the end she recruited a mercenary to deliver $700,000, which she\u0026nbspmanaged to cobble together from different sources, friends, family and Der Spiegel.“I’m still angry,” Michael says, “about losing more than two years of my life.” But he had to rein in his anger if he wanted to live. When he explained he needed a doctor for his broken wrist the trigger-happy guard said to him, “You mean it was broken in this operation.” He was tempted to reply, “No motherf***er, I’m in the habit of walking around Somalia with a broken wrist.” “Yes” is how he chooses – rather carefully – to phrase it.He developed friendships with the other hostages – Chinese, Cambodian, Vietnamese, Filipinos –and he came around to liking some of the guards. But he was never tempted by Stockholm syndrome: “I went through a long period of wanting to kill them.” Notably one guy by the name of Ali.Werne)Sometimes your reading can save your life. In Moore’s case it was Epictetus, the great stoic philosopher. Stoicism says that you can’t do a lot about your fate, but you can control your attitude towards it. Epictetus asks the question, what do you do if your servant drops your favourite vase and it smashes into a thousand pieces? Do you lash out and whip the servant, or do you say – which is what he recommends – “the vase has been restored”. Moore grits his teeth and develops a sense of humour about his predicament. “Not that I laughed every day.”\u0026nbspWhen he was staring down the barrel of a gun, quite literally, he learned to sit and accept the prospect of a sudden death. “I had to train my mind for actual non-existence.”As well as ancient Greek philosophers, a collection of Tom and Jerry cartoons definitely helps. As does news, on a short-wave radio, of the World Cup in Brazil in 2014, when Germany thrashed Brazil 7-1 in the semi-final.\u0026nbspThere is an ironic twist in Moore’s story, when most of the people who tormented him for so long are annihilated, in a way he could never have anticipated, but which reflects what he writes about the rise of “factionalism and violent opportunism”. One further irony:\u0026nbspwhen he gets free he even has one of his former captors becoming a Facebook “friend”.Disney removes bride auction scene on ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ ride‘Porch pirates’ steal 4-year-old boy’s supply of life-saving medicineMaybe he could have made it as an astronaut, but he is the most persistent and unstoppable of writers. He simply stole a pen and paper from the pirates and wrote about his experiences, like a Solzhenitsyn of the Somali gulag. But these samizdats never see the light of day. When his guards read their own names they confiscate his notebooks, again and again. Finally he realises his only way out is fiction. He sets his novel in southern California, not in Somalia. About a quixotic innocent who is kidnapped by bad guys. It was partly allegory, to remind him of what happened, but now it’s in danger of becoming his next book.For Michael Scott Moore, writing is therapy, a way of retaining sanity. “To put painful events into a certain order, I had to find a way through it. The easiest thing was to set down what happened.”I asked him what he missed most during his 977 days. “I’m not sure there was any one thing. Beer? Fresh fruit? Above all my family and friends. Everything about my old life, good and bad,” he said. “I was just grateful to be alive in the end.”There is almost a note of sadness or nostalgia in his voice when he says that the traditional Somali pirate is now virtually extinct. “The business model has evolved. They’ve shifted into arms and human trafficking. Piracy has become too dangerous.”Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’, and\u0026nbspteaches at the University of Cambridge‘The Desert and the Sea:\u0026nbsp977 Days Captive on the Somali Pirate Coast’, by Michael Scott Moore, is published by Harper CollinsShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

has said.The consumer group said the government\u0027s preparations for a no-deal exit suggested a reduction in consumer rights and choice as well as price hikes that would have a “direct and hard” impact in areas ranging from travel to food and energy.The watchdog, which based its conclusions on its assessment of the government\u0027s technical notices in preparation for the event of a no-deal Brexit, online forums and surveys, said two in five people did not understand the potential implications of a no-deal scenario.Health department cannot guarantee \u0027supply of medicines\u0027 after BrexitIn its report - Brexit no deal: a consumer catastrophe?

And in the very last days of his life he may have made important work towards solving it once and for all.That question revolves around the way that black holes are thought to swallow up and destroy anything that falls into them. If they do entirely destroy them, they would take the information about them behind – but it is thought to be impossible for that information to simply disappear, leading to the paradox.Created with Sketch.The most incredible space images of Earth Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Explore ESA astronaut Tim Peake\u0027s stunning photos of Earth, taken from the International Space Station during his six month mission (captions by Tom Peake)Every day spent living in space is a great day, but today was particularly special.

No prizes for guessing where this is…From one mighty ocean to another – ships passing through the Panama canalBecause Professor Hawking suggested that black holes have a temperature and so would eventually cool down and evaporate, disappearing entirely from existence. With that, they appear to take the information with them, but it cannot simply be lost without breaking the laws of quantum mechanics.But the new paper suggests that can be explained by the phenomenon of soft hair. That is a sort of glossy edge\u0026nbspthat sits at the edge of the black hole and allows for scientists to overcome the paradox.Hawking memorial sees professor\u0027s voice shot into a black holeNow the researchers who worked with Professor Hawking on the paper in his final days will have to explore more of how exactly that works without him. They hope to find out how exactly the soft hair works, and what happens to it when the black hole comes to an end.The study itself – which is attributed to\u0026nbspSasha Haco, Stephen W. Hawking, Malcolm J. Perry and\u0026nbspAndrew Strominger –\u0026nbspdescribes that process in far more technical detail. The summary concludes with a sentence that reads: Assuming the existence of a quantum Hilbert space on which these charges generate the symmetries, as well as the applicability of the Cardy formula, the central charges reproduce the macroscopic area-entropy law for generic Kerr black holes.But at its most simple level it could be part of a solution to a problem that has occupied many of the greatest minds in the world for decades, according to researchers.“Understanding the microscopic origin of this entropy – what are the underlying quantum states that the entropy counts? – has been one of the great challenges of the last 40 years,\u0026nbspMarika Taylor, professor of theoretical physics at Southampton University and a former student of Hawking’s, told , which had first reported the new paper.This paper proposes a way to understand entropy for astrophysical black holes based on symmetries of the event horizon. The authors have to make several non-trivial assumptions so the next steps will be to show that these assumptions are valid.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Users can go on holiday to France and still have full access to the\u0026nbspNetflix films and Spotify\u0026nbspmusic they get at home, for instance.But a tranche of newly-released official\u0026nbspdocuments about the anticipated impact of a no-deal Brexit includes a paper that suggests the portability\u0026nbsparrangement that exists with the bloc would “cease to apply”.Created with Sketch.

But when they do so they will most likely see the library of the country they are in, as happens if Britons travel outside of the European Union now.“UK Netflix subscribers are able to access Netflix everywhere in the world Netflix is available and will continue to do so once the UK leaves the EU,” a Netflix spokesperson said. The company said that “local catalogues vary due to licensing and local tastes”, but pointed out its original shows are available everywhere.The new papers also make clear that the same regulations would apply to geo-blocking regulation. That ensures that people can buy from online services across the continent, without being punished for doing so from another country.“Following repeal of the Geo-Blocking Regulation in the UK, traders from the UK, EU and third countries would not be prohibited from discriminating between EU customers and UK customers,” the papers say.“For instance a UK trader would be able to offer different terms to a UK customer compared to a French customer.”Companies based in the UK and selling products and services in the EU\u0026nbspwill still have to comply with the regulation, to ensure that they don’t discriminate between people in different countries within Europe.The new geo-blocking rules go into effect in December 2018, meaning that they will apply to UK citizens for about\u0026nbspthree months before a possible no-deal Brexit in March 2019.The paper covering ‘Geo-blocking of online content if there’s no Brexit deal’ and another covering portability of content\u0026nbspis one of a range of papers released in the latest set of documents from the UK government. They also include new documents showing Britain could no longer benefit from deals that represent a significant portion of UK trade and that train journeys into and out of the EU could be disrupted.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Many were surprised the duo remained on the BBC series, however they graced the stage\u0026nbspwith an action-packed Charleston that won rave reviews from all four of the judges. Shirley Ballas\u0026nbspdeemed it “outstanding.”Additional viewers probably tuned in this week to see if and how presenters Tess\u0026nbspDaly\u0026nbspand Claudia Winkleman would acknowledge the scandal. Well, they did albeit quite subtly.

But, as part of ongoing austerity measures, they have been frozen since April 2016, resulting in a decline in\u0026nbsptheir real term value while inflation rises.Now, if this year’s inflation reaches the predicted 2.7 per cent when revealed on Wednesday, it will mean the worth of working age benefits has fallen by an astonishing 6.4 per cent over the last four years.The foundation says some 10 million people will be affected, and called on the government to use the upcoming budget to cancel the freeze.Adam Corlett, its senior economic analyst, said: While the prime minister this week repeated her claim that austerity is over, significant cuts in support for millions of low-income families are set to continue next year as a result of the ongoing freeze in working age benefits.The budget represents a last chance to cut short the benefit freeze. Scrapping it would send a strong signal that, from the perspective of low-income families, the government is committed to ending austerity.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police stop a breakaway from the main Football Lads alliance march, as they attempt to get close to a rival anti-facist demonstration in LondonWaves hit Cawsand, Cornwall as Storm Callum arrives to the UKFormer Prime Minister John Major has spoken out against the launch of Universal Credit (the Government\u0027s new benefit model).

The goods will therefore need to be checked as they enter the UK,” they say.The Food Standards Agency plans to require all importers of high-risk food and feed from the EU to warn them using a new UK import notification system.All the new guidance documents have the caveat: “This notice is meant for guidance only.

Anyone engaging in this in a light-hearted way foolishly fails to grasp the gravity of the decisions we will make in the coming weeks.”The DUP has also warned its MPs could vote against the Budget, which could in turn trigger a vote of no-confidence if the government is defeated.“That may lead to a different leader. But that’s not a question for us, we’re not members of the Conservative Party,” the DUP’s Brexit spokesperson Sammy Wilson said this week.However several Labour MPs have told The Independent they may be prepared to support Ms May’s Brexit plan if the alternative is leaving the EU without a deal.They said\u0026nbspthat at least 15 of their number could rebel against Mr Corbyn and back the government, which could be enough to tip the balance in the Commons in favour of the deal.The Observer said the emails were “leaked from the highest levels of government”.It came as David Davis urged cabinet ministers to “exert their collective authority” in opposition to Ms May’s plans, which the former Brexit secretary called “completely unacceptable”.With continued speculation that Leave-supporting senior ministers could resign if Mrs May presses ahead with the proposal, David Davis said: “This is one of the most fundamental decisions that government has taken in modern times.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police stop a breakaway from the main Football Lads alliance march, as they attempt to get close to a rival anti-facist demonstration in LondonWaves hit Cawsand, Cornwall as Storm Callum arrives to the UKFormer Prime Minister John Major has spoken out against the launch of Universal Credit (the Government\u0027s new benefit model).

has admitted.Trade agreements enjoyed with scores of other countries, through EU membership, will “cease to apply” if the UK crashes out of the EU next March.The government said it would attempt to

condemned the “shambolic” prospect of a no-deal exit – warning of higher shop prices and a huge loss of jobs, if tariffs were imposed.And the British Chamber of Commerce said it underlined the need for the UK and EU to break the deadlock “as soon as possible, to avoid the confusion and significant disruption of a no deal scenario”.The UK boasts around 40 free trade agreements, with more than 70 countries, because it is an EU member, including the United States, Canada, Switzerland, Turkey and NorwayThey give businesses “a range of preferential market access opportunities”, including cheaper import tariffs and duties and more relaxed “rules of origin” requirements.The deals also provide “enhanced market access” for services, “public procurement opportunities” and “improved protections for intellectual property”, DExEU said.The Independent revealed last month that no country has yet agreed to “roll over’ any deal, even if a withdrawal agreement is struck and a 21-month transition period

votes to secure parliament’s support for her deal in the face of staunch opposition from many of her own Eurosceptic backbenchers.Labour MPs told The Independent that at least 15 could rebel against Mr Corbyn and back the government, which could be enough to tip the balance in the Commons in favour of the deal.Hammond claims Brexit deal would deliver ‘economic bonus’One prepared to go public,\u0026nbspGareth Snell, MP for Stoke Central, said:\u0026nbsp“If the deal is some sort of customs union, protection of the unity of the union and looking at a future trade deal, it would be very hard to justify why we’re not supporting that.”Ruth Smeeth, Stoke North MP, said: “If the option is voting for the deal or voting for something that would mean no deal – well, I’m not prepared to vote for no-deal.”Don Valley MP Caroline Flint said:\u0026nbsp“I believe if there is a reasonable deal that stops us crashing out with no deal, we shouldn’t rule it out.”If 15 Labour MPs\u0026nbspput their support behind the deal, the prime minister could afford a Tory rebellion of more than 20, presuming she is able to keep the Democratic Unionist Party on her\u0026nbspside.Eurosceptic Tories claim they have at least 40 MPs ready to vote down the deal, although the government hopes to whittle down that\u0026nbspnumber when pressure is applied.Many Labour MPs in Leave-supporting constituencies feel they cannot both vote against Ms May’s deal while convincingly opposing a no-deal exit.They are torn between, on\u0026nbspthe one hand, party members who will be furious if they help prop up a Tory prime minister and, on the other, constituents who will not forgive them if they vote in a way that could appear to be frustrating Britain’s exit from the EU.“We can’t vote against the deal but also oppose no-deal without it looking very much like we’re voting against Brexit,” another said. “That isn’t an option.”Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on

RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchMr Snell added: “I’m quite clear that no-deal would be an absolute disaster and therefore to avoid a no-deal outcome we’ve got to be open to supporting a deal that’s presented.“I’m not wedded to opposing a deal just because it comes from the government. If the deal is as May has been suggesting then it would be difficult for me to justify to myself not strongly considering supporting it, if the alternative is crashing out without a deal.Labour is expected to instruct its MPs to vote against Ms May’s deal, which it will say does not meet the six strict tests the party has set out.However, one MP said: “Everyone knows the six tests were designed to never be met.”Mr Corbyn and his team are likely to warn MPs how members will react if they vote with the government and help the Conservatives stay in power.They will tell MPs that voting down Ms May’s deal would either force her to return to Brussels to renegotiate a softer Brexit, or trigger a general election – a suggestion some MPs have already dismissed.“The suggestion that parliament could somehow force her to go crawling back to Brussels, or that Labour could force a general election, is nonsense,” one said.Another said Labour could not credibly oppose a deal that had the support of all 27 other EU countries. “The idea the Labour Party should block a deal that is backed by the likes of Merkel, Macron and the rest of the 27 is ludicrous.”The Labour leadership is understood to believe the fact that hardline Tory Eurosceptics will join them in the ision lobby to vote against the deal will invalidate accusations the party is frustrating Brexit – a confidence not shared by many of the party’s MPs.Potential rebels have increasingly found an unlikely ally in John McDonnell, who, MPs said, appears to be increasingly concerned about the risks of Labour being seen to vote against Brexit.MPs dismissed reports that up to 30 Labour MPs could vote with the government and suggested the number of potential rebels has been intentionally inflated by Conservative whips in an attempt to convince Tory Eurosceptics that Ms May is not reliant on their support.And despite reports that Downing Street is actively lobbying Labour rebels with a view to cobbling together a majority for Ms May’s deal, none of the Labour MPs spoken to by The Independent\u0026nbspsaid they had been approached by Tory whips.Several Labour frontbenchers are understood to\u0026nbspbe considering abstaining from the vote, effectively boosting Ms May’s chances of securing a parliamentary majority. They believe they could do this without having to resign from their positions.Labour facing fresh row after Jewish activists banned from eventMay’s pitch for centre-ground voters branded ‘desperate’ by LabourLabour ‘will be forced to keep UK in single market’, unions claimOne said: “I’m definitely not going to vote against the deal. If it’s a choice between a deal or no deal, the deal has got to be really bad for me to vote it down.“No-deal is the worst possible option for my constituents. I’m pragmatic about it. If it’s something like Chequers I could support that. Several of us would likely abstain.”Some MPs\u0026nbspin Leave areas are banking on a constitutional get-out clause that would give them the cover to vote for a deal. While the Labour leadership and pro-EU Tory MPs are united in insisting the choice before parliament cannot be between Ms May’s deal and no deal, some Labour MPs believe that is exactly the decision they face.Some have even sought the advice of constitutional experts in the hope of seeking credible confirmation that there would be no parliamentary mechanism for avoiding a no-deal outcome if Ms May’s deal is rejected. That would give them the justification they need to allow them to vote with the government.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Then, online sleuths reportedly managed to use open-source material to identify at least eight of those allegedly involved in the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, a 59-year-old Saudi journalist, as members of Saudi security forces. One photo purported to show a member of the 15-member team hobnobbing with Mohammed bin Salman, the powerful 33-year-old Saudi crown prince who has become the primary target of\u0026nbspMr Khashoggi’s criticisms. Another identified an alleged team member as Salah Mohammed al-Tubaigy, a name and face matching the head of forensic evidence at Saudi’s General Security department.Sabah purports to identify the 15-member Saudi team allegedly involved in the disappearance of journalist Jamal KhashoggiThe details\u0026nbspwere published by Sabah, a mass-circulation daily newspaper close to the government of president Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Friends, family, and officials say Mr Khashoggi was lured to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October before disappearing.\u0026nbspTurkish media reported that security camera footage from inside the consulate was removed and that staff were ordered to go home the afternoon Mr Khashoggi arrived.On the same day, two private jets, owned by Riyadh based Sky Prime Aviation,\u0026nbspreportedly arrived from Saudi Arabia to Istanbul’s Ataturk airport, carrying the 15 personnel, landing just hours before Mr Khashoggi’s scheduled appointment at the consulate. Some of the 15 checked in to the five-star\u0026nbspMovenpick\u0026nbsphotel near the Saudi consulate in Istanbul’s Levent district.\u0026nbspBoth private jets and the 15 men departed hours later, according to Turkish officials and local press. Khashoggi: Emergence of Saudi dissident and his potentially tragic endTurkish authorities investigating the disappearance of Mr Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi with Turkish ethnic roots, have been leaking information about the probe to local and international media with what appears to be the tacit approval of government officials.Police in Istanbul have formed a special team to investigate Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance, the newspaper Milliyet reported, tasked specifically to use chemicals, dogs, and infrared light to look for DNA, blood and other traces of the journalist at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.The Post and other media also circulated a photo, likely taken from security camera footage, showing a black Mercedes Vito van that was parked outside the consulate and left shortly after Mr Khashoggi’s arrival, parked in front of the residence of Saudi consul general Mohammad al-Otaibi.The 15-member team identified by Sabah are all Saudi men aged between 30 and 57 years old. Those purportedly tracked down via open source internet tools by Oslo-based researcher Iyad al-Baghdadi and others include: a Saudi special forces member a lieutenant colonel in the Saudi civil defence force a major and lieutenant in the Saudi air force a lieutenant in the service guarding the crown prince’s palace and an intelligence service colonel who had once been attached to the Saudi embassy in the UK.Kalin on the disappearance of a Saudi journalist Jamal KhashoggiMr Khashoggi served for years as the right-hand man of Saudi prince Turki bin Faisal, a former intelligence chief as well as Riyadh’s envoy to the US and UK.\u0026nbspIncreasingly frustrated with Saudi Arabia’s\u0026nbspcourse, he began to bristle at the restrictions placed on media and civil society, eventually moving to the US last year amid fears for his own safety. In recent months he had grown increasingly critical of the crown prince, who has been criticised as authoritarian despite attempts to cast himself as a reformer. Saudi officials have denied that they had anything to do with Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance, insisting he left the consulate, but without providing proof, as demanded by Mr Erdogan.\u0026nbspThe disappearance of Mr Khashoggi, a permanent US resident, has put Washington in a tough spot. The crown prince has forged a strong alliance with the administration\u0026nbspof Donald Trump and a personal bond with the US president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. US lawmakers have made tough statements about the Khashoggi affair, but the White House and State Department have been tepid. Saudi Arabia has vowed to buy $110bn in American weapons.“We’re not going to make any judgments about what had happened to him,” Heather Nauert, State Department spokeswoman, told reporters on Tuesday. “The United States is certainly concerned about his whereabouts. Senior officials at the State Department have spoken with Saudi officials through diplomatic channels about the matter. We call on the government of Saudi Arabia to conduct a thorough and transparent investigation.” Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It is unacceptable that the Government leaks the results of its modelling when it suits but simultaneously hides what lies behind these forecasts from the public.The Cross-Whitehall Brexit Analysis leaked to the news website Buzzfeed early this year and subsequently \u0026lsquopublished\u0026rsquo in the form of 24 PowerPoint slides, forecasts a 7.7 per cent hit to GDP under a World Trade Deal under WTO rules and a 4.8 per ent contraction under Canada Plus. While all such forecasts are only indicators of orders of magnitude and general direction, independent private sector forecasts and those of Whitehall are wildly far apart, many of which forecast a positive impact on GDP. Such differences have huge consequences for Brexit strategy and the long-term trajectory of future public expenditure, taxation, and borrowing.Your recent evidence to the Lords\u0027 Economic Affairs Committee confirms that the key points of difference are now the benefits accruing from free trade agreements and the impact of any possible new non-tariff barriers. With regard to the latter, you appear to believe that the EU will behave illegally and in defiance of WTO rules that are backed by the international legal order.Differences in assumptions must be debated in detail and resolved. Adopting a constructive and transparent approach would be in the national interest. The general public is battered and bewildered by conflicting predictions of the future path of the economy following Brexit, fuelling a growing suspicion that Whitehall is engaging in what is apparently known internally as \u0027policy-based evidence-making\u0027.We therefore propose that you publish in full detail the cross-Whitehall Brexit analysis and the underlying models and assumptions so that experts from all sides can study its methodology, assumptions, and conclusions.

And a potentially “invisible” one at that.It has a “man-optional” combat mode and potentially allows the military to take humans out of the battle physically by operating the vehicle remotely.The tank features advanced Active Protection System and crew protection from heavy weaponry including IEDs, antitank mines and chemical, biological, radiological and nuclearattacks.BAE’s ADAPTIV program provides camouflage that renders the vehicle essentially “invisible” to enemy forces using “active multi-spectral cloaking”.The cloaking can make the vehicle blend into the background so it seems to vanish. It can even mimic other objects making the tank look like rocks or a car in the eyes of the enemyneed be.The Defensive Aid Suite enables the armoured vehicle to classy targets, give warnings about threats and best manoeuvre guidance to others in the battle space. To prevent the vehicle from getting hit, it can also deploy countermeasures by itself.Human crews can operate from inside the vehicle, but it can also be controlled remotely — from anywhere in the world.The CV tends to involve a two-man turret armed with Bushmaster cannons. This remote-controlled solution allows powerful weapons to be unleashed on the battlefield but reduces the risk to soldiers by taking them out of the turret.The vehicle’s weaponry can be tailored to requirements and there’s quite a range of options — including weapons that can hit enemy aircraft and tanks.Its Fire Control System can already autonomously set the type of ammunition most suitable to defeat these threats, as well as automatically calculating the angles for maximum accuracy. By itself, the vehicle can also choose whether the best approach will be airburst, impact or delayed detonation.In the long term, combat vehicles may conduct missions entirely on their own however it is more likely there will always be humans in the loop.Soldiers could, for example, operate the unmanned CV MkIV combat vehicle while on-board another vehicle to amply the force.Or dismounted soldiers could control the unmanned vehicles, using them to perform reconnaissance in advance of troops.Patrols, whether dismounted or in vehicles, could pilot the smart combat vehicles to travel in front of them so that in the event of an IED the unmanned vehicle would be hit instead of soldiers.From inside a base, soldiers could also send the vehicles out on patrols.And of course, battalions of robotic combat vehicles could eventually be deployed in battles.A version of this story appeared on news.au"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000441416675.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"the everest revellers most raucous race royal randwick","story":"The sozzled revellers left little to the imagination in tiny, plunging dresses despite rain lashing the event in Sydney.And some men appeared worse for wear as they celebrated by hoisting chairs in the air and jumping on each others shoulders.Others quaffed champagne as they watched Liam Payne perform in front of a cheering crowd at the Royal Randwick Racecourse.Everest is Australias richest race day with the winner taking home  million.Redzel romped to victory lading his owners another huge payday ahead of Trapeze Artist, with Osborne Bulls coming home third.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But why do the former rebels of rock music always tug their forelocks to the European Union  Why does everyone in leather trousers act like the EU is an unalloyed good thing  Why does rock music have a blind spot when it comes to Brussels How can Bono, right, possibly mistake Jean-Claude Juncker for Joe Strummer   The EU is the ESTABLISHMENT, man! And the EU is the ­establishment at its most ­unaccountable, undemocratic, incompetent and corrupt.The EU is not a beautul thing, Bono. It is a crumbling ­expansionist empire, rotten to the core, merciless in its opposition to democracy.The EU is a gravy train, Bono, a trough for puffed-up political piggies, a sclerotic body of ­privileged old white men in suits with MEPs who do not have to provide receipts for their £,-a-month expenses. The EU really stinks, Bono.And the music that you and I grew up with — the music we loved, the music U and I were inspired by, the music we placed at the centre of our worlds — was meant to be against this kind of thing. Bono bent the knee to the bullies of Brussels in the same week that Bob Geldof sent a ­letter to Theresa May warning her that Brexit will be the day the music dies.“Imagine Britain without its music,” thundered Geldof’s letter, co-signed by musicians including Sting, Ed Sheeran, Jarvis Cocker and Damon Albarn. “If it’s hard for us, then it’s impossible for the rest of the world. Britain does rule the waves. The airwaves. But Brexit threatens, as it does so much , this vast voice.”But it is simply not true that our country owes its musical genius to the European Union. The golden years of British music were before we joined the EU — when it was still being touted to us as a common market — back in .The Beatles, the Rolling Stones, The Who, The Kinks, Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin all somehow managed to make great music without Brussels. Now Geldof and his co-signatories seriously suggest that British music can’t survive outside the European Union.No doubt the Brexit-loathing Boomtown Rat believes this rubbish but everyone  who signed his Whinge Aid letter should have paused to think before signing. Because by claiming that Brexit will kill British music, Ed Sheeran, Sting and the rest just make themselves look like laughably out-of-touch luvvies. Not a good look for the wild boys of rock ’n’ roll.Geldof is right about one thing — British music has been brilliant for  years because our little country embraced the world.But John Lennon, Jimmy Page, Joe Strummer, Mick Jones, Ray Davies, Robert Plant, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Eric Clapton and Pete Townshend opened their ears and their hearts to the sounds coming out of America.The glorious music that smashed down the walls between white music and black music was born in Chicago and Nashville and Detroit and Memphis.  Its roots were in the backwoods of the Deep South and the ­Mississippi Delta, and reached all the way back to Africa. Belgium never came into it, Bob.The Rolling Stones never needed a grant from the EU. They just needed one glimpse of Buddy Holly, one listen to Muddy Waters, one nod from Elvis Presley. British bands changed the world and they sure as hell did it without the help of the European Union. Sorry, Bob. Sorry, Bono. But no British musician in history was ever inspired by the mysterious rhythms coming out of Brussels.PETER JACKSON’S new film, They Shall Not Grow Old, shows painstakingly coloured images from World War One for the very first time.Because we have only experienced World War One in black and white footage and photos, there has always felt like a huge distance between our time and the unimaginable horrors of the trenches.Lord Of The Rings director Jackson has bridged that gap and the results, above, take your breath away. He says: “The war was a colour war. You’re seeing it as they saw it. And they saw it in colour.”World War One never felt closer. And the humour, humanity and courage of the men who fought it has never been more heartbreaking.BEST wishes for the future to Trevor Engelson and his bride Tracey Kurland, who were married in a low-key ceremony in Calornia last weekend.Andyou don’t recognise the names, that is because Mr Engelson has chosen to keep a discreet silence on the subject of his two-year marriage to Meghan Markle.And in an age where every broken relationship is ­dissected on social media, isn’t it refreshing to see a man who can keep a dignied silence “WE lost the match but won the battle,” claimed Conor McGregor after his beating in last weekend’s UFC .  What planet was that victory on then, Conor To the casual fan it looked like McGregor  followed up months of denigrating Khabib Nurmagomedov with a feeble performance in the octagon and a lack of grace in defeat.True, Khabib spoilt his victory by jumping into the crowd to continue the punch-up with McGregor’s corner.  But for the le of me I can’t see how Conor McGregor can claim anything other than unconditional surrender. Neither man brought credit to MMA.There is only one reason why mainstream sports fans have been paying interest to Mixed Martial Arts in recent years and that is Conor McGregor. But after the squalid scenes around Conor v Khabib, many of us will be turning off the MMA.Even Mike Tyson was shocked. And he once bit off part of a man’s ear.WHAT my mum would have found unforgivable about Strictly star Seann Walsh snogging Katya Jones is that it happened when Walsh’s girlfriend, Rebecca Humphries, was home alone on her BIRTHDAY.My mum would never have forgiven that kind of casual cruelty from some curly-haired love rat. And I suspect the great British public will feel the same. But what we call the Strictly curse is really just an office romance that spirals out of control.People get thrown together at work all the time. The dference is that a couple from the accounts department don’t usually spend hours every day rubbing up against each other perfecting their Paso Doble.But the intense, intimate physical contact of doing Strictly makes it certain the curse will strike again.The mystery is why Katya was never led astray by Ed Balls.FEMALE terrorist, married to a British jihadi, claimed a council breached her human rights by not giving her a new home after she turned down seven homes because they were not big enough or not in the right location.Kindly Brent Council also offered her £, to put down a deposit on a home of her own.Are we insane Our welfare state was built to care for the most vulnerable members of our society.Not creatures who would spit on our society’s grave.TINA TURNER is the only female performer who was hotter live than Blondie’s Debbie Harry in her pouting, heavy-lidded prime.So it comes as some surprise to hear Tina say that she never tried to be sexy on stage. “Fishnets are practical,” Tina says primly. “They don’t run. And leather doesn’t show the perspiration on stage or wrinkle. I only wore a mini-dress because everyone knows you can’t dance in a dress that goes past your knee.”OK, Tina, we believe you – even though your practical work clothes launched a million adolescent fantasies.

This kind of thing is so commonplace that many — some as young as eight — feel street harassment is “part of growing up”. How awful is that  Partly, the problem is that somewhere along the line, the idea that schoolgirls are “sexy” has become normalised, acceptable, even mainstream.Yes, I know that the waters were somewhat muddied by the likes of Britney Spears in her Baby One More Time video and Gemma Arterton in her St Trinian’s films — both looking as sexy as heck in school unorm.  And yes, I know a lot of girls look older than they are, and might even try to do so by wearing make-up, smoking or shortening their skirts on the way to and from school.But let’s be really clear about this. — girls young enough to wear school unorm are children. And the idea of any man thinking it’s OK to wolf-whistle, chat up or give any kind of sexual attention to a girl in a unorm is not just seriously worrying. It should be a criminal offence.By the way, I wonder what a similar survey of boys would find. Because the thought of women wolf-whistling schoolboys in the street is unimaginable, right  Parents of ­secondary school children need to give them some freedom to help them on the path to adulthood.Often, that involves letting them walk unaccompanied to school.  But the idea that doing that is exposing their child to the possibility of sexual harassment will be pretty distressing to any parent.One of the saddest things about this report is how many of the girls interviewed thought this kind of behaviour is “normal”. One -year-old said she felt street harassment was part of the “bro culture” and her dad had told her: “You know what men are like.”  What kind of advice is that for your daughter Another girl, aged , said: “It’s just become normal.” But the net result of behaviour like this is that it makes girls scared of walking the streets.All too often, our response to such news is to try to protect girls by telling them not to look too ­provocative. But that just perpetuates the idea men “can’t help themselves” so it’s down to the girls, and the way they dress, to make sure they are left alone.You can’t blame girls or women for men’s behaviour, no matter what theof their skirt. But the dficult truth is that we know women do have to ­mody their behaviour, and the way they dress, to stop men from ­commenting on their appearance, harassing them or worse.Perhaps what I am most shocked about is the young age at which this starts. One good thing is that these days, girls at secondary school have phones. They can record things that happen to them and report it. Also, Plan International UK is calling on bystanders to challenge harassment when they see it.Certainly,I was around someone wolf-whistling schoolgirls, I’d flip my lid. I would not be too scared to speak my mind and verbally intervene. I think my opening ­gambit would be: “How would you feelthat were your sister, ­granddaughter or daughter some old git was harassing ”To any man reading this who thinks it’s OK to talk to schoolgirls like this, let me tell you some of these girls are terried. It’s not funny or cute. It’s threatening. Lots of teen girls look older than they are butyou are confused and in doubt, here is a clue: The school unorm is a giveaway.Any man who leers at a child in a unorm is nothing short of ­disturbed. Andthey can’t stop themselves from doing so, the law needs to intervene.AS you know, I’m a huge advocate of body acceptance and self-love but I confess to a moment of envy at model Rachel McCord’s fantastic figure.Yes, clearly she must spend most of each day at the gym . . . But you have to give credit where credit is due. And she looks amazing!ANOTHER day, another crazy promise from Labour. This time it was Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell saying a Labour government would bring in a four-day working week.This, as Treasury analysis shows, means Labour would have to borrow £trillion to bankroll its spending spree over the next ten years – the equivalent of £, for every UK household. Frankly,the Labour Party gets into power, it will end up being a zero-day week as business will collapse and there will be no jobs to go to. The simple fact is you can’t run a country or a business on a four-day week.I LOVE a good party as much as the next person.But I can’t be the only person who rolled my eyes at the claim that Coldplay frontman Chris Martin and actress Dakota Johnson hosted a “baby gender reveal party” on Sunday.Apparently, large arches of pink and blue balloons were spotted flying above a star- studded bash at Martin’s Malibu home. Moments later, blue balloons were freed into the air, presumably announcing a baby boy is on the way.The couple claim it was just her birthday party but the singer did help introduce us to the term “conscious uncoupling”. Stand by for this being a new thing . . .She was being “punished” for running away with her Hindu boyfriend.Police were reportedly called to the scene but did not make any arrests – which beggars belief, doesn’t it Stories like this are a reminder that religion can be a negative power as well as a positive.I COULDN’T agree more with Sir Anthony Seldon, above, Buckingham University’s vice-chancellor, who wants the uni to adopt an actively anti-drugs stance.My son is at Buckingham uni and they already have snfer dogs all around campus, randomly checking students. Sir Anthony says he wants to create a “psychological contract” between students and the university so undergraduates implicitly agree to shun drugs when they enrol, which I think is a brilliant idea.His approach is the opposite to Sheffield University, where the student union gave advice on how to take ious hard drugs safely. But the fact is drugs aren’t safe and they ruin lives.  Barely a week goes by without another drug death appearing in the news.Some might say a drug-free campus is unrealistic. And sure, you probably can’t stop everyone taking them.  Nor can you prevent people wanting to experiment.  But making young people really aware that drugs are not only dangerous but illegal can only be a good thing.A WRITER called Kamin Mohammadi had an Instagram rant about “manspreading” this week. And yes, I know this happens. But I think we’ve got to get better at politely asking people to just stop it.Forget gender for a moment. I think it comes down to respect: It’s just blatantly rude to invade someone ’s space and the answer, in my view, is to call the person out.  If someone’s arm is on my arm rest on a train or plane, I ask them – in the nicest possible way – to move it.Let’s not be embarrassed when it’s someone’s legs.My personal bugbear is backpacks. I called a man out for keeping his on while on a crowded Tube train this week and he was really apologetic.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That’s why the Prime Minister’s Chequers proposal was not right.Under such a deal, we would be required to follow EU laws under the EU rule book and we would still be subject to the European Court of Justice.We would be out of Europe, yet still run by Europe. Any proposal that is brought forward and put to Parliament needs to take back control of our laws and make sure the European Court has no say over us.  So what should Theresa May do  The answer, once again, is set out clearly in the  Conservative manesto.It says: “We will seek a deep and special partnership including a comprehensive free-trade and customs agreement.”  That’s why the Prime Minister should move on from her Chequers proposal and seek an advanced free-trade deal with the EU. A comprehensive free-trade deal, like the EU’s free-trade deals with Canada and Japan, is what our manesto promises require.Such a deal would ensure we take back control of our laws, borders, money and trade. It would honour the referendum mandate. It would be in line with our manesto commitments. And it would work for the EU too. The Government’s objection to this is the supposed dficulty of keeping an open border in Northern Ireland.For this reason, Government figures claim we cannot seek a trade deal with the EU unless this problem is solved. This is nonsense.Clear proposals have been set out by two former Northern Ireland Secretaries as to how a frictionless border can be maintained under a free-trade agreement. These proposals have been endorsed by former Brexit Secretary David Davis and Good Friday Agreement architect Lord Trimble.Moreover, former Cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith has set out how we can build on the system of joint border controls at Dover to avoid delays or friction at the UK’s borders — including in Ireland. This would work for the EU’s rules and ensure a positive future relationship going forward.This approach is not simply a bad use of taxpayers’ money. It breaks another manesto pledge.For our  manesto says “it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside our withdrawal, reaching agreement on both within two years” of our serving notice to leave the EU. In other words, by the end of March next year.So it is wrong for the Government to agree withdrawal terms without sorting out the full detail of our future relationship. A temporary fix does not honour the referendum mandate, it does not keep our manesto promise and it certainly fails to look after our hard-earned money.Moreover, would this temporary fix really be temporary  Just ask the people of Norway how such a deal turned out for them. In  they signed the European Economic Area Agreement. They were told by the EU their sovereignty would be respected. Yet  years later, this “temporary” arrangement has become permanent.Meanwhile, the cost has increased ten-fold and nearly , EU directives and regulations have been implemented through Norway’s EEA agreement.Our Government should fear to tread such a dangerous path. Voters will not tolerate any “temporary” arrangement becoming permanent. They would see it as a betrayal. People voted to leave the EU because they wanted change. They believed in Britain and the land of opportunity we can build. They voted to take back control of our laws, money, borders and trade.The Conservative manesto promised that we would leave the EU altogether. That we would seek a free-trade deal and a new national future.Now is the time for the Government to honour the referendum mandate and the Conservative manesto by seeking a free­-trade deal with the EU that enables Britain to become an economic powerhouse in the decades to come.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sir Craig was acting Met Commissioner at the time, earning £, a year.He will avoid any potential disciplinary action when he leaves after  years’ service.Insp Matt Webb, of the Sussex Police Federation, said his actions on that day were unforgivable and called for him to be stripped of his knighthood.Online pranksters altered a pic of Sir Craig getting his gong, replacing it with a white feather — a symbol of cowardice.Met chief Cressida Dick said: “Sir Craig had absolutely no opportunity to save PC Palmer.”And coroner Mark Lucraft QC told last week’s inquest Sir Craig couldn’t have done anything to stop the attack.Scotland Yard’s counter-terror chief Neil Basu branded the cowardice claims “abhorrent”.Sir Craig said he remained in the vehicle with two civilian colleagues because they had no protective equipment or a radio.He tried to get out of the car but was advised by an officer on guard at the site to leave.Michelle Palmer says her husband “was left at a vulnerable location with no protection to die.” He was carrying only a truncheon and CS spray.She should have received a lump sum of £, from the Met for his death. It is understood that they are considering a civil action for damages.Masood’s rampage left five dead.

Boardroom bobbies have closed ranks around Mackey, saying he had no choice but to keep out of danger. That’s probably what the rule book says.But real heroes act out of instinct, not self-interest.The contrast between Mackey’s actions and the bravery of PC Keith Palmer, or the off-duty PC Charlie Guenigault who ran TOWARDS danger in London Bridge, could not be clearer. The latter was awarded the George Medal this week.

Supporters of the far-right group were marching from Park Lane to Whitehall before some of them started to push through their police escorts. Dozens were seen fighting with police officers, with one seen threatening a policeman and screaming Ill kill you. Scores of police on horseback and wearing riot gear tried to control the swelling groups with police vans trying to block them in. Many DLFA supporters seemed extremely hostile to police, screaming at them for perceived inaction against paedos and grooming gangs.  The Mirrors Kevin Maguire said a DFLA executive member had promised , football hooligans would take to the streets. However, figures suggest around , people joined the protest with around , on a counter-protest opposing them. On Facebook , the DFLA organisers had said they were protesting ing jihadists, thousands of Awol migrants, rape gangs and groomers, and veterans treated like traitors. The DFLA have previously organised marches in Sunderland, Birmingham and London, with support of UKIP leader Gerard Batten and former EDL leader Tommy Robinson.  DFLA demonstrator Peter Mantell, , from Crayford, told the Press Association: I detest some of the people Im walking with. A lot of them hate people because of the colour of their skin. Im a lefty. But I believe we should have a voice against the people who want to hurt everyone and cause harm. Mr Mantell said he was a supporter of former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson.  Counter-protesters, representing groups such as Momentum and trade unions, managed to block the DFLA march route at one point.

But he has yet to decide when the new rules will be introduced. And campaigners – who warn more lives will be ruinedthe measures are delayed – are backing a Commons showdown that could see Mr Hammond’s Budget challenged. Backbenchers could put down an amendment that would see it defeated and the FOBT rules brought in.  One source said: “The people getting organised are those he needs to keep onside. At the moment Tory backbenchers are willing to rebel at the drop of a hat, so he needs to be really careful. “He’s going to come under pressure from the backbenches as well as Number . They won’t want to go to war over a relatively small issue like this. After all, these are the MPs they need to keep onside for Brexit.“There’s no good reason not to do it, unless pressure from thegambling lobby is too much.” The Sunday People launched a campaign against the terminals dubbed the crack cocaine of gambling.Rules allowed customers to bet up to pound every  seconds. We fought to have the stakes reduced to pound. After years of pressure, the Treasury finally caved in. But they angered campaigners by appearing to delay the introduction of the new rules.  This followed pressure from the gambling industry who claimed the reduction in stakes would cost jobs and dent their profits. Bookies have claimed it will cost the Treasury poundmillion a year in lost tax and risk , jobs. Labour MP Carolyn Harris, Chair of the FOBT All Party Parliamentary Group said: “The Government must set a date in the Budget for when the FOBT stake is going to be reduced, and that should be April  at the very latest. “Anything after that would be indefensible and further evidence this Government cares little about improving society or helping vulnerable people. “The harm caused by FOBTs cannot go on.” LIVES ARE IN HIS HANDS By Liz and Charles Ritchie Founders of Gambling with LivesOur son Jack was just  when he took his own le almost a year ago because of a gambling addiction.

But, as was pointed out to me this week,at pm on a Wednesday you really want to watch a competition between the red team and the blue team then BBC One’s Bargain Hunt is on. In some ways it’s a shame, though, because this week Jeremy Corbyn did what he’s been threatening to do for a long time. He completely took Theresa May apart. It has been a long road to get to this point for the Labour leader but worth the wait.  Manchester United’s Paddy Crerand once said about George Best that the star’s footwork left opponents with “twisted blood”. And that was the case this week. Mrs May was gutted, shydemolished, ruined, schooled – take your pick. This came about because Mr Corbyn attacked with shyquestions on austerity. And she has no answers. None. Zero. So she evades and ducks and es. To get an answer about austerity you need to talk to the police, firemen, teachers, NHS, armed forces, councils and ask how it’s going for them  Ask the people who are working but are still on their way to food banks how the end of shyausterity is coming along. I’ll save you a bit of time – it’s not going well. Mr Corbyn said: “Poverty is up. Homelessness and deaths on our streets are up. Living standards down, public services slashed and a million elderly are not getting the care they need. “Wages have been eroded and all the while billions were found for tax giveaways for big shycorporations and the super-rich.” Hard to argue with that.

Mishkin, , used the alias Alexander Petrov for the failed hit on the double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury in March. Accomplice Ruslan Boshirov was unmasked as GRU colonel Anatolly Chepiga and Mishkin’s true identity as a doctor in Russia’s GRU military shyintelligence emerged last week. He now faces allegations of plotting to use the same nerve agent on former MI officer Christopher Steele during a visit to Britain  months earlier. KGB defector Boris Karphichkov, , claims Mishkin was part of a GRU special ops group that slipped into the country in late February . According to information a GRU source gave him on a recent trip to Europe, they were here to kill Steele, , on the direct orders of Putin.  Karpichkov said: “I was told Steele was to be liquidated using the same stuff as the Skripals. The shyassassins shyinitially conducted surveillance both on Steele’s house in Farnham, Surrey, and at his London office. “The operation was aborted when they realised the house was guarded with a lot of CCTV. As they also quickly established he was not appearing at his office, they concluded it was too risky to carry out the operation.” The bid came after Steele was outed as the author of a -page dossier shyalleging Donald Trump romped with prostitutes during a  trip to Moscow. The file also claimed Trump had co-operated with Russia for years and warned compromising shymaterial on him could lead to blackmail. The US President has denied the claims in the “phony and corrupt shydossier” and called Steele a “lowle”. And President Putin wanted Steele dead for souring his relations with Trump and jeopardising dodgy shybusiness deals with people close to him.  Karpichkov said his source did not give him Mishkin’s real identity. But the former major in the KGB and its FSB successor added: “He shycontinually referred to him as ‘esculap’ – which is Russian for ‘clinician’. He said he was involved in some nerve agent research involving macaque monkeys.” This took place at the GRU’s secret labs in Kirov, known officially as the th Central Research Institute of the Ministry of Defence. Steele and Karpichkov were both targets on an eight-name Russian hit list revealed by the Sunday People earlier this year – which also included Skripal, . Karpichkov’s source said the Skripal strike was shyoriginally to be carried out by the FSB but the GRU stepped in after winning a power struggle.He added: “The FSB have more field knowledge and expertise to carry out such sensitive missions. But the GRU convinced Putin its operatives should carry out the extermination of one of their own traitors.  “That shows Putin was definitely aware of the operation.” The FSB transferred its hit squad to a second Russian exile living in Britain, former Aeroflot deputy director Nikolai Glushkov, . He was found strangled in his home in New Malden, Surrey, a week after the Salisbury shyattack. Glushkov had accused the Kremlin of murdering his friend, the Putin critic Boris Berezovsky. He claimed political asylum here after Russia accused him and Berezovsky, who died in , of a criminal shyconspiracy involving Aeroflot. But Karpichkov says Glushkov was really probing how Russian shyintelligence use Aeroflot as cover for overseas operations. The GRU has been led by Colonel-General Igor Korobov, , since February . But after its failure to kill Skripal in Salisbury and bungled operations where, he faces the sack. Putin is so furious with the GRU bungling he has ordered all future operations to be supervised by the FSB. Karpichkov said: “The most likely replacementis Lieutenant-General Sergei Gizunov. He’s Putin’s most trusted man in Russian military intelligence.” Gizunov was banned from the US by Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, as punishment for suspected cyber shyattacks in the  election. Steele’s company, Orbis Business Intelligence, was paid pound, to shyoutline Russian financial and personal links to Trump’s election campaign. The dossier stressed the allegations in it were “unveried”. According to court papers Steele filed in the US, the dossier was handed over “on a confidential basis in hard copy form” to British intelligence services because it “had implications for the national security of the US and the UK”. Last week Steele broke his silence with a swipe at Trump. He told Vanity Fair magazine: “In these strange times, it is hard to speak unpalatable truths to power but we all have a duty to do so.” "},{"url":null,"title":"bride be 25 wakes up","story":"NewsBride-to-be, , wakes up ‘entirely dferent person’ after her memory is wiped by rare brain conditionFran Geall, , from Falmouth, doesnt recognise her closest relatives or remember five years of university studiesShareCommentsByMike Smallcombe:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsFran with her brother, Joe, after her le was turned upside down \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA bride-to-be woke up an entirely dferent person after her memory was wiped by a rare brain infection. Fran Geall, , was left unable to recognise even her closest relatives and friends after contracting auto-immune condition encephalitis - a condition where the bodys immune system starts attacking healthy brain cells. The marine biologist, from Falmouth, Cornwall, even lost all recollection of her pound, five-year university education and now has to learn how to live all over again.She told Plymouth Live even her niece and fiancee Staceys family were unrecognisable.Fran said: With people Im told Ive known for years, it can be like meeting them for the first time, which is really sad.  I also feel like Im meeting myself again, because I have absolutely no idea who I was before all this was. People say theres a new Fran, that Im a dferent person and theyre having to accept that. Im not so sureI like the new Fran, though. All I want is to get back to the old me, who achieved so much and built so many loving relationships. As ‘old Fran’ she completed an undergraduate degree in marine biology, before being awarded a Master of Science in sustainable agriculture from Plymouth University. Keen to work in ethical agriculture, in January she landed her dream job working as a business development manager for an oyster company in Whitstable, Kent.  In December  she also became engaged to marry the love of her le, teacher Stacey Tonkins, , who she had met at university over a year earlier. But her happiness was shattered in March this year, when she began suffering with migraines so crippling that she was forced to stay in bed for a week.She saw her GP and once visited AE , but doctors thought she had pulled a muscle in her neck, as she could not put her chin to her chest.Then, one morning, she began having a seizure in bed and it became clear something was very wrong - prompting Stacey to call an ambulance to rush her straight to Kents Ashford Hospital, where she was immediately placed in an induced coma. When she came around a week later, she felt like a completely dferent person.  Unable to read, walk or speak for several weeks, she is still having to relearn many basic le skills. Doing the simplest things, like using a computer or navigating around a supermarket, have now become very dficult, Fran said. But what is heartbreaking for me is that my intellect, which was like my superpower, is now gone, and all the years I spent learning facts and learning about the natural world has been wiped out like chalk on a blackboard. Despite having scant memories of her le before her brain condition, Fran said she still feels an instinctive emotional link to many of her loved ones, including Stacey, her parents and her siblings. But she has no recollection at all of her sisters-in-law or her niece and is now having to rebuild these relationships from scratch. She said: When Stacey and my family visited me in hospital, I knew instinctively that they were people I loved, but I couldnt remember anything about them, apart from very minimal, basic details. They would show me photos of old times together and it wouldnt jog anything - its like looking at someone s le. I couldnt speak, I couldnt walk and I had no idea who anyone around me was or what had happened to me.  Slowly, her faculties began to , although Fran could write before she could talk. I dont know why, but the first thing I was able to write down was my mums telephone number. I couldnt remember anything, but for some reason I could remember that, she said. The second thing I wrote was, things are a jumble. My friends and family tried to communicate by speaking and writing things down, too, but I couldnt understand anything. Things gradually improved when Fran was given a plasma exchange  days after being admitted to hospital, a procedure which replaced the white blood cells in her system that had been attacking her brain. After that, her speech recovered and she started writing a daily diary, although it did not trigger any memories. Discharged from hospital after five weeks, and determined to get back to normal, she ed to work. Within a few days, however, it became clear it was not going to be possible for her to stay when she had a major seizure. I realised then that my recovery would take a lot longer than I had imagined, she explained. The doctors have no ideaI will ever regain my memories, so Im living with the prospect of potentially having to relearn everything I ever knew. Fran, who once studied in Falmouth, now lives in the town to be near Staceys family, who are helping to support the couple. And Fran is putting all her energy into her recovery. She said: When Im out people will sometimes come up to me and say hello, as they recognise me from when I lived here before. Obviously, they dont know what Ive been through. I have no idea who they are, but still smile and pretend to know them. We only have a brief conversation, so theyre usually none the wiser. If I talk to anyone for longer, they can usually tell something isnt quite right, so I tell them what happened. Luckily, Fran has not lost her hunger for knowledge and is now reading up on everything she learnt at university. But she can only study for short periods, as the mental exertion can trigger seizures. As doctors have no idea what caused her encephalitis, a condition which still frequently baffles the medical profession, Fran often blames herself for what happened. “In a way, I feel like its my fault. Theres no logic to that whatsoever, butI tell myself that its just unfair, it puts me into a spiral of depression. Telling myself that there was some reason behind it lets me think that I can somehow get better and move on, even though no one seems to knowIll ever have my memory back. Although the future remains uncertain, Fran is delighted when people tell her they still see signs of the person she used to be. “People say that I used to crack a lot of jokes, and Im starting to do that again now. But I suppose when youre in a situation like mine, what  can you do  "},{"url":null,"title":"eugenie royal wedding cheeky savannah","story":"NewsEugenie royal wedding: Cheeky Savannah Phillips stands on brides train in official wedding photographsThe seven-year-old bridesmaids mischievous move came after she had Prince George in fits of giggles during the ceremony on Friday afternoonShareCommentsByMark Chandler:,  OCT NewsSavannah put her foot on Eugenies train\"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSavannah Phillips performed a cheeky move in Princess Eugenies royal wedding photos.Stunning official snaps of -year-old Eugenies marriage to Jack Brooksbank , , were released last night , a day after their Windsor Castle ceremony.One image showed the beaming bride and groom surrounded by their bridesmaids and page boys.And eagle-eyed royal fans have spotted Savannah appeared to be deliberately standing on Eugenies train.The mischievous seven-year-old, daughter of Peter and Autumn Phillips, is seen grinning at the camera as she places her left foot on the dress.

Harry mutters something to Meghan and her eyebrows raise before she turns her head towards him, using what looks like an emphatic gesture with each word of her reply.  She told the Daily Mail : Harry starts to talk to her and she performs a subtle eye-dart to her left, a bit like a mother whose kid is trying to interrupt her grown up conversation.

But they were lying down in the far corner of the field so we thought it should be safe. “We had our nine-month-old dog with us, a Boston Terrier, which was calm and on a lead.

I turned and saw them about ft behind us. “I looked forward to judge how far we were from the gate but in that second they charged. “One butted me into the air and I landed on my we, which saved her. Then a cow stood up on its rear legs and landed on me. That’s how cattle fight off predators in the wild. My we was screaming, ‘get off him’. It was like being in a tumble drier, there were  cows trampling me and I could hear my bones breaking. “Everything went black and when I opened my eyes I couldn’t see my we. “I followed the trail of blood out of the field and found her. I thought I was going to die as I sat on the ground. I did a first aid course days earlier and I knew thatyou weren’t in major pain despite obvious injuries then it was serious.” Pampered cows who listen to moo-sic by Calvin Harris produce quality milk for award winning cheesesLuckily, a passing motorist saw the stricken couple in the village of Cosgrove, Bucks, and called .

Poundworld collapsed in June with the loss of , jobs and  stores. Five Pound World is the brainchild of businessman Dev Singh, managing director of Opium Group. Everything costs pound with plans to also sell cheaper products in multiples at the same price point. The budget brand is set to go head-to-head with competitors such as BM by opening other shops across the country. It will rent spaces that have been left vacant by Poundworld, which went into administration earlier this year. The collapse of Poundworld was a major blow to the high street.

The former javelin world champion ended up in a string of children’s homes after being abandoned as a baby and later raped by her mother’s drunken boyfriend. Her saviours were a love of athletics and coach Margaret Whitbread who took her under her wing at  and adopted her. Now Fatima – who has -year-old son Ryan – wants to give a child in need the chance of a better le, just like she had. “I have empty nest syndrome now because Ryan is at university,” says Fatima, who raised her boy alone after her estranged husband Andy died in .  “I have been thinking about fostering and adopting recently, especially now my son is moving away after he finishes next year. “I raised him to be independent and he can cook, iron and clean. It was always really important for me to be a hands-on mum. “I have a lot of love in me and it runs through everything I do. There is no iding line for me. “I always knew how lucky I was to find the love of the Whitbreads. I would happily give that same love and care to someone .” Found abandoned in a council flat at three months old, Fatima spent much of her childhood in and out of children’s homes and says she still suffers “crippling anxiety” from her time in care. Her mother later drted back into her le and social services arranged for Fatima to have visits to her home in the hope of a permanent reunion. But it turned into a nightmare and at the age of  she was raped by her mother’s boyfriend – while her mother held a kne to her throat to “quieten her down”. The turning point in her young le came when she met javelin coach Margaret, now , at her local athletics club and began spending a lot of time with the shyWhitbread family – eventually leading to her adoption at .  A settled and determined Fatima went on to compete in three Olympics, winning bronze at the  Los Angeles Games, and silver in Seoul in . In  she had set a world record and the following year in Rome became world champion and was voted the BBC Sports Personality of the Year. After her eight-year marriage to athletics promoter Andy Norman broke down and her career ended prematurely through injury, Fatima stepped out of the spotlight. But her appearance on I’m A Celebrity in  endeared her to a whole new legion of fans. Almost  million watched her come third on the hit ITV reality show. Her rollercoaster le has now led to plans to turn her inspirational rags-to-riches story into a film. “I have been working with two film scriptwriters,” she says.“Now it is up to them to get it written. But I’ve been with researchers for the past year and they have read my book Survivor. “Basically the script will focus on the first  years of my le and the  years I spent in children’s homes and the anxiety and isolation I suffered as a result.”She admits the insecurities ingrained in her over those years are never far away.  “I get crippling anxiety still and I have to try to combat that,” she says. “If I stay in my routine then I am not so bad, and so every day I go for a run or to the gym or I walk my dog. “If I don’t have a routine then I find it hard because as an athlete I was always training three or four times a day for  years.” Fatima has recently supported Barnardo’s adoption campaign, which aims to encourage more people to consider taking in vulnerable shychildren. If she gets the chance to adopt or foster, she says it will be a new chapter in a le in which she has triumphed over tragedy. And she’s not fazed by the prospect of adopting a child alone. She says: “My husband died when Ryan was nine and I have been a single mum ever since really. “I didn’t really want to introduce anybody into the equation and I was always a bit worried whether it would upset the apple cart. “It does work for a lot of people, but I have my own issues and I decided I would enjoy being a mum on my own. I have my family around me.

Dionne Mein decided to take on the challenge after she ballooned to st, lbs and a size  after heavy boozing at the weekend and the odd glass of wine after work began to take its toll. Her friends never believed she would be able to keep up her sobriety for an entire month - but to their disbelief the pounds started to drop off once Dionne realised what a huge impact simple changes could have on her le. Determined to prove everyone wrong, the -year-old carer decided to raise money for Macmillan Cancer Support and took on the challenge in October .  Dionne, who lives in Newcastle, managed to lose lbs. She said: Nobody thought I was going to be able to go sober for October. I was drinking a lot. I would come home after work and have a couple of glasses of wine and then drink loads of pints at the weekend. I was out partying all the time and then after a night drinking Id eat loads of takeaway. I decided to go sober for October to raise money for Macmillan and my mum doesnt drink so it was a little thing for her too. In just a month Dionne managed to lose half a stone but after October ended she began to slip into old habits, and the boozy nights ed. In January Dionne was determined to lose the weight for good and began to make simple changes to her diet and to start exercising.

She now is a size eight and has lost a whopping five stone. Shedding her excess weight hasnt only improved Dionnes fitness and lowered her BMI from  to  - from obese to healthy - it has also boosted her self-esteem. Her newfound confidence has made Dionne feel like a new woman and she says without it she never would have met her supportive boyfriend Dean Irving, .  Dionne said: My weight had really started to affect me physically. Just walking around would leave me so out of breath. It even started affecting my job. I work in a care home and people rely on me for help but I was struggling with simple tasks like helping them put their shoes on. It was horrible feeling that way at such a young age. I was just  and I was struggling to help the elderly people in my care. The first session was so dficult that I vomited but I kept at it and what I did for that first session is like my warm up now. My personal trainer Nathan has been amazing. Without him Im sure Id still be fat. And losing weight hasnt just made me healthier, it has made me so much happier.  I was never happy before, people have always seen me as a bubbly person but I was just using that as a front. Whenever I went out, I was always the fat friend. If any guys came over theyd be coming to ask me whos your friend . All my friends are between a size  and . But since losing weight I am so much more confident, Im like a dferent person.

Tracing her fingers over the creases in her granddaughter’s tiny hand, she offered a prediction that would shape Jessie’s le: with a strong writer’s fork, Jessie would go on to be a well-known author. Jessie had been born in her grandmother’s traditional Gypsy wagon in her family’s back garden. Jessie’s mother had given up her traveller le to marry her father, a ‘gorger’and the family lived a settled le, though Jessie had always felt a strong connection to her grandmother and her Romany roots. One of her most poignant childhood memories was standing in the garden aged  watching the traditional burning of the wagon following her grandmother’s death. Sadly things went downhill following her grandmother’s death. Jessie’s much older brothers, who treated her poorly and were sometimes violent, embezzled money from her father’s engineering business, and the family went bankrupt.  ‘The stress was horrendous,’ remembers Jessie. ‘Suddenly, at , we had nothing. My father suffered enormously, and, in the midst of the bankruptcy process, he had a heart attack and died in front of me.’ Jessie and her mother moved to a run-down local authority flat on the outskirts of Southampton. The local kids teased her for being ‘posh’ and threw stones at the windows so that she was afraid to go out. The previous tenants had kept pets, and Jessie found herself covered in a mysterious red rash that turned out to be fleabites. ‘It felt like the bottom had fallen out of my world,’ she says. ‘I was close to my mum, but my brothers still visited frequently – I think my mum was afraid of these ft strapping men. I just felt like I had to get away and be free of it all.’ She landed a job washing dishes in a restaurant in London, and finished school with no qualications. Finding herself thrown into the seedy world of Soho in the s, Jessie was fascinated by the shadowy characters who frequented the area. She ended up marrying a musician at , orcing, and marrying again at . Without an O-level to her name, she found herself in a succession of increasingly depressing dead-end jobs. Over the years, Jessie worked as everything from a sweeper-upper in a hair salon to a bacon slicer in a deli, but she’d never once had a role she enjoyed, and the low salaries were barely enough to pay the bills. By the age of , she had hit rock bottom. Divorced and living in a freezing local authority flat, she was struggling to make ends meet. She hated her job in an electrical factory where she coiled wires for eight hours a day.  Just as her grandmother had predicted, her driving passion had always been writing and she had penned several romantic comedy novels that were now gathering dust.‘Those early books were hard work – they just didn’t seem to flow at all,’ she says.‘I spent donkey’s years slogging away at them, and though a couple of publishers said nice things, no one picked them up. That’s when I decided to write something entirely for my own amusement, a book I wouldn’t even send out to the publishers.’As she lay on the sofa one day, wrapped in a duvet against the cold, she flicked through the TV channels and, by chance, came across a film about the Kray brothers. She was drawn in at once: something about the murky underworld in s London appealed to her enormously. ‘That’s when I thought, “Wouldn’t it be interesting to hear a woman’s point of view, someone caught up in that criminal world ” An idea for a character called Annie Carter came to me, and I set about writing at once.’  For the next five months, Jessie worked furiously on her novel. Her le experiences gave her plenty of fodder for her writing: she knew all about the shady people who visited Soho, so she wove them into her tale of gangland London. Every evening after work, she’d stay up late – often past midnight – getting words down on the page. ‘Something had just clicked, and it was an entirely dferent feeling to when I was toiling away over the romance novels,’ she says. ‘I had an awful, horrible job but I’d get through the day because I knew after work I could just disappear into the page. I suppose it was isolating in a way because I’d spend every evening alone, and I kept myself to myself at work. But I’ve always been a pretty solitary creature.’ Jessie’s book was quickly starting to take shape, so she knew she needed to invest in a typewriter. But with no savings and bills to pay, Jessie had to find an imaginative way to cobble the funds together. She dug out her old wedding dress, took it to a second hand dress shop, and left with four crisp pound notes in her hand – just enough to buy a beaten up old typewriter.  After five months of tapping out , words a day, Jessie had a completed manuscript that she was surprised to find she liked. ‘I remember thinking, “This isn’t half bad.” At this point I decided to read my tarot cards, just like my grandmother had taught me.’ Jessie drew ‘double death’ from the pack, a sign that something monumental is about to take place. ‘I knew then, for absolute certain, that the book was going to be a big success – it was right there in the cards.’ She made a few copies of the , word manuscript she’d titled Dirty Game, and send it out to six agents. A week later, she received two offers from agents who loved the book and wanted to represent her. In the highly competitive world of publishing, this was big news, but Jessie wasn’t surprised at all: she’d seen it in the cards. ‘A couple of weeks after my agent took me on, she told me that a publisher had shown an interest, but warned me not to get excited because these things often came to nothing. Two days after that, she rang again and said, “I hope you’re sitting down, because you’ve got a three-book deal for a six figure sum!”’ "},{"url":null,"title":"prince harry meghan markle mid","story":"NewsPrince Harry and Meghan Markle in mid-air scare as £m private jet hit by lightningThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex had been travelling to Amsterdam for a partyShareCommentsByZoe ShentonUS Showbiz Editor :,  OCT NewsMid-flight scare: Prince Harry and Meghan Markles plane hit by lightning\"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrince Harry and Meghan Markle were caught up in a mid-air scare when their private jet was hit by lightning, it has been reported.

As expected the day was a lavish affair, with tiaras, designer gowns, decadent flower arrangements and a whole host of famous faces - everyone from Cara Delevingne to Robbie Williams was in attendance.It would be fair to say we were keeping an eagle-eye on everything that was going on throughout the ceremony, and at one pint we couldnt help but notice something a little odd.  With over  guests invited to the wedding, it was said the couple would have to add extra seats to the venue to fit everyone in. So with lots of chairs to fill, why on earth would the couple leave one of the best seats in the church empty This was the question on our lips when we realised that a front row seat beside the senior members of the royal family was noticeably not filled on the day.But it turns out there was a very good reason for this - and its all to do with the Queen.  The reason the seat would have been empty is so Eugenie could keep her grandmother happy.Traditionally the Queen and the rest of the royals sit in the right hand choir pews at St Georges Chapel , closest to the altar, as was previously seen in May.And royal protocol dictates that no one is allowed to sit in front of the Queen and obstruct her view.

For example The Number, the firm behind the market-leading  , charges pound. per call and then pound. a minute, which works out at pound.. Rivals Maureen charge the same amount for  seconds but Telecom can demand pound.. Charges are the same from landlines and mobile phones. However, some mobile providers make things worse by adding their own p “access” charge to bills.  Campaigners say the rip-off directory enquiry calls cannot be justied when similar services can be found for much less or nothing. The Post Office charges just pound for calls to its   number. The Number also provides a free service on   ,callers are willing to listen to an advert. The opening up of directory enquiries in  to new providers was meant to boost competition and cut prices, but bills soared. Operators have to register themselves and follow strict rules but there is no licensing system. Watchdog Ofcom has now launched a consultation on prices which is due to publish its findings by the end of the year. It could lead to a cost cap of pound. for a -second call – in line with charges of five years ago. David Hickson of the Fair Telecoms Campaign said: “Ofcom intends to give providers four months in which to make the necessary changes. It’s about time, operators have been ripping people off for far too long.” "},{"url":null,"title":"retro home time capsule 60s","story":"NewsRetro home is a time capsule to the s - and it has a secretThe unique five-bedroom abode come with a host of new features and has been used as a filming locationShareCommentsByNeil Murphy:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsThe house has a large swimming pool built into the floor \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThis jaw-dropping home has hit the market and comes with a fascinating hidden feature - a huge circular swimming pool.

The ten-year-old childs body was found with a stone in its mouth, possibly out of fear the child would come back to le and spread an infectious disease such as malaria. The skeleton was uncovered at a commune in Teverinay, Italy by archaeologists from Arizona and Stanford universities. The bones are the latest in a string of unusual discoveries made at the Cemetery of the Babies since excavations began in . As well as dozens of childrens remains, archaeologists have found evidence of witchcraft including toad bones, raven talons and bronze cauldrons.  David Soren, a University of Arizona archaeologist, said: Ive never seen anything like it. Its extremely eerie and weird. Locally, theyre calling it the Vampire of Lugnano. Known as the La Necropoli dei Bambini in Italian, the cemetery dates to the mid-fth century when a deadly malaria outbreak swept through the area, killing many old and young. The bodies of the victims were buried at an abandoned Roman villa built at the end of the first century B.C. Until now the cemetery - which also contained the remains of a sacriced puppy - was believed to be designed specically for toddlers and unborn foetuses. A previous dig unearthed the body of the -year-old girl with stones used to weigh down her feet, a practice used in dferent cultures to keep the dead in their graves.  The discovery of the -year-old, whose age was determined by studying its teeth but whose sex is unknown, is the first evidence that the cemetery was also used for older children. It also provides evidence that the ancient community was worried about the undead. Soren added: We know that the Romans were very much concerned with this and would even go to the extent of employing witchcraft to keep the evil — whatever is contaminating the body — from coming out. The -year old was the first at the cemetery to be found with a stone in its mouth. Similar graves have been unearthed in other locations, including in Venice, where an elderly th-century woman dubbed the Vampire of Venice was found with a brick in her mouth in .  In  in Northamptonshire, England, a man from the third or fourth century was discovered buried facedown with his tongue removed and replaced with a stone. Other examples of vampire burials throughout history include bodies being staked to the ground through the heart or dismembered before they are put in their tombs. Archaeologists willto the gruesome graveyard next summer to complete excavations of the cemetery. Jordan Wilson, a doctoral student at the University of Arizona, said: Its a very human thing to have complicated feelings about the dead and wonderthats really the end. Anytime you can look at burials, theyre signicant because they provide a window into ancient minds. We have a saying in bioarchaeology: The dead don’t bury themselves. We can tell a lot about peoples beliefs and hopes and by the way they treat the dead."},{"url":null,"title":"worlds oldest woman 129 reveals","story":"NewsWorlds oldest woman, , reveals only happy day in long le that she claims is Gods punishmentKoku Istambulova claims to be -years-old and has spoken of a le of great hardshipShareCommentsByMirror:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video worlds-oldest-woman-aged--,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman who claims to be the oldest person in the world has told of the one happy day in her le. According to her Russian passport Koku Istambulova is -years-old, her birthday on  June  making her the oldest living person by more than six years. Many official documents were destroyed in the wars that ravaged her native Chechnya, meaning her age is impossible to very. If she is truly , then Koku lived through the toppling of Tsar Nicholas II in  and was  when her native Chechen people were deported en masse by Stalin to the steppes of Kazakhstan almost  years ago. “It was a bad day, cold and gloomy,” she said of the February morning in  when the entire nation was banished from their mountain homeland in the Trans-Causacus. “We were put in a train and taken … no one knew where. “Railway carriages were stuffed with people - dirt, rubbish, excrement was everywhere.”  Speaking in her native Chechen, Koku recalled young Caucasus girls dying when their bladders ruptured because they were too embarrassed to go to the toilet in the crowded, stinking trains. Koku added: “On the way to our exile, dead bodies were just thrown out of the train. “Nobody was allowed to bury the dead. “Corpses were eaten by dogs. My father-in-law was thrown out of the train in this way.” Earlier this year Koku said she had never lived a happy day in her le and was alive only through Gods grace. While she has again spoken of great hardship during the Soviet regime, Koku recalled a time when things looked a little brighter. Following Stalins death the Chechens  year exile came to an end, allowing many tohome only to discover their houses had been taken by Russians.  Undeterred and without the help of her lazy husband, Koku set about building herself somewhere to live. She said: Youre askingI had a single happy day in my le. “It was the day when I first entered my house. “It was very small and I stoked the stove with wood. “But it was my home. “I built it myself, the best house in the world. “I lived there for  years.” Kokus great granddaughter Medina, , now cares for the elderly woman.  She said that Koku feels the loss of her daughter Tamara, a mother of six and grandmother of , who died several years ago. “After her death Koku went almost blind, Medina said. “She hardly walks now. And when she recalls her daughter, my own granny, she gets anxious. “She cries many times a day as she recalls her daughter.” Things were very dferent for Koku when she was growing up. She claims to have never been to school, instead looking after animals, farming the family garden and caring for her ailing relatives. She said: “Father was ill, then mother was ill. Grandma was ill. “I was the oldest, how could I leave them ” As for romance, Koku married a younger man called Magomed who was chosen for her from another village. “I didnt know him at all,” she said. “But then I started to love him. “What  could I doI got married  “I had to endure. “He wasnt handsome at all.” Previously asked about the secret of her long le, Koku claimed it was Gods will and that long le is not at all Gods gt for me - but a punishment. She asked: Why did Allah give me such a long le and so little happiness  “I would have been dead long ago,not for Allah who was holding me in his arms. “It is hard to live when all who remembered you died long ago. And it is very scary to die, however old you are.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

It means the state-of-the-art school is well on track for opening its doors to pupils and staff in October . Built in the grounds of the existing academy, the new school is keenly anticipated as it’s set to not only transform learning and teaching, but will also signicantly enhance facilities for the local community. The new building will have space for up to  young people, with modern classrooms, massive games hall, two all-weather pitches, games courts and a host of other exciting facilities which are sure to impress pupils, staff and the wider public. Kier Construction is building the school, which is being delivered by South Ayrshire Council in partnership with hub South West. The project is part of a poundmillion programme of works delivered across South Ayrshire with the aim of boosting education standards through targeted investment in schools and communities. Councillor Peter Henderson, the council’s resources and performance portfolio holder, said: “Our new, extended and refurbished schools are completely transforming learning across South Ayrshire and the new Queen Margaret Academy is shaping up to do more of the same. We’re committed to creating modern learning environments that not only inspire children and young people, but provide an important hub and network for the local community. “We want those attending our schools to achieve their full potential when they move on from school and our focus on providing the best education possible, with the best facilities, means we are on our way to achieving this ambition. “Our schools always play a key role in local le so we’re ensuring that their excellent sports facilities can be accessed by the wider public. We also ensure there are areas of our schools that can be used by community groups and the new Queen Margaret Academy will be no dferent.” Michael McBrearty, chief executive of delivery partner, hub South West Scotland, said: “The new school will be a fantastic contemporary and innovative learning environment that will create an abundance of opportunities and benefits to the entire community.” Brian McQuade, managing director of Kier Construction Scotland  north-east England, said: “Up to  people have been on site during peak periods of activity and to date we have created one apprenticeship, seven work placements and three student summer intern placements. This has provided young local talent the opportunity to gain valuable experience working on a state-of-the-art building and a unique insight into the built environment and the erse range of roles available.” Oonagh Browne headteacher at Queen Margaret Academy said: “It’s exciting to see our new school taking shape. Parents, young people and staff were crucial in planning the facilities for our new school, so it’s very much their project and this only increases their anticipation”. The Bishop of Galloway, Right Reverend William Nolan said: “While the ground works were taking place little seemed to be happening on site but in recent months the structure of the building has sprung up, giving a sense of excitement and anticipation as we look forward to the completion next year of a centre of learning that will inspire our young people.” When the new school opens, the old building will be demolished and the site fully landscaped.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEducationSchoolsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"60k christmas lights up grabs","story":"Alexandra McCready switches on the lights with the help of the cast of the Ayr Gaiety pantomime Cinderella.\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA pound, Christmas lights fund is up for grabs in villages and towns needing an illumination boost. But where the cash goes will be decided by South Ayrshire council officials depending on the needs of dferent areas. The move was approved at the full council meeting last week after a heated clash between rival councillors. Councillor Hugh Hunter put forward a motion for pound, cash to be distributed with a maximum of pound going to each town and pound for villages. He said communities faced a major challenge to raise money for lights. He said the council’s “huge” underspend should be used to pay for the festive displays. But his seasonal gesture was snubbed by ruling councillors who backed an amendment from Councillor Alec Clark to make pound, available instead. Independent Councillor Clark said: “We will try and bring some joy into people’s lives.” His amendment said: “With this fund it is important that the funding does not supplant or compete with the work that has been taking place over a number of years.” Conservative Councillor Hunter questioned how communities were supposed to apply for the cash but was told there wouldn’t be an application process. Labour Councillor Brian McGinley said: “There has been an issue with Christmas lights over a number of years.” He added: “We don’t want to undo the good work already going on in the community.” Responding to probes from the conservative opposition, he said: “We will talk to people about the current arrangements and do what we can.” Councillor Hunter said: “I can’t support the amendment. I ask councillors to support the clear motion.” Speaking after the meeting, Councillor Hunter said: “It wasn’t clear how communities could access it. It is really foggy and disappointing that we couldn’t get to the bottom of it.” Councillor Bob Pollock said he is concerned “some areas may miss out.” He said there was “no coherent explanation” on how the money would be “decided or managed” with only six weeks left until switch on. In a press release Councillor McGinley said: “We obviously have a finite amount of resources, so we know that we won’t be able to do everything that communities want right away, but it’s a terric starting point that will support people and places right across South Ayrshire at this special time of year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilChristmasAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrshire student launches campaign against","story":"NewsAyrshire student launches campaign against spikingCara’s drive to keep young women safer when they’re out on the town.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsCara Taven has launched a Facebook page named Girls Against Spiking. \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA campaign has been set up to raise awareness of people having their drinks spiked. Cara Taven, from Coylton, set up a Facebook page called ‘Girls Against Spiking’to bring to light the effects of spiking on nights out and to, hopefully, eradicate it. The Facebook page, which has gained a following of over  people in one week, hopes to attract the attention of nightclubs and bars and is aiming for lids to be put on all drinks served at their bars as part of a drive to stop people having their drinks spiked.  Cara, , told the Post about her campaign. She said: “I have heard a lot about people getting spiked recently, in my local area and in the Glasgow region, and I know that a lot of people in Ayr do go out in Glasgow. “It tends to be younger girls about my age that get affected by spiking and that was something I have really started to think about. “This is something that could happen to anyone. “I’m a law student and the reason why I wanted to study law was to represent people who maybe don’t have the confidence to represent themselves and to make a dference that way and I think that is where getting the idea to make the page has come from. “I honestly thought it would be a page where the girls at my work could like – I am surprised by the response. “I remember saying to someone at work ‘If you like the page it’ll take me to  likes’ – then when I woke up in the morning and it was . “I haven’t been affected by spiking – it’s not really about me or anyone that I know. It is about the community of girls my age. “ I just felt like the answer was there and no one has done anything about it until now.” The Post reported how Cleo Smillie, , from Ayr, was on a night out in Madrid with her friend, Marc Davies, when she blacked out after one sip of her pink gin and lemonade. It was later learned that she had a high level of GHB in her blood – the date-rape drug.

An astute, respected and independent body, its remit would be to act for the long term greater good of the Ayrshire coast and its stakeholders - and issue unorm guidelines to prevent North, East and South Ayrshire councils peppering our seascapes with all kinds of piecemeal shoreline developments. Sadly, such a badly-needed supervisory power is still only a figment of my imagination. But had it existed – it would have poured over builder McCarthy and Stone’s ‘Legoland’ plans for the former Malcolm Sargent House site at Prestwick . . . before hobbing them into the nearest bin! As it is, neighbouring Prestwick Golf Club have taken the legal ‘ last resort’ and petitioned for a judicial review of South Ayrshire Council’s decision to grant planning approval. Successfully overturning SAC’s November  decision is the legal equivalent of holing a  footer on Prestwick’s th green. Only six per cent of inidual judicial reviews succeed. But they can take comfort in the classic  judicial review when planning permission for wind turbines was challenged because they were in the flight path of ospreys nesting hundreds of miles away! Lord Hope ruled that while no inidual with land interests had objected to the turbines, the “natural environment” is everyone’s interest. He memorably pronounced: “The osprey has no means of protecting itself. If its interests are to be protected, someone needs speak on its behalf”. Prestwick’s Golf Club’s members are scattered across the county, the country and the world. Not a single one of them has inidual land interests affected by the proposed development. But the  Tom Morris designed links - its fairways, dunes, greens, unique location, backcloth, traditions and history - cannot protect itself. In the spirit of Lord Hope’s ruling, its members are “speaking on its behalf”. And I say good luck to them. As I also said, their chances on paper are slim. Butit hits the Court of Session, and the man in the big seat has a Royal and Ancient tie under his robe – or bits of Muirfield on the golf shoes in the boot of his Jag - well . . . you just never know! Prestwick’s members are no fools either – they hope their legal move will get everyone back around the table for complete rethink on the scale of McCarthy and Stone’s plans. The builder will no doubt deny any adverse reflection on Prestwick – but you can bet the proximity of the historic links will be in the first paragraph in any of their sales brochures! McCarthy and Stone made a pound million profit in . Their average UK apartment price is almost pound, - and they’re planning  of them at Prestwick . . . that’s pound. million. With those numbers at stake – McCarthy and Stone will be putting all kinds of pressure on South Ayrshire Council not to cave in. Prestwick Golf Club doesn’t have a problem with the site being developed – but rightly ask that any development be appropriate in design and scale to its noble and historic surroundings. And that’s something McCarthy and Stone can easily afford. Prestwick Golf Club is a legendary place for winners. And there will be legendary amounts of Kummel quaffed in the clubhousethey win this one!Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEnvironmentPrestwickAirAsiaAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"chief inspector makes return south","story":"NewsChief inspector makes ato South AyrshireChief Inspector Derek Frew takes over the reigns from Gary I’Anson.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsChief Inspector Derek Frew \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe new chief inspector in South Ayrshire has vowed to put the community at the heart of policing.

This is when you learn your people skills. I was there for three and a half years - you involve yourself with the community - it was just amazing. “It was a highlight for personal reasons, for family reasons, for friends you make for le and for the grounding it gives you in getting to know people. “I came back to Ayr in  as an operational police officer then I left the Division and worked in national security for a while which was really interesting. “It got to  and I wanted to come back to operational policing so I ed to Ayr as an operational inspector. “For the third time in my career, I’m back.

Arnold Clark took the decision to shut the twin showrooms and workshops in the town’s Lochside. The big transporters moved in to clear the stock and the famous yellow signage was quickly taken down. The old premises in Galloway Avenue sold cars for generations and was probably best known as the home of Robert McCall Fiat and Alfa Romeo. But being stuck in the middle of housing, the old showroom has now outlived its time.. Arnold bought the dealership from Robert McCall and latterly operated a Fiat franchise. It also had the Jeep franchise for Ayr before it moved to Border Cars. The McCall family ran it for decades and built a reputation for fine service. Bob McCall began selling cars in  and had a series of franchises including Jaguar. His son Robert then took over the running of the business and was very successful selling Fiats and Alfas. Robert’s cousin Peter McCall was actually born in the house on the site that was converted into part of the garage. Customers in Galloway Avenue have been told all servicing work is going to the Ford workshop in Prestwick Road. Arnold Clark also runs separate Toyota, Vauxhall and Peugeot franchises in the town as well as a car and van hire centre. A long-time customer in Galloway Avenue said: “It is a real shame, but I guess dealerships want to be on busy roads in more modern buildings. Sadly Galloway Avenue would have needed a lot of investment and a member of staff said it simply was not in the right location any more. “Staff think the site could be flattened or put to another vehicle use.” Arnold Clark was unavailable for comment as we reached our deadline.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsMotoring NewsAlfa RomeoFiatJaguarJeepPeugeotFishingPrestwickGalloway"},{"url":null,"title":"gymnastics club tries takeover council","story":"NewsGymnastics club tries to takeover council activity centre in TroonMuirhead Activity Centre is the target of Dundonald Gymnastics ClubShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA plan by a gymnastics club to take over Muirhead Activity Centre has met hostility. Secret talks have been taking place since the summer but have only just surfaced. Dundonald Gymnastics Club is ready to take control and turn the popular sports hall into a specialist centre. It would mean no more sports lets of the main hall for football, badminton and handball, the squash court would shut and the property would be shted from South Ayrshire Council ownership. Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association fired the first warning shot over the takeover. Chairman Frances Carson said: “The answer is no. If the council have pulled a fly one over this then they will never hear the end of it from this community.” Scott Telford, head coach of the gymnastics club, promised this week he will speak to the community about his ambitious plans. But Tory councillor Peter Convery slammed the secrecy, saying: “This came out of the blue to all the councillors and community and is an utter disgrace. “People at a meeting on Friday night were flabbergasted the hall could be taken out of council ownership. “The acid on the cake is the council has been speaking to the group without anyone knowing. “The council should not be treating its citizens this way.” Scott Telford said he has a full business plan for the centre and believes it can work. The club has  members and a waiting list of  more. He said the club have restricted facilities at their present base Dundonald Activity Centre, where five adults spend hours setting out and dismantling equipment. As a result they cannot develop youngsters to elite performance level and lose talented performers at an early age. Former top gymnast Scott, who lives in Muirhead, said: “The community will still get use of the centre for things like meetings and birthday parties and we would look to develop that. “There will also be the chance for the community to take part in gymnastics. “I appreciate people don’t like change but we can make this work. We could even look at parkour gymnastic sessions with teenagers on Friday night. “There is also a lot of outdoor space which we could change for other activities, depending on what the community want.” The dad first started helping at Dundonald when there were only  kids and ten mats. He added: “At the moment we get about  inquiries a week and just cannot cope. “I want to work with the Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association and want to hear all views. “We will be running a seven-day-a-week facility but it has to be financially sustainable and work with the community.” Councillor Craig Mackay said he wants full transparency when consultation starts. He said: “The onus will be on the gymnastics club to demonstrate the wider support of the community. “I am relaxed about the process and will very much wish to take on board the community’s views on this once we know the details of what is proposed. “I am concerned about how any potential transfer would impact on the use of the centre by the wide range of groups who currently use it. “The centre currently runs at a small but manageable loss and in my view any decision must be made on what is best for the community and not on the very minimal cost savings.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsGymnasticsSouth Ayrshire CouncilBadmintonTroonDundonald"},{"url":null,"title":"shops replace homes new ayr","story":"NewsShops to replace homes in new Ayr town centre regeneration plansPeople to have their say on radical proposalsShareBySarah Hilley:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailShops are to be replaced with homes in Ayr town centreradical new plans get the go-ahead. Proposals also include the High Street being coated with a new easy clean surface and bins being kept out of site. A great shop clearance has been proposed to regenerate the ailing shopping strip. South Ayrshire Council wants empty retail units to become homes at the bottom of the town. Council leader Douglas Campbell said: “Internet shopping has signicantly altered the landscape in the town. “We need people back staying in the towns.” SNP Councillor Campbell took to his feet at week’s full council meeting to talk through the complete overhaul of the town centre. Conservative Councillor Ian Davis askedshop owners would be consultedthey are forced to move. He said: “This could mean some businesses will have to move. I want reassurances for businesses thatan area is to be reused for a dferent purpose that they are well consulted.” The meeting heard businesses would be consulted. The cleared Riverside block, which included Woolworths, would become a public square. The original proposal for a huge office block has been shelved. Commenting on the cleared site, Councillor Campbell said: “None of us expected the vista.” But he conceded how homes of some description could be erected on the site. He said: “Some sort of building on the site will be necessary.” A report submitted to council said: “There will also be the potential for a small number of residential units on the Riverside sitethis proves desirable through the public consultation exercise.” Council staff from soon-to-be demolished Burns House are likely to move into the Clydesdale Bank Building, the Town Hall and County Buildings instead. The Citadel is to be replaced with a brand new state-of-the art leisure centre on the High Street. A new streetscape surface could also be on the way. Councillor Campbell said: “If we are going to revamp the High Street we need to do it in a signicant way to keep it tidy. “During the main shopping times all the bins should be off the street. We need to present the High Street well. “We need to move the bus stops away from the Clydesdale Bank building.” Conservative opposition councillor Hugh Hunter got to his feet to “welcome” the report. He said: “It would be spectacular for the administrationthey could pull it off.” He called for a park like Belleisle to be built at the Riverside. SNP councillor Siobhian Brown said she welcomed the report but said morale of the community was “on its knees.” All plans will be issued for public consultation.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnClydesdale BankScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"slow progress new troon mega","story":"NewsSlow progress for new Troon mega surgeryBut work on Templehill expansion should start next yearShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailNational Health top brass have been summoned to Troon to explain what is happening to expansion plans at the town’s mega surgery. Members of the public spoke at last week’s Troon Community Council –asking why there has been no obvious progress at the Templehill Surgery in nearly six month. The surgery swallowed most of the collapsed  Medical Practice, re-opening with , patients at the end of April. The Community Council has asked an NHS representative to attend their meeting next month. When Templehill took over they were to be handed around pound, by NHS Ayrshire  Arran for an extension. And partner Robbie Cumming said then it was still to be agreed wether to use a ready-made modular building or a traditional build at the back. At the time he said: “We intend to expand and develop our current premises with the addition of two or three consulting rooms, disabled access doors and a larger reception area.” A planning application has been lodged but it has not even been “validated” yet by South Ayrshire Council. Councillor Craig Mckay has quizzed Pamela Milliken, head of primary care, on the extension which had been a central plank of the transfer. Councillor Mckay said: “I welcome the Health Board’s comments which suggest that there have been no major issues following the transfers. “This is consistent with my own experience as I’ve received no recent complaints from patients. “It is also reassuring that both recipient practices have been reviewing patient records and inviting patients to attend for review appointments. “I hope this will ensure that those who were moved will continue to receive the level of care they deserve. “On the extension to the Templehill surgery, the planning application has recently been submitted but not yet validated. ““Clearly it is in the interests of all patients of that practice that the required expansion takes place, and I note that subject to there being no planning issues, work is expected to begin on site in the new year. “The extension was central to the arguments made when  Medical Practice closed, and the ball is now firmly in the Surgery’s court to deliver on this commitment.” Councillor Bob Pollock agreed the actual transition process seemed to have gone well and said: “None of the Troon Councillors have received any complaints following the merger of the surgeries, butthere are any, they should get in touch.” Ms Milliken said: “Planning permission for the work was submitted to South Ayrshire Council on Friday September . The practice is optimistic that works will commence in early Januaryplanning permission is granted.” In other NHS news, it is understood community midwives have had to change their base from the Barassie Street clinic to Prestwick. One source said: “All that is left at Barassie Street seems to be podiatry. “The community nurses have to start their sht in Prestwick before coming to Troon for their first appointment.”Like us on

in both the concrete sections and steel reinforcements beneath the surface was much greater than initially anticipated.Amey announced that full night-time closures would be required to finish the deck repairs, waterproofing and resurfacing by the scheduled October .But with just over a week until the planned completion date they have extended the timescales through to November.And bosses have also announced that engineers willto complete the extensive repairs in February.Ameys bridges manager Stuart Wallace said: ldquoThese refurbishment works were originally intended to prevent the further deterioration of the bridge structure by repairing defects at an early stage.\"This work has subsequently uncovered several previously hidden defects that far exceeded expectations and this is the reason for the increase to the construction programme.Since the introduction of a one-way system for west-bound traffic across the bridge with east-bound vehicles having to use the winding B near Abbotsford, there have been many reports of drivers ignoring temporary road signs.And many other drivers are using Melrose Road and Lowood Bridge, which causes tailbacks at rush hour.Rather than continue with repairs to Galafoot over the festive period and into the new year, Amey has opted to finish on November  andthree months later.Mr Wallace added: ldquoThe local community has shown incredible patience and understanding with the repair programme to date.\"Having listened to their concerns, we consider it prudent to avoid further disruption over the busy holiday season.\"This strategy will also mitigate against the possible impact that winter weather might have on this workldquoOnce again, we want to thank road users, businesses and residents for their goodwill, and we will continue to consult with local stakeholders and provide updates on this scheme .Exact dates for the  works will be announced in the coming weeks."},{"url":null,"title":"the-best-of-buble-in-galashiels","story":"THE magic of Michael Bubleacute is coming to Galashiels.This weekend the Volunteer Hall will play host to Mark Daniels as

Literature Festival, in which he was interviewed by his daughter Scarlett, who revealed her mother, Emma Freud, has never watched an episode of Blackadder.Curtis explained how he and Atkinson, who himself has gone on to have global success with Mr Bean and Johnny English, dreamt up Blackadder.ldquoBlackadder was in a funny way written out of fear, Curtis said.ldquoSomeone called John Cleese had written a show called Fawlty Towers and when Rowan and I tried to write a modern situation comedy we just knew it was rubbish in comparison to that.ldquoSo we decided to write about history and it really came from two sources, one of which was a series of books called the Ladybird Book of History and the other was the plays of Shakespeare because they were also stupid and people also wore stupid costumes.Curtis added: ldquoI am sorry about the bad episodes they were all written by a guy called Ben Elton.He also gave some tips about his techniques for writing, saying that many wannabe writers give up too early.ldquoThe dference between me and a writer who doesnrsquot go on writing is that I write % good a day and I think that has been a fantastic day and many people give up writing because they write for a day and they have got % of rubbish, he said.ldquoI did once work out I had written , pages to reach Notting Hill which was a -page script.ldquoI think keeping faith and

team and heard directly about their concerns.I have also contacted Argyll and Bute Council#s planning department numerous times, and, on September , I spoke with James Macintyre of Macleod Construction and made my views very clear on this matter.The potential new G pitch and footpath are much needed and more than welcome.That said there have clearly been large failings in the consultation process and this must not happen in future.In order to find the best way forward MacLeods will need to move rugby posts to new positions, using new sleeves and with an Islay Rugby presence during the operation.Leveling off of the west side of the pitch must be carried out using good soil with a view to extending the level pitch by several meters.Material for a ryelock fence should be provided by MacLeods and or others, and permissions given for construction of a standard fence.This fence should run between the timber fence at the rear of the housing estate and the timber fence at the car park, in a line running along the pitch side edge of the new path across the rugby pitch.This should make the extended area as near dog-free as possible and solve the serious fouling problem which unfortunately continues to exist.Regardless of how many of my fellow Ileachs feel, about where this pathway has been built and the lack of proper communication, the hard working front line workers, of Macleods are only following orders and any hostility directed towards them is unhelpful and unfair.If these changes and additions to the building works are made all parties will be happy and Islay will have a terric rugby pitch.Bowmore locals will have a new foot path and Islay can hopefully look forward to the prospect of a wonderful new G pitch in the future.Despite the upset

This is hard for me as I am disabled and struggle to take it in and out when I use the shower.At my former address the replacement bags were thrown into the garden at collection time. This was fine as the garden was fenced in and evenit was windy the bags would blow about the garden but not blow away.Where I currently live the front door is right on the pavement which is only about  inches wide.You would think it would be easy just to put the bags through the letterbox, but no, despite asking and even pleading with workers, to put them through the letterbox, they continuously throw them on the ground and I do not get the bags as they blow away.The last time my recycling was collected two weeks ago I was watching for the workers coming so I could get the bags handed to me.It was early and as the bags were outside I took a shower. Unfortunately, as I exited the shower, the van approached.I rushed as much as I am able but by the time I reached the door they had gone and left just one fresh bag.I had put out three full of recycling. I shouted to the man who was a vit further down the street but he did not appear to hear.In one of the first storms of the autumn, wearing just a T shirt, trousers and slippers with wet hair I followed them down the street, shouting at him to wait.Eventually half-way along the street he stopped and turned.I was dumbfounded when he said: #I heard you the first time you shouted. If you had said excuse me, I would have stopped, but I do not stop when someone shouts.#I was totally exhausted in the high wind and rain and felt asI was going to collapse. I came back in and just sat and cried.I have had enough, even to get them to leave the number of replacement bags is a struggle but it is a lot worse having to chase them down the street.This ignorant man should be doing behind the scenes work and not mixing with the public.I will not be recycling any more the struggle is just too much.Name and address supplied."},{"url":null,"title":"mach dunes golfing greats honoured","story":"General manager Andy Hogan welcomed a large number of golfers gathered for the occasion, last Saturday night, before introducing green-keeper Simon Freeman who made the presentations.Mr Freeman said: #I would like to thank David Southworth, for continuing to fund this enterprise for all of our benefits and Greg Sherwood for taking such an active lead in ensuring that standards of service are constantly being raised.#It has not been an easy year to be a green-keeper for a number of reasons and it definitely helps us to remain motivated when we know everyone is on our side.#I would like to thank each of you, and all the other members and regular players for their support and encouragement in .#This is the end of the season for us but the winter series will be a stableford and winter medals will be played as well.#The Shepherd#s Cross Trophy is to be re-named the David Irwin Memorial Trophy and will be played next weekend.#Andy Hogan added: #I would also like to think Lorna and Peter at the clubhouse, the drivers who take everybody out from Campbeltown, they do such a good job and also all the people who are working behind the scenes tonight.#Awards were as follows: Medal winners: November : Iain Logan, : January: Crawford Kilpatrick, February: Robert Paterson, March: Crawford Kilpatrick, April: Iain Logan, May: Stewart Litster, June: Andrew Wallace, July: Keith Blair, August and September: Craig Ramsay.

The Master Plan talks about , jobs being created.

It was a lovely calm and sunny day, perfect for filming,I was halfway through the story when a group of local teenage lads approached. It seemed they were drinking and I anticipated them disrupting the filming.But I continued telling the story as it had been a perfect take up until that moment.The lads paused for a moment then all sat on the concrete walkway watching me and the film makers. They said nothing and seemed to be listening.I was able to complete my story uninterrupted.And as I walked away in the final shot I made eye contact with the lads and they respectfully waited until the filming had stopped before shouting, ldquoJohnny Moat forever! Then they got up and walked away.It was an unexpected and powerful moment for me.My assumptions about the lads had been utterly challenged as well.This was more than six years ago but I was reminded of it when I visited Johnny Moat this week with my wee boy Lewis.We were having our weekly storytelling walk in the Pans, a three-hour period between his nursery pick up and when I have to pick up his sister Skye from the Infant School.We just walk together visiting dferent places, and I tell him stories and he does the same.Most of his stories this day involved a T Rex or Raptor, which in his imagination wander about Prestonpans.So our respective tales were a bit dferent in content and style, but what is vital at this age is that he hears stories and is allowed to tell them freely.I told him the story of Johnny Moat and he said it looks like a whale.As we wandered from Johnny Moat up to Preston Tower, we stopped at what we call the lsquoStory Stonesrsquo.Here a small circle of stones sit underneath a cherry tree, with the tower looming behind. It is a perfect place to tell stories.Lewis gave me a new version of his T Rex tale here. I couldnrsquot understand all his story, but I got most of it.Then he said it was my turn so I told him a child-friendly version of the tale of the Green Lady. It made him want to go and look in the windows of the tower, which we did.The final story began at the old doorsquocot in the gardens by the tower. I explained it was a house for pigeons, but Lewis was having none of that.ldquoNo daddy, he said with a serious face, ldquoa lion lives there.ldquoReally  Can you tell me the story of the lion  I asked. And so he obliged.It was a great story, and we tracked the lion to the ancient Mercat Cross, where the unicorn sits on top of the pole ldquolooking for the lion.Then he spotted the lion on the  bus coming from Tranent.ldquoWill it eat the people  I asked.ldquoNo, he said asIrsquod asked an inappropriate question, ldquoitrsquos a nice lion.And so with the lion having left town, we headed for the Infant School to pick up his sister, but still keeping a look out for the T Rex.On the surface this may all seem a bit unusual, wandering about telling random stories that often didnrsquot make huge sense.But I value this time with my son, and as a storyteller I know the importance of it.Storytelling in this way when our kids are young helps develop what is called oral narrative ability, which gives a child the skills to explain and describe things, and develop their understanding of words and language.It fires their imagination and research shows that this can help with the enjoyment of reading and writing later on, and of telling and hearing stories.That night my son unexpectedly ed to the story of Johnny Moat.I had earlier told him it had fallen down and is lying face down in the sand and itrsquos too heavy to put back, but hopefully one day there will be a way.Like all kids his age, he took a while to process his thoughts on this. And these thoughts came out at bedtime.ldquoThe T Rex can put the big stone back, he said. I admired his total faith in the abilities of the T Rex.ldquoYes, maybe, I said. He fell asleep holding his T Rex which, for him, symbolises so much more than just an extinct dinosaur.As I headed downstairs, I thought about the connection between this day and the day over six years ago when I unexpectedly told the story of Johnny Moat to some teenage lads.Stories weave through us and bind us in a shared identity. But it made me sad that Johnny Moat still lies forgotten with his face in the sand.So Irsquom going to start looking for the T Rex of the Pans, whoever that may be, who can help. He or she must be out there somewhere. Or perhaps there is a crowd of them.The hope is that once my son is a teenage lad himself, he will be able to sit on the Girdle Rocks with Johnny Moat and tell the legend."},{"url":null,"title":"group-objects-to-750-new-homes-at-windygoul-south","story":"A planning application for the site was submitted last month by Walker Group Ltd.The site plan extends Windygoul South to the Charles River Research Institute and Carlaverock Farm.But at a TECC meeting, members voiced their concerns over the proposals.Robert McNeill, community councillor, told the meeting: ldquoIn all my years on the community council, I canrsquot recall us making a formal objection about any developments in Tranent.ldquoWe try to be very proactive to any problems and find a solution.

He too wants to give the ECJ the bums rush. He regards the court as an instrument of ldquocolonial domination, imposing an alien legal code on Britain. The main reason he wants to ldquochuck Chequers is because Theresa Mays latest Brexit plan leaves the European Court of Justice as the ultimate authority on trade disputes. Actually, on this at least, the bouffant Brexiteer is correct.Its more complicated, of course, everything to do with Brexit is. The latest backstop proposal for resolving the Irish border problem seems to involve Britain remaining in the Customs Union for an indefinite period and for Northern Ireland to remain in regulatory alignment with the European Single Market. Brussels insiders, like the Labour MEP, David Martin, of the parliaments International Trade Committee, believe a deal along these lines has already been done behind the scenes. It remains only for the Brussels negotiator, Michel Barnier, to announce it, in great fanfare, this week.Butmy soundings in Brussels are correct, there is almost zero chance of it being agreed ndash at least by the Brexiteers. This is because,Britain remains even partially in the single market and the Customs Union under the so called ldquohybrid backstop, that leaves the UK still subject to the European Court of Justice. And these people dont mess about.The top legal adviser to the European Court, Advocate-General Eleanor Sharpston is about as tough as they get - shes a karate black-belt for a start. She made it clear that theres no bucking the ECJ. ldquoThis court decides what the single market rules are, and that isnt going to change. Theresa May can try to claim that Britain is not under the ldquodirect jurisdiction of the ECJ ndash perhaps by having the UK Supreme Court act as intermediary ndash but the inescapable legal reality is that it is. The ultimate arbiter for disputes about the European Single Market and the Customs Union is the Luxembourg bench.Boris Johnson understands this. He says that, under this weekrsquos proposed deal: ldquoWe cannot escape the EU laws and ECJ until they allow us to ndash which they may never do. He goes on to say that this makes Britain a ldquocolony which is of course ridiculous. There is a world of dference between a court that deals with disputes over trade and related matters, and the supreme legal authority of a nation state.Whenever countries join a rules-based international trading system they agree to share sovereignty. The World Trade Organisation , the hard Brexiteers hard backstop, also has an arbitration procedure. The European Free Trade Association, has a court. Thai doesnt mean that members of EFTA or the WTO cease to be independent countries. Perhaps the greatest mistake made by Theresa May in these entire negotiations has been to go along with the fiction that Brexit means ldquotaking back our laws. We never lost them.Even the UK governments own White Paper on Brexit made this clear in February  when it said that the UK parliament ldquoremained sovereign throughout our membership of the EU. It went on to say that ldquoit didnt always feel like that, but the constitutional situation has never been in doubt. We never lost control of our laws, except in very narrowly defined areas. The demonising of the European Court of Justice has been a disastrous error of rhetoric, which has led many people to believe the canard that ndash as the Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt put it at the Tory Conference in Birminghamndash the EU is a ldquoprison like the old ldquoSoviet Union from which Britain is ldquoescaping.This equation of the EU with the USSR, which has become commonplace among Tory eurosceptics, has caused genuine outrage across the European Union ndash especially in central European countries which actually experienced soviet domination. Try suggesting to someone from a Baltic state, like Lithuania, that the EU is prison. Theyll tell you, forcefully, that it was the European Union that helped them escape from communist domination. First by giving them a model of freedom, prosperity and human rights, and second by allowing them to become members of a union founded on the autonomy of independent nations.There was a palpable change of mood in Brussels last week following the rhetoric of that Tory conference. Britains friends in the Brussels have mostly given up trying to defend UK ministers. Officials, politicians, and Brussels commissioners just want an end to this whole demeaning Brexit process ndash and they dont much care how. Theyve other, more important things on their minds, like populism, Italy, Putin, Trump.And I have to say, therersquos very little support in Brussels for Nicola Sturgeons call to delay the implementation of Article  next March. That would need the agreement of all  remaining states and officials now believe that is most unlikely. This is partly because EU governments just refuse to prolong the agony. This weeks deal looks final.And it poses very serious problems for Scotland. If Northern Ireland remains in the single market, this will be a huge attraction for firms wishing to gain the benefits of working within the EU without leaving the UK. It gives the North a massive competitive advantage over Scotland. Nicola Sturgeon is right to demand parity. But theres no way she is going to get it. Senior Brussels commissioners dismiss out of hand the idea of Scotland getting a similar deal. They wont even talk about it ndash Ive tried.There is some sympathy in the European Parliament for Scotlandrsquos plight: being forced out of the EU against its will. According to David Martin, theres now a real willingness to help Scotland rejoin the EU,it were to become independent. But that is very much for the future. The EU only deals with member states, in this case the UK, and right now they just want rid the lot of us.My problem is that I cant see how the UK parliament can endorse this weeks hybrid backstop. It may well be that a technical solution to the issue of Irish border checks is not far off. There are already health and environmental checks on agricultural goods and food coming from Northern Ireland to Britain. This could be the basis for a future ldquofrictionless border between Northern Ireland, which remains partially in the single market, and the UK which remains largely out of it.But the DUP are having none of it. Britain remaining for an indefinite period in the Customs Union is a non-starter for Tory Brexiteers. The SNP must oppose NI exceptionalism and Chequers doesnt meet Labourrsquos ldquosix tests. Britainrsquos been asking for the impossible. If you remain even partially in regulatory alignment you must accept ECJ rulings. As with Paolozzis statue, thats the bottom line."},{"url":null,"title":"watchdog-criticises-snp-government-over-proposed-freedom-of-information-reforms","story":"Ministers agreed to make changes after the watchdog issued a critical report into the way the Government dealt with FOI in relation to groups including journalists.Daren Fitzhenry, the SIC, has now expressed concern about an apparent lack of ldquoclarity in the continuing role of special advisers and ministers in the process.Scotlandrsquos FOI law, which came into force in , gives citizens a right to information held by public bodies, unless it is covered by an exemption.However, journalists from across the media last year signed an open letter complaining about the way the SNP Government handled their requests.They complained of delaying tactics and requests being blocked or refused for tenuous reasons.The reporters also claimed that their questions were being routinely handled by special advisers, who are political appointees, and screened for potential political damage.Fitzhenry launched a review into the claims and he found that Government policy reinforced concerns of a two tier system for journalists, MSPs and political researchers.He concluded there had been ldquounjustiable, signicant delays and disregard for the statutory timescales and noted the Government took longer to respond to journalistsrsquo requests than others.Fitzhenryrsquos report also stated that the Government policies and procedures were not ldquoclear enough about the role of special advisers in responding to FOI requests.Oppositions politicians claimed that the role of special advisers amounted to interference in the FOI system.However, the Governmentrsquos ldquodraft action plan makes clear that special advisers ndash otherwise known as spads ndash will stay have a role at the end of the process.ldquoCases identied as sensitive or exceptionally complex will, after clearance, be referred to SPADs and ministers for comment, the draft states.In his response to Government, Fitzhenry said he was ldquocontent with the ldquomajority of the proposed actions, but noted: ldquoI note that, for example, cases identied as sensitive or exceptionally complex will be referred to special advisers and Ministers for comment after clearance. I am concerned that this will not provide the desired clarity or transparency.ldquoAs my report provided, the role of ministers and special advisers must be made clear to all in the process, including requesters.Neil Findlay, Scottish Labourrsquos parliamentary business manager, said:ldquoThe SNP governmentrsquos response to the damning report earlier this year into their misuse of Freedom of Information laws is nothing more than a sham.ldquoInstead of stopping politicians and taxpayer funded spin doctors interfering in journalists requests they have institutionalised it.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoAs is well known, the Scottish Government co-operated fully with the Scottish Information Commissionerrsquos recent comprehensive independent review of our Freedom of Information practice and performance.ldquoFoI legislation allows for special advisers and ministers to be involved in the process and that the Commissioner found no misuse of FoI law by the Scottish Government.ldquoIt is important to note that at no point in any of the seven key recommendations in the Commissionerrsquos report does he suggest that special advisers should not continue to provide advice to ministers and colleagues, as is their proper ."},{"url":null,"title":"the-anatomy-of-a-horror-film-the-perfect-recipe-for-a-great-fright-flick","story":"I WATCHED my first horror movie when I was four years old. I crept downstairs one night in the early s and opened the door to the living room without my mum and dad knowing. A film was on TV ndash this was during the glory days of the BBCrsquos late night weekend Horror Double Bill.It was The Masque of the Red Death ndash which I now declare to be the greatest horror film ever made. It was wild, terrying, demented. A man in a gorilla suit was burned alive by a dwarf, Death walked the Earth, nobles partied within the walls of a castle as the plague raged outside. It blew my tiny mind and scared me witless, but I kept silent, hidden behind the sofa, as I knew it was taboo andmy parents realised I was there, theyrsquod send me to bed.On screen was an actor I would come to love ndash Vincent Price as the evil Prince Prospero. My parents only discovered I was there when the National Anthem started playing, and they turned on the lights and found me, goggle-eyed like some creepy imp in flannel pyjamas.Irsquove spent the rest of my le watching horror films ndash so as the witching season approaches, and the latest Halloween movie gets ready to open in cinemas, I thought Irsquod give you a guide to the secrets of the genre ndash and tell you what really makes a fright flick tick.THE WOODSIt doesnrsquot have to be the woods ndash though it often is ndash but location is as important to a horror movie as it is to Kirsty Allsopp and Phil Spencer. Think of Jonathan Harkerrsquos journey to Transylvania ndash a scene which opens countless Dracula films. The mountains, the inn, the forest, the wolves, the fog, the night ... the castle. A Dracula movie would be as naked without its classic location as the count without his cape.A great location doesnrsquot have to be some gothic throwback either. Look at An America Werewolf in London ndash it fetishises both the English countryside and the grungy grimy London of the early s ndash or the spaceship in Alien, which becomes a white, pared-back, claustrophobic hunting ground.The ballsiest horrors find the most unlikely location and just go for it ndash all great horror films take enormous risks with everything from script to casting and lightning to sound ndash so how about: a creepy ballet school for girls, soaked in vivid technicolour, in Dario Argentorsquos Suspiria a ski lt in Frozeninside a grave in Buried a railway carriage in Train to Busana punk rock venue in The Green Room, or a locked house in Donrsquot Breathe.None of these films would workthe director had chosen another setting ndash the setting is as important as the characters, the killings, and the creeps that the films wring from you.THE JUMPSHave you ever caught the Luton Bus  Or rather the Lewton Bus  If yoursquove watched the s movie Cat People by Val Lewton then yoursquoll know what I mean.In one scene we see our heroine being hunted by a killer we expect to turn into a panther at any moment. The tension builds and just when wersquore sure itrsquos all going to end in blood and fur, a bus screeches by making viewers leap from their seats. Therersquos no murder, no mayhem ndash but it is famously the scariest part of the film. If you donrsquot jump at least once in a horror movie, whatrsquos the point, most fans would say  We come to be scared.Bad directors use music to make you jump ndash a screeching violin is not a scare ndash or cliche, like Jason Voorhees ndash the killer in the Friday the th franchise ndash leaping up from the dead just when we think wersquore safe. Great film-makers like Lewton use your mind to make you jump, nothing .What a good jump scare depends on is sudden unexpected movement ndash tapping into that fear we have of something unexplained glimpsed from the corner of your eye. Look at the \"Sloth\" scene in Seen: the camera lingers over a shrivelled body which police have found tied to a bed. Suddenly, the \"corpse\" moves, struggling in its bonds. The entire set-up is overturned ndash a body we thought was dead, isnrsquot.The switch itself implies something ghastly: whatever is on the bed has been suffering for months in agony. In one split-second, David Fincher physically and emotional terrorises us.Perhaps, the greatest jump scare is in the much underrated The Exorcist III where a satanic killer is on the loose. One two-minute scene features a static long shot of a hospital hall. A nurse is making her rounds at night ndash her red cardigan the only colour on screen.Nothing  happens ndash but we know something has to happen, this is a horror movie. Just as the audience is lulled into a sense of calm, a shroud-draped man with a giant pair of medical shears ndash the kind used for amputations ndash charges at the nurse from behind.I remember audibly screaming in the cinema in  at this scene ... I loved it.THE MONSTERThere are three main types of baddie in horror films: the Monster, the Psycho, and the Thing. Letrsquos start with the monster.First of all, the Monster isnrsquot human and thatrsquos whatrsquos frightening. Whether itrsquos the shark in Jaws, whatever the hell is in the woods in The Blair Witch Project, the house in The Haunting of Hill House, giant ants in the s creature feature Them!, the xenomorph in Alien, or the demons from The Mist ndash these monsters are relentless. They will not stop ndash and we cannot fathom what drives them, beyond a desire to kill, yet they also possess a preternatural human-like intelligence.Monsters create unanswered questions ndash and ignorance means fear: Why is this shark out for revenge  What is running wild in the woods  Why wonrsquot the house stop shaking  Why are those ants the size of a Ford Focus  Why is that alien hugging my face  What are demons doing in a suburban supermarket The Monster works on the fear of the unknown, or the ugly ndash fear of the non-human. The Monster plays on those deep-seated fears we experience as children ndash the creature under the bed at night, or something beneath your feet when yoursquore swimming.THE PSYCHOThe Psycho, however, works on the opposite emotion ndash the fear of fellow humans, that behind our smiles and civilised cappuccinos lie salivating lunatics eager to kill.What better place to start with the Psycho, then, than with Hitchcockrsquos Norman Bates. The original Psycho was based on a real murderer ndash a necrophile, mother-killing, grave-robbing Wisconsin weirdo called Ed Gein .The roots of the Psycho always lie in reality ndash thatrsquos the fear factor. Could we one day meet such killers in real le  Might we already know a Hannibal Lecter, the urbane cannibal psychiatrist with a nose for good perfume and an eye for cheap shoes a Patrick Bateman, the boardroom American Psycho a Jack Torrance from The Shining ndash the intellectual family man about to snap and kill.THE THINGWhen it comes to the Thing, itrsquos all about the Uncanny Valley ndash the psychological theory that when something resembles a human being closely, but just not quite enough, it elicits a horrible feeling of dread.Think of Nosferatursquos spindly long-fingered decaying fiend, the creature in the attic in Rec, Frankensteinrsquos creation bolted together from scraps of corpses, any zombie, the demonic Cenobites from Hellraiser, the baby in Eraserhead, possessed Regan in The Exorcist, even Hal from : A Space Odyssey.These creatures almost look like us, or in Halrsquos case sound like us, but we know they are not us ndash and so they scare the daylights out of us.THE SALLYIt was once standard operating procedure in horror films that there would always be a survivor ndash usually a woman, known in the industry by the slightly sexist term \"The Last Girl\".I prefer to call this survivor character \"The Sally\" in homage to the female lead in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Sally Hardesty, played by s scream queen Marilyn Burns. Texas is loved and hated in equal measure. Horror fans hail it as the darkest and cleverest of the ultra-violent classic slasher films.PhDs have been written on Texas. Itrsquos even been interpreted as a comment on Watergate ndash the deranged hill billy cannibal serial killers do live in a big \"white house\" after all. People who donrsquot watch horror films, though, detest Texas as little more that snuff-inspired torture porn.Director Tobe Hooper put his Sally character through hell at the hands of Leatherface, grandpa and the rest of the slavering clan. When I first watched Texas during the s video nasty era, I felt physically broken afterwards ndash the violence, the terror, the bestial nature of what was happening on screen literally overwhelmed me.But Sally survived ndash and because Sally survived, good won the day. Horror films often rely on such simply fairy tale tricks ndash make me feel scared but then offer hope that what scared me will be defeated and the result is Pavlovian, punters come back for more.Sally led to Laurie Strode, the lead character in the original  Halloween. Now Laurie is dferent to Sally. Sally does a lot of running and screaming and crying ndash Laurie does a lot of running and hiding and trying to breath quietly in cupboards, but then something very important happens: Laurie turns on the killer, the villain Michael Myers.In fact, at one point, we think shersquos killed Myers, clad in his creepy William Shatner face mask . But, in a tradition that Halloween basically forged, the bogeyman lives to kill another day. Nevertheless, he was still vanquished, for the time being at least, by the female protagonist who remains standing.Sometimes, though, The Sally doesnrsquot survive ndash a development seen increasingly in films with a strong artistic bent. In the nihilistic masterpiece Funny Games, Michael Hanekersquos Pinteresque descent into hell, the end is one of deliberate despair ndash no-one will live, and the killers are coming for you next.THE SEXESUnsurprisingly, given that horror exploits our real fears, most villains are men. Horror movies draw very heavily on a primordial battle of the sexes theme: the brutal killer, often a mere personication of evil, versus the sparky, clever woman pushed to the limits of endurance.However, not all horror films conform to the genre. Some switch, and the female villain is far from unknown ndash but when you analyse why the woman is a killer, itrsquos for very dferent reasons to the men.Women donrsquot pick up chainsaws and go on mindless murder sprees ndash women killers tend to act out psychologically, and that can can often create the greatest of screen villains. For proof, enter Annie Wilkes from Misery, an obsessive fan with a fine line in moral rectitudeand a taste for torture.In recent decades, more women began to pop up who should have been put in a straitjacket from birth. Therersquos Lola Stone in The Loved Ones ndash a girl you donrsquot want to invite to a house party Tina, a murderous National Trust nerd, in Ben Wheatleyrsquos black comedy of modern manners Sightseers and Marie, the worst best friend a girl ever asked for in the French new wave horror Switchblade Romance.Carrie is probably the most nuanced female character in any horror film ndash she is both villain and victim. Abused by a religious maniac mother, bullied and sexually humiliated by her classmates, Sissy Spacek as Carrie becomes the revenge prototype of teen female anger.Increasingly, wersquore beginning to see men enter the role of the victim. Take the Belgian movie The Ordeal. Instead of a woman held captive by a male predator, it is a man who is imprisoned and tormented: a good way to bring home to the audience that often the gaze in horror films is on female suffering.THE MEANINGA great horror film has to say something ndash an awful horror film just drips blood all over the cinema seat and leaves you as unsatisfied as a ten pound box of popcorn. By \"saying something\", I donrsquot mean art house pretension ndash I mean that a horror movie must resonate with its times.Horror is the most mutable of genres, apart from comedy. People have fallen in love for the same reasons since time immemorial, people have sought revenge for the same reasons since time immemorial, but jokes change from one day to the next. Horror also changes, not because what scares us changesbut because for horror to work it must relate to you and the fears of the time in which you live.Yoursquoll not be scared by Little Red Riding Hood, but centuries ago it terried your ancestors. Whats needed to scare modern viewers is something that echoes in our real lives ndash think of all those s B movies rfing off the unseen menace of reds under the bed like Invasion of the Body Snatchers or Cronenbergrsquos body-horror movies, like The Fly, driven by the fear of technology there was even a spate of post-s hippie horrors in the wake of the Manson family killings like Last House on the Left.Probably the two best examples of horror movies tapping into modern fears come in the shape of Eden Lake, and Ils . Eden Lake uses fear of the dispossessed to get its hooks into viewers. It makes the viewer wonderthe poor, the uneducated, the forgotten will one day rise up and kill them.This is the horror of the housing estate. It is a brutal take on what happens when the suburban middle classes rub up against the \"underclass\".Ils ndash Them ndash is similar in tone but here it is children who are the terror. It prods at the hidden adult fear that children could quite easily killthey wished. Wersquove seen terrible crimes committed by bored, abused, forgotten children unfold in our papers and on the TV news ndash this film seems to say,you beat a dog long enough it will bite you back, no matter how weak it is.Irsquom not trying to convince anyone that horror is art ndash though as a fan of horror movies, I do think the genre is capable of high art when at its very best.In a strange way, what horror can do is make you feel alive because it makes you confront death. Thatrsquos probably what I realised in my four-year-old mind back in the early s when Vincent Price scared the pants off me in The Masque of the Red Death.As the old toast goes from The Bride of Frankenstein: \"To a new world of Gods and Monsters!\""},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-mops-up-after-storm-callum","story":"Scotland is mopping up after Storm Callum, which brought heavy rain and flooding to swathes of the country.A Met Office yellow \"be aware\" alert for the south west of the country, the Lothians, Borders and Strathclyde areas was lted at midnight.

They do say it takes a thief to catch a thief.Itrsquos actually doubly ironic that it is shiny new ldquoquantum computers that are being used to ldquorecreate the origin of Darwinian evolution.This is because events in quantum physics have a truly inexplicable and weird way of being influenced by observation ndash like a tree in the woods only falling when someone can see it. Some scientists believe such oddness at the molecular level of reality may be an actual quirkinside our simulation.These Spanish researchers, however, are clearly aware of the potential irony of asking a computer to essentially explain and understand itself. ldquoWe leave open the question whether the origin of le is genuinely quantum mechanical, confirmed one of the scientists involved, rather cryptically.Perhaps itrsquos no coincidence New Yorker magazine recently reported two unnamed tech billionaires have employed a number of scientists to work out how to break them out of the simulation using quantum computers.QUANTUM OF SOLACESo whatrsquos so special about these quantum computers compared to that shiny new Macbook you only use for surfing the net and assimilating into societys higher social tiers  Well, the truth is even those who construct quantum computers dont really understand the dference. But they believe the chasm is seismic.Todayrsquos mass market machines compute using an internal binary language of s and s, while quantum machines also have a third potential state that lies, well hellip somewhere in between. Because of this, their computational units ndash known as quibits ndash have the special ability to become \"entangled\" with other quibits. After entering such a relationship, quibits will then instantly reflect any changes in its lsquotwinrsquo.Why does this weird lsquomirroring matter  Well, many particle physicists believe itrsquos an action that actually takes place outside of what we perceive as spacetime. This is because distance seems to be no barrier to quibitsrsquo instant communication. And now, were slowly learning how to harness this ability in order to create machines of almost infinite computing power. Simply, your Macs s and s are very slow and the timeless dimension in-between is not. Forget that thing Richard Pryor created in Superman , wersquore talking machines as powerful as the Transformersrsquo home planet of Cybertron.LOOKING FOR LUCAIT may be the case that quantum machines donrsquot discover a simulation at the root of reality, but actually confirm that Darwinian evolution all boils down to the mysterious ancient leform known as LUCA .What makes this great granny of all things especially fascinating is that it had the chance of eternal le ndash but decided to die so we could live. Just like Jesus four billion years later.Most evolutionary biologists are convinced that everything that has ever existed originates from LUCA, and a genetic portrait was recently created by evolutionary biologists at the Heinrich Heine University in Duumlsseldorf. Apparently this oddity existed in deep sea vents on the magma-drenched, celestial baby Earth and was unlike anything  that has ever existed ndash a spindling conglomeration of tiny cells that spent hundreds of millions of years simply chilling in the sea doing nothing. Blind, deaf yet perhaps not so dumb.Itrsquos notable that gender or death did not exist on Earth until LUCA unzipped itself to kick off evolution, shuffling around its genetics using some mysterious early form of osmosis.Why this organism died to unleash its essential ingredients and create all le on this planet remains a deep, abiding mystery. Or perhaps LUCA was simply an alien virus in our simulation, programmed to self-destruct and seed this virtual Earth with avatars. If so, the creators of this particular illusion are playing a very long game indeed.AND FINALLY hellipEXPANDING further upon Oxford philosopher Nick Bostromrsquos recent Simulation Theory paper, whatrsquos particularly striking is its casual assumption of many long-lived alien civilisations existing out there.If these beings run computer simulations ndash and they will, says Bostrom ndash then articial realities must be abundant throughout the universe. The problem is, these alien programmers would ndash like us ndash have no idea whether theyrsquore part of a simulation themselves. Every universe may simply be a Russian doll trapped within the darkness of another ndash an artical multiverse.Yet,we are indeed living in the root level of reality, perhaps our universal common ancestor LUCA was still a computer virus of sorts ndash one that sacriced its original form to set evolution in motion, hoping to gain a multi-dimentional perspective of reality through the eyes of everything that has ever lived and died on Earth.From the birds in the sky to fungus in the fields, LUCA is likely hiding in plain sight, with infinite perceptions of reality at its disposal to understand and conquer its planet completely.And when its greatest achievement ndash humans ndash finally blast off to the stars, the entire universe awaits."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-and-meghan-to-embark-on-first-royal-tour-as-couple","story":"The royal couple will visit Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand between October  and .Starting on Tuesday, Harry and Meghan will take part in  engagements over their -day trip to the Pacic region.The tour coincides with the Invictus Games in Sydney, which run from October -.The sporting event ndash founded by Prince Harry in  ndash gives sick and injured service personnel and veterans the opportunity to compete in sports such as wheelchair basketball and sitting volleyball.After landing in Sydney, the duke and duchess will travel to Dubbo and Melbourne, before spending three days in Sydney from October - to mark the launch of the games.

Baldrick was cult viewing in the s.Also featuring were Hugh Laurie, Tim McInnerny, Stephen Fry and the late Rik Mayall with Ben Elton co-writing many of the episodes.The four series were each set in a dferent period of English history, covering the Middle Ages, Elizabethan England, the Georgian era and the First World War.Over the years there have been many people who wanted to see another series made with Blackadder set in modern times.Only last month, Sir Tony said he thought a fth series could be made, despite the original cast having very busy schedules.And last year Atkinson spoke of how  years ago there was an idea for a series set during the Russian Revolution, called Redadder, but plans went ldquonowhere.But Curtis, who went on to write blockbuster films Four Weddings And A Funeral, Love Actually, Notting Hill and Bridget Jonesrsquos Diary, scotched chances of a Blackadder revival.ldquoBlackadder is a very, very complicated group of people and soyou are fond enough of the series to wish that the people involved in it should live to a ripe old age then I think it is best that we donrsquot work together, thatrsquos the answer, Curtis said.The screenwriter was speaking during an event at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, in which he was interviewed by his daughter Scarlett, who revealed her mother, Emma Freud, has never watched an episode of Blackadder.Curtis explained how he and Atkinson, who himself has gone on to have global success with Mr Bean and Johnny English, dreamt up Blackadder.ldquoBlackadder was in a funny way written out of fear, Curtis said.ldquoSomeone called John Cleese had written a show called Fawlty Towers and when Rowan and I tried to write a modern situation comedy we just knew it was rubbish in comparison to that.ldquoSo we decided to write about history and it really came from two sources, one of which was a series of books called the Ladybird Book of History and the other was the plays of Shakespeare because they were also stupid and people also wore stupid costumes.Curtis added: ldquoI am sorry about the bad episodes they were all written by a guy called Ben Elton.He also gave some tips about his techniques for writing, saying that many wannabe writers give up too early.ldquoThe dference between me and a writer who doesnrsquot go on writing is that I write % good a day and I think that has been a fantastic day and many people give up writing because they write for a day and they have got % of rubbish, he said.ldquoI did once work out I had written , pages to reach Notting Hill which was a -page script.ldquoI think keeping faith and noticing whatrsquos good and I think the edits of movies are unbelievably rigorous and necessary and a few of my films have been not what I dreamed but they were finished.ldquoThe most interesting was Bridget which didnrsquot work at all until we moved the penultimate scene, which was her in absolute despair in her bedroom dressed in red pyjamas drinking and crying, to the title sequence of the movie, which meant you actually felt for Bridget right from the start, which in our original cut you just didnrsquot.ldquoThere are miraculous things that can happen in the edit.ldquoLove Actually is a bad example because it didnrsquot work at all when we finished it and the one where the finished product was at least like the script I wrote and in fact we had to delay

However, that is not the approach adopted by Highland Council.Mrs Ross said: \"Having raised issues with the council regarding their approach to considering equalities and human rights in their budget process, particularly around the closure of public toilets, it was encouraging to hear that many councils around Scotland have placed such an approach at the heart of their budgeting. Unfortunately, Highland Council appears not to have.\"As a result, I have written to them to ask them to give further consideration to this approach, especially when the committee has heard how well this works in other areas.\"She added: \"While the Highland Council representative did note that there was engagement with the third sector, communities and citizen  for budgeting in the past, I am concerned that engagement, dialogue and meaningful consultation did not happen in the run-up to the budget process for this financial year.\"Im concerned that we are now close to the budget being presented to council and meaningful engagement has still not taken place.\"Highland Council plans to close  of its  public toilets to save pound, a year but opponents claim the move could lead to a visitor boycott.Campaigners delivered a ,-signature petition to Highland Council last month and claimed the proposal has already impacted the tourism sector. They say the closure of the toilets would have an environmental and economic impact. A coach tour firm cancelled a booking over concern for its customers needing comfort breaks.As previously reported, local businessman Andrew Mackay said the threat of toilet closures in Caithness could create \"a negative impression\" of the area and impact on the number of people visiting.Mr Mackay, who has hotels in Wick, Thurso and Castletown and is a board member of the tourism body Venture North, said: \"The perception that there is a shortage of toilets in Caithness ndash and where in the Highlands ndash could impact adversely on the area.\"Any negative publicity could have an effect on the industry. We have a short season and need to capitalise on all markets.\"Green MSP John Finnie recently accused the council of pressing ahead with the closure of toilets in the face of its own evidence that it could have an impact on public health. An equality impact assessment conducted into the proposals identied issues for older people, those with disabilities and pregnant women.Mr Finnie said: \"Despite this, the council leadership are determined to press ahead in their usual incoherent manner, ignoring procedures, policies and good practice.\"Given the clear implications for public health, and potential for increased instances of public nuisance, it is astonishing that the council has not discussed this matter with NHS Highland and Police Scotland.\"Sunday  Oct  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117682.jpg","title":"Repair work set for next month after landslip on lifeline route","story":"CAITHNESS civic leader Willie Mackay has questioned the delay involved in repair work following the landslip at Helmsdale last month.Mr Mackay, who represents the Wick and East Caithness ward on Highland Council, said: \"I am a bit disappointed that it has taken so long ndash the A is a major leline road.\"He was speaking after Bear Scotland confirmed yesterday that repairs to the landslip are due to start at the beginning of October.\"I thought they might have moved a bit quicker.

I am grateful to Andy Moir once again for making himself available and to all those we met in Stronsay, who engaged constructively and put forward a number of issues for further consideration.“The key issue raised at the public meeting was undoubtedly the decision by NHS Orkney not to include a helipad on the site of the new Balfour hospital. Concerns were expressed about apparent delays in transferring Isles patients, brought in by air ambulance, from Kirkwall airport to the current Balfour due to a lack of land ambulance capacity.“While it is unlikely that NHS Orkney will reopen the decision on a helipad, ious suggestions were made about how delays in transfer to the hospital might be avoided in future. Mr Moir agreed to take these up with his colleagues responsible for land ambulance provision. Hopefully this may enable greater resilience to be built into the service going forward.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The other sites being considered for the initial roll-out include Glasgow, Ayr, Dumfries, Dunfermline, Fort William, Milngavie, Oban, Inverness and Aberdeen.The units will be fitted with technology that will enable them to digitally track water usage at each Top-up point, transmitting the data via cloud technology to specialists managing Scotland’s water networks. The resulting data will be used to calculate cost and plastic savings, along with the volume of water being consumed.Douglas Millican, Scottish Water chief executive, said: “Our research shows that people feel very positively towards the quality of Scotland’s tap water — now these state-of-the-art taps can provide access to enable water drinkers to enjoy it while on the go by carrying and using refillable bottles.”The Your Water, Your Le campaign aims to make tap the first choice for water drinkers wherever they are, and encourages businesses to make it readily available for staff and customers. Zero Waste Scotland, Keep Scotland Beautul and Scottish Natural Heritage, have also voiced their support.On average, a litre bottle of water costs about p, so topping up daily from the tap, could save £. a day, nearly £ a year.For further information, visit yourwateryourle vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She called for the creation of prearranged collections for businesses seeking to deposit large amounts of cash, after the review recognised that such arrangements could be improved.The MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch said: \"As the MSP for Beauly and Kyle, I am of course disappointed that the RBS branches in both towns are to close.\"While I recognise branch use has been declining in both of these areas, there are still well-documented and legitimate questions regarding security and disabled access in the alternative banking provision.\"The review plainly states that the branch closure in Beauly will cause dficulties for vulnerable customers and so as the constituency MSP I am calling on RBS to work with me to put measures in place to provide specic support for them. I hope RBS will work with me to listen to the views of the community council to ensure there are better routes and provision in the Beauly area.\"The union Unite slated the announcement by RBS, arguing that the bank had simply gone through the motions of reviewing the cases before pushing ahead with its original plans.The unionrsquos regional officer, Lyn Turner, said: \"The Johnston Carmichael review was entirely predictable and nothing but a rubber-stamp of RBS management decisions. Sixty communities out of an original  with branches earmarked for closure will now be marginalised by this so-called review. Unite will request to meet RBS urgently to discuss the impact.\"Simon Watson, managing director of personal banking at RBS pledged to provide banking alternatives in Kyle and Beauly. He said: \"We know branches are important to many communities, but equally we know that fewer people are using them as more people bank online. In every case of a branch closing we are committed to providing the best possible range of alternatives.\"Sunday  Oct  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

I see a bright future for the town, now things are starting to move forward,\" she said.This was echoed by long-serving Invergordon hairdresser Sharon Mitchell. She agreed more houses were desperately needed but said more shops must follow because the town centre was sorely lacking its yesteryear \"buzz\".\"It used to be thriving here but itrsquos Alness thatrsquos thriving now.

It also can help people buy a new-build home from a council or housing association.Ms Mitchell said: \"A LIFT scheme would be the best.

These were the northern end of the Cromlet site, opposite the rugby club and the farmland at Davidson Drive, surrounding the farm buildings.\"Both landowners were approached and the latter is under discussion.\"She added: \"Invergordon has so much to offer in terms of employment, both atthe base and industrial estates, as well as the cruise sector, which is growing, but people need a decent roof over their heads.\"By encouraging inward-migration and moving around within the town we also encourage the economics to grow, so more people means more people in the town shopping and more new shopping ideas popping up as there would be people to use them.\"In latter years, Invergordonrsquos population has settled around the  mark, whereas Alness has grown to just over .\"It is time this balanced-out and allowed both towns to be more equal in terms of shopping experiences.\"Sunday  Oct  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Stem cell research hit the headlines earlier this week after Glaswegian comedian Sir Billy Connolly revealed he would participate in a pioneering Hard University study which aims to use stem cells to find a cure for Parkinson’s. Censo said it has a “rapidly expanding” portfolio of major drug company clients choosing to outsource this specialised research, including some of the best known pharmaceutical and biotech companies across Europe, the US and Japan.The research firm plans to use the £.m investment to accelerate business growth, expand its marketing and sales capabilities, and broaden the range of commercial research services it provides to clients.The funding will be provided by three sources: Edinburgh-based venture capital firm Par Equity’s Par Syndicate EIS Fund, which invests in young, innovative technology companies the Par Syndicate, which is a network of specially selected expert investors and the Scottish Investment Bank. Aidan Courtney, chief executive at Censo, said: “This investment from Par Equity has come at exactly the right time for the company. “Over the past two years we have developed a comprehensive suite of resources which allow us to create human stem cells from any inidual and use derivatives of these cells to test drugs for clients. “Our focus on selected research areas, such as neuro-inflammation, has aligned extremely well with our clients’ needs and we are seeing more demand than we can accommodate with our current resources. “Par Equity’s investment will allow us to broaden our service offering and accelerate growth.”Paul Munn, partner at Par Equity, said: “Our investment gives Censo the capital to build upon its important work, but we’re also very active managers. “We’ll work closely with Censo’s management, drawing on the expertise and experience of our network of investors to give them the support they need to scale up this exciting business, which could help transform treatment of a number of serious diseases.”Censo was founded in  following the merger of Roslin Cellab and Roslin Cell Sciences, and has employs teamsin the Scottish capital and Cambridge.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4814688.1539464959!/image/image.jpg","title":"catholic church may give its blessing to priests who father children","story":"Priests who father children while serving in the Catholic church in Scotland may be able to continue their religious work, the organisation representing Catholic bishops has said.The general secretary of the Catholic National Endowment Trust, otherwise known as the Bishops’ Conference of Scotland, said every bishop would want to “discern the best ways in which it is possible” for the father of a child who is a priest to “fulfil his responsibilities”. Hugh Bradley said it would not be a “simple default position of insisting that a man leave the priesthood”.It is believed many priests who fathered children did not acknowledge their offspring for fear they would be cast out from the priesthood. Instead, youngsters’ mothers kept the identity of their child’s father a secret, citing “father unknown” on their birth certicate.Campaigner Vincent Doyle, from Ireland, who discovered late in le his own father was a priest, has fought for church organisations to relax rules to allow the religious leaders to have a normal relationship with their children.He has since set up Coping International – a charity to support the children of priests across the world.Doyle, who had a close relationship as a child with the man he thought was his godfather, but without knowing he was actually his biological father, described the statement from the Bishops of Scotland as “empowering priests”. He said it would put the child first.Doyle said: “I would like to publicly thank the Catholic Bishops of Scotland for addressing this. It is not an easy thing to do. This is a sociological move by the episcopal conference of Scotland to eradicate sociological default norms.”He said the problem was not a historical one, with Coping International now advising a young mother whose unborn baby’s father was a priest. Another family in the same situation has a child of two.Bradley said: “The Bishops of Scotland wish to reiterate that, with regard to children of the ordained and religious, every bishop would want to discern the best ways in which it is possible for the father of a child, who is a priest, to fulfil his responsibilities. Every bishop is willing to meet anyone in their diocese in a similar situation to discern an appropriate and just way forward.”He added: “With regard to a priest who has become a father, the Bishops recognise it is not possible to rule out, at the beginning, any possible responses to these situations ... each case should be judged on its merits.” There are no figures about the number of children fathered by Catholic priests. However, there are about , Catholic priests in the world and the Catholic Church forbids articial contraception and abortion.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4814680.1539448496!/image/image.jpg","title":"rosemary goring forgotten women on history s front line","story":"#What#s wrong with the conventional way of writing history # a man asked me the other evening, after I#d been speaking about my forthcoming book, Scotland: Her Story. This is an anthology of eye-witness accounts, from the Middle Ages to today, which recounts the past through women’s experience. It is not entirely by women, since for centuries it was men who kept the records, but its focus is exclusively on the ways in which women and girls lived, acted and were treated. A female perspective on history clearly perplexed this man, who asked why such a thing was necessary. The answer is simple. Since, until recently, the nation was run exclusively by men, be it parliament, education, finance or religion, women’s lives and contribution have been largely airbrushed from sight. For , years and more, unless she was royal, aristocratic, or in holy orders, a woman’s only chance of being recorded for posterity wasshe committed a crime. Like the girl on a convict ship bound for Botany Bay, who caught a sailor’s eye with her weeping. For nothing worse than petty theft, she was being transported. She died before the ship docked. I politely explained my reasons for writing the book, but the man remained unconvinced. “We’re trying to find common ground,” he said to my husband, who had joined us, sensing trouble, “and we haven’t yet succeeded.” It was a reminder that even now women’s equality is not a battle won but an ongoing skirmish. If there are pockets of resistance or incomprehension today, how much worse was it in the days of John Knox or James VI, when queens were not deemed fit to rule, and females taken notice of onlythey were witches  Scotland: Her Story is not a rewriting of history. It is, rather, an attempt to enrich the picture by filling the canvas with those figures who were too often overlooked or ignored. Some of those included are famous, but far more you will never have heard of. Here you will find the children and women who crawled in mine shafts, such as Janet Cumming, , from Ormiston Colliery: “The roof is very low I have to bend my back and legs and the water is frequently up to the calves of my legs. Have no liking for the work. Father makes me like it.” There are farmers’ wives, rebels and anarchists, doctors, spies, Jacobites, nurses, alcoholics, teachers, prostitutes and office workers, their lives bubbling away, out of sight, while men in positions of power made the headlines. In some cases, it was only the absence of their menfolk that allowed women to prove what they were capable of. In a newspaper interview with one of the first lady tram drivers in  you can almost hear a glass ceiling being shattered: “One more question, Miss Campbell. What answer would you make to the people who still declare that women will never make efficient tram drivers ” “They are too premature. The fact that there are five of us in Glasgow seems sufficient reply.” While men were in the thick of battle, so were women. Mary Lee Milne, a Selkirk widow, was cook for Elsie Inglis’s hospital unit on the Russian front in . She turned miserable scraps into tasty meals, making light of the terrible danger. “At tea time they were back again – guns firing and shells flying through the air. For the moment we are all safe – but how long will it last ” Then there is the stuff that for far too long historians considered unimportant: giving birth, raising children, losing children, and sex. While researching I found an abundance of the visceral facts of le, from the rules governing early midwives to what it feels like having a C-section from unwanted pregnancies to wives abused by their husbands from spouses who tried to keep the flame of married sex alight, to others, like Maggie Fuller, who was rare in admitting in the s: “I could count how many times I’ve got anything out of sex.

The paper will be published ahead of Wednesday’s key EU summit and amid reports the Brexit transition period could be extended by another year to help Theresa May find a solution to the Irish border problem.The extension has been proposed by the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier and would mean the UK being tied to the EU until the end of  rather than .But the proposal has been met with fury by Tory Eurosceptics because it would add £ billion to the Brexit bill and has angered the DUP, which May relies on to prop up her government. Sturgeon’s paper will be released when she gives a speech to the Royal Society of Arts in London tomorrow. The paper will argue the UK government’s “ choice” between a “bad, possibly blindfold” Brexit deal and a no-deal scenario should not be accepted.Speaking in advance of its publication, Sturgeon said: “The UK is scheduled to leave the European Union less than six months from now – but both a withdrawal agreement and a clear, detailed statement on the future relationship must be concluded much sooner.“As things stand, we still have no guarantee of a transition agreement or a detailed proposition setting out the future trading relationship between the UK and EU.“The UK goverment seems intent on presenting a  choice between whatever bad, possibly blindfold, deal they manage to conclude and a no-deal scenario. However, the Scottish Government will this week set out our common sense, workable alternative and make clear why we believe there is now an opportunity to seize an alternative path.”In the June  referendum, Scotland saw a majorityof the electorate vote to remain in the EU.Sturgeon said her administration had a duty to work to ensure the Scottish share of the vote was respected even though the referendum was conducted on a UK-wide basis. She said: “It is not too late for public duty and calm heads to prevail and for a no-deal or bad, possibly blindfold, deal outcome to be averted.“MPs and the wider public should not accept the  choice that is being presented – there is an alternative and our proposals are the only way to truly protect our businesses, people and communities from the worst effects of Brexit.“Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU and our duty as a government is to work as hard as we can to ensure that vote is respected and for Scotland’s key interests to be protected.“That means staying in the customs union and single market, which is around eight times bigger than the UK market alone.“With time running short, the UK government must take stock and listen to our proposals.”But Adam Tomkins, Scottish Conservative shadow secretary for the constitution, countered, saying: “The assertion that the EU single market is eight times larger than the UK single market is designed to be misleading.“Two-thirds of Scotland’s trade depends on the UK single market, underlining the fundamental importance of the Union to Scotland’s economy.“If the First Minister genuinely wants to act in the best interests of Scotland she must take indyref off the table and focus on improving Scotland’s stagnant economy, falling educational standards and ening hospital waiting times.”Sturgeon’s intervention comes after she warned last month that extending the timetable for Brexit negotiations must remain on the tablethe UK is to “avoid an economic clf edge”.Last week, she closed the SNP’s annual conference in Glasgow with a claim that her party’s goal of independence for Scotland was “clearly in sight”, although she urged activists to show patience when it came to breaking up the UK.Yesterday the Department for Exiting the European Union said it would not comment on reports that the UK could remain tied to Brussels’ rules beyond the end of  to give negotiators more time to finalise a trade deal.The potential extension of the transition period, which would see the UK stay in the EU single market and customs union, is being considered as intensive negotiations continue ahead of Wednesday’s summit.The year’s extension would allow extra time to draw up a deal on the future UK-EU relationship – and avoid the need to use a controversial “backstop” arrangement to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.The need to resolve the backstop issue is a political headache for the Prime Minister, who is trying to fend off the threat of cabinet resignations after at least four senior ministers expressed concern over the way the issue is panning out.The European Union’s version, which would see just Northern Ireland remain aligned with Brussels’ rules, has been called unacceptable by May and is fiercely resisted by her DUP allies.May’s counter-proposal, set out in June, was for a “temporary customs arrangement” for the whole UK, but Tory Brexiteers are suspicious this could turn into a permanent situation – restricting the freedom to strike trade deals around the world. Pressure intensied on the Prime Minister when DUP leader Arlene Foster warned her not to accept a “dodgy” deal from Brussels.Foster told May not to accept a plan that would “effectively cut Northern Ireland adrt”.In a strongly worded article in the Belfast , Foster warned against the EU’s backstop proposal and also stressed that she would not accept any measure that resulted in extra checks for goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4814678.1539448480!/image/image.jpg","title":"dani garavelli fresh look at tories universal credit crunch","story":"Last Sunday, Theresa May made an audacious pitch for disenchanted Labour voters. #You are not bound by ideology,# she told those #moderates# who are less than overjoyed by the prospect of a Jeremy Corbyn-led government. #It is time for you to look at our party afresh.# There followed some disingenuous bluster about the Conservatives offering a #positive and optimistic vision# and the promise that the end of austerity was nigh.It was nonsense, of course. As any fule kno, this government is as far from representing the working classes as Tommy Robinson is from representing Muslims. But just in case any lost Labour voters might be delirious and find themselves inadvertently straying into the Tory camp, Esther McVey, secretary for Work and Pensions, did the right thing and took time out to remind us just how many f***s the government gives about society’s poorest .As John Major warned Universal Credit might prove to be May’s “poll tax”, McVey finally admitted some people in receipt of the new six-in-one benefit could be worse off. Asked about reportsthat three million people on working tax credits would lose up to £, a year, she answered only that the government had been forced to make some tough decisions, but that those affected would be fine because they would make up the lost income through work.McVey stands almost alone in her view that all manner of things shall be well, largely because she enters a state of denial whenever anyone warns her of impending disaster. That’s what she did last year when the National Audit Officeissued its damning report on the impact Universal Credit was having on the , people who were then claiming it. It said  per cent were in financial dficulty,  per cent were not paid in full on time, and  per cent said they couldn’t make an online claim. The NAO also said there was no evidence Universal Credit would reduce unemployment or result in administrative savings – both key objectives of the original plan – before going on to concede that, after eight years and a £ billion of investment, there didn’t seem to be a practical alternative. But what McVey heard, and relayed to parliament, was that the NAO thought the roll-out should be speeded up. She also suggested the report was based on outdated statistics. So brazen was her behaviour, that the comptroller and auditor general, Sir Amyas Morse, felt compelled to write an open letter correcting her mistakes. She later apologised for the statement on speeding up the roll-out, but did not resign. Now McVey faces a chorus of warnings: from those who have suffered as a result of the problems with Universal Credit, from opposition parties and from those within her own party who can see the storm heading their way.One of the prophets of doom is Iain Duncan Smith, the architect of Universal Credit, who resigned as Secretary of Work and Pensions after the then chancellor, George Osborne, slashed disability benefits. Duncan Smith wants the £bn Osborne plundered from the Universal Credit scheme to be replaced by scrapping plans to raise the tax threshold.Major is another critic. Demonstrating the gulf between the Toryism of the s and now, he has pointed out that leaving vulnerable people worse off might offend a civic sense of fairness and be the government’s undoing. Which is quite a thought given the mess it is making of Brexit.Other backbench MPs fear the policy will cause problems in their constituencies. Nigel Mills, a member of the work and pensions select committee, said the government should slow down the roll-out. And Johnny Mercer, MP for Plymouth, described the scheme as politically “undeliverable” although he blamed “bad press” and a “politically driven fear” which encouraged people to dismiss it as a failure before it had even been tried. Mercer also suggested that frontline workers were broadly positive about the scheme, only to have some of those frontline workers take to Twitter to deny this.Charities contracted to get unemployed people into work are in an ideal position to witness any dysality as the mass migration of existing claimants begins in July next year. That will be why  of them have been forced to sign a gagging clause which prohibits them from saying anything that might tarnish McVey’s reputation.Other charities, such as Mind, oppose the scheme because they know how many people with physical and mental health problems have died while trying to claim Universal Benefit they know that the demand on food banks goes up whenever it is introduced in a new area they know the anxiety and despair it is causing so many people. For its part, the SNP has branded Universal Credit “not fit for purpose” and called for urgent changes, including the restoration of the original work allowance and the lting of the benefit freeze. The Labour Party too has been unstinting in its criticism of the policy, with former prime minister Gordon Brown saying that unless the roll-out is halted the country faces a “summer of discontent”, and party chair Ian Lavery warning of more suicides. Within the past couple of days, scrapping the benefit, as opposed to pausing and fixing it, has become official Labour Party policy.Despite all this pressure, the Prime Minister still appears wedded to the idea. A spokesman for the government said: “Universal Credit is based on the sound principles that work should always pay and those who need support receive it.”She may eventually cave in, at least with regards to scrapping the rise in the tax threshold and replacing the missing £bn, but,she does, it will be because of the work of opposition parties, trade unions, charities and those Tory MPs who have spoken up.As everyone outside the inner core of the Conservatives looks on aghast, May must be delusional – or think others are – to dream that a single Labour voter would drt in her direction. Those who are disaffected with Corbyn may crave a more centrist approach, but they’d surely never be misguided enough to believe that a party that has wrought such misery for the most vulnerable in society could ever provide an acceptable alternative.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4814738.1539464730!/image/image.jpg","title":"veteran labour mep ready to back indyref2 over no deal brexit","story":"One of Labour#s most senior parliamentarians has warned a chaotic no-deal Brexit would push him towards supporting Scottish independence, and criticised Richard Leonard#s stand against holding a second independence referendum.Labour MEP David Martin said he feared the UK’s exit from the EU could turn England into “a very insular, inward looking country”, which could also change his mind on Scotland’s place in the Union.Last month Scottish Labour leader Leonard restated his party’s opposition to allowing the second independence referendum to take place under any circumstances, saying the next UK manesto would include a pledge not to allow such a vote.Martin, who has represented Scotland in the European Parliament for more than  years, said the Scottish people should have the final say on whether another referendum is called.“I disagree with Richard,” the Labour MEP said, speaking to journalists in Brussels. “If we leave the EU in acrimonious circumstances and there is a mood for a second independence referendum, then I think the Scottish people should have the right to make that decision.”Martin said he had not discussed the issue with his leader in Edinburgh.The fresh commitment from Leonard came after comments from UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who said in a recent interview he was “not ruling out” a new independence referendum and would decide “at the time” whether to grant a request from Holyrood for the powers to hold one.Some of Corbyn’s advisers believe that in order to win back votes from the SNP, Labour should take a softer line, while senior figures in Scotland are convinced that would only fuel the Conservative revival.“Jeremy Corbyn might be closer to me on that than Richard Leonard,” Martin said. Asked how he would votethere was a second Scottish independence referendum, Martin added: “It really would depend on the circumstances.“If we leave without a deal and it’s a complete crisis, then I think that does edge towards the idea of independence.“If we leave in a civilised, constructive manner, then it starts to depend on what the future trading relationship is and what the other relationships are. Frankly, what worries me more than Brexit is whether England is becoming a very insular, inward-looking country.“Andit does continue down that path, then it would make me change my mind about remaining in the UK.“I did campaign hard in  for Scotland to remain part of the United Kingdom because my own politics are to look outwards to look outwards from Scotland to the UK and from the UK to Europe.“Butwe become an insular country, it would make me reassess my view.”Martin said an independent Scotland could rejoin the EU within three years and would be able to escape the requirement that new member states commit to joining the single European currency.The -year-old confirmed he would retire from politics after Brexit.Elected to the European Parliament in , he is the second longest serving MEP in the -seat legislature.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.I take onboard your points, Haydn, but I think what is putting people off the VEP, is the shear cost of what it could possibly be. I have heard a figure not far short of kicking on the door of £. Billion, and possibly more, and how many decades would this take to bring VEP into the black in terms of revenue One should also look into the potential running and maintenance costs per year for such a project  Would the revenue created be enough to off-set such costs or would VE require more funding from the SCT, to balance its books It seems very evident, the more information people in Shetland know about VEP, the more people are put off the whole idea in terms of economics and what little benefit the islands may reap from it  I have heard a figure of around £ million a year###.poor investmentthe projected costs are to be believed. Aof around. of % does not bode well.I have to take issue with you here Haydn, The proposed VE turbines will now be meres high and constructed on hills. The high point some meters plus above sea level. That would be the line of sight from sea level of about  miles. Precious little of Shetland would not see the VE turbines!! I note you claim #that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions#. I would respectfully point out wind turbines are hardly a new idea! Many consider them at the point of being an obsolete technologyNow for cutting-edge ideas, look to tidal generation and modular nuclear reactors. The latter , I believe you are openly condemning, something about us all glowing in the dark was your comment!!! Now that was Scaremongering nonsense. Rosatom,Russias vehicle for nuclear expansion,has about % of new nuclear plant contracts in the bag,mainly in emerging and third world countries .If Chernobyl is anything to go by and what Russia the culprit did in rectyingthe mess,novichok is going to be a piddle in the ocean in comparison.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves. Viking energy should sit up and take not it but will have cloth ears when it comes to profit. Remember, as you sow,so shall ye reap.Germany, by nature of its fragmented political system with government by weak coalitions only resulted in the Green Partyexercising much influence beyond their electoral mandate. Nuclear power was cut back as a political gesture to the Greens, that had nothing to do with the science of the matter. The result was a massive increase in coal-fired electrical generation and also the importation of Natural Gas. Germany is now the worlds largest importer of Natural Gas! and the German motor industries disingenuous diesel emission data is almost legendary!!!.Deaths from atmospheric pollution in Germany are massive and this year the EU is taking Germany to court for breaking all EU guidelines. It is indeed very ironic that the Scotish Government does so much to praise the use of Wind power and exploit all its rural communities to that end while it does all in its ability to expandGas Exportation from the North Sea,. It likewise imports Gasto Grangemouth and at all times try and use North Sea oil revenue to promote Nationalist agendas. The logic escapes me, perhaps you could explain Grahm,!!!Billy , I understand where you are coming from when stating that  year old turbines in Germany are coming to the end of their lives , but is this surprising   Since technological advances in vast areas of activity are so rapid it would be most unlikely for things to suddenly stand still.Try selling a  year old car , TV. washing machine ,vacuum cleaner , racing bike etc etc. Virtually worthless . Fighter ‘planes cost £millions EACH so should we have stuck with the Tiger Moth to save money   Times change continuously.No doubt some would like the world to stop to enable them to get off so that they could abandon their mortgage and live in a cave in a cosy corner of the Moon. All very whimsical but I’m sure you get the drt.Interesting comment Haydn. I am unable to find any substantive advance in Wind Turbines as technology over the last  years. They are larger yes, but no less polluting and even more damaging to the environment. The most recent research would indicate that disturbance in airflow patterns and friction around the rotating blades not only creates more noise pollution but results in substantive heat creation. That heat creation in itself would and does contribute to global warming new research has shown. Reference #Hard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences# would indicate wind power in theU.S. with wind alone would warm the planet a quarter-degree Celsius! If this research is proved correct, we will be decommissioning and scrapping wind turbines far sooner than the protagonist advocate. There are already far better ways of generating clean electricity than  meter high turbines, sadly too many have staked their reputations on the wind myth and will resist accepting they have been wrongFair enough Ian. I must confess that I was unaware of the likely height of the proposed turbine blades.I’m not so sure about Japan and others having a reducing intention to set up more turbines though. As for the comment I made about nuclear radiation causing people to glow in the dark —— you surely cannot be serious !!!!That was no more than a figure of speech.I hope you are merely poking fun at such a prospect.I know that glow worms emit light as do other creatures in the sea but it’s silly to think that the effects on iniduals who have been subjected to radiation for medical reasons would then walk about looking like Beacons.Give me a break Ian!Ian.—- Your comments on October th at -.Plenty of food for thought in your missive .Thanks.It is a balance between providing energy safely and economically, but our conventional methods of using fossil fuels has brought to the fore due to the impact such energy has had on the environment.However, whilst we are being side-tracked about the impact of fossil fuels, nobody has every mentioned the impact on the planet caused by agriculture. Agriculture, I believe, causes  times more green house gases than all of transportation put together Not only does agriculture produce more green houses gases than transportation, it is the greatest cause of environmental destruction than any other industry. As our population grows, this will become more evident, as we see species upon species being put on the # endangered species list # or # become extinct #. This man-made catastrophe will impact on other species and it will eventually impact the very existence of humans on the planet as nature takes revenge through disease, drought and other natural impacts.Progress in providing alternative energy may be a positive start, but at what price will this be to the planet and le,this progress is purely based on the man-made concept of monetary value and this of profit David Spence, the single most signicant threats to humanity are overpopulation and our leaders, scientic, religious and political leader#s, utter cowardice to dare to mention such an undeniable fact. World population is set to double in  years. Energy needs, food supply, pollution are all driven by human population density. It makes no odds how many windmills we build whatever their size! Atmospheric pollution, global warming or starvation awaits and will kill all our children#s children as long as human overbreeding continues.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League.

Added to this, a further four football pitches worth of the reserve land would be temporarily lost to the construction site to accommodate the construction activities and the associated diggers, cranes and other heavy machinery.\"But the effects of the road scheme on the reserves wildle will extend far beyond the extent of roadworks activities.\"The noise and activity associated with the A construction works, and the increased traffic flows and the imposing road structure once the road is completed, will cause many birds to keep their distance and not attempt to nest or feed within several hundred metres of the road site.\"Transport Scotland has bought land at Dellmore near Insh Marshes and proposes to convert some of this to wet grassland to accommodate the homeless wader bird species from Insh. While RSPB Scotland has welcomed this, the charity said it will be hard to convert this land for the waders, and maintain it as such over the long-term.The spokeswoman said: \"It is far from guaranteed it will provide suitable habitat, and evenit does, the new habitat will not be big enough or suitable to rehome all of the waders that would be made homeless. Neither will it address other harm to wildle.\"Karen Birkby, RSPB Scotlands site manager at Insh Marshes, said several suggestions made to Transport Scotland to minimise impact on the nature reserve have been ignored.Aviemore Community Council made similar claims last week that their concerns had fallen on stoney ground over plans to construction the dual carriageway on the village side of the current A as part of the Dalraddy-Slochd section.

Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”Cherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.Having battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”Despite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of LuckyBhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like LuckyBhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be hereit wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”Three days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday th June, -year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took  to  minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”After being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.Having served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”During his  years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”On Wednesday th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, -year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.“John hadn’t been  per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was  — to take it easy, so we came home# We went to bed about  o’clock.”“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”Carol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled  and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about  years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”John was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”Carol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”Dr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by LuckyBhere is “truly le-saving”.“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every  seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by  per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.#The approach taken by LuckyBhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”Established in , LuckyBhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in  but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.In view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – LuckyBhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across theand breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.Last year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all  primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently  public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than  across Skye.Ross Cowie said: “We always said at LuckyBhere thatwe could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills. Training takes only two hours and what better skill could be learned than the ability potentially to save someone’s le.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180804_190022_01.jpg","title":"mallaig and kyleakin prepare for championship","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLeague newcomers Mallaig face reigning champions Kyleakin in Broadford on Saturdaywith the  Skye and Lochalsh Football League Championship at stake.This season#s champions will be determined by virtue of a winner-takes-all, title-deciding playoff after both sides finished neck-a-neck on  points in the table # as goal dference isn#t factored in.Mallaig secured their place in tomorrow#s showdown after recording a fantastic - away victory against Sleat and Strath in the final game of the campaign in which their goalkeeper Mark Johnston pulled off a late penalty save to seal the victory.Kyleakin, meanwhile, took the spoils with a well-deserved - home win in their crunch match against fellow title contenders Portree Juniors thanks in part to a splendid showing by goalkeeper Craig Wilson.With the teams having scored  goals between them in the league this season # *including  in their three encounters so far, Saturday#s match-up promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a thrilling and unpredictable campaign.Having gone from - up to - down, the Blues rallied with goals from substitute Brett MacMillan, who drew his side level and then from Andy Cunningham who struck a late winner to seal the points.Mallaig led twice, first through Marc MacLean, and then Angus MacNaughton but were pegged by Graham Campbell#s side.Just as it appeared a vital three points would slip through the net, Jamie MacGregor# side struck a third in injury time as Ryan MacDonald set up Andy Cunningham for the winner.With only a win guaranteed to keep them in the hunt, Mallaig stepped up when the pressure was on to put in an excellent away performance against DL MacKinnon#s men.Ross Douglas scored a brace to help fire his side - ahead but Connaire Yoxon found the back of the net with a fine finish to halve their advantage.With less than ten minutes remaining Sleat were awarded a penalty and the chance to equalise. However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon#s effort and with it seal his side#s playoff berth.After succumbing to a - defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting - win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts# unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.In stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before # which saw him earn a red card # Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.The south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.Kyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a  to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.With Mallaig having finished the season on  points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher#s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.What followed was a fine team performance by the  winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson # including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half. #I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.##The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have onlyone defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.# #It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.#I don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig # so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.# #This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We#re still learning and hopefully improving.# #It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people#s expectations of you.# #I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.# #No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game. We really need to work out a game plan to unlock the Kyleakin code, they are the only team we haven’t managed to beat this year.#########################################-Article by Adam GordonAll images by Willie Urquhart."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/p1-crop.jpg","title":"council wants scotrail to help ease disruption on stromeferry","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineScotrail are currently considering a proposal to terminate rail journeys at Strathcarron to allow road traffic to flow more freely through the ersion on the Stromeferry bypass.At a meeting in Lochcarron last week, Colin Howell , Highland Council’s head of infrastructure, said that the ‘road to rail’ ersion on the bypass, where important stabilisation work to the rockface is being carried out, could stay open to traffic for an extra  minutes each dayScotrail would agree to do this. It would involved taking passengers by bus from Strathcarron to stations along the line to Kyle of Lochalsh.At the moment, even when a train has gone passed the bypass, that section of line must remain closed until the train reaches either Kyle or Strathcarron. Mr Howell said that Transport Scotland and Transport Minister Michael Matheson are considering this.A spokesman for Transport Scotland said Scotrail are looking at the proposal, which will have to be approved by the Mr Matheson. to facilitate the essential works on the Council’s A road.“We appreciate that, notwithstanding this cooperation, there is disruption for road uses during the passage of the normal train service. We have asked colleagues in the ScotRail Alliance to considerthere are any practical options further to minimise disruption to road users during the road works whilst still maintaining services upon which rail passengers depend.”Skye and Lochalsh MP Ian Blackford supported the introduction to the buses from Strathcarron.He added: “Network Rail seem to be sticking their fingers in their ears over this. A number of mistakes from both the rail company and Highland Council have led to the situation that we are in now and have been for some time.”“Network Rail must stop some of the trains coming from Inverness at Strathcarron and then arrange a bus service going onto Stromeferry. That would alleviate the ridiculous waiting times that passengers travelling by road are experiencing.”“The current way of working has caused no end of problems.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.The correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.By her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.Clearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.Her government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.She had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.But despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.Instead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.Faced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.It also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls And while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.The aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.Her government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.This reliance on the DUP remains the central problem andany process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.The Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.The Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit. He also has responsibilities to them in terms of rights and his government and must now show leader-ship in securing and defending rights which are routinely delivered everywhere  on this is-land.Leo Varadkar would not tolerate discrimination against the LGBT community, women, victims and Irish speakers in Dublin. He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.There can be no ambivalence or equivocation on rights, equality and integrity in government.These are basic building blocks of any democratic society. They are not republican demands and it is long past that the British Government stopped prioritising its own selfish interests over what should be birth-rights of people they claim to represent.What is certain is that Direct Rule failed in the past and is not and never will be acceptable again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27474  ","story":" Mark MoloneyMartin said that while a decision on a merger with the SDLP or contesting elections in the North has not yet been reached, there were no circumstances under which Fianna Fáil candidates would not take their seats.FIANNA Fáil leader Mícheál Martin TD has confirmed that successful Fianna Fáil candidates standing in the North would take their seats in Westminster.

Its increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.LastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.Thefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.TheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.In myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that years of progress could be squandered.Irepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.Thefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.And thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.Thereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.Sinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.Partitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.It hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. Thesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.TheCivil Rights Movement  years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.This belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since . Therefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast  months.Thegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.They wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.The politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.Over  years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.Verysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.A newgeneration is questioning partition.Therepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.Brexithas become a defining moment for these islands.Ithas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.Thedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.Thesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.Theydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.Thereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.Negativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince , must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.Initially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.Formany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.Forthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.However, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.It istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.In parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity. Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.A GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.TheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.Politicalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. Toomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.Societalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.Demographicshts in the north are irreversible.It isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.Somevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.However,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.Unionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.No onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.The %which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.Aminority should be cherished because it enriches society.Diversityshould be celebrated and respected.Thispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.Politicaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.Republicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.Thiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.Theopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.Sinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.Butfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.Whocould have imagined  years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.Themodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.Mandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”Irishunity is both reasonable and achievable.Irelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.We arestronger as a people for that.Sinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.Thereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.This isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagleUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1077173.jpg--.jpg?1539084908000\n","title":"public mystified by disappearing planters","story":"LOCAL people have been mystied as to why the large street planters, bought at considerable cost to ratepayers, have vanished from the Ballymena townscap.Many members of the public have been contacting theto enquire what has happened the planters and whether they willto the streets.The large containers, which were added to the town centre as part of the poundmillion public realm scheme were initially the subject of public scorn but by early June many of them had been filled with blooms, adding some colour and vibrant appearance to the town.So, when the best of the planters with superb floral displays were taken away, virtually overnight, many locals were puzzled.However it must be admitted that some of the planters - originally dubbed ‘skips’ by local people, were in a poor state or repair.When thecontacted the Council to askthey were gone for good, they responded by saying the planters had been taken to a Council yard to be replanted, but will be ed to the town centre when this is complete.Eagle-eyed members of the public have also been asking why the planters had been moved from the original storage area at the site of the old Wellington Street church.

EasyJet pilot Alex Hawthorne who is originally from Waringstown Now the proud pilot of an Easyjet airbus , Alex, , graduated from Oxford Aviation Academy earlier this year and is based in Venice.She lives with her Italian boyfriend Edgar, whom she met during her pilot training.It has been  years since Alex left her home in Waringstown at the age of  to start a new le in Canada.The move came about after her mum Alison – a flight attendant for many years – married a Canadian pilot whom she met on her travels.    Alex began to pursue a career as a pilot when she moved to Canada They married in  and the family now live in Kitchener, Ontario, roughly an hour outside Toronto. Inspired by her step-dad Doug Glussich, Alex gained her full private pilot’s licence, her first step towards her dream of becoming a commercial pilot.She said: “Mum was a flight attendant so I was kind of exposed to flying from an early age, but it was when I met my step-dad that I first thought that maybe I could be a pilot.”She admitted that having realised her dream, it was not all plain sailing given that her profession is male-dominated: “I’m based in Venice with EasyJet. I’m the only female first officer and there’s also a female captain.    Alex with her grandparents in the cockpit “There’s just the two females out of -strong flight crew.” She said: “I do think things are going in the right direction, especially with EasyJet.

If you’re a good pilot, your a good pilot – end of story.“Through training I felt that I had to be a little bit better than the boys because I’m a girl.“I have unfortunately encountered a few negative comments, not from any co-workers, but from passengers. It’s been especially from older male passengers when they see a female pilot sitting in the cockpit they things like, ‘maybe I’d be safer getting a dferent flight’. It’s said in jokey way, they’re from a dferent time, but I don’t like hearing it because to me being a pilot is not a joke.“I’ve only had two or three of those comments, it’s not a regular thing.”Talking about the longevity of a career as a pilot, Alex said: “Pilot retirement age is  simply for medical reasons. You have medicals once a year until you get to over , then your medicals come once every six months.”She said: “I’m very settled where I am for now. EasyJet is a fantactic company, they really look after their employees, the money is good, the benefits are good. “To start your career flying an Airbus  is fabulous – it’s one of the best jets around.“However I’ve always had my sights on going long haul. I’d love to try the Boeing ‘triple sevens’, or the s or even the Airbus s, because the bigger the better, right “Before my career ends I would definitely like to try a bigger jet.”She continued@ “The longest flight I’m doing now is from Venice to Edinburgh. It’s two and half hours but from October we’ll be doing Lanzarote and Tel Aviv – those will be three and half hours each.“The Airbus that I fly now simply wouldn’t have the mileage to do more than seven hours. To do that I’d have to go to a bigger airbus – a , or to the Boeing .”Going back to her first time on board an airplane, Alex said: “The first time I was on a commercial aircraft was when I was four years old. I was going to Lanzarote with my parents and brother. “I was really excited. The noise was a bit frightening, but I loved the speed of the take off. “Back in those days you were still allowed to visit the pilots in the flight deck, so my brother and I went up with a flight attendant and I remember wondering what all the buttons were for.”Alex is now pleased to offer the same opportunities to children: “After we land we’ll have young boys and girls coming in to the cockpit. They give you so much respect, and are so interested. “If I could give any advice to the girls out there thinking of becoming a pilot, I’d say go for it.”The reassuring tone of a pilot is something that goes hand-in-hand with air travel, but are the men and women in the cockpit putting on a special voice to talk to passengers or is it their actual demeanour Alex explained: “They say everybody has a PA voice, they just want to sound as professional as they can. When I speak on board, I don’t want to come on with a really thick Northern Irish accent because nobody will understand me. It’s about clarity and getting the message across.”She added: “Pilots don’t only do medical testing. We do psychoanalysis testing. Pilots are calm. It’s in our nature. If a bad situation occurs we need to be able to handle it quickly and efficiently.“They’re not faking the voice, that’s their personality and how they are. That’s why they’re pilots.”Of her own journey she said: “Training was loads of hard work. My programme with Oxford was  months. It’s non-stop.“You have to say goodbye to your social le, but what’s  months in the grand scheme of things.“As a pilot, I’m quite happy to be a passenger. We work hard so it’s nice for me to let someone  fly. I’m completely as ease because I know the training the pilots have been through.”Talking of the most challenging manoeuvres she has had to carry out, Alex said: “When we went to Oxford we had to do upset recovery training. “We went into an aerobatic aircraft which is designed to be able to do all sorts of manoeuvres. “They put us into barrel rolls, spiral es. “Because we’re flying the big jets it’s very unlikely they will be able to get into a spiral e because computer systems have protection it wouldn’t let you. “However we always have to think of worst case scenariothese protections failed.”She commented: “In high school my strong subjects were maths and physics, when it comes to the theory behind flying I didn’t find it too overwhelming.“To get to spin an aircraft is a lot of fun. I feel like I’m in the red arrows.“I’ve been in planes from a young age. “It’s second nature to me, I don’t even flinch at it.”But what of those people who more than flinch at the prospect of air travel Alex said: “EasyJet actually do have a programme from Luton once a year where they take nervous fliers up on a free flight. “They have two pilots up front and two pilots in the cabin with the passengers explaining to them step-by-step from the take off to the landing what is happening and what are the noises you hear.“I can promise you this,it was completely dangerous I wouldn’t be doing it every day. “I think it’s fear of the unknown that makes people afraid.”Askedthere was training in place to deal with terrorist attacks, Alex said: “We do hijack training. We’re trainedanything were to happen we’re able to send out a squawk code which sends a message directly to Air Traffic Control.“Even everyday stuff – before we push back for the taxi until we get to the gate – the cockpit door is closed and will only be open for examplewe need to go to the bathroom. “We need to call cabin crew and they need to come to guard the doorwe have to leave the cockpit. “We take measures to ensure the cockpit door will not be breached. It’s also bulletproof. They’ve changed everything since  .”She explained how she came to be stationed in Italy: “The reason why I’m in Venice is because I met an Italian called Edgar during the training.”Alex and Edgar, , who is from Milan, soon became an item.She said: “Towards the end of our course we were able to say where we wanted to go. Edgar and I said we don’t mind where we’re placed but we’d like to be together. They put us both in Venice.“I’m still struggling a bit with the language – Italian has a lot of grammar in it. To get by I know the basics. It’s great to have an Italian speaker with me, in Italy a lot of places are remote and they don’t speak English.”Asked how much they see of each other, Alex said: “For the first year with EasyJet you’re on a flexi-roster so you can be working for three days then have two days off. “Sometimes we’re on completely opposite shts. He could be starting at am and I can be on lates working pm to midnight. Sometimes we’ll just see each other in the crew room, say hello and that’s it. “Some weeks you pass each other but others we get time off together when we can do whatever we want. It’s part of the job.”Alex said she also tried to go back to Waringstown as much as possible to visit relatives."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8658944.1538772078!/image/image.jpg","title":"northern

A mother and grandmother, Cindy, who was just , has been described as an ‘inspirational’ figure both to her family, friends and those she mentored.   Cindy Greer Her son Aaron Greersaid: “My mum was the rock of the family. We all depended on her. “I think we all feel a bit lost right now. To have the person you have always depended upon taken away from you so suddenly, it is dficult to deal with. “She was the most amazing, inspirational person in my le. It is so hard to put into words what she meant to us. “This was always a happy house. I have such good memories because of mum. She brought all of us together. She has two grandchildren and loved them to pieces. The family was mum’s big love. Any excuse for a family gathering to bring us all together. Christmas dinner was always here with everyone around the table.”Her mum Joan Newell is simply heartbroken. She said she couldn’t imagine never seeing her eldest daughter Cindy again. “I just love her so much. She was always there for me and did whatever she could to make my le better.“She was such a rock in this family. She phoned me last Wednesday after she had been talking to Alan. I asked herwe would see her that night but she had a client coming and she would see me on Thursday afternoon. That was the last we spoke.“I was at a meeting in church on Wednesday night and a couple of people came in late and said there had been a terrible accident. I said ‘God help whoever it is’. Little did I know it was Cindy. I couldn’t take it in when I heard the news.”Her partner of  years Alan McIvor said she was coming from work last Wednesday and phoned him on her hands-free around pm to say she was leaving. “She asked how my day was and she was her usual cheery self.“She said to put the tea on, and I reckoned she would be home about .pm. Sadly she didn’t make it.”Her red Honda Civic had been involved in a collision with a van at around .pm.“Someone stopped at the scene and started CPR then Cindy was resuscitated by paramedics.

But the worst thing for a child is to lose a mother. There are no words good enough to describe the person my Mummy is or how I feel at this present moment. Even though her fabulous personality shone throughout every part of her and her le, I am going to miss the simple things like goodnight kisses, the constant ‘I love you millions my special girl’ and the hour long chats about our dreams. I am so so privileged to call her my mother and she made sure she gave all of us the most heart-warming special memories that will stay with us a letime.“Her smile, her laugh, her humour, her love will always be with me. I love you millions forever Mum.”Cindy’s sister Julie Newell said she was  years younger than her and for many years took on a motherly role. “That grew into a friendship, sister relationship which was amazing. She was my biggest support. She is the heart of this family. She was the boss as the oldest sister. She took all the decisions for mum and dad as their health isn’t great.”Cindy and her partner Alan had been together for  loving years. Alan firmly believes Cindy made him a better man. “She was a total and utter inspiration and has improved my le. She was just what I needed.“We met when we both worked for the First Trust Bank, although in dferent departments. We enjoyed such brilliant times together - so many things, holidays and weekends away that I have great memories of.“Over the last few days people have said to me that Cindy and I did more in the last  years than a lot of people have done in a letime.“We had outline plans for Cindy’s th birthday in a year and a half and that is something I will have to deal with.“It is absolutely devastating. She was my rock and inspiration to be a better person.” Cindy grew up in Gilford’s Barrack Hill and went to Craigavon Primary School in the town and on to Tandragee Junior High School. She then went to Banbridge Tech.Straight after school she joined the TSB Bank in Lisburn in  later moving to the Lurgan branch. She was in the Banbridge branch for a while but she spent the longest time in the TSB, or First Trust as it became known, in Portadown where she was a Mortgage Sales Advisor.In Lisburn she was a business advisor for the Wallace High School Young Enterprise Team which won the NI Heat of the competition one year.She took early retirement in  and retrained as a professional make-up artist later working for Clarins initially at Debenhams in Rushmere and most recently Boots at Sprucefield.In Cindy’s younger years she was very involved in her local Church of Ireland at Tullylish in the Girls Brigade and as a Sunday School teacher.Her partner Alan said Cindy held strong religious beliefs. Her other sister Tracy McConnell is involved in with a children’s missionary charity called Abaana based in Bangor. Through that charity, Cindy sponsored a little boy called George in Uganda.Cindy’s partner Alan said some of the family will be taking over this sponsorship and that is why the family feel it is appropriate that donations in lieu of flowers are to the Abaana charity c o Milne Funeral Services.The family have been overwhelmed by the huge support and love since Cindy passed away.Her son Aaron said the kindness of everyone has been ‘unbelievable’ with so many gts of flowers, food and cards.“We always knew mum was popular but didn’t realise just how many lives she had touched.“We now know how much she was loved by everyone around her and how much she loved us... we will always love her.”The family also want to thank the wider family circle and friends for their support and kindness, those who attended the accident scene for their assistance and medical intervention, the PSNI Liaison Officer who has been a tower of strength and support to them the ‘absolutely amazing’ hospital staff and consultants at the Royal Victoria Hospital and the funeral director for his compassion and professionalism.

She said everBODY taught her mechanisms to cope with her illness.Action Mental Health’s Deborah McCready, everyBODY Project Worker said: “AMH everyBODY exists to bridge the gap on the clients’ journey from the moment they seek help until they eventually get to speak to a medical expert, as with existing waiting lists this can be a long time. AMH everyBODY offers a recovery approach in sessions when people will receive information and support to develop skills, stay focused and healthy until they see a therapist.” One service user said: “Speaking out is hard and you get scared that people will judge you, but for the first time I felt like somebody was listening to me and just got it. “I was able to get support for other underlying issues as well as my eating disorder and it helped having someone to explain how to access dferent types of support.AMH everyBODY Manager, Colin Loughran added: “This is a very practical model and one that could be used as a model of best practice throughout Northern Ireland.“There is a signicant shortfall in support services for people experiencing eating disorder and their families, prior to patients being seen by clinicians.“This new service will fill that gap giving people access to specially trained staff who will provide the vital support to help people in their recovery.”\"  \"  Happiest places in Northern Ireland revealed  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8667856.1539430479!/image/image.jpg","title":"too often the dedication of those working on frontline services goes unnoticed","story":"The unsung heroes of frontline service provision in communities across Northern Ireland have been celebrated at a gala event in Armagh.Councils throughout the province were represented as the nine award category winners of the  Local Government Awards were announced.

A second officer with responsibility for Ulster-Scots, sign language and other languages has also been appointed.The posts are jointly funded by Belfast City Council and Foras Na Gaeilge.The announcement was made during an event in City Hall presenting research by Conradh Na Gaeilge and the Committee on the Administration of Justice into how the north’s  councils are complying with their obligations with regard to the Irish language.Speaking at the launch Chief Executive of Belfast City Council Suzanne Wylie said: “I am absolutely delighted to be here today to celebrate the Irish language officers scheme and to welcome our Irish Language Officer Colm Mag Uiginn.“We also have our Irish Language Pfficers from Fermanagh, Omagh, Derry and Strabane here as well. It’s also great to see representatives from the Irish language community here today.“This council, earlier on this year under a dferent Mayor, launcheda five-year language strategy and we are now seeing the practical out-workings of that strategy including the appointment of the Irish Language Officer.“On behalf of myself and the other councils who have benefited from this scheme we thank Foras Na Gaeilge for this initiative.”Ms Wylie added: “Languages are something to be celebrated. Belfast has a close association with the Irish language, many of our place names are taken from Irish language whether it’s Béal Feirste, Bóthar na bhFál or Bóthar na Seanchille, Belfast heritage has got an enduring relationship with the Irish language going down centuries.“I think in many ways Irish speakers in Belfast were pioneers. Today we acknowledge the Irish language community here, in this city and across the north.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"festival frolics to cheer us up","story":"THE announcement by Teesie May on the eve of the Tory conference that there’s to be a Festival of GB and OWC in  has, not surprisingly, split the Pravince down the middle. On the one side are those who think that an orgy of union jack-waving to the strains of Land of Hope and Glory is an excellent idea on the other side are those with a titter of wit.Squinter can recall two similar Ulsterfests in his letime, both of them when he was a youngster. The most recent one was the queen’s  silver jubilee, when Britain vos celebratink der th anniversary von der coronation von Elizabeth Saxe-Coburg und Gotha. Loyal Ulster being loyal Ulster, it ended up cheering loudest and, West Belfast being West Belfast, we decided to celebrate the auspicious occasion with a non-stop summer of rioting as a result of which Squinter’s right arm remains sore to this day.The earlier one was the rather creepy and sinister ‘Ulster ’’ – a celebration of  years of partition that was held on land between Botanic Park and the Stranmillis Embankment. The idea was hatched in December  by Prime Minister Terence O’Neill: “In that yearNorthern Ireland will celebrate its th anniversary –  years of challenge and dficulty and occasional disappointment, but also  years of splendid achievement, of growing prosperity, of expanding opportunity.”By the summer of , though, when the gates opened to the public, Terry was out on his ear, having been done for by a combination of opposition by UUP hardliners to his limited programme of civil rights reforms and a series of UVF bomb attacks on Belfast’s water supply. He jacked it in in April  and in an interview a month later he revealed the depth of his passion for reform: “It is frightfully hard to explain to Protestants thatyou give Roman Catholics a good job and a good house they will live like Protestants because they will see neighbours with cars and television sets they will refuse to have eighteen children. Buta Roman Catholic is jobless and lives in the most ghastly hovel he will rear eighteen children on National Assistance. If you treat Roman Catholics with due consideration and kindness they will live like Protestants in spite of the authoritative nature of their Church.”Ulster ’ cracked on regardless, although the loss of a man so imbued with the spirit of egalitarianism must have been a crushing blow. An expectant public surged through the gates when the exhibition opened in May for a five month .Looking back at the photographic and filmic evidence that survives, it’s clear that the attractions on the site were, ah, modest, to say the least. Let’s see now… there was a big, multi-coloured plastic model of the Giant’s Causeway over the door of the main indoor space there was, um, a model of a Shorts plane hanging overhead there were fairground ridesthere was a disco with go-go girls a £m satellite was launched containing a message of peace from Ulster to any le forms who may happen across it. .By far the most exciting thing to happen during Ulster ’ was the introduction of internment, which wasn’t technically part of the show although doubtless it was wildly popular with a fair percentage of Ulster ’ attendees and organisers.The last bit of air went out of the balloon when it was finally decided that there would be no royal visit because the safety of the afore-mentioned Saxe-Coburg von Gothas could not be guaranteed.As for posterity, the BBC – normally an enthusiastic booster of Our Wee Country – reported in an article in : “The official government report did not describe it as a success and ultimately it is remembered as a bland effort in self-promotion for a state that was teetering on the brink of implosion.”Which brings us back to Gammonfest – sorry, the Festival of GB and THP. What’s that going to look like on this side of the Irish Sea border in four years time  Well, flags, of course – there’ll be plenty of those. But then there always is, so Ulster’s going to have to do a bit of thinking outside the box here. Marches – ditto. Bonfires – ditto. What about a festival, then  One with a funfair and the Giant’s Causeway and.. and.. never mind, you get the idea. We could call it Ulster ’. Or Catch . Which might make a bit more sense."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"johnnies havent missed the boat insists mcnulty","story":"ST JOHN’S and Cushendall lock horns again this Sunday at Ballycastle two weeks on from their thrilling drawn semi-final in Dunloy.Cushendall battled back from being five points down in the closing stages to take the lead following a late free from Neil McManus. Yet, Ciaran Johnston had the final say on proceedings to nail a free under intense pressure and in the face of a strong cross-field wind. As the underdogs, some may feel that St John’s had their chance the first day as favourites have a habit of winning replays. However, St John’s manager Tony McNulty sees it dferently and has urged his side to make to most of Sunday’s second chance to reach the county final. “We just took our foot of the pedal in the last few minutes. I said before the game that we had to play for  or  minutes and we only played for  minutes,” said McNulty. “We were four or five points ahead late on and we just switched off. “We switched off long enough for them to get their goal and it was nervous at the end. While we scored to draw the game, we felt we had done enough to win the game. “We’ll not be going into this match thinking we’ve missed the boat. “When Neil McManus hit that free I though “here we go again” – thankfully Ciaran Johnston stepped up and scored his free. We were disappointed having led not to hold on.“We can’t afford to switch off again – Cushendall are too good. When you have players like Neil McManus, Arron Graffin and Alex Delargy, we can’t afford to. I can’t see there being much in the game again this Sunday.” McNulty also gave his views on the worrying scenes which marred the end of the match when two Cushendall supporters jumped over the wire at Dunloy to confront the St John’s players in the dying minutes of the game. With such incidents in the spotlight in recent weeks, the intruders could have sparked a much more serious flashpoint, but order was soon restored. While McNulty condemned the actions of those involved, he feared the game might have been brought to a premature end with his side one point in arrears at the time. “There was a bit of carryon at the sideline which had nothing to do with us,” reflected McNulty “The ball was in among four or five Cushendall men and one of their players pulled on it.“He hit his own player and one of our players. It resulted in a bit of pushing – nothing serious. “Two of their supporters jumped over the wire. “I don’t know why, but they started throwing punches until the players got them off the pitch. “I was glad the referee continued the game and gave us the chance to equalise and thankfully the people were identied.” It is believed that the Cushendall player who was struck by his own teammate was Antrim ace Eoghan Campbell, who is likely to miss Sunday’s replay as a result of the hand injury sustained late in the drawn encounter. St John’s will also be without one of their leading players for the remainder of the campaign after attacker Donal Carson departed for Australia last week, but Simon McCrory is expected to be fit to play a greater role in the replay having played the second half in the drawn game. “Donalis away to Australia so that’s a big blow for us,” added McNulty. “I don’t know what happened, but there was something about the dates and he couldn’t get them changed. “It is unfortunate because he has been playing well for us. “In nearly every game, he has scored a goal for us. If Campbell is out for them, it evens things up a bit. “Simon McCrory should be good to go. He is a super player for us and he has been outstanding in every game he has played this year. He wasn’t right for the last game. All being well, the two-week break will do him good.” McNulty will also have the task of lting the dual players in the club following their semi-final football defeat at the hands of Creggan last Sunday. Senior finalists in , the Johnnies were edged out - to - by Kevin Madden’s men at Glenavy, but McNulty, whose son Ryan is a key member of both squads, doesn’t think the dual players will suffer any hangover from that defeat. “We are disappointed, but we have to hang in,” stated the Johnnies boss. “We didn’t play as well as we can do on Sunday, so we can have no complaints. “Things conspired against us on the day. Simon McDonagh’s we went into labour on Sunday morning so he was unavailable. Peter McCallin wasn’t back from holiday in time. “We had six or seven dual players in action on Sunday who will feature again this weekend. “They’ll lt themselves up alright. “It would have been great to going into the match trying to reach two senior finals, but we have to focus on Sunday’s game now.” With Division One winners and  champions Dunloy out following their surprise loss to Loughgiel, the remaining sides will all fancy their chances of lting the Volunteer Cup later this month.

We also cannot thank Ciaran Cunningham of Michael Brentnall Solicitors enough for his help with getting this disgraceful decision overturned.“Roisin still has a huge battle ahead of her but we believe this new treatment will be successful, her new treatment is very tough on her, Roisin’s cancer is a very fast growing cancer, her new treatment is making her very lethargic and it has nasty side effects but she is prepared, she knows what she is up against and she will continue to fight.”"},{"url":null,"title":"pressure mounts on theresa may as brexit summit looms","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

This week the authority of our constitution is on the line.”The issue of the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland is one of the last remaining obstacles to achieving a orce deal with Brussels, with wrangling continuing over the nature of a “backstop” to keep the frontier opena wider UK-EU trade arrangement cannot resolve it.The European Union’s version, which would see just Northern Ireland remain aligned with Brussels’ rules, has been called unacceptable by Mrs May and is loathed by the DUP.Mrs May’s counter-proposal is for a “temporary customs arrangement” for the whole UK, but Tory Brexiteers are suspicious this could turn into a permanent situation, restricting the freedom to strike trade deals around the world.The Sunday Times said at least nine ministers want Mrs May to change course when the Cabinet meets on Tuesday.Speculation about possible resignations has centred on Andrea Leadsom, Penny Mordaunt and Esther McVey, but the newspaper also indicated that Scottish Secretary David Mundell and Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson could quit because special arrangements for Northern Ireland could fuel the case for Scottish independence.Mrs May’s own position also appeared in jeopardy, with as many as  letters demanding a vote of no confidence reportedly submitted to the Conservative  Committee – just four short of the number required to trigger a ballot.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Arlene Foster has insisted the DUP is not playing a game over its opposition to the Brexit backstop plans The Northern Irish situation is politically problematic for Mrs May because her minority administration depends on the votes of the  DUP MPs.A leaked email reported in the Observer indicated Mrs Foster was ready to block a Brexit deal.According to a private email exchange between senior UK officials, seen by the newspaper, Mrs Foster gave her views during a dinner with the leader of Conservative MEPs, Ashley Fox.The leaked email said Mrs Foster described the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Mr Barnier as “dficult and hostile” and indicated “the DUP were ready for a no-deal scenario, which she now believed was the likeliest one”.Writing in the Belfaston Saturday, Mrs Foster said she appreciated the risks of a no-deal Brexit but “the dangers of a bad deal are worse”.She added: “The DUP’s actions this week are not as some have suggested about ‘flexing muscle’.“This is no game.“Anyone engaging in this in a light-hearted way foolishly fails to grasp the gravity of the decisions we will make in the coming weeks.”A further demonstration of Tory resistance to Mrs May’s plans came from MP Anne-Marie Trevelyan, who wrote in the Sundaythat “the idea of remaining in the customs union – even itis called a ‘temporary customs arrangement’ – after the end of the transition period, in to the s, means simply delaying Brexit and causing the . million people who voted for it to lose faith in our democracy”.Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the European Research Group of pro-Brexit MPs, warned that when it came to the backstop proposal “temporary means eternal”."},{"url":null,"title":"3k for northern ireland man told he was too old for","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

In his evidence, which the tribunal accepted, Mr Matier recalled that when he was giving his details to a man at the premises he was asked to state his age. When he replied that he was , he was told: \"I was looking for a younger person who I could train and move upstairs.\" Mr Matier askedthere was any point in continuing the conversation, and was told: \"No, not really.\"He said: \"I had been keen to get this job, and to be told I was too old to even apply for it really shook me. \"I had been off work for a while and I was trying to get back in to work. It was disheartening and it made me angry that my application could just be dismissed in this way because of my age.\"In its finding, the tribunal acknowledged that the incident \"had the effect of signicantly discouraging the claimant\". It added: \"This had been caused entirely by the behaviour of the respondent and this behaviour was motivated by age discrimination.\"Mr Matiers claim was supported by the Equality Commission.Mary Kitson, senior legal officer at the Equality Commission, said: \"This case is an important reminder to all employers not to make generalised assumptions about people on grounds such as age, which are protected by anti-discrimination law.\"It is unlawful under the Employment Equality Age Regulations of  for any employer to discriminate on grounds of age in the arrangements they make when offering employment.\"The tribunal in its finding noted that Mr Matier \"was, in effect, given no opportunity on the grounds of his age\". Ms Kitson added: \"That goes to the heart of the case and it quite rightly caused Mr Matier major disappointment at a time when he was attempting to re-enter the workplace in very trying circumstances.\"No employer should be making assumptions about a persons ability, or suitability for training and promotion, because of their age.\"Spring  AirbrakeLtd said it was \"extremely disappointed\" with the decision and will be applying to have it reviewed.It said: \"This decision sets a very dangerous precedent for any employer defending claims of discrimination, in that the tribunal determined that the claimant was discriminated against, despite ascertaining that the evidence of the claimant was a little imprecise and vague.\"On behalf of the respondents, we will be applying to have this decision formally reviewed.\"We also intend writing to the Department for Communities seeking a review of their recruitment services. \"The respondent followed the approved process for advertising their vacancy with the Jobs and Benefits Office and strictly adhered to the procedure.\"The company said the absence of an employment appeal tribunal led to an \"imbalance\".It added: \"Should a review fail to address the shortcomings of this decision, the only avenue open to the respondent is to refer the matter to the Court of Appeal, which for any company is extremely prohibitive financially.\""},{"url":null,"title":"arlene foster eu spin on offer suggested ni would have best of both worlds that was a lie we would not","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

We had a series of meetings arranged with representatives of the EU as well as the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier. .pushIt was in that meeting with Michel Barnier and his team that we received a very clear outline of the type of post-Brexit arrangement the EU envisioned for Northern Ireland.The deal on offer was certainly unique but as the first State to leave the EU club, any deal will be unique. The EU spin on this offer suggested that Northern Ireland would have the best of both worlds ­— ie we would have full access to the EU single market and full access to the UK single market. That was a lie. We would not.Under the EU’s plan, Great Britain-based businesses would have a barrier when they would seek to trade with Northern Ireland. Such a barrier cuts right to the heart of what is at stake here. The United Kingdom is one nation. There should not be international-style borders within it.I am a unionist. I became involved in politics to build a better Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom. Back in June , when we agreed a confidence-and-supply arrangement with the Conservative Party, central to it was helping Northern Ireland financially but also the entire United Kingdom. I want every part of the United Kingdom to prosper.I would not tolerate a trade barrier between England and Wales any more than I would tolerate one between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The dangers to the Union and our single market were clearly demonstrated by how quickly the SNP demanded the same for Scotland as was offered to Northern Ireland.  Countries like the United Kingdom have some regional iations but what is held in common is what is fundamental to make their national markets work. We may pay lower rates here than council tax in England. Dferent states in the USA would be the same. However, what is made in each part can be sold within those countries without extra barriers.Indeed, unionists who voted Remain have contacted me to express their vehement opposition to any deal which would limit Northern Ireland’s access to the United Kingdom single market.However, it would be wrong to think that the DUP are the only people in Parliament who see the EU’s proposal as unacceptable. ‘No sea border’ has support across the House of Commons.  I believe that the Prime Minister is in her own beliefs a committed unionist. However, she should learn from her previous female predecessor, Margaret Thatcher. Despite her unionist convictions, others persuaded Thatcher to sign the Anglo-Irish Agreement. She later deeply regretted the choice she had made. However, we do not want nor need the regrets of another Prime Minister. We want the right choices made. We want her to stand by her principles and instincts rather than accepting a dodgy deal foisted on her by others.  I fully appreciate the risks of a ‘no deal’ but the dangers of a bad deal are worse. If true to her principles Mrs May would not and should not choose the path to effectively cut Northern Ireland adrt.  The DUP’s actions this week are not as some have suggested about ‘flexing muscle’. This is no game.  Anyone engaging in this in a light-hearted way foolishly fails to grasp the gravity of the decisions we will make in the coming weeks.  Over time the gap between UK regulations and EU regulations would only grow. With double red tape for businesses, such an arrangement would add costs for businesses and consumers.This backstop arrangement would not be temporary. It would be the permanent annexation of Northern Ireland away from the rest of the United Kingdom and forever leave us subject to rules made in a place where we have no say.  The coming days, weeks and months will be critical. The decisions taken will shape the type of Northern Ireland that our grandchildren will live in.The DUP will have teams in London, Brussels and Belfast meeting key influencers to ensure our position is fully understood and upheld.On Monday, I will travel to Dublin for a range of meetings. We want a deal which respects Northern Ireland’s constitutional position but one that also works for our nearest neighbours in the Republic of Ireland.  Yesterday when we met our MPs and MLAs collectively, people were united behind our plan and united in standing firm not just for Northern Ireland but for the Union. I reminded people that the stand we are taking is not about the party, this is about the Union and the shape of the United Kingdom for the future."},{"url":null,"title":"ashers photographers booked for gay cake case refuse to hand over images","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

This week the authority of our constitution is on the line.”The issue of the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland is one of the last remaining obstacles to achieving a orce deal with Brussels, with wrangling continuing over the nature of a “backstop” to keep the frontier opena wider UK-EU trade arrangement cannot resolve it.The European Union’s version, which would see just Northern Ireland remain aligned with Brussels’ rules, has been called unacceptable by Mrs May and is loathed by the DUP.Mrs May’s counter-proposal is for a “temporary customs arrangement” for the whole UK, but Tory Brexiteers are suspicious this could turn into a permanent situation, restricting the freedom to strike trade deals around the world.The Sunday Times said at least nine ministers want Mrs May to change course when the Cabinet meets on Tuesday.Speculation about possible resignations has centred on Andrea Leadsom, Penny Mordaunt and Esther McVey, but the newspaper also indicated that Scottish Secretary David Mundell and Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson could quit because special arrangements for Northern Ireland could fuel the case for Scottish independence.Mrs May’s own position also appeared in jeopardy, with as many as  letters demanding a vote of no confidence reportedly submitted to the Conservative  Committee – just four short of the number required to trigger a ballot.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Arlene Foster has insisted the DUP is not playing a game over its opposition to the Brexit backstop plans The Northern Irish situation is politically problematic for Mrs May because her minority administration depends on the votes of the  DUP MPs.A leaked email reported in the Observer indicated Mrs Foster was ready to block a Brexit deal.According to a private email exchange between senior UK officials, seen by the newspaper, Mrs Foster gave her views during a dinner with the leader of Conservative MEPs, Ashley Fox.The leaked email said Mrs Foster described the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Mr Barnier as “dficult and hostile” and indicated “the DUP were ready for a no-deal scenario, which she now believed was the likeliest one”.Writing in the Belfaston Saturday, Mrs Foster said she appreciated the risks of a no-deal Brexit but “the dangers of a bad deal are worse”.She added: “The DUP’s actions this week are not as some have suggested about ‘flexing muscle’.“This is no game.“Anyone engaging in this in a light-hearted way foolishly fails to grasp the gravity of the decisions we will make in the coming weeks.”A further demonstration of Tory resistance to Mrs May’s plans came from MP Anne-Marie Trevelyan, who wrote in the Sundaythat “the idea of remaining in the customs union – even itis called a ‘temporary customs arrangement’ – after the end of the transition period, in to the s, means simply delaying Brexit and causing the . million people who voted for it to lose faith in our democracy”.Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the European Research Group of pro-Brexit MPs, warned that when it came to the backstop proposal “temporary means eternal”.In a letter to Chancellor Philip Hammond,  Tory MPs challenged him to release the full details of the cross-Whitehall Brexit analysis which forecast GDP growth would be . percentage points lower over  yearsthere was a “no-deal” exit on World Trade Organisation rules.Former minister Steve Baker said: “After several rounds of Project Fear, the reputation of government economic analysis is rock bottom. It’s therefore time to reveal Government’s full working out for close scrutiny in the public interest."},{"url":null,"title":"richard bruton named as replacement after denis naughtens shock resignation","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

He wants to explicitly permit the existence of Japan’s military.Opponents say such a revision is not necessary because the defence force is widely recognised in and outside the country as Japan’s military and its constitutionality is no longer an issue.Mr Abe’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party has continuously expanded the force’s international role by loosening interpretations of Article . In , his government passed a defence law allowing Japanese troops to defend US and other allies in case of foreign attack, a fundamental change from its self-defence only policy.Two-thirds approval is needed in both houses to propose a revision, which would then be subject to a national referendum.

Bredagh had other ideas and points from the towering Niall McFarland and Joe Hanrahan suddenly had their side in front.Gerard Quinn fired over the equalising score in the fth minute, but it was all down hill after this for Ballycran as they were put under the cosh by a blistering Bredagh attack.Unanswered points from Hanrahan, Sean Hughes and the fleet-footed Ronan Costello had Bredagh - to - in front after  minutes. It got an awful lot worse for a wasteful Ballycran when Hughes drilled the sliotar to the back of the net after a defence-splitting run from Matt McAreavey.Costelloand Hughes rubbed salt into Ballycranrsquos wounds as gave Bredagh a commanding - to - lead by the nd minute.Ballycran were then thrown a leline when Stuart Martin ended a piercing run with a clinical finish to leave seven points in it with seven minutes of the half remaining.Alas, Ballycran were unable to push on from here and Bredagh punished them on the break with points from Costelloand Hughes to take a - to - lead as the break approached.Martin and McFarland swapped points before Ballycranrsquos task got even harder when star midfielder Phelim Savage, who was part of the clubrsquos senior team who lted the SHC title in Ballygalet last Sunday, was harshly red-carded leaving his side to play the entire second half with only  men.It all could have been so dferent for Ballycran at the end of the first half. They shot seven wides, had a strong penalty appeal turned down and arasping shot from Gerard Quinn rattled against the crossbar and flew to safety.An early point at the start of the second half from Ballycranrsquos Francis Caldwell was cancelled out by Hughes before Martin and P J Lavery did likewise. Costello edged Bredagh into a - to - lead after  minutes, but a battling Ballycran took the next three points from Francis Caldwelland Liam McCarthy.Bredagh halted Ballycranrsquos momentum with a point from Hughes before McCarthy cancelled his score out with another free.Costello and Joe Blaney extended Bredaghrsquos lead to  points before Caldwell kept Ballycran ticking over with a point from play as his team-mates went for goal.Three Costello points in quick succession had Bredagh in wonderland before Caldwell converted a free in the th minute to make it a - to - game. Naturally, Ballycran continued to go for goals, but Bredagh were not for conceding anything and late points from Costello and Jacob McDonnell gave then a resounding win.Bredagh: Odhran Davies, Aaron Patterson, Tiarnan Sheehan, Evin Maguire, Aodhan OrsquoKeefe, Niall McFarland , Liam Hogan, Matt McAreavey, Joe Hanrahan , Dara Curran, Sean Hughes , Joe Blaney , Ciaran McMullan, Ronan Costello , Enda Gargan.

Last Wednesday nightrsquos attack on St Patrickrsquos Primary School has been equally disturbing to police, who feel that a new wave of criminology seems to be underway.This time they witnessed the destruction of the schoolrsquos tuck shop which had just been stocked up with almost pound worth of stock. Everything was scattered round the hall and even on to the adjoining football field. Fire extinguishers were turned on and directed at tape recorders, which were destroyed.Police are treating the crime seriously and have appealed to for any information to help them in their inquiries. Fingerprints have been taken.This latest wave of school destruction is already being regarded as monstrous in terms of the community. No-one, it seems, saw anything, but this could be indicative of the public turning their back, lest they should suffer recriminations.Brother Otteran, headmaster at St Patrickrsquos, was abhorred at the destruction. He permitted a Down Recorder photographer to visit the scene and had no objections to the crime being publicised.HOLLYWOOD mdash The widely-held belief that Hollywood actress Greer Garson was born and bred in Down District has been scotched.

It is turning into death-trap with dficult turning circles that intrude on pedestrians and oncoming traffic, she explained.ldquoThe meeting with roads officials took place at .am so they were able to see the situation for themselves with everybody having to demonstrate nimble footwork, ing out of the way of oncoming traffic.Cllr Enright said the pavement currently ran only half way up Racecourse Hill and the road was not wide enough for two-way traffic.ldquoRoads officials have agreed to a one-way system which will allow vehicles to drive down the hill when a new pavement is in place. Traffic calming measures will also be provided to ensure vehicles do not race down the hill.

It is for this reason I am delighted with the recent decision of Newry, Mourne and Down Council to endorse and back my call for a peoplersquos vote on Brexit.Across the UK, more and more people are asking for this vote to have the opportunity to pass their final judgement on what will define us for generations to come. Brexit will affect everyone and we should be looking at the detail and allowing everyone the right to have their say.This is not only a moment for those of us who voted to remain, but also the growing number of people who voted to leave and now see the ramications of Brexit will be so widespread.Northern Ireland only works when based on sharing and interdependence, yet Brexit entails new isions, barriers and friction. We can stop those isions by supporting political stability and protecting the Good Friday Agreement, maintaining open borders throughout these islands and protecting our economy and enabling future opportunities.This is not about overturning democracy. Indeed, nothing is more democratic than allowing people to have their say. Democracy cannot be overturned by applying more democracy.Rather than answering a question, more questions can often emerge at the result of an election. This is the case with the EU Referendum of . Since the end of the Second World War, we have had four sets of general elections which have occurred within two years of each other. I doubt anyone would argue these elections occurring in any way subverted the democratic process.We are witnessing almost daily the complexities of interdependence, which we benefit from, that have developed between member nations of the EU. These complexities were brushed aside by many of the leave side as unnecessary and easy to re-establish on better terms. Yet, with six months to go, these same leavers have not managed to propose anything which has come close to a pragmatic workable solution. For these leavers to now claim to speak on behalf of the lsquowill of the peoplersquo is a hood.This leads to bad politics and bad democracy through containing the lsquowill of the peoplersquo to a one-time snapshot within history. This precludes the people from quite simply changing their mind. Just as a healthy democracy requires constant checks and restraints placed upon the government of the day, departure from the EU should require the continuing consent of the people.We are without an Executive, and thus without a voice, in what is the most tumultuous constitutional period in generations. Our preparation for leaving the EU is based upon a two-page letter written over two years ago and being carried out by civil servants.This is a complete abdication of responsibility and the duty of governance by those elected to lead this society. Instead, our politicians have retreated into the safe confines of their own ideology, rather than search for a consensus which is best for the country.It is time for the people to take back control. What we have seen is an abject failure of politicians to lead in the face of this crisis. Instead, they have retreated into the confines of their own ideology rather than search for a consensus within the country. That extends not only from Westminster, but also closer to home.Only a peoplersquos vote can begin the untying of this Gordian knot.bull The South Down Alliance Party is organising a Brexit  discussion in the Newcastle Centre on Thursday, October , between pm and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Response times not what we wish%2C says ambulance chief  ","story":"NORTHERN Irelandrsquos most senior ambulance official has conceded that the local community has not been receiving the emergency response that it deserves.The admission from Ambulance Service chief executive Michael Bloomfield came during a public meeting in Downpatrick on Monday night organised by the Down Community Health Committee.However, Mr Bloomfield hopes the service will improve when proposed changes to how the organisation responds to calls are implemented.A review of current despatch procedures has resulted in the development of proposals mdash currently out to public consultation ndash which aim to provide the most immediate and appropriate clinical response to the most seriously ill or injured.Mr Bloomfield insisted the proposed changes to the way all calls are categorised were not a cost cutting exercise and nothing to do with achieving targets. He said the main thrust was to provide a safer, quality service.The chief executive revealed that implementing the new model will require the recruitment of an additional  frontline ambulance staff over the next three to five years and cost in the region of poundm.ldquoOur firm view is that the proposed changes will provide a better quality and safer service and go a long way to meeting the challenge in providing an effective response times to communities such as the one in this area which has not been getting the sort of response that we would wish, said Mr Bloomfield, who viewed Mondayrsquos meeting as the first in a series as part of the organisationrsquos consultation on how it aims to improve services for patients.He continued: ldquoResponse times in this area are challenging, but not particularly dferent to other areas. I have been so impressed at the commitment, dedication and professionalism of our staff to provide the high quality of response that they do in all communities. Without doubt, we only have the quality service we currently have as a result of the huge efforts staff go to.ldquoI have met staff in Downpatrick and Ballynahinch and the efforts and dedication staff go to to provide the best response they can is humbling and I am proud to lead the organisation, but it is not sustainable. The level of effort that staff are required to put in on a constant basis is not reasonable and not fair to continue to expect it.Mr Bloomfield said that while ambulance staff always put the needs of the public first, that level of effort and commitment on an ongoing basis against a rising demand was ldquosimply not sustainable.He said the organisation received around , calls a year, equating to a  per cent increase on the number since  . Mr Bloomfield said the huge increase was ldquoway above what was typical in any other service and while the number of calls had increased, the organisationrsquos resources had remained relatively static.Turning to ambulance response times, Mr Bloomfield said a government target required the organisation to respond to .% of le threatening calls within eight minutes. He explained that while this was achieved in   when the rate was actually .%, that has reduced over the years.In the last financial year, the Ambulance Service responded to % of le threatening calls within eight minutes, with the figures for East Down just % with patients waiting up to  minutes for an emergency ambulance. Mr Bloomfield conceded this was ldquoclearly much more than the eight minute target.The chief executive said the organisation was proposing a new way of categorising and prioritising calls.Currently, calls that come through are categorised as immediately le threatening that require an eight minute response, based on a model which has been in place since , he excplained.ldquoThere have been no changes since and we are trying to respond to % of all the calls we receive in eight minutes. What staff tell us is that when they go to many of those calls that have been categorised as immediately le threatening, they discover they are not and many may not even be urgent, Mr Bloomfield continued.ldquoResearch also suggests that closer to seven per cent of all calls are truly le threatening where time is so important that we need to get there quickly.The chief executive said the organisation wanted to introduce a more sophisticated way of answering calls by talking a little bit longer to ask more questions about the patientrsquos condition to be able to more accurately determine what is their real need.Mr Bloomfield said this will allow the organisation to make sure people who require a response within eight minutes are dealt with appropriately.He said the proposed changes were about assessing a patientrsquos needs more accurately, based on their clinical indication and despatching the right vehicle.The chief executive also pointed to frustration at turnaround times for ambulance crews when they transfer patients to hospitals outside the district, particularly to the Ulster in Dundonald. He said crews ldquodid not want to be standing around AE departments waiting they want to be out providing care to patients.He added: ldquoI can understand there may be a view that the proposals are about changing the way calls are categorised in order to change targets or, even worse, that this may be seen as some sort of cost cutting measure.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When was the last time he visited or was here on the th July  Likewise, the unprecedented crisis schools are facing here cannot be fixed with merely encouraging pupils to ‘try harder.’”Speaking on yesterday’s BBC Talkback programme, Irish News columnist Brian Feeney said Mr Hepburn knows “nothing whatsoever about this place,” and added: “I think the less the Orange Order has to do with educating young people the better. It’s just a silly suggestion and no one is going to take it seriously.”Rev Gibson said one of his main goals since joining the institution has been “raising the culture of education and raising the value of education,” He added: “We are already involved in education. We have a full-time education officer, we have schools visit our museums quite regularly from all sectors and we engage with them. Everybody in their own community has a role in raising educational attainment, but I think the Orange Order has a particular role within the Protestant community to do this.”Hillary Clinton tells Northern Ireland parties to put their quarrels aside Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

internal opponents that she will not be walking away from theDUP leadership after a series of criticisms of the party emerged at an unusually forthright meeting of the DUP executive in Omagh last week.Over recent weeks there have been rumours of a potential challenge to Mrs Foster before the party’s annual conference at the end of next month.Power within the party has shted from Stormont – where Mrs Foster has now not been firstminister for almost two years – to Westminster, while the tide of revelations from the RHI Inquiry have exposed problem after problem in how theparty has been run.But Mrs Foster’s stance at the meeting last Thursday night suggests that there is scant chance of her deciding to vacate her position voluntarily and her internal critics will have to launch a formal challenge – something which has never happened in the history of the DUP –she is to be removed.The News Letter understands that during the meeting, which lasted for about two hours and involved about  people, Mrs Foster and the wider party leadership faced criticism on at least three fronts – the revelations about the party’s role in the RHI scandal, the issue of Spads and her attendance at a GAA match.Many of those who spoke out at the meeting were councillors, a group of people particularly concerned about the public perception of the party because they face the electorate next May.One DUP member who was at the meeting told this newspaper that Mrs Foster had set out how she planned to make changes to respond to some of the unhappiness and that those who spoke in support of, or opposition to, her were “usual suspects” on either side, rather than a sudden sht in people’s positions.Another inidual said that the meeting had involved “a lot of grumbling” while another described it as “very acrimonious”.He said that Lord Morrow, who was chairing the meeting, “tried to close down the debate” about RHI but was unable to due to the strength of feeling in the room.He described the meeting – which began with prayer and a scriptural exhortation – as “brutal” and said that there was loud applause for criticisms of the party.However, he said that Mrs Foster had made her intentions clear, with words to the effect of “I’ll be going nowhere”.There were also indications of what are now clearly delineated internal fault lines.At one point North Antrim councillor John Finlay complained about the handling of the RHI scandal, prompting a sharp rebuke from where in the room, with someone calling out that he was in no position to talk, given the scandal surrounding North Antrim MP Ian Paisley Jr, in whose defence Mr Finlay has publicly spoken.Scrap the Irish border backstop, Boris Johnson urges prime minister in News Letter articleMan and woman killed in A crash Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"One of those present said that Foster had been was “pretty defiant the whole way through” but that the meeting had been unusually uncomfortable.However, another member said that although the meeting had involved plain speaking, the fact that it had been held in a way that allowed an open internal debate about issues which are clearly concerning party members was a positive and a sign of change from the days of Peter Robinson’s leadership.He said: “We now have more frequent party executives – the executive was pretty much forgotten about under Peter. “The reason this [the blunt criticism] could happen is because Arlene is willing to have debate.“A lot of the stuff about RHI is about how Peter wanted the world to work and Arlene Foster is being pilloried for the way that the party operated under Peter.”Among those to speak in defence

It seems London is about to accede to the demand that Dublin laid out so explicitly thenBen LowryEmail Published::Saturday  October Share this article window.onload  .sharetool \"m.\" index  .indexOf \"ContentId\" pointIndex  .indexOf articleID  .substringSign Up To Our Daily Newsletter ipaddress.getJSON .keypress.focus.on email  .val.ajax\",source_url: location.href,source_website_category: \"Columnists\", \"text\".done .removeAttr  .html  .html.valTo get a sense of how serious events are for Northern Ireland, you only need to look at the top of this page .Sammy Wilson’s quote  is taken from an article that appeared in the News Letter this week, in which he made clear that the DUP was not bluffing in its preparedness to block a border in the Irish Sea.The tweet, top right , from Nick Boles MP, reveals the thinking of a pro BrexitTory in response to any perceived threat from the DUP to the Conservative Party Needless to say, this is not a good position for unionism to be in.For days there has been increasing speculation that the government is going to agree some sort of regulatory border in the Irish Sea, regardless of what the DUP thinks.It will also agree to the whole UK staying in the customs union.To understand how we have ended up in this extraordinary position, you need to go back not merely to the December ‘backstop’ on the Irish border, but a bit before it — to when the Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney spoke to an SDLP breakfast in Belfast on November . What he said there gave a chillingdescription of how uncompromising Dublin was going to be on the land border.It is worth quoting at , because everything he vowed has so far held true, and so his comments are set out in the  below.If you read Mr Coveney’s comments, one thing becomes clear. The Irish government is not accepting regulatory or customs ergence at the land border, full stop.The backstop, agreed weeks later, gave Dublin comfort on that point .So this is not, repeat not, just about checks, as Mr Coveney made clear in his comments last year.Eventhere was wide acceptance of a technological solution to the land border and evenchecks were carried out in farmyards in Bangor or Ballyclare or Bushmills, to spare the sensitivities of nationalists who live in border areas, Dublin would not accept it.Claims of anti Catholic bias by the old Stormont regime are hugely exaggerated Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"That means that as far as the Irish government is concerned, Northern Ireland must always be in the EU custom and regulatory zone. You could even say that this whole saga has shown Irish acceptance of the principle of consent to be conditional .Now plenty of unionists reading all of the above, and Mr Coveney’s comments below, might think: fine, Ireland can think or say whatever it wants with regard to Northern Ireland, but that doesn’t mean it will get its way.That is all very wellyou have a British government that agrees. But it has become gradually apparent that we might not have such.Because, it seems, London is about to accede to the demand that Dublin laid out so explicitly last year. It is reported to be seeking a solution in which the whole UK stays in the customs union and NI stays in the single market until another deal can be struck . That ensures that the Irish demand is fully met, of no land border ergence, and the British vow to have no border in the Irish Sea is only partially met .It is a remarkable outcome, but it is also one that has been staring us in the face for months.Perhaps it won’t happen.Perhaps Downing Street will retreat. Perhaps Boris Johnson will prevail . Perhaps there will be no deal. Perhaps the UK will decide not to leave the EU.But it is looking like it might happen. A well informed source told me this week that London had already decided to face down the DUP on this — as it did with the second version of the backstop in December . EvenBrexiteers take charge and a Canada style free trade deal comes close to clearing parliament and the EU says no to Northern Ireland being part of it , the Brexiteers will have to be willing to stand up to that. Will they, or will they cut us adrt for a deal Unionism is in a very bad way: on legacy , on competence issues , on Brexit, on friendship .Dire events might force some sort of unionist unity on it quite soon.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editorSimon Coveney’s  comments below:Last November, Simon Coveney spoke to the SDLP about how the border had changed over  years. He said: “ ... that painful journey that many of you have been involved in, the success of it essentially has been largely invisible ... It is a seamless relationship, livestock moves around, product moves around, people move around. And I, for one, am not going to be part of an Irish government that allows that progress to be reversed. And I will make that promise here, just like I will make it in Dublin and I will make it in Cork. “Anybody who thinks that we see this issue purely in trade terms, in terms of trade numbers, fundamentally misunderstands the depth of feeling in the context of the politics of the border and of course the politics of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement... And so what we have insisted upon, which seems to have raised the hackles of some, is a language which now says that it seems essential for us that the UK commit to ensuring that a hard border on the island of Ireland can be avoided by ensuring no emergence of regulatory ergence in those rules of the internal market and the customs union which are, and in our view will be in the future, necessary for meaningful north south cooperation, the all island economy and the protection of the GFA. “That is the language of the EU task force that we have absolute solidarity on in relation to this and that is now why are in an awkward impasse,the truth be told ... If you have a dferent rule-book by which business operates in Northern Ireland versus Ireland, there is no way of avoiding border checks. That is the reality, whether those border checks happen on the border, or in business premises or in farmyards is a dferent issue, but as far as I am concerned that is all border infrastructure preventing free movement, preventing trade, undermining the relationships that have been built up over the last  years, and it’s about building barriers rather than bridges on this island and we won’t stand for it.”Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy  Cookies Policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.8668165.1539471739!/image/image.jpg","title":"politics","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to Johnston Press# Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+  Politics   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Politics Legacy Scandal RHI News Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Politics       chief commissioner, above centre, at court for anNIHRC case that NI abortion law is incompatible with human rights.

After the ruling, Ashers’ general manager, Daniel McArthur and his we Amy spoke to The Christian Institute, which has backed them throughout the long-running case.In the interview they admit that the y and highly public nature of the case has taken its toll. But recognising the importance of the case for others, the family kept going.Daniel said: “People ask you ‘was it worth it, going through all this ’ and I answer them ‘absolutely yes’.”“To get a unanimous decision, that we were in the right all along, that we hadn’t discriminated, was an amazing result and glory to God for it.”“We’ve had letters from nearly every continent in the world. We’ve had emails constantly coming in and we’ve had hundreds of customers come into our shops and telling us that they’re there because they support us in the stand we’re taking.”Amy said: “A lot has changed for us over the last four and a half years, we’ve had three new additions to the family, so le has definitely got busier. But God has been good and brought us through the challenges that have come with the court case.”Mr McArthur concluded: “This all started over four years ago and we find ourselves here at the very end of it and it’s only by God’s goodness and grace that we are here and we give all the glory to Him.”The Christian Institute’s deputy director for Staff and Communications, Ciarán Kelly, said: “One of our most important jobs is to help protect Christians’ religious freedom by creating signicant national precedents.“We count it a privilege to have been able to do this alongside such a gracious and dignied family.” chief commissioner, above centre, at court for anNIHRC case that NI abortion law is incompatible with human rights.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

As well as being a memorable occasion for the Accelerators, we believe it is important to help MPs understand the vital role that our company and the wider pub and bar industry play in offering, not just jobs, but worthwhile progressive careers, with arguably the best opportunity out of any industry to go from the bottom rung right to the very top. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Initially under the baton of Clford Bunford and later conducted by Douglas Baxter, the choir performed many of the major works of the choral repertoire and several less well known works. Following Douglas retirement in , the choir began to suffer a decline in numbers, which led to a ersying of the repertoire.The choir was rebranded as Barry Community Choir in  and, under the leadership of conductor, Emma Arscott, the membership has begun to increase again.The choir meets in Crossway Church in Barry on Wednesday evenings and all are welcome to join.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This week the authority of our constitution is on the line.The issue of the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland is one of the last remaining obstacles to achieving a orce deal with Brussels, with wrangling continuing over the nature of a ldquobackstop to keep the frontier opena wider UK-EU trade arrangement cannot resolve it.The European Unionrsquos version, which would see just Northern Ireland remain aligned with Brusselsrsquo rules, has been called unacceptable by Mrs May and is loathed by the DUP.Mrs Mayrsquos counter-proposal is for aldquotemporary customs arrangement for the whole UK, but Tory Brexiteers are suspicious this could turn into a permanent situation, restricting the freedom to strike trade deals around the world.The Sunday Times said at least nine ministers want Mrs May to change course when the Cabinet meets on Tuesday.Speculation about possible resignations has centred on Andrea Leadsom, Penny Mordaunt and Esther McVey, but the newspaper also indicated that Scottish Secretary David Mundell and Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson could quit because special arrangements for Northern Ireland could fuel the case for Scottish independence.Mrs Mayrsquos own position also appeared in jeopardy, with as many as  letters demanding a vote of no confidence reportedly submitted to the Conservative  Committee ndash just four short of the number required to trigger a ballot. \"Arlene Foster has insisted the DUP is not playing a game over its opposition to the Brexit backstop plans The Northern Irish situation is politically problematic for Mrs May because her minority administration depends on the votes of the  DUP MPs.A leaked email reported in the Observer indicated Mrs Foster was ready to block a Brexit deal.According to a private email exchange between senior UK officials, seen by the newspaper, Mrs Foster gave her views during a dinner with the leader of Conservative MEPs, Ashley Fox.The leaked email said Mrs Foster described the EUrsquos chief Brexit negotiator Mr Barnier as ldquodficult and hostile and indicated ldquothe DUP were ready for a no-deal scenario, which she now believed was the likeliest one.Writing in the Belfaston Saturday, Mrs Foster said she appreciated the risks of a no-deal Brexit but ldquothe dangers of a bad deal are worse.She added: ldquoThe DUPrsquos actions this week are not as some have suggested about lsquoflexing musclersquo.ldquoThis is no game.ldquoAnyone engaging in this in a light-hearted way foolishly fails to grasp the gravity of the decisions we will make in the coming weeks.A further demonstration of Tory resistance to Mrs Mayrsquos plans came from MP Anne-Marie Trevelyan, who wrote in the Sundaythat ldquothe idea of remaining in the customs union ndash even itis called a lsquotemporary customs arrangementrsquo ndash after the end of the transition period, in to the s, means simply delaying Brexit and causing the . million people who voted for it to lose faith in our democracy.Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the European Research Group of pro-Brexit MPs, warned that when it came to the backstop proposal ldquotemporary means eternal.In a letter to Chancellor Philip Hammond,  Tory MPs challenged him to release the full details of the cross-Whitehall Brexit analysis which forecast GDP growth would be . percentage points lower over  yearsthere was a ldquono-deal exit on World Trade Organisation rules.Former minister Steve Baker said:ldquoAfter several rounds of Project Fear, the reputation of government economic analysis is rock bottom.

show starring Rowan Atkinson as the anti-hero Edmund Blackadder and Sir Tony Robinson as his hapless servant Baldrick was cult viewing in the s.Also featuring were Hugh Laurie, Tim McInnerny, Stephen Fry and the late Rik Mayall with Ben Elton co-writing many of the episodes..\"The final series, Blackadder Goes Forth, starred Rowan Atkinson as Captain Edmund Blackadder and Sir Tony Robinson as Private Baldrick The four series were each set in a dferent period of English history, covering the Middle Ages, Elizabethan England, the Georgian era and the First World War.Over the years there have been many people who wanted to see another series made with Blackadder set in modern times.Only last month, Sir Tony said he thought a fth series could be made, despite the original cast having very busy schedules.And last year Atkinson spoke of how  years ago there was an idea for a series set during the Russian Revolution, called Redadder, but plans went ldquonowhere.But Curtis, who went on to write blockbuster films Four Weddings And A Funeral, Love Actually, Notting Hill and Bridget Jonesrsquos Diary, scotched chances of a Blackadder revival.Blackadder writer Richard Curtis has dashed hopes of a new series of the show being made ldquoBlackadder is a very, very complicated group of people and soyou are fond enough of the series to wish that the people involved in it should live to a ripe old age then I think it is best that we donrsquot work together, thatrsquos the answer, Curtis said.The screenwriter was speaking during an event at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, in which he was interviewed by his daughter Scarlett, who revealed her mother, Emma Freud, has never watched an episode of Blackadder.Curtis explained how he and Atkinson, who himself has gone on to have global success with Mr Bean and Johnny English, dreamt up Blackadder.ldquoBlackadder was in a funny way written out of fear, Curtis said.ldquoSomeone called John Cleese had written a show called Fawlty Towers and when Rowan and I tried to write a modern situation comedy we just knew it was rubbish in comparison to that.ldquoSo we decided to write about history and it really came from two sources, one of which was a series of books called the Ladybird Book of History and the other was the plays of Shakespeare because they were also stupid and people also wore stupid costumes.Curtis added: ldquoI am sorry about the bad episodes they were all written by a guy called Ben Elton.He also gave some tips about his techniques for writing, saying that many wannabe writers give up too early.ldquoThe dference between me and a writer who doesnrsquot go on writing is that I write % good a day and I think that has been a fantastic day and many people give up writing because they write for a day and they have got % of rubbish, he said.ldquoI did once work out I had written , pages to reach Notting Hill which was a -page script.ldquoI think keeping faith and noticing whatrsquos good and I think the edits of movies are unbelievably rigorous and necessary and a few of my films have been not what I dreamed but they were finished.ldquoThe most interesting was Bridget which didnrsquot work at all until we moved the penultimate scene, which was her in absolute despair in her bedroom dressed in red pyjamas drinking and crying, to the title sequence of the movie, which meant you actually felt for Bridget right from the start, which in our original cut you just didnrsquot.ldquoThere are miraculous things that can happen in the edit.ldquoLove Actually is a bad example because it didnrsquot work at all when we finished it and the one where the finished product was at least like the script I wrote and in fact we had to delay the moviersquos release by three months to just

A company linked to Newry man Brian McConville, who runs the successful MJM Group, has submitted plans for the extension and refurbishment of  –  Donegall Square East. The works include a new extension, with plans for commercial use at the basement, ground floor and four floors, and office accommodation on the first to third, fth and sixth. A design statement from architects Hamilton says the design intention is “to remove any unsympathetic additions and alterations within the listed buildings, retain the original plan form of the buildings, and conserve all extant historic features”. That includes ornate cornices, ceiling roses and moulded timbers “all of which survive in relatively good condition throughout the building”. The design document says the “new work within the historic structure will follow conservation principles of maximum retention of historic fabric, minimum intervention, reversibility, honest, clarity and sustainability”. Brian McConville’s MJM Group is one of Northern Ireland’s fastest growing companies. MJM Marine is MJM Group’s main business, based in Newry, and headed by founder Brian McConville. It was set up in  by Mr McConville, and carries out work for many of the world’s top cruise liners, including Star Cruises. The fit-out specialist is seldom out of the headlines, whether it’s landed new contracts or winning awards.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Premier.jpg","title":"premier inn looking at two new ni hotels","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by John Mulgrew Premier Inn is eyeing up opening new hotels in Newry and Enniskillen as it seeks to expand across Northern Ireland, Ulster Business can reveal.The hotel chain, which has seven hotels here, is seeking developer opportunities in the two new locations, alongside growth in Dublin.The company, owned by Whitbread, has said it secured  new hotels in the UK during the last financial year, and has the same aspirations this year.It also says it is looking for “property partners and freehold development sites in Dublin and other major cities” as it seeks to grow Premier Inn across Ireland.Meanwhile, a new report from PwC says hotel prices in Belfast are rising five times faster than the UK average.In June , the average cost of an overnight stay in Belfast was £. but has now grown to £..Belfast is now the fourth most expensive city to stay in the UK, outside London.PwC Northern Ireland partner, Martin Cowie, said: “The influx of high-quality rooms to the market have driven and continue to support improved RevPAR and ADR for the city. “Though the full impact hasn’t been realised with easyHotel and the George Best Hotel yet to open as well as Signature Living’s new hotel at the Crumlin Road courthouse which just received planning permission, demand continues to be driven by inbound tourism, domestic holidays and events.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete-2.jpg","title":"in focus peter hannan on beef brexit and business","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Peter Hannan tells John Mulgrew about turning away the big retailers, growing trade by % and that he doesn’t believe Brexit will happen once people see what’s at the edge of the clf Like many in his industry, Peter Hannan is no fan of Brexit.But the top-end beef and red meat supplier also doesn’t think it’s going to happen, given how disastrous the post-Brexit landscape is painted, now that it’s been starkly laid out in front of everyone.The Kildare-born businessman runs Hannan Meats, based in Moira. He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam.

I grew up in an era where comedians actually had the benefit of free speech and you simply switched off or walked outyou didn’t find them funny. Common sense used to prevail and adults were able to admonish children as part of their development process. Today the world is dferent, everyone’s opinion matters evenit is illogical, ill-conceived and does not stand the scrutiny of even the most cursory of cross examinations. Politicians have always manipulated the message to try and persuade the electorate that the policy they are peddling today is for our benefit. Once elected they then change tack, claim they never supported the policy that they were elected for and blame the opposition. One of my clients’ recently told me to stop wasting my time writing about Brexit because nobody cares and the subject is now boring. I tend to agree that the subject has been over discussed but sadly it appears to have been under considered by almost all associated with our path to European exit. Local, national and European politicians have patently no clue as to how to deliver a workable and practical orce with both sides predicting a range of dire consequences for the UK economy whether we stay or go. As ever the true position will never be visible to the vast majority of voters and, therefore, we will probably never have the chance to understand our exit deal, whether or not we get the chance to vote on it. Never has the duplicitous nature of politicians been more evident than this shambles we are now watching. Businesses do not have the luxury of endlessly debating a myriad of options, we need to make decisions and act upon them. If we don’t then jobs are lost and families suffer. Locally we are pathetically represented by a group of politicians who appear not to want to undertake the jobs they were elected to do. Maybe I am just cynical but it appears to me that they are hiding in the shadows hoping that someone comes up with a plan for which they have no actual responsibility. That way,it works they can quietly move forward asthey were a part of it,it fails then it was not their fault. Do we not deserve better than this  I read an article in another publication recently, penned by one of my competitors, in which he invoked property professionals to be more optimistic and sell the positives of the NI market. I have spent my entire  year career trying to sell the positives of investing in NI. I have stayed here, built a business, paid taxes, employed many people and hopefully delivered pleasing results for our clients. It would be really nicefor once our politicians could simply deliver us a viable business oriented solution that made le easier rather than the constant uncertainty we face.
