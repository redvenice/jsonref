Meanwhile just behind Beaconsfield – England’s only million-pound market town – is Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, with homes selling at an average of £797,436.Andrew Mason, of Lloyds Bank, said: ‘There are many reasons why homebuyers continue to pay a premium for market town properties – the idyllic surroundings of these close-knit communities make them the perfect place for many.’Earlier this month it emerged house prices in London and the South East had fallen, while the rest of the UK saw house prices rise 1.4 per cent to an average £227,000. London prices dropped to an average £463,000 in March, down 1.9 per cent on the previous year, while the rest of the South East saw a 0.4 per cent dip to an average £318,000.This is thought to have been driven partly by a rise in stamp duty tax for the most expensive homes. "},{"url":null,"title":"Young people far likely smaller home elderly","story":"Share this article Sarah Coles, of Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘Generation Rent is being squeezed out of the property market and crammed into smaller and smaller homes.‘Tenants may be forced to keep downsizing in order to keep a lid on costs.

Delicious. Moreish beyond beliefHistorically, men used specially trained pigs and dogs to dig truffles out of the ground, which is one of the reasons they have always been so expensive. Nowadays clever and highly secretive farmers are successfully growing them.That trip to Scotland turned out to be one of the most bizarre days of my life. After I asked about the origin of the truffles, I was caught in a web of secrecy more bamboozling than a John le Carré novel. David Wilson offered to introduce me and Derek Cooper, the presenter of Radio 4’s The Food Programme, which I was producing, to his ‘supplier’.The next day, a mysterious man told us to park our car in a lay-by off the A92. When he showed up in a maroon Ford, Derek asked if we were going to collect a dog or pig.‘No,’ came the reply. How would we find them, then? ‘You’ll see.’He drove us through a maze of lanes before stopping at a wooded hilltop. The truffle man’s kit was two steel skewers — the kind you use for kebabs. We briskly set off into the woods, and after two hours, we had found two truffles.         Prince Charles, pictured, smells a black truffle during a visit to Italy in November 2002They were outstanding — and they showed me the immense lengths people will go to in order to get their hands on this remarkable food.

That unique savoury hit, layered on top of some good Parmesan . . it’s not as ridiculous as Ramsay says.But I do wish manufacturers would make it more explicit that the ‘truffle’ flavour you are enjoying in your truffle crisps is not the real thing, snuffled from the ground by an expert forager — but a slippery and lucrative oil processed in an industrial plant. Sheila Dillon is the presenter of BBC Radio 4’s The Food Programme."},{"url":null,"title":"Butterfly experts launch PR campaign improve peoples opinion MOTHS","story":"Share this article It will highlight unusual species, such as the puss moth, which can shoot acid from its chest, and the Mother Shipton, whose markings resemble the face of a witch.The survey of more than 2,000 people found one in six people see moths as ugly, and one in eight believe they are scary.          A Death\u0027s-head Hawk-moth, one of more than 2,500 common species of the insect in the UK"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/05/27/04/13998676-7073479-image-a-63_1558928983816.jpg","title":"George Michaels ex lover Fadi Fawaz squatting singers 5m London home","story":"Share this articleGeorge Michael\u0027s ex is SQUATTING in the star\u0027s £5m home despite legal letters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3904988.1558888806!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"schools to get 800 new special needs assistants","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThere will be a record 15,950 special needs assistants in school in the coming year, supporting about 37,500 pupils.Almost 800 new special needs assistants are to be allocated to schools from September.The increased allocation reflects the fact that record numbers of children with special or additional needs are in mainstream education, as well as earlier diagnosis of underlying conditions.The announcement means there will be a record 15,950 special needs assistants in school in the coming year, supporting about 37,500 pupils.Schools are set to receive confirmation of their allocations from the National Council for Special Education over the course of Monday. They will also be available on the council’s website (www.ncse.ie) from midday.Minister for Education Joe McHugh confirmed the additional allocations that will apply from September.Under a new school inclusion model, the role of the SNA is set to broaden out from supporting care needs – such as toileting and feeding – to assisting with delivery of speech and language or occupational therapy.The approach is being piloted in 75 schools in Kildare and Wicklow from next September.If successful, it could lead to changes being applied to all SNAs, though unions have warned that this will require training and a renegotiation of members’ pay rates.Mr McHugh said “good progress” was being made in developing the new inclusion model which aims to provide better outcomes for students with additional needs.“I look forward to applying this new model of support and the opportunity it affords for review and evaluations to ensure we are providing the most effective and efficient service to students in our schools who require additional supports.”IncreaseThis latest allocation represents a 50 per cent increase in the number of SNAs who were working in schools in 2011.Spending on special education now stands at about €1.9 billion, or a fifth of the overall education budget.The scale of investment has previously prompted concern within the Department of Public Expenditure over “rapidly escalating costs” and the fact that more is spent on special needs than higher education.However, Mr McHugh has welcomed the fact that more children with special educational needs than ever before are participating in school.“Our education system is increasingly better equipped to support children with special needs and support their full participation and progression,” he said.“SNAs are the bedrock of Government supports for children with special needs. It is their work day in, day out that is key to helping ensure that children can go to school and participate in education.”The Minister added: “Special needs assistants are vital to the work of a school. They are dedicated, caring and hugely important in ensuring the Government can meet its goal of supporting children with special needs and helping them to reach their potential.“I would like to take this opportunity to pay credit to the fantastic work that they do.”Until recently, SNA allocations were announced over the summer months, which led to uncertainty among schools, SNAs and parents.However, the earlier announcement is aimed at ensuring parents and children know of the allocation in good time for the start of the next school year."},{"url":null,"title":"a baby born today the climate and their future","story":"Life-support systems that nature provides – an intertwined web that sustains humans, plants and animals – are at risk of unravelling in a matter of decades.Deforestation, intensive agriculture, overfishing, development and other human activities are breaking the bonds that combine to make a healthy planet. Their destruction, fuelled by rampant consumption and obsession with economic growth, is accelerating.“The evidence is crystal clear: nature is in trouble. Therefore we are in trouble,” declared Sandra Díaz, who co-chaired the completion of a global assessment of bioersity published this week.There is a dual threat to life on Earth: species loss and climate change. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bioersity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) ranked the main factors causing species loss: changes in land and sea use exploitation of organisms climate change pollution and invasive alien species.These are “eroding the foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide”, and climate breakdown could soon become the main driver.Nature is being destroyed at such a rate that a million species are at risk. On the day the IPBES report made headlines, Dr Allan Mee of the Golden Eagle Trust checked for sightings of the Ring Ouzel in the MacGillycuddy’s Reeks in Co Kerry, one of just two of its remaining habitats in Ireland. “No birds located. Sad but likely witnessing local extinction of the species, once found in 28 Irish counties,” he tweeted. Pádraic Fogarty of the Irish Wildlife Trust replied: “This is mass extinction unfolding before our eyes.”How is the potentially lethal cocktail of bioersity loss and climate disruption going to impact on coming generations in contrasting parts of the globe? Equally, what does it mean for an animal that dominates the Irish landscape (the cow), and the majestic lion, not critically endangered yet rapidly disappearing?The baby born in IrelandConscious of what the next generation is facing, Australian Jim Scheer helped set up the FridaysForFuture climate action movement in Ireland, which is driven by young people. As for the babies of today, “their freedom is limited”, he believes. As a child, “the most I had to worry about was, ‘is there air in the tyres of my bike?’” he says.They are facing a whole different world of realities, a place where the First World problem of “where will I go on my holidays?” may be replaced by “where is my next meal coming from?”The issues weigh heavily on the current generation of young people, he believes, which is why “coming together to grieve” – a feature of recent protests – matters, and is part of telling the truth. There is much frustration too at the inaction of elders.“Uncertain” is the future of that child, says climate activist Dr Lorna Gold. Hope is emerging through the climate movement but, looking at the timelines required for transformational shift, there is “more and more uncertainty”.Children growing up in Ireland will be relatively protected, by location, wealth and assets they will have access to, “but even in the best-case scenario, it will be a diminished world.”This will be due to loss of species and a more complicated world, disrupted by climate and associated conflict, where Dr Gold fears the freedom to explore and travel in relative peace is undermined. It’s a place of learning from the internet rather than real life. The pluses will be better local connectedness with “their own earth” and nearby food production.That Irish child will never hear the corncrake or the curlew, says climatologist Prof John Sweeney, and, as they grow, they will be confronted with hard choices on lifestyle and mobility. The fossil fuel-driven car will be forced out by regulation, he says, but different ways of getting off the island, for example, will be needed if aviation does not overcome its emissions issues.By mid-century, most will live in green cities with an almost total absence of the private car. The transport revolution will be in urban areas but slower to come to the countryside until battery technology improves, Sweeney notes.A near zero-carbon world will mean less air pollution. Clean energy in their home and workplace will mainly come from offshore wind.A downside will be more extreme weather events attributable to climate change more intense storms and rainfall, increased flooding with sea level rises – and yet water shortages in summer.The child born today in Ireland – and the adult they become – will cope far better than their counterpart elsewhere.The developing world babyA baby born today in a developing country, on the other hand, will be at the frontline of climate disruption, says Christian Aid Ireland policy and advocacy adviser Jennifer Higgins. They will have to contend with stronger cyclones, warmer days and nights, more unpredictable rains and longer heatwaves.“Here in Ireland we will have the resources and ability to adapt and deal with these unprecedented weather events, but in many parts of the world, going to Tesco to stock up on sliced pan won’t be a possibility.”They will be the ones who will suffer the worst consequences of our inaction on climate change. “Sustained periods of unseasonably heavy rain can have a damaging impact on agriculture, causing the loss of topsoil and serious nutrient leaching,” says Higgins.In Ireland, save for the odd hosepipe ban, water is always on tap for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. “But in the developing world, where most people depend on agriculture to earn a living or just stay alive, it’s a scarce and precious resource.”Those living in coastal regions will suffer a loss of coral reefs, which half a billion people rely on for fish. For those born among indigenous communities in tropical rainforests, not only will they lose their homeland – already being eroded by increasing industrialisation – but there will be loss of habitat that acts as the lungs of the earth and regulates rainfall.Children will be most susceptible to the increasing diseases that a changing climate will leave in its wake, she adds. Their education may be disrupted when schools are used as shelters when disaster hits their communities.If temperatures increase in already hot areas, it will diminish scarce resources to sustain life and will force many to become refugees.But this may “dwarf numbers caused by conflict or political and economic necessity. When their land becomes uninhabitable because of drought, flood or sea-level rise, they will have to seek a safer place to live,” Higgins predicts.It may be a world where techniques such as conservation agriculture transform crop production and smartphone technology helps drive rural economies backed by deployment of cheap solar PV. But extreme weather events will continue to threaten food production, as seen with recent cyclones in southern Africa.Gold fears a business-as-usual approach means such circumstances can become an intractable problem very quickly, and says solutions are beyond most communities on cost grounds. Therefore the child is facing increased malnutrition, chronic hunger, dependency on external aid, and political instability – an existence marked by inequality and injustice.The IPBES report starkly outlines how indigenous peoples and the poorest are most reliant on land and sea for survival. The combination of land grabs by multinationals facilitated by corrupt governments, extreme climate events and bioersity loss add up to a very bleak future for their offspring, Gold concludes.The future of the cow Humans are not the only beings whose lives will change. The IPBES report emphasises that the effects will be felt first among animals and other living things.In Ireland, there are currently more cattle than people, and they are the most common large animal. For many, the cow (for beef and milk) is the bellwether of Irish agriculture and rural life. For others, it’s the problem because of associated carbon emissions.Teagasc’s head of communications, Eric Donald, says cattle numbers are currently a matter for inidual farmers. With no quotas, no policy instruments are in place. In future we are likely to have fewer beef and more dairy cattle.On emissions, Donald says there is wide acceptance of the need to implement mitigation measures – a process is already in train.Having a grass-based system to feed those cattle will be critical to sustainable farms from an environmental, economic and social perspective, Donald adds. Ireland will need to find export markets for 80 to 90 per cent of its product. Meat consumption may decrease on an inidual basis and there may be a shift to plant-based diets, but increased population growth will mean “demand won’t drop significantly”.But cattle will have to compete for space due to a more erse range of crops, land being used for bioenergy and afforestation (increasingly native woodlands and not just on marginal land) that will act as important carbon sinks, and hedgerows ensuring better bioersity and pollinator capacity.To question beef consumption may currently be an Irish “no-no”, but the reality is the consumers of tomorrow will be confronted by a wide range of new plant and synthetic proteins that will taste surprisingly good and be cheaper, which is likely to mean less red meat is consumed – in line with health guidelines.Eric Donald defends the pursuit of higher genetic quality as a means of increasing efficiency and lowering emissions, especially “because lifetime productivity is better”. With extending grazing seasons, it’s the key measure in improving farm sustainability guidelines. It also complements changes in fertiliser use and slurry management.But John Sweeney says the Irish cow is “reaching limits in terms of genetics”. Like pedigree dogs, they are less able to cope with change and stress compared with native species.Unquestionably, there will be fewer of them, he believes, “if we want to maintain bioersity for future generations”.Expansion in the cattle population has coincided with deterioration in water quality, with widespread glyphosate contamination (one study has found 20 per cent of Irish adults have traces of the herbicide in their urine), nitrates pollution and an emerging ammonia problem.“Continued expansion of the national herd is not compatible with this report. That’s where the crux comes.”The future of the lionJennifer Higgins joins in a lament for so many endangered mammals.Of all species threatened, IWT campaign officer Pádraic Fogarty is shocked by the latest indicators for hippos, giraffes and lions. In particular, “it would be an absolutely travesty if lions were to go extinct . . . The magnificent animal has permeated our culture and imagination, from children’s stories to the pillars on Trafalgar Square.”But maps don’t lie. In 1950 there were 400,000 lions in the wild. Today there are 23,000-39,000 lions in all of Africa, which is “extremely low” in global terms, when once they lived in Ancient Greece and North Africa, and became extinct in Greece only around 100BC.Outside of southern Africa, numbers of lions in 23 unfenced reserves in 11 countries are estimated to have dropped by 62 per cent between 1993 and 2014. Asia is home to a small subpopulation in the Indian state of Gujarat, where numbers are growing, but it’s just a pin on the globe.“There is no data to say that lions are about to disappear, but their populations are shrinking fast,” he explains. The species is classified as vulnerable but the slide into the “endangered” and then “critically endangered” categories looms, while “threatened with extinction” is applied to its current status.For Fogarty, the same pressures apply to other mammals, but the lion’s wellbeing is further undermined by gametrophy hunting and false western-world notions that it is somehow good for population numbers. All told, we are facing a scenario where lions will “shrink to a few corners of the planet”.What to doThis is not going to be sorted by putting bird tables in back gardens. The Ipbes report shows nature-based solutions can help bring “transformative change”, but there is a greater systemic problem.In the past 50 years, the human population has doubled, the global economy has grown nearly four-fold, and global trade has grown tenfold, together driving up the demands for energy, food and materials.Thinking that endless economic growth is possible and not valuing the essential services provided by nature is a delusion leading to catastrophe, Sweeney believes.“Until we get away from euros and cents and GDP, we will be in a cul-de-sac . . . Unless we rethink how we value the services provided by the natural world and include them explicitly in a wellbeing measure, we delude ourselves that a sustainable future is possible.”That was the core message in a submission this week to EU leaders meeting on the future of Europe by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB) and more than 200 academics, including John Sweeney, policy experts and civil society groups.There is an onus too on iniduals to act, according to EEB vice president Attracta Uí Bhroin. “It’s not enough for us to sit on the sofa and watch David Attenborough’s latest breathtaking and terrifying documentary and shake our heads. Every politician coming near your front door needs to know environmental sustainability is your priority, and must be Europe’s priority.”Fogarty hopes people now see the connections between climate breakdown and mass extinction, that they are two sides of the same coin. “We have all of the solutions to hand, but what we’ve been lacking is any sense of urgency to get on with it.”He senses momentum moving in the right direction, though the lack of a response from the Taoiseach or any Government minister “makes me feel that they are still hoping it’s an issue that will go away. We can’t really afford this level of disengagement when we need to be getting on with things.”Scheer is brutally frank about future voters born today. “I don’t think people get a choice of what games they play.”They will have to be focused on survival. “It feels as we have handed them a shitstorm.”As for the current generation, too many are stuck in business-as-usual mode. There is a need to raise consciousness quickly. “Ignorance is not a choice” given the IPBES report. “It’s not an opinion, it’s scientific. It’s happening.”Kevin O\u0027Sullivan is Environment and Science Editor and former Editor of The "},{"url":null,"title":"brexit turmoil triggers low take up of special state loans","story":"Less than a tenth of the money set aside for a special State loan scheme to help businesses prepare for Brexit has been sanctioned, sparking concerns about the level of readiness.Almost €29 million of the Government’s €300 million Brexit loan scheme has been authorised at bank level on 132 loans, almost 14 months after the financial support was announced. The low take-up has led to fears that businesses are not willing to commit to fresh borrowing when they do not know what to prepare for in light of the political uncertainty in Britain.The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation said that the scheme had received 620 applications and 563 had been approved by the State-owned Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland. There have, however, only been 132 loans sanctioned by the lenders involved in the scheme – Bank of Ireland, AIB and Ulster Bank – up to the middle of this month.Tánaiste Simon Coveney warned last week that businesses needed “to be wide awake to Brexit” after he advised the Government to continue making preparations for a potential no-deal exit in light of the political turmoil in the UK and isions over the manner and timing of Britain’s departureTheresa May’s resignation as British prime minister last week, leaving open the possibility of a Brexiteer taking over, has increased concerns that the UK may leave the EU next October without a deal.Loans of up to €1.5 million are available under the scheme at a maximum interest rate of 4 per cent. The Government hopes businesses will use the loans to prepare for Brexit.The scheme, which makes loans on terms ranging from one year to three, also offers unsecured loans of up to €500,000. New deadlineThe department said that it expected applications to increase as the UK’s new deadline to leave the EU on October 31st drew closer. “It is worth bearing in mind that any application for finance has to be in line with a company’s financial planning,” said a spokesman for the department.“At present firms are naturally reluctant to take on debt until the details of the Brexit challenge becomes clearer.”The Government strongly urged businesses to make an application for a loan “if they suspect they might need one down the line”.“Ultimately, they do not have to draw it down unless they need it, but it is good contingency planning to prepare for the worst,” said the department’s spokesman.Fianna Fáil’s spokeswoman on Brexit Lisa Chambers TD said she understood why so few businesses were applying for the loan given that the application process was “quite cumbersome” and small and medium-sized firms were finding it difficult to justify expenditure “to prepare for the unknown”.“What they are looking for is a stronger level of support from Government, probably more in the line of a grant to help them stay afloat.” Last month the Government opened another €300 million lending programme, the longer-term Future Growth Loan Scheme, offering businesses loans of up to €300 million ranging from eight to 10 years to small and mid-sized businesses to help them prepare for post-Brexit planning.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Party leader Eamon Ryan said he was “thrilled” by Chu’s success in her election at the first count in the five-seater Pembroke ward with 4,069 votes - almost double the quota. He predicted the party would secure eight or even nine seats in the city of the 10 candidates the Greens ran for the city’s 11 wards.Asked if the party should have run more candidates in the city, Mr Ryan said it certainly could have run a second in Pembroke. “We could have run two here and we would have won two here.” With the possibility that the Greens could be the largest party on the council Mr Ryan said their strategy for the coming term would be “about more than just iding up mayors and chairs” and would see the party pushing for real environmental measures to be taken at council level. Chu born in Ireland, to parents from Hong Kong, is the partner of sitting Green city councillor Patrick Costello. She said it was “a bit overwhelming but great privilege” to be elected.Two Green candidates who were celebrating in the RDS were Michael Pidgeon and Hazel Chu, both of whom are poll toppers.Hazel Chu topped the poll in the Pembroke area with more than 2,000 votes above the quota, told The : “Politics was never part of what we do. Both my parents were kitchen workers, they washed dishes. It wasn’t until I met my partner Patrick Costello who is, hopefully, a councillor in Kimmage Rathmines because he is topping the poll, that I decided to get involved in the Greens. I decided you know what, I’ll put my name forward.”Mr Pidgeon said at one stage he expected to have to fight for the last seat instead of topping the poll. “I am a little bit in shock. I’m really humbled. We thought we would be scrapping away for the last seat here. There hasn’t been a Green councillor here for 25 years,” he said. “There is a part of me that’s aware that we worked really hard on the campaign. This isn’t a personal vote, it’s not even really a party vote. It’s a vote about the issues the Government are not tackling. From what I can tell, looking at the areas where we got the votes, they were coming in from areas including areas that wouldn’t have been traditionally Green at all.”French-born Sophie Nicoullaud was elected for the Green Party in the Ballyfermot-Drimnagh Dublin City Council ward, as yet another first time candidate brought in on a surge of popularity for the party. Sitting Sinn Féin councillor Daithí Doolan topped the poll in the ward, and was followed by Solidarity-People Before Profit candidate Hazel de Nortúin on the eight count. A strong number of transfers for Ms Nicoullaud, who moved to Ireland in 2006, saw her take the third seat in the ninth and final count.Independent councillor Vincent Jackson retained his seat, finishing behind Ms Nicoullaud. It was initially announced that Michael Jackson had been elected to the council, a mistake quickly corrected by the returning office team. Fianna Fáil’s Daithí de Róiste took the last seat in the ward, beating the Labour Party candidate Michael O’Sullivan by 178 votes. The Greens knocked another one out of the park with Claire Byrne, one of their three sitting councillors, topping the poll in the South East Inner City. Byrne was a comfortable winner with 1,961 first preferences ahead of the 1,144 quota in this five seater.Sinn Fein’s Chris Andrews, once a Fianna Fáil councillor, but now a full council term in Sinn Féin, took a seat after the fourth count. However, the rest of the field is very spread out, with a large number of first timers in this ward and no one else with a particularly impressive first preference showing.(First preference votes: candidates elected in bold)Full results and in depth analysis of the local elections"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3905256.1558914601!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"elections 2019 what we know so far","story":"Trends between the two elections emerge: a big increase in support for the Greens, a disastrous e for Sinn Féin and a reality check for Fine Gael which did not see the gains it anticipated.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSorting votes at the Dublin count centre for European election at the RDS.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsCounting has resumed for a third day in the elections as the first of the Irish MEPs are due to be elected, with Ciaran Cuffe of the Green party expected to take the first seat in Dublin. In the local elections, Limerick elected its final three local candidates on Monday morning after a 20 hour long count but there are still almost 80 local seats that remain to be filled . The Green Party was the big winner having recorded its best ever election results, and Sinn Féin was the big loser of the weekend.Sinn Féin lost seats on councils all over the country – and was wiped out on some local authorities – in a major reversal of fortunes from the last such elections five years ago.Party sources were braced to lose as many as 50 seats, from a total of 159 in 2014, with some fearing that its total seat haul could dip below 100.Sinn Féin TD Pearse Doherty told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland it was a disappointing election for his party. “There’s no doubt about it, this has been a blow to Sinn Féin, that being said, we’re still the third largest party at local government level, we still have representation across the island of Ireland at that level, our people will be dusting themselves down, that’s what we will be doing, dusting ourselves down collectively,” he said. “We need to look at what went wrong and where, we can see that our vote didn’t come out.“It’s our job to learn lessons from this election ... this was a disappointing election from us, we would rather have done a lot better.”However, it has been a great election for the Green Party. Green candidate Ciarán Cuffe topped the poll with 63,849 first preferences in the European Parliament elections and is expected to take the first Dublin seat. Mr Cuffe is likely to be followed to the European Parliament by Fine Gael’s Frances Fitzgerald (59,067 first preferences) while Sinn Féin’s Lynn Boylan (39,387) will struggle to hold her seat. While the party is certain to take the Dublin MEP seat, the Green candidate in the South constituency Grace O’Sullivan and the Midlands North West candidate Saoirse McHugh will have to wait until later counts on Monday to learn whether they will join Mr Cuffe in the new European Parliament.Party leader Eamon Ryan said newly elected Green Party councillors will seek to form alliances with all other parties on local authorities in the coming weeks to agree action on climate change.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the public had sent a “clear message” by electing more Green Party candidates that they want the Government to do “more on climate action”.Around EuropeThe Greens will be the fourth biggest group in the next EU Parliament after their share of seats rose to more than 9 per cent from 7 per cent, according to provisional results released on Monday morning in Brussels. Europe’s far right had a modest night at the polls in the European elections, making striking gains in some countries but losses in others. In the end, a promised populist surge turned out to be more of a ripple.There were expected strong showings for leading figures of the European far right, such as Hungary’s anti-immigration prime minister, Viktor Orban, whose Fidesz party took more than half the vote, and Italy’s interior minister, Matteo Salvini, whose Lega was the biggest party. Marine le Pen’s National Rally also narrowly topped the polls in France. But while there were losses for traditional big parties in many countries, far from all of those votes went to far-right or populist parties, with greens and other pro-European forces also doing well. In the UK, an insurgent Brexit party and reinvigorated Liberal Democrats have delivered a harrowing night for the Conservatives and Labour at the European elections, prompting profound soul-searching at the top of both major parties.Overnight, the Brexit party gained 28 seats, with the Lib Dems in second on 15 seats. Labour held 10, having lost seven so far, the Green party won seven, a gain of four, and the Tories were languishing in fifth place, with just three seats.Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said Nigel Farage was wrong to say the Leave side had won the European election. She told the Today programme: “I don’t think that’s right, I think the Brexit Party got about 35 per cent of the vote and the strongly Remain parties got about 40 per cent of the vote.

Photograph: Michael McLaughlinPositively radiant, having just been swept from the ranks of the unappreciated right to the top of the eligibility league.The apple of every leaders’ eye.But were they lifted by a Green tide or merely flattered by a seasonal algal bloom?After a terrific showing for Eamon Ryan and his colleagues in the local and European elections, the two main parties must figure out the answer to that question.But in the meantime, neither Leo Varadkar nor Micheál Martin can ignore the figures. If the Greens do as well in a general election, they will most likely hold the key to power – which is a very handsome dowry for a small grouping in search of government.Suddenly, they look a very attractive proposition to a major party in want of a political partner.This new state of affairs brought out a heartwarming display of gallantry from the Taoiseach, who didn’t want to be caught casting covetous glances in the direction of new coalition soulmates while still doing the Government tango with a group of Independents.“It would be really inappropriate of me to be looking around the walls for a new dance partner,” Leo unconvincingly declared on Sunday while on a quick visit to the Dublin count centre in the RDS. But he couldn’t help admiring the Greens for making the running on climate change and winning so many voters to their side of the argument.Make no mistake, he vowed Fine Gael was going to go all out now to follow their lead.The Attenborough BounceIn Cork, Micheál Martin and his Fianna Fáil senior officers were making the same pledge. There are some people out there who continue to deny that climate change is happening.It happened in Ireland in the space of 24 hours this weekend, witnessed by an entire nation.As Green Party leader Eamon Ryan finally consigned the awful memory of his last European election count to the non-recycle bin of the past (he thought he had won a seat only for his hopes to be dashed at the tail end of a marathon count), the main parties underwent a chastening climate change experience of their own.They will be hoping that the big surge in support for the Green Party is down to the Attenborough Bounce – a voter reaction spurred on by recent documentaries from the world’s favourite natural history expert which they may be able to counter with through policy tweaking and market research.For now though, the man of the moment is former Green junior minister Ciarán Cuffe, who topped the poll in the Dublin constituency and left some political big guns in his wake.“I have to pinch myself,” he said on Sunday afternoon, locking his bicycle to the fence outside the local election count centre. “I’m not sure about the Elderflower wine which everyone keeps talking about, but I think a bottle of something nice will definitely be cracked open when I finally get home tonight.”Former Green party leader and former tánaiste, John Gormley was to the forefront of the last Green wave. This one is just as good.“I’m not surprised we topped the poll but I am surprised by the extent of it. In my own constituency we got over two quotas.”Having tasted the highs and the lows in his political career, Gormley wasn’t worried that the party’s fantastic nationwide showing might be a flash in the pan.“There’s a whole new dynamic in the party, with committed young people who will have to be listened to.”While the so-called Green Tide was the big story of the election, it slipped down to second place in the news cycle even before the first European election votes were counted on Sunday. Would the result have any impact on the timing of a general election?The Taoiseach teased with vague answers. He didn’t envisage one happening soon but he couldn’t say anything more definite that that. This was because Micheál Martin and Fianna Fáil have the option of “pulling the plug” on his administration at a time of their choosing.“I don’t intend to be calling into Áras an Úachtaráin in the next couple of days anyway.”Which is a relief. But he can’t rule anything out either.So if the Government falls, it won’t be his fault, presumably.Leo Varadkar arrived at the RDS during the Six One news – having spent the afternoon at the races in the Curragh. Was he contemplating a general election? No, but that didn’t mean he might be forced to call one.What it does mean is that journalists will keep asking him about it and talking about the possibility until an election until it actually happens. This could take weeks or many months and will prove a useful weapon of distraction for the Taoiseach when he wants to deflect media interest in other, more embarrassing, matters.Stirring speculationSinn Féin has had a terrible experience. Around the RDS, supporters looked very glum. For the new breed, this is relatively unknown territory – the party has performed well in recent outings. Questions were already being asked about the future of party leader, Mary Lou McDonald.The Taoiseach was right to keep stirring the speculation pot.Should Fianna Fáil pull the plug while Sinn Féin is at a low ebb? Should Fine Gael chance it, even though the party hasn’t put clear water between itself and Fianna Fáil?All these questions are for another day as far as the Greens are concerned. Efforts to put Ciarán Cuffe on the spot about entering coalition proved unsuccessful on Sunday, he dodged the issue with a smile, a shimmy from the microphones and run for cover.Meanwhile, the narrative that the young people of Ireland are responsible for the Attenborough Bounce because they convinced their mammies and grannies to vote Green gained ground with commentators. It wasn’t so popular with the older cohort of voters who also know their own minds and are very worried about the kind of world that might be left behind by their generation for the generations to come.As evening moved into night and impossibly slow counts ground on, a relaxed looking Frances Fitzgerald arrived to check progress. She knew she had a seat in Europe. “People wanted to give a message about climate change and that is very clear”, she said, clearly on message.An resolutely upbeat Mary Lou McDonald arrived as it grew closer to 10pm. Her supporters were subdued, but the Sinn Féin leader felt the last seat in Dublin would “go down to the wire” and the party was still in the running for seats in all the constituencies.“We come here in a spirit of optimism,” she said.As Leo left the RDS in the early evening, a middle aged man wearing navy slacks and a purple golf sweater tried to speak to him outside the building. The Taoiseach was already in his car but the man tried to force himself in through the passenger door. He had to be physically hauled out of the vehicle by gardaí.Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy was assailed by protesters on Saturday and Sunday when he went to the local count in the RDS.“You can stick your co-living up your arse! Up yer arse!” sang a group from People Before Profit.But overall, the mood was quiet in an election which had something in it for almost everyone.Last in to the RDS was a jubilant knot of Greens, with Ciarán Cuffe modestly leading the sedate procession into the hall. He was delighted. The celebration was already planned.“It’ll be a bottle of Five Lamps lager once I get out of here.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3905618.1558946530!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"northern ireland counting begins for three mep seats","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) MEP candidate Diane Dodds (R) and her husband Nigel Dodds MP (L), DUP Leader in Westminster. Photograph: Paul FaithAFPGetty Counting is under way in Northern Ireland to decide which three MEPs will be returned to the next European Parliament, which as some candidates have said could be for “five days, five weeks or five years”.Amid the uncertainty of when and if Britain and Northern Ireland exits the European Union the turnout in Northern Ireland was 45 per cent, which is about five percentage points down on the local elections earlier this month. The turnout is down more than 6 per cent from the 2014 European election.From an eligible electorate of 1,278,951 a total of 577,275 people voted in Northern Ireland to return three candidates. How long those candidates will conduct their work in Europe will depend on how long the Brexit process will take to conclude – or whether the 2016 referendum result can be overturned in any possible future plebiscite.The count is taking place at the Meadowbank Sports Arena in Magherafelt, Co Derry with first results due later on Monday. The North’s electoral office has doubled its staff from the election of 2014 to try to speed up the count. The office has warned, however,\u0026nbspthe count could run into Tuesday.Considerable focusEleven candidates contested the election in Northern Ireland with outgoing Sinn Féin and DUP MEPs Martina Anderson and Diane Dodds expected to be returned.During the campaign there was considerable focus on who would take the third seat due to the decision of the Ulster Unionist Party politician Jim Nicholson not to seek re-election after 40 years as an MEP.A disappointing performance by the UUP in the North’s local elections also reinforced the view that it could be a tight battle for the third seat.The issue of Brexit also was a significant factor in the European election campaign with the DUP and UUP arguing for Leave and Sinn Féin, the SDLP, Alliance and the Greens standing for Remain.

Photograph:  EPAMAURIZIO BRAMBATTIFar-right parties are poised to be a disruptive influence in the next European Parliament after elections that stemmed, but did not halt, the rise of populism.Two of the standard-bearers of the right, Italy’s Matteo Salvini and the UK’s Nigel Farage, won resounding endorsements. Exit polls indicated that Mr Salvini had taken his League party’s seat tally from five to 15, while early counts had Mr Farage’s Brexit Party on 32 per cent of the vote in the UK.With a projected estimate of about 176 of the new parliament’s 751 seats, the far-right groups will be in a position to wield considerable influence, though without anything like a decisive majority.Seat tallies for the parties remained estimates late on Sunday night based on pre-election polling and exit polls. And from Monday the process of reforming and realigning groups will begin to take place.MEPs’ hopes of a resounding mandate for a candidate to present to EU leaders as their next European Commission president failed to materialise. The centre-right European People’s Party (EPP) lost seats, although it outperformed pre-election estimates, but its candidate for commission president – or spizenkandidat – Manfred Weber, saw his own Bavarian CSU achieve its worst result.\u0026nbsp With heads of government looking for an excuse not to appoint him, his chances have not improved.The prospects of commission vice-president Frans Timmermans will, however, have been boosted by his Labour Party’s (PvDA) poll-topping performance in The Netherlands, where its near extinction in 2014 was put firmly behind it with a vote of 18 per cent, three points ahead of the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy of prime minister Mark Rutte. \u0026nbspBut projections suggest Mr Timmermans’s best hope of a Socialist, Liberal, Green, hard left alliance will fall just short of a parliament majority.The elections also saw the parliament’s Socialist group (S\u0026ampD) lose seats in what were once its heartlands of Germany, France and Italy, although it made significant gains in Spain. The Greens, notably in Germany, where their support increased by over 20 percentage points, and France, up by 12 points, saw strong gains.The EPP, to which Fine Gael is affliated, has lost its predominant position in the parliament although it was estimated on Sunday night to remain the largest group with about 173 seats.Among the strong performers on the populist and far-right fringe were the German Alternativ für Deutschland (10 per cent), up\u0026nbspthree points on its 2014 figures, although down on its 2017 general election breakthrough vote. Marine Le Pen in France took first place on 23.3 per cent, just ahead of Emmanuel Macron’s La République En Marche. And the Flemish far-right in Belgium took substantial votes off the mainstream nationalists.In Austria, chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who fired his far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ) coalition partners only a matter of days ago, saw Austrian People’s Party take a dramatic step forward, boosting its 2014 vote by over 7 percentage points to 34. Remarkably, however, the FPÖ seems, rather Trump-like to have a most tolerant base, losing only a couple of percentage points.Exit polls suggest the anti-immigrant Danish People’s Party\u0026nbspwill lose half its four seats.Voter engagement\u0026nbspacross the EU appears to have significantly improved with estimates suggesting substantial increases in turnout recorded in The Netherlands, France, Spain, Denmark, Romania and Hungary. Turnout is estimated at 52 per cent for the EU27. It had declined consistently since 1979, in 2014 reaching only 42.6 per cent. Ireland was one of the few which saw turnout decline, in its case by close to 3 percentage points.Full profiles and in depth analysis of the European election"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3905615.1558945281!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk elections 2019 gains for brexit party and lib dems as voters desert main parties","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeader of the Brexit Party Nigel Farage is pictured outside the BBC building, following the results of the European Parliament elections. Photograph: Hannah MckayReutersAn insurgent Brexit party and reinvigorated Liberal Democrats have delivered a harrowing night for the Conservatives and Labour at the European elections, prompting profound soul-searching at the top of both major parties.Nigel Farage has warned the Conservative leadership candidates he could win the next general election if they fail to deliver Brexit by the end of October, as his party topped the European polls.The Brexit party leader said he had no trust in Boris Johnson or any of the other Tory hopefuls to deliver Brexit, as he pledged to field 650 candidates to stand for Westminster office.Mr Farage’s victory at the European elections is now likely to put pressure on the Conservative leadership hopefuls to promise a hard Brexit in order to win back many of the party’s voters.The Brexit party humiliated the Conservatives in their rural heartlands but also made sweeping gains in cities such as Cardiff, Leeds and Sheffield, as well as in Hillingdon, the home of Boris’ Johnson’s seat where the Tories were pushed into fourth.Lib Dem revivalThe night also confirmed an extraordinary revival of the Lib Dems, who overtook the Tories in Theresa May’s Maidenhead seat and came first in Jeremy Corbyn’s north London home of Islington. Overnight, the Brexit party gained 28 seats, with the Lib Dems in second on 15 seats. Labour held 10, having lost seven so far, the Green party won seven, a gain of four, and the Tories were languishing in fifth place, with just three seats. The results so far show that the hard Brexit vote totalled 34.9 per cent - with the Brexit party on 31.6 per cent and Ukip on 3.3 per cent .The overall total for pro-leave parties was up at 44 per cent including the Conservatives on a historically low 9.1 per cent. The pro-remain vote added up to 40.3 per cent - with the Lib Dems on 20.3 r cent , the Greens on 12.1 per cent, the SNP on 3.5 per cent, Change UK on 3.4 per cent and Plaid Cymru on 1 per cent. Labour, which tried to appeal to both sides with a soft Brexit pitch or a possible confirmatory referendum, was on 14.1 per cent.Mr Farage’s success campaigning in favour of a no deal Brexit is likely to push the Conservative leadership candidates into hardline positions on leaving the EU. Mr Johnson, who is currently the favourite, used his Daily  column to acknowledge the results were a “crushing rebuke” to the government’s Brexit policy.“The message from these results is clear. If we go on like this, we will be fired: dismissed from the job of running the country,” he said. “The only way to avert that outcome is to honour the result of the 2016 referendum, and come out of the EU and that means doing it properly - not with some frail simulacrum of Brexit ? If we fail yet again to discharge that mandate, then I fear we will see a permanent haemorrhage of Conservative support, and loyal voters who have left us to join the Brexit party (and others) may simply never come back.”Another leading candidate, Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, said the dire results for the Conservatives meant the party faced an “existential risk” unless it delivered Brexit.Second referendumMeanwhile Jeremy Corbyn is under huge pressure from within his party to swing behind a second referendum, after Labour fell to third place behind the Liberal Democrats in the European elections.The Labour leader promised to think about the party’s Brexit policy, as Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, called for a clear shift in favour of a people’s vote with Labour campaigning to remain.Mr Corbyn said: “With the Conservatives disintegrating and unable to govern, and parliament deadlocked, this issue will have to go back to the people, whether through a general election or a public vote. Over the coming days we will have conversations across our party and movement, and reflect on these results on both sides of the Brexit ide.”Calls for a second referendum were led by Thornberry and Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, as well as some of Corbyn’s allies, including the trade union leader Manuel Cortes.– News and MediaFull results and in depth analysis of the local elections"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3904827.1558880562!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"maureen dowd crazy is as crazy does","story":"US president Donald Trump has called US house of representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi crazy and a mess after Pelosi claimed Trump stormed out of a meeting in the White House.

I think about how cool it will be to see Idris Elba resume his role as a world-weary London homicide detective in Luther. I think about what a harrowing tale Patrick Radden Keefe has woven in Say Nothing: a True Story of Murder and Memory in Northern Ireland.But once I’m completely awake, a gravitational pull takes hold and I am once more bedevilled by our preposterous president.I flip on the TV and gird for the endless stream of vitriol coming from the White House, bracing for another day of overflowing, overlapping, overwrought news stories about President Donald Trump. I’m sapped before I rise.As mayor Pete Buttigieg said on his Fox town hall about the national Trump preoccupation, “It is the nature of grotesque things that you can’t look away.”My head hurts, puzzling over whether Trump is just a big blowhard who’s flailing around, or a sinister genius laying traps to get himself impeached to animate the base ahead of the election.A minute ago, we were fixated on the half of the Mueller report that vividly details how Trump tried to shut down and hinder the Mueller investigation. But now the president has triggered the media’s shock collar, so everyone is fixated on how he gave William Barr vast new powers to use the intelligence agencies to investigate the investigators.Daily onslaughtJust as Trump once wore out contractors, bankers, lawyers and businesspeople in New York with his combative, insulting and wayward ways, now he’s wearing out the political crowd, as he tries to beat everybody here into submission with his daily, even hourly, onslaught of outrage piled upon outrage.Journalists must not become inured to Trump’s outlandish, transgressive behaviour. Mitch McConnell, Barr and almost everyone else in the GOP have made themselves numb to his abhorrent actions because of self-interest.But for those who are concerned about the scarring of the American psyche, it’s exhausting to find the vocabulary to keep explaining, over and over, how beyond the pale and out of the norm the 45th president is.How do you ratchet up from “remarkable,” “extraordinary,” “unprecedented”?What words can you use about someone who considers pardoning war criminals on Memorial Day? Who wants to make it simpler for adoption agencies to bar same-sex couples? Who circumvents Congress to complete arms deals to benefit the same Saudis who are clearly culpable in the case of the dismembered Washington Post columnist?Buttigieg and Nancy Pelosi have both mastered the art of puncturing Trump – far better than his Republican primary debate rivals did.“I don’t have a problem standing up to somebody who was working on season seven of Celebrity Apprentice when I was packing my bags for Afghanistan,” Buttigieg told the Post’s Robert Costa, saying he took a dim view of Trump’s bone-spurs excuse to get out of serving in Vietnam.Pelosi winds Trump up when she drips condescension worthy of a Jane Austen grande dame, saying she will pray for the president or pleading for someone to stage an intervention with the poor soul.After Pelosi remarked that the president was engaged in a cover-up, Trump dynamited his own meeting with “Crazy Nancy,” as he called her. His ‘I’m not crazy, you’re crazy’ rebuttal to Pelosi echoed his ‘I’m not a puppet, you’re a puppet’ line to Hillary Clinton during the debate.Trump tweeted a video of Pelosi that was manipulated to make her look as if she were slurring her words.“Well, I don’t know about the videos,” the president told reporters as he left on his trip to Japan.Destructive“He does outrageous, nasty, destructive things, knowing full well he’s crossing a line, and then he pretends he didn’t,” said Trump biographer Tim O’Brien. “He has spent five decades going to gossip columnists, radio shows, TV interviews and newspapers to stick a knife into almost anybody who crosses his path that he doesn’t like and he revels in it. There is something amazing in the Energiser Bunny aspect of his nastiness and his ignorance. He doesn’t care what people think about how mean or dumb he is. He just keeps going.”O’Brien said Pelosi “hit on something that is core to his con. His whole life is about the cover-up. He has covered up his academic record, his health reports, his dalliances with women, his finances, his family history. Even while he was saying he was the most transparent president in history, his treasury secretary was across town telling Congress, ‘I’m not giving you the president’s tax returns.’“One of the biggest motivating factors in Trump’s life – other than food, greed, sex and revenge – is mythmaking. Deep down, he knows he’s a pathological liar and he’s not the person he says he is. But any time anyone pierces that veil, it sends him into a rage.”It’s wearing, not letting this petulant man wear us all out. – New York Times"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/17/TELEMMGLPICT000147339863_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"judges given new expenses policy telegraph discovers judiciary","story":"The Ministry of Justice approved expenses including shampoo and crockery.  Lord Chief Justice, Lord Ian Burnett, pictured, claimed for multiple journeys to and from his homeMinistry of JusticeThe judiciary are to be given a new expenses policy after The Daily  found that Britain\u0027s most senior judges have claimed for crockery, shampoo and a taxi to transport ceremonial robes on taxpayer-funded expenses.Expenses data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows how some of the most high-profile members of the judiciary in England and Wales have had claims for everyday items as well first-class trains approved, even though they receive a salary of at least £180,000.At present, judges are encouraged to follow the expenses policy for Ministry of Justice (MOJ) civil servants, and the judiciary has also set out specific guidance relating to travel, accommodation and relocation....To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletMinistry of Justice EU election UK results and maps: Brexit Party wins nine of 10 regions, Lib Dems triumph in LondonEuropean Elections results live: Brexit Party triumphs while Tories and Labour suffer heavy lossesJeremy Corbyn under pressure from senior Labour figures to fully commit to second Brexit referendum after disastrous European election resultsWho won the UK’s European elections - Leave or Remain? Matteo Salvini triumphs in European elections, taking nearly 35 per cent of Italian vote Liberal Democrats \u0026#39back in business\u0026#39 as huge EU elections gains see them beat Tories and LabourComment: European election results show UK is as ided as it ever was over BrexitChange UK tactical voting row: Anna Soubry criticises Heidi Allen as party fails to win single seat at European electionsTommy Robinson and Rachel Johnson lose out in EU elections as mixed fortunes for high-profile MEP candidatesEurope’s crumbling centre - why Emmanuel Macron is becoming kingmaker in a falling down castleComment: After three years of Brexit sound and fury, we are almost exactly where we were three years agoComment: Esther McVey\u0026#39s optimistic \u0026#39Blue Collar Conservatism\u0026#39 is just what our country needs Labour collapse in Scotland fuels SNP to \u0026#39best ever\u0026#39 European elections resultComment: How can we rise above the noise and chaos of modern politics?Comment: Politicians can no longer ignore the national outrage of university fundingNigel Farage demands seat at Brexit negotiating table and says European elections victory \u0026#39is just the beginning\u0026#39Comment: The Brexit Party\u0026#39s EU elections triumph leaves the political class stuck in a no-deal viceWhy moths matter more than your cashmere scarf as charity warns they are under threatConservatives slump to lowest national vote share ever in European electionLabour erupts into civil war over European elections as Jeremy Corbyn calls for second referendum or general electionWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2019/05/13/TELEMMGLPICT000196956429_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6B56EokmwVz8yO1uUcPB99UIvfx6lPoez-YFK6IWJbE.jpeg?imwid","title":"rollout facial recognition technology has terrifying implications","story":"San Francisco has banned the use of facial recognition technology by police – should Britain follow suit?Our MPs have some front.

By 2000 this figure dropped to almost 28,000.The country has now seen no new infections since 2013 and is the first nation in WHO Africa region to be declared malaria-free in more than 40 years – only  Mauritius, which achieved the goal in 1973, has also eliminated the disease in the region. “Algeria is where the malaria parasite was first discovered in humans almost a century and a half ago, and that was a significant milestone in responding to the disease,” said Dr Matshidiso Moeti WHO regional director for Africa.“Now Algeria has shown the rest of Africa that malaria can be beaten through country leadership, bold action, sound investment and science. The rest of the continent can learn from this experience,” she said. War on malaria | On the brink of a breakthrough?Algeria\u0027s success has been due to a combination of free malaria diagnosis and treatment and a well-trained health workforce. Similar factors have helped Argentina eradicate the parasitic disease – the second country in South America to do so following Paraguay last year. “Argentina reported the last indigenous case in 2010 and has demonstrated the commitment, the capacity within its health, laboratory and surveillance systems, and the necessary financing to prevent the re-establishment of malaria within the country”, said Dr Carissa F. Etienne, director of the WHO Pan American Health Organization.“I am sure that Argentina will serve as an inspiration and as an example for other countries of the Americas to achieve the elimination of malaria in the coming years,” she added. India and Rwanda have made huge progress in tackling malariaAccording to the 2018 World Malaria Report, China is also close to eradicating the disease and Rwanda, Ethiopia and Pakistan have reduced infection levels. The countries are a highlights in an otherwise gloomy global picture. The countries with the highest disease burden are all moving backwards, including Nigeria, DRC, Mozambique and Uganda.“The news that Algeria and Argentina have been declared malaria free is a remarkable achievement for both countries,” said Dr Abdourahmane Diallo, CEO of the RBM Partnership to End Malaria.“As well as saving precious lives and strengthening health systems, malaria-free status provides external economic benefits for these countries enabling them to free up resources to address other health and development priorities and improve worker productivity and school attendance.“Other countries now have two more nations that serve as examples of how elimination can be achieved,” Dr Diallo added.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security European Elections results live: Brexit Party triumphs while Tories and Labour suffer heavy losses EU election UK results and maps: Brexit Party wins nine of 10 regions, Lib Dems triumph in LondonJeremy Corbyn under pressure from senior Labour figures to fully commit to second Brexit referendum after disastrous European election resultsWho won the UK’s European elections - Leave or Remain? Matteo Salvini triumphs in European elections, taking nearly 35 per cent of Italian vote Liberal Democrats \u0026#39back in business\u0026#39 as huge EU elections gains see them beat Tories and LabourComment: European election results show UK is as ided as it ever was over BrexitChange UK tactical voting row: Anna Soubry criticises Heidi Allen as party fails to win single seat at European electionsTommy Robinson and Rachel Johnson lose out in EU elections as mixed fortunes for high-profile MEP candidatesEurope’s crumbling centre - why Emmanuel Macron is becoming kingmaker in a falling down castleComment: After three years of Brexit sound and fury, we are almost exactly where we were three years agoComment: Esther McVey\u0026#39s optimistic \u0026#39Blue Collar Conservatism\u0026#39 is just what our country needs Labour collapse in Scotland fuels SNP to \u0026#39best ever\u0026#39 European elections resultComment: How can we rise above the noise and chaos of modern politics?Comment: Politicians can no longer ignore the national outrage of university fundingNigel Farage demands seat at Brexit negotiating table and says European elections victory \u0026#39is just the beginning\u0026#39Comment: The Brexit Party\u0026#39s EU elections triumph leaves the political class stuck in a no-deal viceWhy moths matter more than your cashmere scarf as charity warns they are under threatConservatives slump to lowest national vote share ever in European electionLabour erupts into civil war over European elections as Jeremy Corbyn calls for second referendum or general electionWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"expenses podcast lone campaigner took whole parliament","story":"Journalist and freedom of information campaigner, Heather BrookeTucked away in the back of New Labour’s 1997 manifesto is a promise.

As a lifelong resident of Amderma, a hardscrabble former mining and military town perched on the edge of the Arctic Ocean 1,200 miles northeast of Moscow, Mr Prikazchikov has seen more than a hundred polar bears first-hand. He took a quick video on his phone, yelled out the window so the bear would keep moving and put the kettle on for tea.“It\u0027s par for the course,” he said. “They were always here. They are the masters here, so we don\u0027t conflict with them, and they don\u0027t show aggression toward us.”The “tsar of the Arctic” has indeed always been part of life in Amderma. It features in the folktales of indigenous Nenets reindeer herders, and old photographs show Soviet soldiers feeding condensed milk to polar bears well within reach of their razor-sharp two-inch claws. Some residents even admitted to having poached the animals in the hungry 1990s, when a hide was said to fetch $10,000.But as global warming melts the polar sea ice, these marine hunters are increasingly being forced onto land. The risk is rising of conflict with the humans, who are also arriving in greater numbers as Russia develops oil and gas deposits and expands its military capabilities in the Arctic. In response, coastal towns have started to organise “polar bear patrols” to scare off intruders with snowmobiles and flares. A polar bear looks into a window in Amderma Almost every resident of Amderma has seen a polar bear, even the youngest, and many are surprisingly blasé about the predators\u0027 presence. Anastasia Popovich, now 15, was walking home with friends in May 2016 when they ran into a bear cub they initially mistook for a huge white dog.“The white thing turned, and we understood that it wasn\u0027t a dog,” she remembered. “We saw the cub turn toward us and we froze in horror.”The girls tried to hide in a nearby abandoned building but couldn\u0027t open the door, so they ran to the guard booth at a vehicle depot. Her father, a member of the local polar bear patrol, had had an even closer call when he came face to face with a bear coming out of his fishing hut once the year before that. Luckily, the creature immediately ran from his shouts.“It was terrifying just because it was such a surprise. I just yelled,” Yury Popovich said. “If he didn\u0027t like me he could have hit me with a paw or grabbed me.”Amderma polar bear patrol member Yury Popovich dries his catch from a recent fishing expeditionEight polar bears have come into Amderma already this year, compared to five all last year, according to Eduard Davletshin, the head of the patrol. He grew up in a house on the seashore frequented by bears and would sometimes had to stay home from school because one was lurking outside. But he said there have been more bears in Amderma in the past decade.“They used to go on the ice to hunt seals,” he said. “Now there\u0027s no ice, they have no choice. They go along the shore, and the town is in the way.”Although it is the world\u0027s largest land predator, the polar bear actually prefers to spend its time on sea ice and is classified as the “sea bear,” or “Ursus maritimus”. Called the “white bear” in Russian, it blends in almost seamlessly as it sneaks up to breathing holes to snatch harp or spotted seals, as shown in David Attenborough\u0027s Our Planet series last month.Bears often swim more than 100 miles to reach ice packs and can spend almost all of their lives at sea. That is changing, however, with global warming.A curious polar bear visits the Amderma meteorological stationIn February, the restricted-access military town of Belushya Guba across the Kara Strait from Amderma declared a state of emergency following an “invasion” of 52 polar bears. CCTV cameras caught one polar bear walking the hallway to a young family\u0027s flat. “The emotions are indescribable, adrenaline, terror and the question \u0027what to do,\u0027” postal worker Nadezhda Kireyeva told The  at the time.Experts blamed the invasion on the lack of sea ice and an open rubbish dump where groups of bears were seen foraging.The predators departed when sea ice finally formed off the coast in late February. But that can hardly be counted on for the future. Meteorologist Andrei Mikushin examines a snowmobile seat that was recently bitten up by a hungry polar bearThis year, Arctic sea ice hit a new record low for April, and a study predicted that the Arctic Ocean would become ice-free in the summer within the next 20 years.In Amderma, the “fast ice” that is firmly attached to the coast has been forming later and not growing as thick, according to meteorologist Nelli Shuvalova, who has been measuring the ice here twice a day since 1981. This year, the maximum extent of the fast ice was 10 kilometres—some years it has stretched to the horizon 26 kilometres away—and its maximum thickness was 60 centimetres. “That\u0027s really small,” Ms Shuvalova said. “The ice is thin for bears.”“We have a catastrophic situation with the fast ice,” polar bear expert Ilya Mordvintsev said while visiting Amderma last week. “When the ice comes south in the winter, so do the bears. When it recedes the majority don\u0027t make it back onto the ice.”These stragglers tend to head north along the coast in search of ice—which means towns like Amderma are now essentially located on a polar bear highway.Amderma was home to as many as 20,000 people before a fighter jet regiment moved away in 1993. Today it has just 300 residents, though its town hall hopes to boost its fortunes by attracting back Russian troops, as well as scientists and tourists.Stranded polar bears often head north looking for ice, a route that leads them through AmdermaEither way, those townspeople still here are mostly determined to stay, and 25 children attend the town school—which is located next to a windswept beach frequented by bears. Whenever one comes into the town, the school calls parents to take their children home early. Other Arctic settlements are growing quickly. Belushya Guba, with a population of 2,000, is developing a new military facilities, airstrip and port, and there are plans to mine lead and zinc nearby. Vladimir Putin cut the ribbon on the Sabetta gas plant on the northern coast in 2017. Moscow has also revamped several Arctic bases in recent years. Two schoolchildren laugh on near the Amderma administration buildingAll that increases the risk of human-bear run-ins, which can turn violent if the animal is ill or hungry—or is provoked by boorish behaviour. An oil and gas worker was killed by a polar bear on Franz Josef Land in 2016, and a meteorologist was killed there in 2011. While polar bears can weigh upward of 1,300 pounds and run 25 miles per hour or faster, they aren\u0027t typically aggressive toward humans and can usually be scared off by loud noises and moving vehicles. “To avoid instances of harm to people and shooting of polar bears as problematic animals, it\u0027s better to take action creating these bear patrols that could avoid such conflict situations,” Mr Mordvintsev said. Amderma decided to move its rubbish dump after the \u0026#39polar bear invasion\u0026#39 in nearby Belushya Guba in FebruaryAmderma hunters started a polar bear patrol in 2017 with flares, rubber bullets and flashbangs from the regional government and a quad cycle from WWF. Due to fuel problems, they more often ride their own snowmobiles. Similar groups have been started in the nearby towns of Ust-Kara and Varnek. Other measures include a CCTV system installed last year at a weather station on a nearby island, which clued in scientists to stay inside behind barred windows while a polar bear nosed around outside in February.During their visit last week, WWF and regional officials promised the Amderma patrol radios, fuel and satellite phones to upload photographs of bears. They also played top 40 dance hits to test the loudspeaker warning system, which residents have complained is too quiet and unreliable.Polar bear patrol leader Eduard Davletshin drinks tea in his kitchen overlooking the Arctic coastAt a meeting in the hall of the Soviet-built “palace of culture,” Mr Mordvintsev and WWF employees advised locals not to run from any polar bear they might see but rather back away slowly, so as not to trigger its predatory instinct.If they don\u0027t have something to bang on, they should make a “sh” sound to mimic bears\u0027 own warning vocalisations.In reality, residents said they\u0027re more afraid of Arctic foxes, which can be aggressive and infected with rabies. They often like to photograph polar bears that come—and some have even taken selfies with the creatures.Meteorologist Lyudmila Maksimova takes a selfie with a polar bearThe meeting finished with a short debate about whether scientists should try to save the polar bear at all. “The polar bear is the top of the food chain and a symbol of the Arctic,” Mr Mordvintsev said. “If there was no polar bear, what would we do here? If there was no polar bear here, would you be at peace?”The audience began murmuring before one woman came up with an answer: “It would be boring!” Please review our commenting policy EU election UK results and maps: Brexit Party wins nine of 10 regions, Lib Dems triumph in LondonEuropean Elections results live: Brexit Party triumphs while Tories and Labour suffer heavy lossesJeremy Corbyn under pressure from senior Labour figures to fully commit to second Brexit referendum after disastrous European election resultsWho won the UK’s European elections - Leave or Remain? Matteo Salvini triumphs in European elections, taking nearly 35 per cent of Italian vote Liberal Democrats \u0026#39back in business\u0026#39 as huge EU elections gains see them beat Tories and LabourComment: European election results show UK is as ided as it ever was over BrexitChange UK tactical voting row: Anna Soubry criticises Heidi Allen as party fails to win single seat at European electionsTommy Robinson and Rachel Johnson lose out in EU elections as mixed fortunes for high-profile MEP candidatesEurope’s crumbling centre - why Emmanuel Macron is becoming kingmaker in a falling down castleComment: After three years of Brexit sound and fury, we are almost exactly where we were three years agoComment: Esther McVey\u0026#39s optimistic \u0026#39Blue Collar Conservatism\u0026#39 is just what our country needs Labour collapse in Scotland fuels SNP to \u0026#39best ever\u0026#39 European elections resultComment: How can we rise above the noise and chaos of modern politics?Comment: Politicians can no longer ignore the national outrage of university fundingNigel Farage demands seat at Brexit negotiating table and says European elections victory \u0026#39is just the beginning\u0026#39Comment: The Brexit Party\u0026#39s EU elections triumph leaves the political class stuck in a no-deal viceWhy moths matter more than your cashmere scarf as charity warns they are under threatConservatives slump to lowest national vote share ever in European electionLabour erupts into civil war over European elections as Jeremy Corbyn calls for second referendum or general electionWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/26/TELEMMGLPICT000198539556_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqXrKVwB25uHhXDARmIJ6BhfHHj71g0-OjBEoYkgsNYmU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"yoga instructor lost 16 days hawaii ate moths berries survive","story":"Amanda Eller speaks from her hospital bed at Maui Memorial Medical Center in Hawaii, May 25, 2019A yoga instructor who was lost for more than two weeks in the wilds of Hawaii \u0027ate moths\u0027 as she battled to survive.Amanda Eller, 35, spoke for the first time this weekend about her ordeal, saying she almost gave up deep in the jungle. Miss Eller spent 16 days wondering the Makawao Forest Reserve on the island of Maui after becoming lost during what was meant to be a quick three-mile hike. So quick, in fact, that she had left her mobile phone and water battle behind in her car.Speaking to the New York Times on Saturday, 24 hours after she was spotted by a search helicopter hired by her frantic parents, she said from her hospital bed: “I wanted to give up. ”But the only option I had was life or death. ”I heard this voice that said, ‘If you want to live, keep going.”After several days, tracking in an area inahabited by wild boars, she fell twenty feet into a deep ravine and fractured her leg. Weak and injured, she began to crawl instead of walk. ”I was getting so skinny that I was really starting to doubt if I could survive.”  Julia Eller, her relieved mother, told local news outlets that wild berries and even a few moths were all that sustained her. She tried to catch some crawfish but was ”not very successful.”Eller smiles surrounded by her rescuers Mrs Eller added: ”She lost quite a bit of weight, as you can imagine, being lost for that amount of time. “But she was able to survive it. She had the right skills and did the right things to buy time so that we had a chance to find her.”One night, Miss Eller took shelter in a boar’s den.  She covered herself in leaves and mud to stay warm. On the 17th day of her disappearance, she was spotted by an elated rescuer 4 miles away from the original search area.The local fire crew went in to retrieve her. She was sunburnt and malnourished. ”I looked up and they were right on top of me,” said Miss Eller of the moment she saw the helicopter. “I was like, ‘Oh my God,’ and I just broke down and started bawling.” EU election UK results and maps: Brexit Party wins nine of 10 regions, Lib Dems triumph in LondonEuropean Elections results live: Brexit Party triumphs while Tories and Labour suffer heavy lossesJeremy Corbyn under pressure from senior Labour figures to fully commit to second Brexit referendum after disastrous European election resultsWho won the UK’s European elections - Leave or Remain? Matteo Salvini triumphs in European elections, taking nearly 35 per cent of Italian vote Liberal Democrats \u0026#39back in business\u0026#39 as huge EU elections gains see them beat Tories and LabourComment: European election results show UK is as ided as it ever was over BrexitChange UK tactical voting row: Anna Soubry criticises Heidi Allen as party fails to win single seat at European electionsTommy Robinson and Rachel Johnson lose out in EU elections as mixed fortunes for high-profile MEP candidatesEurope’s crumbling centre - why Emmanuel Macron is becoming kingmaker in a falling down castleComment: After three years of Brexit sound and fury, we are almost exactly where we were three years agoComment: Esther McVey\u0026#39s optimistic \u0026#39Blue Collar Conservatism\u0026#39 is just what our country needs Labour collapse in Scotland fuels SNP to \u0026#39best ever\u0026#39 European elections resultComment: How can we rise above the noise and chaos of modern politics?Comment: Politicians can no longer ignore the national outrage of university fundingNigel Farage demands seat at Brexit negotiating table and says European elections victory \u0026#39is just the beginning\u0026#39Comment: The Brexit Party\u0026#39s EU elections triumph leaves the political class stuck in a no-deal viceWhy moths matter more than your cashmere scarf as charity warns they are under threatConservatives slump to lowest national vote share ever in European electionLabour erupts into civil war over European elections as Jeremy Corbyn calls for second referendum or general electionWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/27/TELEMMGLPICT000198639807_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqEDjTm7JpzhSGR1_8ApEWQA1vLvhkMtVb21dMmpQBfEs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"matteo salvini triumphs european elections taking nearly 35","story":"Matteo Salvini expresses his gratitude to voters - \u0026#39First party in Italy, thank you\u0026#39 the sign readsMatteo Salvini and his hard-Right League party have triumphed in the European parliament elections, winning nearly 35 per cent of the vote in Italy, provisional results show.The results confirm Mr Salvini’s status as one of the most influential populist politicians in Europe, as he seeks to forge a populist, nationalist bloc in the European Parliament.With around one-third of the Italian vote, the League is poised to become one of the biggest parties in the parliament with 28 seats, according to provisional results.A beaming Mr Salvini posted a photograph of himself with a hand-drawn sign saying “First party in Italy – thank you” on social media.On a bookshelf behind him was a photograph of Vladimir Putin, a book about the Russian president and a baseball cap with the slogan Make America Great Again.The results from across the continent, which produced strong showings for other populist parties, sends a strong signal that the European people are asking for a different Europe,” Mr Salvini said.He forecast that populist and nationalist parties will control at least 150 seats in the new 751-seat European Parliament.Not only is the League the first party in Italy, but also Marine Le Pen is the first party in France, Nigel Farage is the first party in the UK. Therefore, Italy, France, the UK - it is the sign of a Europe that is changing. The Five Star Movement, the other half of the ruling coalition, were on Monday struggling to come to terms with a deeply disappointing result, taking just 17 per cent of the vote – just under half that of the League.They came in as the third biggest party, beaten to second place by the Democratic Party, Italy’s centre-Left force, which won 22 per cent.The League’s strong performance is likely to lead to jostling for greater power within the coalition and confirms Mr Salvini, who is interior minister and deputy prime minister, as by far the most powerful politician in Italy.The prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, is a largely powerless figurehead with the unenviable task of mediating between the fractious coalition partners, while Luigi Di Maio, the leader of Five Star, has seen his authority further diminished by the results.Five Star performed particularly poorly in the north of Italy, relegating them to a party with its support base largely in the south.The results will strengthen Mr Salvini’s hand in his negotiations with Five Star over the many policies on which they have clashed in recent months, from migrants and tax reform to big infrastructure projects.The League’s strong showing compares to the 17.4 per cent it won at last year’s general election and 6.2 per cent at the last European ballot in 2014. Mr Salvini has transformed it from a weak, marginal party that once campaigned for secession for northern Italy from the rest of the country, into a formidable national force.Please review our commenting policy EU election UK results and maps: Brexit Party wins nine of 10 regions, Lib Dems triumph in LondonEuropean Elections results live: Brexit Party triumphs while Tories and Labour suffer heavy lossesJeremy Corbyn under pressure from senior Labour figures to fully commit to second Brexit referendum after disastrous European election resultsWho won the UK’s European elections - Leave or Remain? Liberal Democrats \u0026#39back in business\u0026#39 as huge EU elections gains see them beat Tories and LabourComment: European election results show UK is as ided as it ever was over BrexitChange UK tactical voting row: Anna Soubry criticises Heidi Allen as party fails to win single seat at European electionsTommy Robinson and Rachel Johnson lose out in EU elections as mixed fortunes for high-profile MEP candidatesEurope’s crumbling centre - why Emmanuel Macron is becoming kingmaker in a falling down castleComment: After three years of Brexit sound and fury, we are almost exactly where we were three years agoComment: Esther McVey\u0026#39s optimistic \u0026#39Blue Collar Conservatism\u0026#39 is just what our country needs Labour collapse in Scotland fuels SNP to \u0026#39best ever\u0026#39 European elections resultComment: How can we rise above the noise and chaos of modern politics?Comment: Politicians can no longer ignore the national outrage of university fundingNigel Farage demands seat at Brexit negotiating table and says European elections victory \u0026#39is just the beginning\u0026#39Comment: The Brexit Party\u0026#39s EU elections triumph leaves the political class stuck in a no-deal viceWhy moths matter more than your cashmere scarf as charity warns they are under threatConservatives slump to lowest national vote share ever in European electionLabour erupts into civil war over European elections as Jeremy Corbyn calls for second referendum or general electionLondon European election results see Liberal Democrats defeat LabourWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 27 may 2019","story":"French President Emmanuel Macron\u0027s wife Brigitte, right, hugs a supporter after voting in the European parliamentary elections in Le Touquet, northern France, Sunday May 26, 2019.

It was one its lead character would have approved of: as with many of the soundtracks on this list, High Fidelity’s success lies in a balance between old-school gems by the Velvet Underground, The Kinks and Elvis Costello to Noughties newcomers like Stereolab and Royal Trux.This may seem like sacrilege given that the first Dirty Dancing soundtrack is indisputably the more iconic of the two. And yes, the sequel (essentially a remake set in Cuba during the 1950s), starring Romola Garai and future Rogue One star Diego Luna, suffered from a plot loaded with clichés and lack of chemistry between its two lead actors. But the soundtrack – featuring the Grammy-nominated Latin fusion band Yerba Buena, Colombian rock band Aterciopelados, and the Cuban hip hop group Orishasis – is what draws me back to this guilty pleasure of a film. Dirty Dancing 2 didn’t really deserve such a soundtrack, but it adds some actual heat to a film that, asides from the superb dance routines, leaves you cold.Martin Scorsese had strict rules for the soundtrack to his film Goodfellas: each song had to have been around during the time in which the scene was set, and the tracks had to make some kind of comment on the scene or character in question “in an oblique way”. A staggering 48 songs are heard during the film, including classics by Dean Martin, Fred Astaire and The Drifters, Sid Vicious, The Who and The Rolling Stones. One of the most unforgettable moments is when Bobby Darin’s “Beyond the Sea” plays as the Wise Guys cook dinner, which was “always a big thing” in prison.When it comes to soundtracking your movie, it helps if the director is a massive music nerd. Of course, music was always going to play a huge part in a film about a boy in a band and his video game quest to win the girl of his dreams. But Edgar Wright, a former music video director, found a way to seamlessly integrate his soundtrack into Scott Pilgrim vs the World’s narrative. Beck, who wrote the music for Scott Pilgrim’s garage band Sex Bob-omb, was a perfect match for their chaotic, DIY approach, while Metric’s song “Black Sheep” was used for a performance by ex-girlfriend Envy Adams’s (Brie Larson) band The Clash at Demonhead.Drive wouldn’t have worked as well as it did without the soundtrack. Steven Soderbergh\u0027s go-to composer Cliff Martinez assembled the songs for Nicolas Winding Refn’s ambitious indie project, showing an understanding that the most effective soundtracks are often the ones that transport you into the movie without you realising. By using a set of mostly female vocalists, all of whom sing over dry electronic beats, Martinez achieved a sonic portrayal of Drive’s startling juxtaposition between beauty and violence.It’s the biggest movie soundtrack of all time and the 15th best-selling album in the US. Whitney Houston breathed new life into songs by Dolly Parton (“I Will Always Love You”) and Chaka Khan (“I’m Every Woman”). Five of the songs performed by Houston were hits: I Will Always Love You, I\u0027m Every Woman, I Have Nothing, Run to You (both Oscar-nominated), and Queen of the NightYes, it was the Fab Four\u0027s worst film, but the soundtrack is packed with some of their best songs: “I am the Walrus”, She Loves You and “Hello, Goodbye”. Where A Hard Day’s Night, Yellow Submarine and Help were undoubtedly more influential on popular culture, Magical Mystery Tour is the most fun to listen to – regardless of how much effort is required to watch.Few films offer as comprehensive a look at hip-hop stars during the heights of their creative powers – even though the movie itself was a clumsily written crime drama. Belly’s soundtrack captured the East Coast rap scene as it stepped towards a grittier sound and underwent one of the most important transitions for any genre in music history – with contributions from the likes of D’Angelo, members of the Wu-Tang Clan, Nas and Jay-Z.At the time, it felt like Richard Kelly’s dark and gloomy film starring a young Jake Gyllenhaal was one of the few to truly capture what it meant to be a confused, alienated teenager. With composer Michael Andrews, Kelly picked some the best songs from an era that dealt in existential angst via upbeat synth-pop: Echo and the Bunnymen, Duran Duran, Tears for Fears, The Pet Shop Boys and more. By choosing to close the film on Michael Andrews’ cover of Tears for Fears’ “Mad World”, Kelly underpins both the self-absorbed attitude of teenagers convinced that only the artists singing these songs truly understood them, and the nostalgia felt by their parents who were there in the moment.Midnight Cowboy – the first X-rated film to win the Oscar for Best Picture – took original material and pre-existing songs to complement the theme of a naïve cowboywannabe sex worker trying to survive in a big city, and the juxtaposition between Jon Voight’s character Joe Buck and dying con artist “Ratso” (Dustin Hoffman). Fred Neil\u0027s song “Everybody\u0027s Talkin\u0027”, which underscores the first act, won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Vocal Performance, Male (for Harry Nilsson).Trent Reznor’s work on David Lynch’s 1997 neo-noir movie is loaded with stark electronics and instrumentals by Angelo Badalamenti. In between, you have Smashing Pumpkins, Nine Inch Nails and, of course, This Mortal Coil’s “Song to the Siren” – a track that caught Lynch’s attention and inspired him to co-write two albums for Twin Peaks chanteuse Julee Cruise.1240 29. The Last Days of Disco (1998)Whit Stillman’s 1998 indie-classic starred then-virtual unknowns Kate Beckinsale and Chloë Sevigny as friends and roommates in early-Eighties New York. Add that to a wall-to-wall disco soundtrack and you’ve got an intoxicating film, set 20 years after the genre’s heyday, with classic dancefloor anthems from Chic, Diana Ross, and Sister Sledge belted out one after the other.  In the summer of 1992, the soundtrack to a film that flopped at the box office offered the masses the gateway they needed into the Seattle grunge scene. Cameron Crowe wanted the Singles soundtrack to be “more like a simple mixtape of Seattle’s finest”, and ended up with a veritable who’s-who of every important band from that moment in music history: Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Smashing Pumpkins, Soundgarden and Mudhoney… everyone apart from Nirvana. Regardless, almost three decades after the film’s release, the soundtrack serves as a landmark for one of the most pivotal moments in music history.Adapting literary classics to modern-day high-school scenarios was the big thing in the Nineties. Cruel Intentions came from Pierre Choderlos de Laclos’s 18th-century work, Les Liaisons Dangereuses, and starred Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe as Kathryn and Sebastian: two spoilt, bored rich kids toying with the naïve and virtuous Annette (Reese Witherspoon). John Ottman was originally enlisted to compose the score, but producers decided that wouldn’t sit well with the teenage demographic it was going for and instead plumped for a soundtrack of Placebo, Blur, Skunk Anansie, Aimee Mann and Counting Crows. This mix of credible and corny mirrors a typical experience we go through as adolescents, discovering iniduality via the music we listen to and trying to leave the theatrics behind. The cult status of both the featured music and the film itself suggests we can never let the drama go completely.Flashdance, the first collaboration between producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, is important because it actually changed how some of the most popular films of the Eighties were shot. For each song featured in the film there is a scene presented in the same way as a music video, like the use of “Maniac” as Alex (Jennifer Beals) trains for her dance audition, or the lead song of the film “What a Feeling”, which plays during the opening montage of the steel mill. The latter, written by Italian composer Giorgio Moroder, Keith Forsey and Irene Cara (who performed the track), became the singer’s first and only number one hit. It also won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, a Golden Globe, and a Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Michael Sembello’s “Maniac”, meanwhile, went on to become one of the highest-grossing songs ever written for a film.While Half Nelson isn’t as highly regarded as Lars and the Real Girl or Drive,  it’s the one that helped Ryan Gosling break away from his status as the heartthrob from The Notebook. It also has a phenomenal soundtrack steered by Broken Social Scene, whose brilliant collection of B-sides proved indispensable for this film about a drug-addicted middle-school teacher struggling to deal with the aftermath of a breakup. In between those tracks you’ve got gritty hip hop that shows Dan\u0027s crossover into the world of his pupil, the stoic Drey (Shareeka Epps) – from New York collective Dujeous, to Rhymefest.1740 24. Lost in Translation (2003)Sofia Coppola has a history of needle drops that encapsulate certain moods that can’t be expressed through dialogue, particularly if it involves a medley of shoegaze from Air and My Bloody Valentine, and the full-throttle debauchery of Peaches on “Fuck the Pain Away”. The soundtrack was so influential that several critics suggested it had something to do with the rebirth of shoegaze in the mid-Noughties. Either way, there a few better songs to close a film than Jesus and Mary Chain’s “Just Like Honey”, that plays just after the kiss goodbye between Bob (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) and that indecipherable whisper.Former Massive Attack producer Nellee Hooper is the brainchild behind one of the greatest film soundtracks of all time. Working with composers Craig Armstrong and Marius de Vries, he beta-tested many of the tracks that ended up on the album by playing them at 5am to afterparty guests at his house in London. Others took direct inspiration from Shakespeare’s original text, with Justin Warfield of One Inch Punch and Art Alexakis of Everclear both allowed to watch early edits of scenes from the film to inspire them. Like the soundtracks for Kill Bill, Trainspotting and Marie Antoinette, it’s the vast eclecticism of the songs featured in Romeo + Juliet that make you remember each one, and the scene where each is used, for years after first seeing the film.As well as making a star of reggae singer Jimmy Cliff, both the film and soundtrack for The Harder They Come exposed mainstream audiences to the emerging Kingston recording industry, helping bring the genre to the US and beyond. Only the title track was an original recorded by Cliff for the movie the rest were singles released in Jamaica between 1967 and 1972, including Cliff’s superb “You Can Get it if You Really Want”, plus songs from seminal artists like Toots and the Maytals and Desmond Dekker.A veritable masterpiece: The Beach soundtrack is what gives this film starring a fresh-faced Leonardo DiCaprio its vitality, capturing the essence of the trance music heard during Thai beach parties during the Nineties. It was supervised by Pete Tong, who said the songs, including Moby’s “Porcelain” and Dario G’s “Voices”, are what make the film “watchable time and time again”. The way the music progresses mirrors the grit and darkness that begin to emerge out of paradise.2140 20. Pretty in Pink (1986)John Hughes virtually pioneered the formula for teen movies soundtracked by angsty British post-punk rock. Echo \u0026amp the Bunnymen, The Smiths, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and New Order all appeared on what is essentially Hughes’s checklist of what cool kids were – or should have been – listening to in the Eighties.    Curated and co-executive produced by Kendrick Lamar, the Black Panther soundtrack brought on a select group of extraordinary talent that would understand the themes in the film, from Anderson .Paak to Earl Sweatshirt. Leading this group is Lamar himself, undoubtedly the best choice of artist for a film that explores responsibility, black power, family dynamics and loyalty. Where Jay-Z failed to step aside on the Great Gatsby soundtrack and let other artists do their thing, Lamar is more interested in highlighting the skills of his fellow artists, like South African singer Babes Wodumo, or Jorja Smith. It’s true that the Black Panther album pales in comparison to some of Lamar’s solo work, but it’s rare to see a soundtrack that so deeply considers the subject matter it has been presented with, and the responsibility of continuing the story through music.2340 18. Dazed and Confused (1993)Dazed and Confused was relatable even if you didn’t happen to spend your teenage years riding shotgun in a 1975 Chevy El Camino. This is largely due to director Richard Linklater highlighting an era of raucous butt-rock anthems and stoner jams, from Alice Cooper’s “School’s Out” to Ted Nugent’s “Stranglehold”.In a year that was saturated with serious historical and period dramas, from a remake of Jane Eyre to The Queen, Marie Antoinette stood out for its highly stylised and fun approach to a well-known figure. Director Sofia Coppola took a similar approach with the music as James Gunn did for s of the Galaxy, mixing new wave and post-punk – including The Strokes, New Order, Adam and the Ants and The Cure – with period music by Baroque composers Vivaldi and Couperin. By doing so, Coppola gave her audience something to relate to, and a soundtrack that suited Marie Antoinette’s rebellious teenage spirit. The best example of this is in the shopping scene – set to the song “I Want Candy” by Bow Wow Wow – that famously included a pair of purple Converse: one of the most defining fashion items of Nineties teen culture. It is a brilliant yet subtle alignment of modern Western consumerism and the outrageous decadence at Versailles during the 18th century.One of the most eclectic compilations to grace cinema-goers’ ears in recent years: the Call Me By Your Name soundtrack wins for those three songs by Sufjan Stevens alone. The American singer-songwriter remixed his 2010 track “Futile Devices” and also wrote two new songs specifically for the film: “Visions of Gideon” and “Mystery of Love”, the latter of which was nominated for the Best Original Song Oscar. Director Luca Guadagnino worked with film editor Walter Fasano and music supervisor Robin Urdang, all understanding that music would play a “vital role”. He wanted the music to give the film a “precise identity” that would act as a “voice” in the movie, he told Billboard. “That’s when I thought of Sufjan Stevens.” Other tracks, like the buoyant “Love My Way” by The Psychedelic Furs, captured the wistful, heady nature of hot, endless summers in Italy during the Eighties.Of course, any biopic about the rise and fall of gangsta rap collective NWA had to have a killer soundtrack – especially if its former members were involved in its production. Even so, the meticulous care with which the soundtrack for Straight Outta Compton was assembled is impressive, and provides backdrop for an origin story about some of the most influential and important records – and artists – of the Eighties and Nineties.2740 14. 500 Days of Summer (2009)This offbeat romantic comedy has developed cult status over the years and stood out at the time for its original take on the “boy meets girl” genre. Music is what first drew characters Summer (Zoe Deschanel) and Tom (Joseph Gordon Levitt) together (they start talking after Summer overhears The Smiths playing on Tom’s MP3 player). Each song mirrors the various highs and lows the characters go through, helped by director Marc Webb’s background making music videos for indie pop artists. Regina Spektor’s song “Hero” is the perfect backdrop for the scene where Tom realises his hopes of getting back with Summer are futile the track closes on the lyric “no one’s got it all”, as if to point out that not everyone gets the fairytale ending they hope for.A veritable smorgasbord for any self-respecting music nerd: Baby Driver took movie soundtracks to a whole other plane. The Fault in Our Stars actor Ansel Elgort stars as “Baby”, a skilled getaway driver who relies on a steady stream of music in order to counteract the effects of tinnitus.There are vintage cuts from The Beach Boys, Beck and Barry White, and Seventies rock gems by Queen and Golden Earring. Yet it was the slightly more unassuming song “Bellbottoms” from the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion album Orange that initially inspired the film. A then 21-year-old Edgar Wright was sitting in his bedroom, “completely broke”, when he began to visualise a car chase set to the songs on that album.George Lucas managed to amplify the already-nostalgic mood on his “summer of ‘62” film by choosing songs from the mid-to-late Fifties as the lead tracks on the American Graffiti soundtrack. Songs from Buddy Holly and Chuck Berry to The Beach Boys are all presented by legendary disc jockey Wolfman Jack.3040 11. 10 Things I Hate About YouIf Pretty in Pink captured teenage angst in the Eighties, 10 Things I Hate About You achieved it for the decade that followed. Unlike many films of the Nineties, which attempted to capitalise on the major rock stars of the day, 10 Things managed to select what is essentially a list of one-hit wonders, from Letters to Cleo and Semisonic to Save Ferris. When you watch the film today, it only serves to fuel that feeling of nostalgia and add to its ever-growing cult status.3140 10. Do the Right Thing (1989)Spike Lee’s Brooklyn-based masterpiece is set to a breathtaking jazz score conducted and composed by his father, Bill Lee. It’s also punctuated by summer jams and blissful ballads, or the urgent demands of Public Enemy’s “Fight the Power”, which is played from Radio Raheem’s boombox a number of times through the film.Until Eden, there was no film about club culture that took the scene seriously. French filmmaker Mia Hansen-Love’s character Paul (Felix de Givry) is based on the experiences of her brother Sven – a relatively popular DJ who had to look on as his peers, including Daft Punk, achieved global fame by pioneering the early EDM scene. Its soundtrack offers a comprehensive look at the house, jungle and garage music that was the lifeblood of Paris youth culture in the Nineties, but is also carefully chosen to match the situation of the film’s characters. Daft Punk’s “Veridis Quo” signals a mood-change at a celebratory dinner, while “Happy Song” by Charles Dockins conveys Paul’s euphoria as his hero Tony Humphries works the decks in a New York club.  This was one of the first films to be defined by its music Mike Nichols also helped pioneer the practice of curating pre-existing songs that would appeal to a pop radio audience. Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel’s music was the perfect fit when it came to music that would show Dustin Hoffman’s character’s intensifying feelings of isolation, particular whenever “The Sounds of Silence” was used.This was one of the first films to also be defined by its music Mike Nichols also helped pioneer the practice of curating pre-existing songs that would appeal to a pop radio audience. Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel’s music was the perfect fit when it came to music that would show Dustin Hoffman’s character’s intensifying feelings of isolation, particular whenever “The Sounds of Silence” was used.Curtis Mayfield’s third studio album was released as the soundtrack to the Blaxploitation film of the same name. It was groundbreaking for its themes of poverty and drug abuse which made the record stand out among the less socially aware music of its time. It would go on to influence everyone from TV score composers to soul singers in the decades that followed.3540 6. s of the Galaxy (2014)The soundtrack for Danny Boyle’s adaptation of Irvine Welsh’s novel was so popular it promoted a release of a second soundtrack a year later, in 1997. After two decades, it still holds up as one of the greatest and most lovingly curated collections of songs in music history. The use of “Lust for Life” in the opening scene triggered something of a career renaissance for Iggy Pop (one that many would argue didn’t do him many favours). There’s a romanticised overdose set to Lou Reed’s “Perfect Day”, and Heaven 17 soundtrack a club scene with “Temptation”. A particularly disgusting toilet scene is set to Brian Eno’s “Deep Blue Day” and French composer Georges Bizet’s “Carmen Suite No.2”.Quentin Tarantino didn’t commission a traditional film score for what is arguably his most adored film, 1994’s Pulp Fiction. Instead, he mixed American surf music and classic rock and roll, including the late Dick Dale’s “Misirlou” in the iconic opening scene. The track was suggested to Tarantino by musician Boyd Rice, via their mutual friend Allison Anders. The soundtrack had such an impact – reaching number 21 on the Billboard 200 and selling more than two million units by 1996 – that it was credited with “reinvigorating” surf rock and sparking a trend by advertisers to use it in their commercials, “to help sell everything from burritos to toothpaste”. Chuck Berry’s song “You Never Can Tell”, also known as “C’est la Vie”, also enjoyed a resurgence in popularity thanks to its use in the famous dance scene with Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta). Neither Cameron Crowe nor his music coordinator Danny Bramson wanted to pander to the charts for this story based on the director’s years as a teenage rock journalist. If anything, they avoided tracks that seemed like potential radio favourites, choosing lesser-known songs like “Sparks” from The Who’s album Tommy as the theme for Crowe’s alter-ego William Miller. The music is essentially a whole other character – a narrator who offers running commentary on the scenarios the others find themselves in. And there are few scenes more uplifting than the one in Almost Famous where, having retrieved guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) from a drugs and alcohol-fuelled party, the fictional band Stillwater and their crew take up a rowdy singalong to Elton John’s “Tiny Dancer”.Prince\u0027s acting debut took place in a film that also produced one of his greatest works. The concept for the plot, about a talented but tortured frontman of a band in Minneapolis, was developed by Prince during his 1999 tour. Purple Rain was one of the 10 highest-grossing films of 1984 and shows Prince as his best and most outrageous self. Yet the songs also provided a window through the Purple One\u0027s enigmatic facade, to reveal the soul beneath.The Wu-Tang Clan’s RZA worked with director Quentin Tarantino on the collection of music that would accompany Uma Thurman’s character The Bride on her bloody quest for revenge. What is particularly brilliant is the alternation between non-diegetic sound and the silence that precedes and lasts during some of the most tense action sequences. When it comes to the most crucial battle between O-Ren Ishii and The Bride at the end of the film, they first chose the disco flamenco intro from Santa Esmeralda\u0027s Latin arrangement of “Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood”. At the gory conclusion, where O-Ren falls, RZA and Tarantino used Meiko Kaji’s “The Flower of Carnage”. The song was first used in the 1973 martial arts film Lady Snowblood, in which Kaji starred. She sings: “I’m a woman who walks at the brink of life and death Who emptied my tears many moons ago” and then: “I’ve immersed my body in the river of vengeance.” It\u0027s as though the song was written with The Bride in mind.Before Garden State and 500 Days of Summer, the team behind the adaptation of Nick Hornby’s novel compiled 15 tracks like a mixtape. It was one its lead character would have approved of: as with many of the soundtracks on this list, High Fidelity’s success lies in a balance between old-school gems by the Velvet Underground, The Kinks and Elvis Costello to Noughties newcomers like Stereolab and Royal Trux.This may seem like sacrilege given that the first Dirty Dancing soundtrack is indisputably the more iconic of the two. And yes, the sequel (essentially a remake set in Cuba during the 1950s), starring Romola Garai and future Rogue One star Diego Luna, suffered from a plot loaded with clichés and lack of chemistry between its two lead actors. But the soundtrack – featuring the Grammy-nominated Latin fusion band Yerba Buena, Colombian rock band Aterciopelados, and the Cuban hip hop group Orishasis – is what draws me back to this guilty pleasure of a film. Dirty Dancing 2 didn’t really deserve such a soundtrack, but it adds some actual heat to a film that, asides from the superb dance routines, leaves you cold.Martin Scorsese had strict rules for the soundtrack to his film Goodfellas: each song had to have been around during the time in which the scene was set, and the tracks had to make some kind of comment on the scene or character in question “in an oblique way”. A staggering 48 songs are heard during the film, including classics by Dean Martin, Fred Astaire and The Drifters, Sid Vicious, The Who and The Rolling Stones. One of the most unforgettable moments is when Bobby Darin’s “Beyond the Sea” plays as the Wise Guys cook dinner, which was “always a big thing” in prison.When it comes to soundtracking your movie, it helps if the director is a massive music nerd. Of course, music was always going to play a huge part in a film about a boy in a band and his video game quest to win the girl of his dreams. But Edgar Wright, a former music video director, found a way to seamlessly integrate his soundtrack into Scott Pilgrim vs the World’s narrative. Beck, who wrote the music for Scott Pilgrim’s garage band Sex Bob-omb, was a perfect match for their chaotic, DIY approach, while Metric’s song “Black Sheep” was used for a performance by ex-girlfriend Envy Adams’s (Brie Larson) band The Clash at Demonhead.Drive wouldn’t have worked as well as it did without the soundtrack. Steven Soderbergh\u0027s go-to composer Cliff Martinez assembled the songs for Nicolas Winding Refn’s ambitious indie project, showing an understanding that the most effective soundtracks are often the ones that transport you into the movie without you realising. By using a set of mostly female vocalists, all of whom sing over dry electronic beats, Martinez achieved a sonic portrayal of Drive’s startling juxtaposition between beauty and violence.It’s the biggest movie soundtrack of all time and the 15th best-selling album in the US. Whitney Houston breathed new life into songs by Dolly Parton (“I Will Always Love You”) and Chaka Khan (“I’m Every Woman”). Five of the songs performed by Houston were hits: I Will Always Love You, I\u0027m Every Woman, I Have Nothing, Run to You (both Oscar-nominated), and Queen of the NightYes, it was the Fab Four\u0027s worst film, but the soundtrack is packed with some of their best songs: “I am the Walrus”, She Loves You and “Hello, Goodbye”. Where A Hard Day’s Night, Yellow Submarine and Help were undoubtedly more influential on popular culture, Magical Mystery Tour is the most fun to listen to – regardless of how much effort is required to watch.Few films offer as comprehensive a look at hip-hop stars during the heights of their creative powers – even though the movie itself was a clumsily written crime drama. Belly’s soundtrack captured the East Coast rap scene as it stepped towards a grittier sound and underwent one of the most important transitions for any genre in music history – with contributions from the likes of D’Angelo, members of the Wu-Tang Clan, Nas and Jay-Z.At the time, it felt like Richard Kelly’s dark and gloomy film starring a young Jake Gyllenhaal was one of the few to truly capture what it meant to be a confused, alienated teenager. With composer Michael Andrews, Kelly picked some the best songs from an era that dealt in existential angst via upbeat synth-pop: Echo and the Bunnymen, Duran Duran, Tears for Fears, The Pet Shop Boys and more. By choosing to close the film on Michael Andrews’ cover of Tears for Fears’ “Mad World”, Kelly underpins both the self-absorbed attitude of teenagers convinced that only the artists singing these songs truly understood them, and the nostalgia felt by their parents who were there in the moment.Midnight Cowboy – the first X-rated film to win the Oscar for Best Picture – took original material and pre-existing songs to complement the theme of a naïve cowboywannabe sex worker trying to survive in a big city, and the juxtaposition between Jon Voight’s character Joe Buck and dying con artist “Ratso” (Dustin Hoffman). Fred Neil\u0027s song “Everybody\u0027s Talkin\u0027”, which underscores the first act, won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Vocal Performance, Male (for Harry Nilsson).Trent Reznor’s work on David Lynch’s 1997 neo-noir movie is loaded with stark electronics and instrumentals by Angelo Badalamenti. In between, you have Smashing Pumpkins, Nine Inch Nails and, of course, This Mortal Coil’s “Song to the Siren” – a track that caught Lynch’s attention and inspired him to co-write two albums for Twin Peaks chanteuse Julee Cruise.1240 29. The Last Days of Disco (1998)Whit Stillman’s 1998 indie-classic starred then-virtual unknowns Kate Beckinsale and Chloë Sevigny as friends and roommates in early-Eighties New York. Add that to a wall-to-wall disco soundtrack and you’ve got an intoxicating film, set 20 years after the genre’s heyday, with classic dancefloor anthems from Chic, Diana Ross, and Sister Sledge belted out one after the other.  In the summer of 1992, the soundtrack to a film that flopped at the box office offered the masses the gateway they needed into the Seattle grunge scene. Cameron Crowe wanted the Singles soundtrack to be “more like a simple mixtape of Seattle’s finest”, and ended up with a veritable who’s-who of every important band from that moment in music history: Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Smashing Pumpkins, Soundgarden and Mudhoney… everyone apart from Nirvana. Regardless, almost three decades after the film’s release, the soundtrack serves as a landmark for one of the most pivotal moments in music history.Adapting literary classics to modern-day high-school scenarios was the big thing in the Nineties. Cruel Intentions came from Pierre Choderlos de Laclos’s 18th-century work, Les Liaisons Dangereuses, and starred Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe as Kathryn and Sebastian: two spoilt, bored rich kids toying with the naïve and virtuous Annette (Reese Witherspoon). John Ottman was originally enlisted to compose the score, but producers decided that wouldn’t sit well with the teenage demographic it was going for and instead plumped for a soundtrack of Placebo, Blur, Skunk Anansie, Aimee Mann and Counting Crows. This mix of credible and corny mirrors a typical experience we go through as adolescents, discovering iniduality via the music we listen to and trying to leave the theatrics behind. The cult status of both the featured music and the film itself suggests we can never let the drama go completely.Flashdance, the first collaboration between producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, is important because it actually changed how some of the most popular films of the Eighties were shot. For each song featured in the film there is a scene presented in the same way as a music video, like the use of “Maniac” as Alex (Jennifer Beals) trains for her dance audition, or the lead song of the film “What a Feeling”, which plays during the opening montage of the steel mill. The latter, written by Italian composer Giorgio Moroder, Keith Forsey and Irene Cara (who performed the track), became the singer’s first and only number one hit. It also won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, a Golden Globe, and a Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Michael Sembello’s “Maniac”, meanwhile, went on to become one of the highest-grossing songs ever written for a film.While Half Nelson isn’t as highly regarded as Lars and the Real Girl or Drive,  it’s the one that helped Ryan Gosling break away from his status as the heartthrob from The Notebook. It also has a phenomenal soundtrack steered by Broken Social Scene, whose brilliant collection of B-sides proved indispensable for this film about a drug-addicted middle-school teacher struggling to deal with the aftermath of a breakup. In between those tracks you’ve got gritty hip hop that shows Dan\u0027s crossover into the world of his pupil, the stoic Drey (Shareeka Epps) – from New York collective Dujeous, to Rhymefest.1740 24. Lost in Translation (2003)Sofia Coppola has a history of needle drops that encapsulate certain moods that can’t be expressed through dialogue, particularly if it involves a medley of shoegaze from Air and My Bloody Valentine, and the full-throttle debauchery of Peaches on “Fuck the Pain Away”. The soundtrack was so influential that several critics suggested it had something to do with the rebirth of shoegaze in the mid-Noughties. Either way, there a few better songs to close a film than Jesus and Mary Chain’s “Just Like Honey”, that plays just after the kiss goodbye between Bob (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) and that indecipherable whisper.Former Massive Attack producer Nellee Hooper is the brainchild behind one of the greatest film soundtracks of all time. Working with composers Craig Armstrong and Marius de Vries, he beta-tested many of the tracks that ended up on the album by playing them at 5am to afterparty guests at his house in London. Others took direct inspiration from Shakespeare’s original text, with Justin Warfield of One Inch Punch and Art Alexakis of Everclear both allowed to watch early edits of scenes from the film to inspire them. Like the soundtracks for Kill Bill, Trainspotting and Marie Antoinette, it’s the vast eclecticism of the songs featured in Romeo + Juliet that make you remember each one, and the scene where each is used, for years after first seeing the film.As well as making a star of reggae singer Jimmy Cliff, both the film and soundtrack for The Harder They Come exposed mainstream audiences to the emerging Kingston recording industry, helping bring the genre to the US and beyond. Only the title track was an original recorded by Cliff for the movie the rest were singles released in Jamaica between 1967 and 1972, including Cliff’s superb “You Can Get it if You Really Want”, plus songs from seminal artists like Toots and the Maytals and Desmond Dekker.A veritable masterpiece: The Beach soundtrack is what gives this film starring a fresh-faced Leonardo DiCaprio its vitality, capturing the essence of the trance music heard during Thai beach parties during the Nineties. It was supervised by Pete Tong, who said the songs, including Moby’s “Porcelain” and Dario G’s “Voices”, are what make the film “watchable time and time again”. The way the music progresses mirrors the grit and darkness that begin to emerge out of paradise.2140 20. Pretty in Pink (1986)John Hughes virtually pioneered the formula for teen movies soundtracked by angsty British post-punk rock. Echo \u0026amp the Bunnymen, The Smiths, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and New Order all appeared on what is essentially Hughes’s checklist of what cool kids were – or should have been – listening to in the Eighties.    Curated and co-executive produced by Kendrick Lamar, the Black Panther soundtrack brought on a select group of extraordinary talent that would understand the themes in the film, from Anderson .Paak to Earl Sweatshirt. Leading this group is Lamar himself, undoubtedly the best choice of artist for a film that explores responsibility, black power, family dynamics and loyalty. Where Jay-Z failed to step aside on the Great Gatsby soundtrack and let other artists do their thing, Lamar is more interested in highlighting the skills of his fellow artists, like South African singer Babes Wodumo, or Jorja Smith. It’s true that the Black Panther album pales in comparison to some of Lamar’s solo work, but it’s rare to see a soundtrack that so deeply considers the subject matter it has been presented with, and the responsibility of continuing the story through music.2340 18.

She sings: “I’m a woman who walks at the brink of life and death Who emptied my tears many moons ago” and then: “I’ve immersed my body in the river of vengeance.” It\u0027s as though the song was written with The Bride in mind.Moby says he asked him if he wanted to collaborate on new music together, to which André allegedly responded: “Moby, you know I like you, but just too many people are hating on you right now.”The book also contains anecdotes about The Strokes, Bon Jovi and other artists Moby worked with or met across the years.\u0026nbspKate Nash claims the music industry has \u0027killed a lot of people\u0027Director Mati Diop becomes first black woman to win award at CannesNatalie Portman denies dating Moby after \u0027creepy\u0027 claim in new bookAmong the more controversial anecdotes was one where he claimed to have dated Natalie Portman 20 years ago, to whom he has since apologised.Portman, who would have been 18 at the time Moby claimed they dated, while he would have been in his mid-thirties, said she was “surprised” at his version of events and denied dating him – instead referring to his behaviour as “inappropriate” and “creepy”.While Moby initially doubled down on his claim, he has now apologised and said that many of the criticisms about his memoir are “very valid”.He said he should have behaved “more responsibly and respectfully” towards Portman when they met, and also approached her about including his version of events in the book before it was published.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Scunthorpe was built around steel, not the other way round.”Closing the steelworks would take out a huge amount of wages from the economy. The average steel worker makes £36,000, well above average for the region and the UK as a whole. It would double the local unemployment rate in the region, even before any jobs are inevitably lost in the supply chain.But the impact goes beyond that.\u0026nbspHundreds of local businesses rely on steel indirectly.“My brother has a car garage across the road from the steelworks,” says Ms Childs, who is now a representative for the GMB union.“Most of his customers\u0026nbspwork for British Steel or its contractors. Where is his income going to come from?“There are loads of businesses that are there purposely because of British Steel, like the cafe where the workers can go for a cheeky butty on their break.”Scunthorpe MP Nic Dakin is determined to find a resolution that allows workers to keep their jobs. Closure would cause strategic damage to the UK, he said.“This is not just about the core of 4,500 workers that would lose their jobs and not just about those in and around Scunthorpe.“In the blast furnaces at Scunthorpe we are talking about a national strategic asset. To lose that would damage the supply of steel to key industries like defence.“The steel industry is the foundation of manufacturing in this country and vitally important for our economy.”After the UK’s last steelworks closure at\u0026nbspRedcar in 2015, the UK now has just two active blast furnaces – Scunthorpe and Port Talbot in South Wales. They provide some of the highest quality steel in the world.“Once you lose that capability you can’t make your own steel. Are we serious about being a modern, independent nation?” asks Dakin.Such concerns are particularly pertinent at a time of growing nationalism in trade policy with Donald Trump pushing up US tariff barriers and China responding in kind.\u0026nbsp“We would have to import from overseas, where production might be less carbon friendly, the impact on the environment and air quality is higher“You can be held to ransom if you need to import to build important national assets: your railways, ships, planes and whatever else.Ms Childs agrees that the UK will be left in a vulnerable position. “If the Tories abandon manufacturing in the UK, as they seem to be doing, China will one day finish flooding the market with cheap steel and realise that there’s no competition left.”Another thing that\u0026nbspirks is that despite pledges to support steel as part of its industrial strategy, the government undermined it in one important way.When EU steel tariffs were proposed after China began dumping steel onto markets, pushing down prices,\u0026nbspBritain led efforts not to introduce tariffs that would have protected British steel.“It’s fine for the government to talk about an industrial strategy, but what does that actually mean?”Anna Soubry came to visit when steel was facing its last crisis in 2015.“I couldn’t tell you one tangible thing that they did after that.”While many people might want to blame Brexit for the closure, the government must look at its own record, says Ms Childs.“Once the Brexit shambles is over there will still be the same problems and issues that were there before.”British businesses pay twice as much for energy as their French counterparts while business rates are five to 10\u0026nbsptimes as high as on the continent.The experience of Redcar, points to what could befall Scunthorpe if the British Steel plant were allowed to close. Average weekly wages have gone from being some of the highest in the region to amongst the lowest since the steelworks shut.“Redcar knows only too well the cost of a closed steelworks and the impact it has on families, on communities, and on the local economy,” says MP Anna Turley.“Former steelworkers still contact my office needing support.”\u0026nbspBritish Steel’s Scunthorpe site – which is as big as a town in itself – also poses big, and expensive, problems for the environment.Steelworks can leave behind a toxic legacy which presents dangers to the public. Following a plant closure in Corby, Northamptonshire, 19 children were born with deformed feet and hands after their mothers inhaled toxic particles while pregnant during the Eighties\u0026nbspand Nineties.In Redcar, many more millions need to be spent to make the site safe and ready to become productive again.“It’s costing millions every month, and has been for three and a half years, just to keep the site safe,” says Anna Turley.\u0026nbsp“That is before any real clean up work has begun.“The cost of closure is astronomical, especially in comparison to much smaller sums needed to protect the assets, keep them running, and give the business and workforce a future.”The cost of environmental clean-up in Scunthorpe would be “at least” in the hundreds of millions of pounds and would take years, says local MP Nic Dakin – a huge bill that would be footed by taxpayers.“While its operating and it’s safe it’s all an asset but once it stops operating there are some dangerous things there,” he says.Some critics have said that market forces must be allowed to run their course and that the industry is in terminal decline -\u0026nbsp186,000 were employed in UK steel in 1981 compared to just 32,000 last year. Yorkshire and the Humber has already been the worst hit region with 40,000 jobs gone.But there this simplistic story of decline is misleading. Despite little support from the government, the average steel worker has become roughly five times more productive than they were in 1970 a significantly bigger improvement than in the economy as a whole.Given the UK’s current dire level of productivity growth, jettisoning some of the country’s most skilled workers would raise some serious questions.Now that the company has gone into liquidation there are three main options: find a buyer, nationalise or close it down.\u0026nbspThe public broadly supports nationalisation, with 48 per cent of people believing British Steel should be taken back into public ownership compared to just 18 per cent thinking the opposite, according to a new YouGov poll.It reveals that, even among Tory voters, 41 per cent think British Steel should be nationalised compared to 30 per cent who don’t.Nationalisation is the last thing that would have helped British SteelThis leaves a tricky decision for business secretary Greg Clark. Nationalisation of key assets such as the energy and rail networks has been a high-profile element of Labour’s policy platform -\u0026nbsp and one that some Tories have ridiculed.\u0026nbspTo take the British Steel into public ownership could easily be seen as a capitulation or at least an admission that Labour has a point. But to do otherwise could appear heartless. It would also be criticised as\u0026nbspa failure of the government’s industrial strategy, part of which was supposed to be a sector deal to support the steel industry.Clark has said that there are interested private-sector parties but Ms Childs is wary that an “unscrupulous” owner may enter the fray.“We don’t want a buyer that wants to take certain bits of the steel works and discard the rest or charge extortionate rates of interest.\u0026nbsp“We want someone who will take the whole thing and make steel in Scunthorpe for the foreseeable future.”“One thing is for sure” she says. “Through the financial crisis, the 2015 steel crisis and this current crisis, the men and women that work at that plant have always turned up, worked hard and delivered the best steel they can.\u0026nbsp“They will never stop doing that. Unless the gates close for good.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was a strong stance against the unregulated, so-called wild-west world of cryptocurrency, and some feared it was an attempt to silence the nascent space. But secretly, the social network was actually planning its own version of the virtual currency.Less than a year after the ban was\u0026nbsplifted, details about what this cryptocurrency might look like have emerged. GlobalCoin, as it is reportedly called, may be about to upend the entire payments industry.The social network, which is used by more than two\u0026nbspbillion people around the world, has sought advice from the Bank of England and US Treasury about how the virtual currency could integrate with existing payment systems.Created with Sketch.Facebook birthday: 15 defining moments for the social network Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.On 4 Feb, 2004, 19-year-old Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg launched a website called \u0027TheFacebook\u0027 from his dorm.

This new small team is exploring different applications.How would GlobalCoin work?It is understood that the value of GlobalCoin will be pegged to a handful of established currencies, like the US dollar and euro, in order to avoid the price volatility issues that continue to plague bitcoin.It remains unclear whether Facebook\u0027s cryptocurrency will be decentralised like bitcoin. Industry experts have questioned whether the social network would launch a digital currency that was out of its control, despite advocates considering decentralisation a key tenet\u0026nbspof cryptocurrency.Bitcoin now accepted at Starbucks and dozens of other shopsMark Zuckerberg doesn\u0027t have an idea how to implement it where Facebook doesn\u0027t own it, Phil Chen, who masterminded the HTC Exodus blockchain smartphone, said in March.Cryptocurrencies are open, decentralised, censorship resistant and borderless – this is completely antithetical to the current business model of big technology companies, whose walled gardens mean they essentially own their customers.Facebook is also currently planning a merger of its other social media platforms, which include Instagram and WhatsApp, meaning GlobalCoin could be transferred between\u0026nbspa variety of apps. Both the merger and the cryptocurrency launch are expected to take place at some point in 2020.Rival messaging apps are also working on their own cryptocurrencies, with Telegram expected to launch its so-called GRAM cryptocurrency later this year.Competing with ChinaOne explanation to why Facebook feels the need to have its own currency lies in a country where Facebook and its various apps aren\u0027t even allowed: China.In order to compete on a global scale with the social networks and messaging apps spreading out of China, its own form of currency could give Facebook the upper hand.Corporate lawyer and fintech expert\u0026nbspTim Bird, who has worked closely with Facebook in the past, said he believed\u0026nbspGlobalCoin\u0026nbspwould give Facebook a new hold over advertising revenues thanks to the massive amounts of data it could generate.Ever since I spent a day working in Facebook HQ in Menlo Park, California, three years ago, it has been evident that they feel the need to challenge China, Bird told\u0026nbspThe Independent.To do this, Facebook needs a currency or payment platform of its own.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On 19 August, a temporary license granted to Huawei by the US government will expire.Users will also lose\u0026nbspthe ability to install future versions of the Android operating system.“Huawei will continue to provide security updates and after sales services to all existing Huawei and Honor smartphone and tablet products covering those have been sold or still in stock globally,” a Huawei spokesperson told\u0026nbspThe Independent.“We will continue to build a\u0026nbspsafe and sustainable software ecosystem, in order to provide the best experience for all users globally.”But this will not be the case for future versions of Huawei smartphones, which will lose access to popular Google apps like Maps and YouTube.The suspension will also mean owners of new Huawei phones will not be able to download any apps using the Google Play store.Huawei\u0026nbspsays it has been preparing for this eventuality by building its own technology that is not reliant on US tech giants.Chief executive Richard Yu said in an interview last year that it has a backup plan should it ever be cut off from the likes of Google and Microsoft.Google issues message to Huawei phone owners“We have prepared our own operating system,” he told German publication\u0026nbspDie Welt. “Should it ever happen that we can no longer use these systems, we would be prepared.That’s our plan B but of course we prefer to work with the ecosystems of Google and Microsoft.”After the Trump administration placed Huawei on its “entity list” last week, Huawei executive Ren\u0026nbspZhengfei\u0026nbspreiterated this in comments to Japanese media.“We have already been preparing for this,” he said.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

David Barnett reports\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentJoy Division: (left to right) Ian Curtis, Bernard Sumner, Stephen Morris and Peter HookIt’s a big year for fans of Joy Division and New Order. This summer marks 40 years since the former’s debut album Unknown Pleasures, their only LP released before the suicide of lead singer Ian Curtis, aged 23, in May 1980. The surviving members – bassist Hook, guitarist Bernard “Barney” Sumner and drummer Stephen Morris – transformed themselves into New Order that year, joined by Gillian Gilbert on keyboards, with Sumner taking over vocals. It’s 30 years since the band released Technique. It was their their fifth album, but the one that propelled them to the top of the charts and into proper stardom, influenced by the Balearic sound of house music.Everybody, it seems, has a Joy Division or New Order story to tell, as evidenced by the books released this year. Jon Savage’s This Searing Light, the Sun and Everything Else is an “oral history” of Joy Division, published by Faber in April. Drummer Stephen Morris has his memoirs, Record Play Pause, out this month. Dave Haslam, one-time DJ at Manchester’s Hacienda club, the focal point of the so-called Madchester scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s, mentions his love of both bands in his recent autobiography, Sonic Youth Slept On My Floor.“Hooky”, you might be unsurprised to hear, doesn’t have a lot of truck with any of them. We meet in a Costa in Alderley Edge, a leafy little town in Cheshire, only 20 miles away, geographically, from Salford, where Hooky and Bernard Sumner grew up, but half a world away in other respects.He’s lived here for 20 years, and as we find a quiet corner of the coffee shop, I mention in passing that I took my 14-year-old daughter to listen to Haslam reading from his book a few weeks ago. “Well, when she grows up she’ll never forgive you,” he says.Created with Sketch.Caught on film: Joy Division on tour in 1979 Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Hooky perhaps has a reputation for abrasiveness, for speaking his mind, for not taking any crap. He and New Order parted ways in 2007 and don’t appear to be on good terms. I mention that Haslam had spoken fondly of him, which he finds hard to believe. Has he read Haslam’s book?“I haven’t read many good Manchester books,” he says. “I think my favourite is Bez’s. I’ve got Mark E Smith’s on my shelf but not got round to it yet.”Peter Hook to perform Joy Division albums in full at UK showsJoy Division’s Bernard Sumner’s memoir recalls the death of bandmateHooky himself wrote Unknown Pleasures: Inside Joy Division, published in 2012, and he says he did so as a direct response to the author and journalist Mick Middles’ 1996 book, From Joy Division to New Order. “That Middles book was a crock of f**king shit but he inspired me to write my own,” he says. “I suppose I’m in the unenviable position of being too close to the whole thing.”I wave Jon Savage’s book at him and he shakes his head. “That is particularly annoying that one, it’s Joy Division in their own words but a lot of it’s just lifted from when we did the Joy Division documentary. Those interviews were from the Control interview, Faber bought them lock stock and barrel without our permission, without even a f**king charity donation. He had access to the whole transcripts. Didn’t make sense to me, especially from Jon Savage who you’ve known for 40 f**king years. We weren’t party to how it was done in any way shape or form so it’s just another annoyance.”Does a lot of stuff annoy Peter Hook generally? He shrugs. “It’s not that bad after a while. You just get used to it. You get to that bit where nothing surprises you. I mean, I’ve had a few fracas with Jon because he sided with them lot and excluded me which I felt was really unfair, especially when I used to tow his f**king car back so our kid could fix it. So yeah… people have short memories.”There’s a chapter in Dave Haslam’s book where he details being commissioned by NME to interview New Order, a band of which he describes himself as “a devotee, bewitched by them”. Haslam interviewed the band in 1986 at their recording studio in Cheetham Hill afterwards, Hooky gave him a lift back into Manchester city centre. Haslam had taped the interview but something went wrong his tape was blank. In a panic, he sat down in a cafe and tried to write down everything again from memory, commenting:\u0026nbsp“No one knew how I’d crafted the quotes by New Order.”Tales grow in the telling. Legends get embellished. Stories take on a life of their own. “Yeah,” concedes Hooky. In 2010 he wrote a book called The Hacienda: How Not to Run a Club, and says he initially wanted to do it on interviews with the principal characters. “What I found which was really weird, when I started talking to a few people I very quickly realised that everybody had a different memory of the single occasion, so I thought f**k this, I’m going to have to do it on my own. And you find even though you think something is true you can be contradicted by people.”As an example, Hooky cites his auctioning off earlier this year of all his old Joy Division and New Order memorabilia, to raise money for the Epilepsy Society (Ian Curtis suffered from it) and Calm, the charity aimed at tackling suicide, especially among men. He put a bell tree percussion device in the lots, saying it had been used on the Joy Division track Atmosphere. Drummer Stephen Morris, who would have used it, disputed the fact.Hooky says, “I think you’d have to be deaf not to realise that a bell tree made the sound and it wasn’t a tambourine stuck on a pair of scissors. But that is an example of how people can remember completely different things. Normally it doesn’t lead to that level of aggro but it is quite shocking really because there is no truth, the only truth really is your truth. You’re not gonna lie. I’m sure Stephen Morris thinks it was but, y’know, in my opinion he’s wrong, and you have to go with your own truth otherwise you’d never get through life. It is interesting the way you can have completely different ideas.”V97 with Monaco (PA)There’s a sense when talking to Peter Hook that his often cutting remarks about the people he’s shared some of the last 40-odd years with are, in a way, a defensive tactic, that there’s been so many wars of words since New Order split that he’s getting his jabs in first. At one point I ask him what would happen if Bernard Sumner walked into the Costa we were sitting in, and he laughs uproariously and says, “You’d need your camera, mate!”But it’s obvious he loves the music. He’s rarely been without a band or project since he started while New Order were still going he worked with another Factory band, Ad Infinitum. When New Order had their first break-up in 1993, he started two new bands, Revenge and Monaco. New Order reformed for almost a decade from 1998, during which time Hooky began to develop his DJing career, which now sees him about to embark on a tour with Hacienda Classical, kicking off on 8 June at Scarborough’s Open Air Theatre.Classical accompaniment to pop and dance music is something of a thing right now, but this is the fifth year of the Hacienda Classical concept, which combines the live orchestral music of the Manchester Camerata with DJs recreating the sounds of the nightclub’s heyday. If you think that sounds a bit weird, then you wouldn’t be on your own.Camerata Orchestra performing Hacienda Classical (Rex)The idea had been pioneered by DJ Todd Terry in the States, and British DJ Pete Tong had started doing it over here. “Pete Tong was doing it more as a concert, songs finishing and starting. Graeme’s idea was to do it as a DJ mix, just the same as it would be in a club, so once you started you didn’t stop,” says Hooky.That caused some problems with some venues because they wanted an intermission in which to make up the takings on the bar. “But we felt it was more intrinsic to the spirit of the Hacienda to be complete it starts and it finishes, you’re f**ked and you go home and you recover. It was that depth of feeling that you wanted from what we were doing.”The orchestra plays live and the sound is mixed by the DJ in to the classic Hacienda club tracks, with live vocalists. Hooky gets a bit of fire in his eyes that’s impossible to fake just for PR purposes as he waxes lyrical over the gigs. “A lot of these songs you’ve grown up with and they’ve marked many, many special occasions in your life… death, kids, meeting the missus, losing the missus … it’s very charged, it’s very physical, and people f**king love it. And it gives all us old people the excuse to live our youth again, get a babysitter, have the kids tucked up at home, and fearing what you’re going to feel like the next morning.”Hooky started DJing in 2004, doing it full time in 2007 when New Order split for the second time. He says, “I started doing it out of necessity because I had no money at that point, as New Order we’d not worked for a bit. I mainly do dance music and I get in a lot of trouble because everybody expects you to play the f**king Stone Roses and the Happy Mondays ad infinitum.Madchester’ hub\u0026nbsp(Rex)“The other fantastic thing is most DJs are sober and they’re always on time, which is f**king fantastic. If I’m on at 9 o’clock I know the DJ before me will finish at 8.59.59. You play with groups and they’re always f**king late, nobody arguing about who goes on last and all that crap. It’s very courteous. The rivalry comes with you wanting to play a better set.”So he’s looking forward to hitting the road with the Hacienda Classical Tour, which takes in the Royal Albert Hall and the Isle of Wight Festival among its dates. But Hooky has a special soft spot for the tour opener, Scarborough.“Scarborough is a great place,” he enthuses. “I DJ’d in that old place on the pier the last time I was there. They were nuts. And I never realised how beautiful Scarborough was. Scarborough actually reminded me insanely of Palma, Majorca. I couldn’t believe how beautiful it was. All that European money, innit? And they won’t be getting that any more.”Ah, here it is. We look at each other cautiously over our coffee cups. Ageing rock stars and Brexit. You never know how that one’s going to pan out, do you? Morrissey calling the referendum result “magnificent” and Johnny Rotten in a “make America great again” T-shirt.“Look,” says Hooky, who lives in Majorca for half the year and has ambitions to do that full-time. “I’m a traveller. I go all round the world all the time and I do think it’s important in this day and age for us all to stick together, and not to be fragmented. I think that’s the worst thing that could happen to anybody and I think it exacerbates differences and things like immigration and racism.“I just think it’s the wrong way of pursuing a modern life. It’s old-fashioned, and honestly if you found someone who still thought it was a good idea then they’re a f**king idiot because it’s been proved that our government can’t handle it, which is an embarrassment. I was sat there last week doing a Euro news interview and the guy’s going, ‘What’s happening with Brexit?’ and I haven’t a f**king clue but there’s one thing I do know that if I was doing my job as shit as them I’d be stood on me own in a concert hall. There’d be no audience, right, and that’s what makes me laugh about it. Our government is selfish, it’s only interested in power, personal power, personal politics, and the country is just an absolute f**king embarrassment.”He pauses, then shakes his head and adds, “David Cameron should be torn apart by an angry mob. Theresa May had\u0026nbspthe balls to try to stay in office and say I’ll see it out, not like that shithouse.”Though DJing with the Hacienda Classical tour will dominate this summer, Hooky does of course still keep his bass arm working, primarily with Peter Hook and The Light. That started in 2010, around the 30th anniversaryof Ian Curtis’s death, the same year he opened a new nightclub, The Factory, in the old\u0026nbspoffices of Factory Records\u0026nbspin Manchester. The Light performs Joy Division and New Order tracks, as they were meant to be heard, faithfully following the order of the songs on the albums.“I literally only booked one gig, which was at The Factory, and it was supposed to be a one-off celebration and we ended up doing two nights and we started getting loads of interest,” he recalls. “We hadn’t booked anything until we played, it all came out as a result of that and it was wonderful. I’d not played Joy Division songs for 30 years ... to actually start playing them was absolutely fantastic because we hardly ever did them as New Order.”According to Hooky, New Order “buried Joy Division along with Ian”, and they would only very occasionally revisit the old stuff, such as when manager Rob Gretton asked them to play Love Will Tear Us Apart “because it’s f**king so-and-so’s birthday”. He says, “I think we played in our whole career of New Order about three Joy Division songs.”That changed in 2006 when New Order played the first Manchester Versus Cancer gig, an initiative set up by Andy Rourke of The Smiths. They played a full set of Joy Division tunes. “It was absolutely fantastic, it was delightful, absolutely delightful to do,” says Hooky. “But I don’t think Barney liked doing it and I understand that. He wanted to do his own lyrics, he wanted to do his own songs, which makes perfect sense. But it was a frustration, because you’re sort of given something back for a moment and then it’s snatched off you again.But Hooky had developed a taste for performing the Joy Division songs he hadn’t played for 30 years, and The Light was born. In May 2020 The Light will perform the two Joy Division albums, Unknown Pleasures and Closer, in full, at the Manchester Apollo and the Brixton Academy. Again, they will be benefiting the Epilepsy Society and Calm. It will be 40 years, almost to the day, since Ian Curtis died.Without taking anything away from any of the musicians Hooky has worked with (his own son Jack has played with Monaco and The Light), I wonder if it wouldn’t just be simpler – and more satisfying for fans – to get the old band back together again to play these classic songs?We’re just a bunch of old men who are arguing, and we seem happy to keep doing that. But I do feel more and more that... well, life’s just too short, isn’t it?Hooky thinks for a long moment before musing, “With any group you’re always going to get a problem if the members of the group don’t get on. Look at The Smiths the only two that make most money out of it are Morrissey and Marr. It’s a great shame.”I wonder out loud what The Smiths would be like if they were still together as a band today. Hooky looks at me. “Well, what would New Order be like if they were going today?”And could that be a thing?“What happened at the end of New Order was that Bernard and I had completely different ideas about the group, the music, the attitude to business, and they were that far apart,” he says holding his hands wide. “And the only thing in the middle was Stephen. I had the opinion that Steve agreed with me and then found out afterwards that he seemed to agree with Bernard so I’m looking forward to his book for an explanation of that.“Then they reformed behind my back, and licensed the assets to themselves. Which is not exactly the most honourable thing to do but...” He shrugs. “It’s survival.”There was a long-running court case over Hook’s claim of lost royalties after the band’s “restructuring”, which was settled out of court in 2017. Bernard Sumner, Stephen Morris and Gillian Gilbert continue under the name New Order.Three decades since Technique, 40 years since Unknown Pleasures. Next year will be the 40th anniversary\u0026nbspof Ian Curtis’s death. Is there any change of a reconciliation on the horizon at all? Over the course of the interview, Hooky seems to have mellowed away from his initial defensive-offensive tactic of getting his attacks in first, albeit done with wry humour as they were. Now he seems almost reflective.“You asked me earlier what would happen if Barney walked in here,” he says. “We’re just a bunch of old men who are arguing, and we seem happy to keep doing that. But I do feel more and more that... well, life’s just too short, isn’t it?”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special.

Dean Turner, UK economist as UBS Wealth Management, forecast that the pound could crash to as low as 1.15 against the dollar and close to parity against the euro in the event of a no-deal Brexit. He warned investors not to be complacent about the prospect.“Despite mounting public impatience over the process, many top officials and lawmakers remain fearful of the economic damage from a no-deal exit,” said Mr Turner.“Lingering uncertainty would likely cause firms to delay investment, and keep sterling under downward pressure.”“A UK decision to remain an EU member would likely cause a swift rebound in sterling, which we believe is undervalued relative to its purchasing power parity level of around USD 1.58.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Bringing people together when there’s such a ide was never going to be easy. Now we face prospect of Brexiteer extremist as Tory leader and\u0026nbspthreat of no deal, we must unite our party and\u0026nbspcountry by taking issue back to people in a public vote.”MInutes later, the shadow chancellor added: So people are absolutely clear what I am saying. Of course I want a general election. But I realise how difficult this is to secure.I will do anything I can to block no-deal Brexit. So yes if, as likely, general election\u0026nbspnot possible, then I support going back to the people in another referendum.As results rolled in last night, Mr Corbyn said:\u0026nbsp“After three years of Tory failure to deliver a Brexit that works for the whole country, these elections became a proxy second referendum.“With the Conservatives disintegrating and unable to govern, and parliament deadlocked, this issue will have to go back to the people, whether through a general election or a public vote.”He added: “Over the coming days, we will have conversations across our party and movement and reflect on these results on both sides of the Brexit ide.Created with Sketch.

Parliament can and will prevent such a damaging outcome for jobs and industry in the UK.”Meanwhile, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said Labour must “listen to our members”, who polls suggest back a Final Say vote by a large majority.“We have to take the time to analyse the EU vote,” said Ms Abbott. “But, when we come in third after the Brexit party, that is a clue something is wrong with our strategy.“We need to listen to our members and take a clearer line on a public vote.”Brexit Party tops European poll as Greens push Tories into fifthConservatives and Labour hit hard in EU election routLabour should promise referendum after ‘kicking’ say Corbyn alliesWe can’t turn our back on democracy, whoever now enters No 10Close Corbyn ally Richard Burgon said the option of a second referendum should be kept open, telling BBC Radio 4’s Today: “I think we have got to understand now that a damaging, dangerous no-deal Brexit is becoming more and more likely because of the changes in the Conservative Party.“It could be a Boris Johnson-backed hard Brexit, it could be a hard Brexit backed by another new prime minister.“In those circumstances, we must do everything we can and use whatever mechanisms we can to stop a disastrous no-deal Brexit – yes, including a public vote.”Ms Thornberry said Labour was “not clear enough” about its position on Brexit and should have promised voters a confirmatory referendum.“We went into an election where the most important issue was what was our view on leaving the EU and we were not clear about it,” she said.\u0026nbsp“We should have said quite simply that any deal that comes out of this government should be put to a confirmatory referendum, and that Remain should be on the ballot paper, and that Labour would campaign to Remain.”Meanwhile, Baroness Chakrabarti, Mr Corbyn’s shadow attorney general, said that a second referendum was a way to “break the deadlock” on Brexit.“It has been part of our policy since party conference last autumn,” she told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. “It is past midnight. So that means of breaking the deadlock is more and more important by the day.”Labour\u0027s Mayor of London\u0026nbspSadiq\u0026nbspKhan repeated his call for the revocation of the Article 50 letter declaring the UK\u0027s intention to quit the EU, to allow a second referendum to take place.With the Prime Minister having resigned and Parliament in gridlock it’s crystal clear what must happen now, said Mr Khan. Article 50 should be withdrawn to stop the clock ticking down towards a no-deal Brexit, and the British public given the final say, with the option of staying in the EU.And Labour MEP Seb Dance, who held on to his seat in the London region, said: “Those colleagues who lost their seats did not do so because of their record or their commitment to fight for Britain’s place in the EU.“They lost because our message as a party was not clear. We tried to fudge an issue that voters held paramount in these elections -\u0026nbspBrexit.”However there were indications that some MPs in Leave-backing constituencies will resist any move to position Labour\u0026nbspas an anti-Brexit party.Makerfield MP Yvonne Fovargue tweeted: “We need to respect the result and leave the EU with a pragmatic deal.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it’s also the case that right at the top of our campaign messaging we had responses to the accelerating climate crisis.”Support for remain-backing Greens and Liberal Democrats showed there was\u0026nbsp“no mandate” for no-deal Brexit, she claimed.Left-leaning, ecology-focussed Greens did well among younger voters in urban areas,\u0026nbspresults suggested. They beat Finland’s social democrats into third place,\u0026nbspand even appeared to have won a seat in Portugal despite previously being invisible in the polls.The Greens’ co-leader in the European parliament,\u0026nbspSka\u0026nbspKeller, said that “the green wave has really spread all over Europe and for us that is a fantastic result”.Fellow leader Philippe\u0026nbspLamberts\u0026nbspsaid the party should now become major players in alliance-forming deals to come, in order to counter anti-EU parties.“We can see that with an uptick in nationalism and populism, that to forge a stable European Union the Greens are going to be indispensable,” he said.Conservatives and Labour hit hard in EU election routIrish premier Leo\u0026nbspVaradkar\u0026nbspgot his congratulations in early, tweeting on Saturday: “I want to congratulate the Greens on a very good election.“It’s a very clear message from the public that they want us to do more on climate action – and we’ve got that message. That’s going to require lots of changes on inidual level, community level and\u0026nbspGovt\u0026nbsplevel.”The Greens’ success came amid greater visibility for environmental issues and climate change in particular. Teen activist Greta Thunberg has sparked a rolling series of school strikes by young people, and Extinction Rebellion’s protests shut down parts of central London for several days.In the years since\u0026nbspBlue Planet II\u0026nbspalerted British viewers to the scourge of plastic pollution and humanity’s impact on the planet, the UN has warned that mankind’s “very survival is in doubt” due to climate change and other disasters.Its secretary-general, Antonio Guterres, called global warming “the battle of my life”,\u0026nbspand one the world was losing.Additional reporting by agenciesThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The independent candidate polled 2.2 per cent of the vote in the North West region,\u0026nbspfinishing in eighth place behind all the major parties and losing his deposit.Open warfare as Hammond says no-deal Brexit Tories will be toppledMr Batten was already expected to step down after the elections to make way for a new leader in light of a poor performance in the polls. His leadership was partly responsible for the Brexit Party’s breakaway – with Mr\u0026nbspFarage\u0026nbspciting Mr Batten’s anti-Islam rhetoric and closeness to Robinson as reasons for his departure.Ukip also suffered heavy losses at council elections last month, which the Brexit party did not contest.

The Brexit Party took 32 per cent of the vote share and topped the poll in nine of the 10 regions declared.“Never before in British politics has a new party launched just six weeks ago topped the polls in a national election,” said Mr Farage.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This time too he left his sickbed to return to the campaign trail – and has now been elected as an MEP.His election marks what he will hope is the first step on the path back to the corridors of power, after he was forced to give up his parliamentary seat, following a conviction for tax fraud in 2015. An Italian court last year lifted a ban on Berlusconi holding public office, for good behaviour.Created with Sketch.

For his die-hard base he can do no wrong.Speaking on Monday, the man himself said that the result showed:\u0026nbspWe are still indispensable – without Forza Italia the centre right cannot win ... In Brussels I will remain the sole levee against anti European nationalism. I couldn’t do any more than I have done. I have given the maximum.Berlusconi was forced to resign as prime minister in 2011\u0026nbspafter running the Italian economy into the ground, making way for a technocratic government.If Berlusconi wins in Italy, Putin will finally have found his EU allyHis last few years in the country’s top job had been marred by allegations of corruption and tales of “bunga bunga” sex parties at his lavish villa outside Milan. He was accused of unlawful sex with 17-year-old nightclub dancer Ruby – “the Heart-stealer” – but was acquitted on appeal, after a troupe of starlets testified the evenings were merely elegant dinners.After his ousting from politics, the former cruise ship crooner served a community service sentence in a retirement home, where he was in his element, at bingo games and singalongs. But with the lifting of his exclusion from public office last year, the “Teflon don” saw a chance to return yet again to the political fray.He declared his bid for European election in January, saying that “at the lovely age” of 82, he felt “a sense of responsibility to head for Europe, where there is a lack of deep thinking about the world.” Since then he has been working his mainstays of off-colour jokes and popular-appeal policies, including lower taxes and animal rights.But much has changed since Berlusconi left office: his party haemorrhaged voters as Italy’s conservatives have defected to Matteo Salvini’s hard right League, now the most popular party in Italy. In last year’s elections, Berlusconi’s party polled just 14 per cent, down from 37 per cent\u0026nbspin 2008. It was too toxic to be part of the coalition between the far right League and the anti-establishment Five Star, which now govern Italy in an uneasy partnership.Furthermore he is now in the midst of a second trial for the corruption of witnesses in the Ruby case. The unexplained death of a vital prosecution witness, model Imane Fadil, in January, sparked\u0026nbspspeculation that she had been poisoned as part of a cover-up plot, threatening to ruin Berlusconi’s comeback.\u0026nbspBerlusconi claims\u0026nbsphe has\u0026nbspnever met her and that her statements had always sounded like inventions and nonsense.His planetary ego will enjoy a brief respite. But his election as an\u0026nbspMEP\u0026nbspdoesn\u0027t really change much. Prime-time Berlusconi was extraordinary because he was a libertine billionaire in charge of a G8 country. But now he’s fading away\u0026nbspBerlusconi sees himself as an elder statesmanlike figure with experience in international relations. But in reality, and while in power, he frequently embarrassed Italy on the international stage, and horrified Eurocrats with his puerile jokes.He suggested German politician Martin Schulz could get a role as concentration camp guard in a war film and reportedly called Angela Merkel an unf***able lardarse. But while at one time he would be every European leader’s worst nightmare, now in an increasingly fractured Europe, Berlusconi, jaw-dropping gaffes and all, would be a welcome return. He is the best that they can hope for,\u0026nbspsays Orsina.If, as seems probable, there is a crisis in the coalition after the European elections, there may be fresh elections in the autumn. Forza Italia could then return to government as part of a centre-right coalition with Salvini’s League.But for Michael Day, author of Being Berlusconi, from Cosa Nostra to Bunga Bunga, any comeback will be a short-lived rally on a path of terminal decline.“His planetary ego will enjoy a brief respite. But his election as an MEP doesn\u0027t really change much. Prime-time Berlusconi was extraordinary because he was a libertine billionaire in charge of a G8 country. But now he’s fading away.The miserable showing of Forza Italia at 8.8 per cent, a quarter of the 37 per cent\u0026nbspit was at its prime in 2008, underlines how Salvini and the hard-right are running things now.”Even Salvini is doing everything to hinder Berlusconi’s political return, hoping to be able to form a centre right coalition without him, says Orsina.“Berlusconi puts off a certain part of the electorate, and even as a junior partner would be cumbersome, not happy to sit on the sidelines.”Ever the maker of his own myth, Berlusconi has often been said to harbour ambitions of becoming president of Italy. But that dream has now evaporated with his votes. His real legacy is likely to be the corrosion of political faith caused by the corruption and tawdry scandals that dogged his career and tainted Italian politics, ironically contributing to the rise of the new generation of populist forces.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Cool them downRemove their clothes, to help lower their body temperature.If the room theyre in is hot, open a window or door to get a flow of fresh air through the room.Step . Wait and watchWhen the seizure is over, help your baby rest on their side with their head tilted slight back to ensure their airways are open.If their symptoms continue or its your childs first fit, call a doctor and get medical advice.In the modern world, most homes will now be cluttered with chargers for ious devices - from smartphones to fitness trackers.But as most parents will know, young children will be tempted to put anything in their mouths, including electrical items that might still be plugged in.Always unplug the cable and store it away somewhere safe.With stores now charging for plastic bags, many of us will find were actually clinging on to more of them in our homes so we can re-use.But bags pose a serious suffocation hazardplayed with.Be sure to keep yours out of reach and sight of youngsters.If theyre not breathing move on to step two.Step . Tell someone to dial If youre on your own carry out rescue breaths, and chest compressions described below for one minute, then dial .Step . Give five rescue breathsTilt your babys head back, seal your mouth over their mouth and nose and blow steadily.Repeat five times.Step . Give  chest compressionsPush firmly in the middle of your babys chest with two fingers and then release.Maintain a regular rate of around two compressions per second.Repeat  times.Step . Give two rescue breathsThen continue with cycles of  chest compressions and two rescue breaths until help arrives.More drugs are being prescribed than ever before and according to the NHS, medicines are the cause of over  per cent of hospital admissions for poisoning in under-fives.Where possible, only buy or request medicines which come in child-resistant packaging and never empty them into easy to open and unlabelled containers.Remember, child-resistant does not mean packaging is entirely child-proof, so always keep all medicines out of reach of children.More people are making the switch to e-cigarettes, which reduces the risk of burns for children.But it comes with a new worry.E-Liquid refills contain large quantities of concentrated nicotine which is highly toxic when ingested, inhaled or touched.Never let your child near your vaping products or leave them lying around and for peace of mind, choose a vaping brand whose packaging has child-resistant features.Another potential hazard for young children involves blind cords, with official statistics revealing suffocation or strangulation was the cause of death for half of all under-ones who die.And for those aged one to four that drops slightly, but only to  per cent.There have been multiple cases where a toddler or small child has got themselves entangled in the cord, leading to death.The Government’s safety leaflet instructs parents to keep blind cords away from cots and even nappy changing units.Hit them firmly on their back between the shoulder blades up to five times.If back blows dont dislodge the object, move on to step two.Step . Give up to five chest thrustsTurn your baby over so they are facing upwards and place two fingers in the middle of their chest just below the nipples.Push sharply downwards up to five times.Step .

This is just the beginning.In a warning to the Westminster parties, he said: If we dont leave on October  then the scores you have seen for the Brexit Party today will be repeated in a general election, and we are getting ready for it.Mr Farage repeated his demand for the Brexit Party to be involved in the negotiations ahead of the Halloween deadline.All EU citizens, as long as they are registered to vote, have the right to vote in the European elections.The UK uses the D’Hondt system of proportional representation which means the number of MEPs a party wins is directly related to the percentage of votes it receives.Voters choose a single party instead of an inidual candidate.This means all political parties have the chance to send representatives to the European Parliament.The proportion of seats given by a party directly reflects the proportion of votes won.In the first round of counting, the party with the most votes is allocated a seat for the candidate at the top of its list.Under the D’Hondt method, each party’s total number of votes is repeatedly ided – until all seats are filled – by isor  + the number of seats already allocated.If it is still top it gains another seat. If not, whichever party has the most votes then gets the seat instead.The original vote count of the largest party in each round is ided by one plus the total number of seats they have already been allocated, until all the seats for the region have been handed out.Although the method is considered to be one of the most constant and representative forms of voting, the results do not exactly reflect the votes, as this would lead to parties winning fractions of seats.EU voters go to the polls every five years to elect Members of the European Parliament .Each country has a specic number of seats based on their population size.The smallest is Malta and they have six seats, whereas the largest is Germany with .There are  MEPs in total and the UK has .Candidates can stand independently or with a party.They will represent a region of their country, and the number of MEPs for each region depends on population.The government confirmed the country would be taking part in the EU elections in early May after May administration was forced to push back the date it was leaving the bloc because MPs could not get a majority for her withdrawal agreement.As the UK was still in the EU at the time of the elections it is forced to take part even though the majority of voters said they wanted to leave in the referendum vote.The UK went to the polls to elect MEPs on May , .The vote is said to have cost around £million to hold.If a Brexit deal is agreed before the election date or soon after then the UK’s MEPS will not take their seats.Butthat doesn’t happen then the newly elected MEPs will take their place in the European Parliament – which sits in Brussels and Strasbourg - in early July.European Council President Donald Tusk has said that MEPs could sit for “months or even longer”the negotiations drag on.At this stage, how long the UK MEPs will continue to sit is anyones guess.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Her loss of the Tory majority robbed her of her authority, boxed her in on Brexit and discredited her domestic policy agenda.The failure of that campaign carries an important lesson for the Tories — they need a happy warrior.May looked deeply uncomfortable on the campaign trail, with the result that the more the public saw of her, the less they liked.This Tory need for a good campaigner is heightened by the fact that their next leader will have to fight on two fronts, against both Jeremy Corbyn and Nigel Farage.On Brexit, May’s biggest problem was not knowing what she wanted. She triggered Article , the two-year process for leaving the EU that we had to request a humiliating delay to, without a clear idea of the kind of relationship she wanted — and how to get it.This meant that the UK wasted valuable negotiating time and ceded the initiative to the EU in the talks.The Tories need a leader with a plan. Whoever succeeds May will have to know what they want to get out of the EU and how they plan to get it. Given Brussels’ intransigence in these talks, they are also going to need Plans B, C and D.One of May’s other failings was that she didn’t understand one of the key purposes of preparations for No Deal.It wasn’t because you actually wanted — or thought you would end up with — No Deal. It was meant to secure a better deal.The leadership contest, overseen by party chairman Brandon Lewis, will take around six weeks.Any Tory MP can enter the race, and the list of contenders is then whittled down by the parliamentary party.MPs vote in multiple rounds, eliminating one candidate each time until just two are left.The partys , activists then choose behind the final shortlist of two, with the winner declared leader and Prime Minister.When Mrs May became leader, she didnt have to submit to a vote of members because Andrea Leadsom pulled out of the race.So the last time activists have had a say on the leadership was , when David Cameron defeated David Davis.If the UK had been more visibly prepared to walk away, then the EU would have been more constructive in the negotiations.The new Prime Minister must spend the summer examining the state of our no-deal preparations.Absurdly, the Brexit delay has not been used as a chance to improve the UK’s no-deal planning but rather as an excuse to soft pedal. That must change.May’s other great failure has been failing to build a team or create a sense of collective endeavour.Both the disastrous  manesto and her Brexit plan were executed with far too little Cabinet involvement.She sent civil servants to do the very political job of negotiating. The result was a deal that was, unsurprisingly, politically tone deaf.May’s successor must appoint a Cabinet of all the Tory talents — and let them do their jobs.And we need a Brexit Secretary who actually negotiates with Brussels.The Tories have no perfect candidate for No . No one fully fulfils all of these requirements.But a Prime Minister who could deliver Brexit would give the Tories a fighting chance.THE way to think about the Tory leadership contest is that it is like a tournament with two sides of the draw, with each side sending one candidate into the final membership round.One side of the draw is for full-on Brexiteers.Here Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab, Andrea Leadsom, Steve Baker and Esther McVey will duke it out.The other side of the draw features the Cabinet candidates: Jeremy Hunt, Sajid Javid, Michael Gove, Matt Hancock and Rory Stewart.Whoever comes out of the Brexit side of the draw will go into the final round as the strong favourite, given how Tory members just want the UK to get out of the EU.I understand that Boris Johnson has edged ahead of Dominic Raab on this side of the contest.But he will, in the words of one key MP, need to be “materially ahead” of Raab on the first round.Why  Because Raab is more likely to pick up support as more hardline Brexiteer candidates such asRaab’s pitch will be that the Conservative Party is toastit cannot deliver Brexit – and that he is the man to do that.He will argue that other candidates might be better known than him, but Boris’s celebrity won’t save the Toriesthey cannot get Brexit done.But one of Boris’s advantages over Raab is that he has more reach into the rest of the party.His campaign is beginning to pick up support from former Remainer ministers, who see the former London Mayor as the Tories’ best chance of seeing off the twin threats of Corbyn and Farage.At the same time, some on the left of the party have decided that stopping Raab – who they see as a down-the-line right-winger – is now their priority, rather than blocking Boris.ON the Cabinet side of the contest, the question is whether Michael Gove can overhaul Jeremy Hunt.The Foreign Secretary currently has more MPs backing him than anyone  in the Cabinet.But his campaign has had a bumpy few weeks, and some of his supporters are beginning to peel away.This, perhaps, explains why Hunt felt the need to confirm that he was standing just hours after Theresa May announced her resignation yesterday.Part of Hunt’s problem with MPs is that it is very hard to see him beating Boris Johnson or Dominic Raab when it comes to the party members.Their experience with Theresa May has made the membership very wary of former Remainers.GEORGE Osborne has finally had his revenge on Theresa May.He sent a text to a slew of Cabinet leadership hopefuls saying that a big prize awaited the minister who went and told May that the Withdrawal Agreement Bill had to be pulled.Several recipients of this text were amused when Sajid Javid, who was one of Osborne’s junior ministers at the Treasury, then went to demand that May shelve the second referendum part of the bill.SOME members of the  parliamentary intake are considering running for the leadership.They should hold their horses – the new leader will need more than four years of parliamentary experience.But whoever becomes the new PM needs to freshen up the Cabinet, to bring in this new talent.After nine years in government, there are too many administrators in Cabinet and not enough doers.It needs an injection of energy and fresh ideas.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It will be ungenerous not to remember too her unshakeable dedication to her country and remarkable perseverance against what became insurmountable odds.She is a good person. She did her best.But she is a poor Prime Minister and the author of her own downfall. She appointed a Cabinet of loyal friends largely devoid of talent.She credulously swallowed bad advice from a staunchly europhile and dysal civil service.She lacked vital traits for a leader: core beliefs, confidence, decisiveness, mental agility, communication skills and a willingness to trust and delegate.These failings, and a suicidal manesto, were exposed at the  election. Stripped of her majority, she foolishly tried to pretend “nothing has changed” and made promises she couldn’t keep.She negotiated a Brexit deal which was bad enough even before Monday’s final, fatal compromises.Mrs May described what she sees as her legacy. It is thin gruel. The economy is doing fine, the job market booming. But she did next to nothing for Sun readers, for the “just about managings”.Brexit is undone, like her “social justice” agenda. Our democracy is in disarray, Britain ided, her party at historic poll lows. She leaves her successor an even more colossal task than her own.Whoever that is must, above all, stop Corbyn’s thuggish extremists winning power.That can only be done by delivering Brexit — yes, with No Dealneed be — and somehow seeing off the Brexit Party whose surge could let Corbyn in.Winning the battle of ideas against the Marxist Left will be far simpler. Who is best placed to do it It must be a Brexiteer ready to appoint a younger, fresher, far more talented top team. There are plenty of able Tories in the ranks, their paths blocked by ­Cabinet duds who must be swept away.Leave-backing MPs must avoid splitting their vote and letting another Remainer into No. The party may not survive it.Nor, we believe, will its members tolerate any attempt by MPs to block their favourite candidates. They now have Nigel Farage’s party to join.Mrs May has left the Tories in dire straits and with one chance to survive.For their sake — and Britain’s — they had better make the right choice.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Andyou are paid less than someone  because they are better than you then that is OK. But that is apparently not the case here.“Despite being awarded the same job, on the same day, after the same board, during the same recruitment process, BBC News asked me to accept a considerably lower salary than my male counterpart. A lot less,” Karen told colleagues by email.“I’ve been assured our roles and responsibilities are the same. I’ve also been told my appointment was ‘very well deserved’. It’s just that I’m worth £, less.“Over the past four months I have asked BBC News to think again. And they’ve inched their offer up . . . now the gap is nearer to £,. But for me it has never been about the actual salary. It has been about equal pay.”She also said she had turned down the job on principle after discussing the matter with her young daughters, which led her to conclude that she must “stand up for what is right”.And, to my mind, that is the real nub of this story.Her two daughters, aged seven and , said this to her: “You always tell us to stand up for what is right. If it means less pocket money or not going on holiday, we don’t mind.What matters to us is that when we grow up, we want to be paid the same as a man for the same job.”How poignant — and how powerful. Sometimes you have to see things through the eyes of children to realise there is only one course of action.It makes me think of that phrase: Strong women — may we know them, may we be them, and may we raise them.Well, Karen is certainly raising them. And her brave decision means that her children won’t be as subservient as the women of our generation.To an extent, women have always just accepted the status quo when it comes to men being paid more. But that’s changingStill, what Karen did by refusing the job and sending that email is brave. Most people don’t like to rock the boat, which sometimes means we accept things that should be unacceptable.And women, especially mothers, are often so grateful to have a job that they don’t question it. That’s especially the case for single working mums, as Karen is.Most single working mums simply can’t afford not to work, so they put up and shut up. But that expectation that women should accept less than they are worth makes my blood boil.Can you imagine, by the way,it had emerged that men were routinely being paid less than women  Would we ever hear the end of it Not until equality came. So maybe we all need to think like men for a bit.By rocking the boat, Karen is taking one for the team. She will be no doubt be seen as a troublemaker by some potential employers. But it’s not until people make stands like this that change happens.Despite the furore, the gender pay gap is still everywhere, and it’s not until people say, “No more” that things will change. The bottom line is that women need to start feeling a bit more entitled.We need to know our worth and not be afraid to ask for it. Because the sad truth is that people will pay you less than you are worththey can get away with it. So let’s not be muggins enough to accept it, eh HAVE you been following the story of chef Gary Usher, who was asked by a homeless man called Derickhe had any jobs in his restaurant He offered Derick a job as a kitchen porter. And then tweeted about it because he was happy to have done a good deed.His tweet then went viral. And then suddenly people started accusing him of exploiting homeless people to publicise his restaurant.But given the fact that Usher has declined every single one of the many invitations he has had to go on TV to talk about this story that is so patently untrue.And also, regardless of whether he publicised it or not, there is no doubt that he did a good thing.Still, he has been roundly vilied for what was evidently a kind-hearted gesture.Social media has made us into a nation of cynics and critics. The saying “no good deed goes unpunished” seems very true on this occasion.LOTS of teenagers will no doubt be envious to hear about Benjy Fish, the -year-old from Middlesex who has dropped out of school after being encouraged by his mother – to become a professional gamer.Benjy, who has so far earned £, playing Fortnite, is ranked among the best in the world.And he has guaranteed himself another £, by qualying for this year’s Fortnite World Cup, which boasts a prize pool of £million.He’ll be competing at the event in New York this July, which may sound like the dream for some, and I wish him all the best.But has any parent ever uttered the words: “I hope my son quits school at  to become a professional gamer”  I seriously doubt it.NO doubt the critics will line up to bemoan the fact that Davina McCall is dating again after her orce from Matthew Robertson.She is seeing her long-term friend and hairdresser, Michael Douglas, who she has known for more than  years.All I can think about is just how daunting it must be to put yourself “out there” and start dating again after  years of marriage and three kids.Add to that the burden of being famous, which makes it hard to join Tinder .But we should all wish Davina well – good for her for giving herself another chance at happiness and finding love again. She turned  in October and has got a whole new chapter of her le to live. Why should that be alone Divorcees out there should take heart. You are entitled to happiness. You might just want to go and have a bit of fun by putting yourself out there without waiting for Mr Perfect.Or the love of your le might already be under your nose, like Davina’s hairdresser.What could be better than getting together with an old friend, because he knows the real her. But also, possibly best of all, no more bad hair days.I HAVE no idea what is being shown at the Cannes Film Festival­ – these days it’s much more about the red-carpet dresses than the actual movies.And wow, were there some dresses this year.Alessandra Ambrosio, , and Sharon Stone, , dazzled in little red numbers.The most amazing thing is that there is  years between them. What is Sharon Stone’s secret  She never ages.SO sad reading about Jasmine Bush, the -year old schoolgirl who threw herself in front of a train on the day she was due to receive the grades for her GCSEs in .She had been suffering with ious mental health issues, including anxiety, and had been on medication to help control the symptoms.But she had also been smoking marijuana to relieve anxiety symptoms. Except it clearly had the opposite effect. This story is every parent’s nightmare.Smoking weed is seen as innocent and has been normalised by the fact that “everyone does it”. But it is illegal for a reason.Marijuana is known to make people paranoid and, far from curing anxiety, it exacerbates it.

Since March , the day the UK should have left the EU, there has been a growing sense of political crisis.Brexit wasn’t happening and the government’s impressive achievements were being lost in the fog. If government was telling people about the growing economy, unemployment falling to its lowest since  or the UK attracting more inward investment in the last year than any other country in the world – no-one was listening.Theresa May was rightly committed to building a majority in parliament for something that would at least complete the first stage of Brexit and allow a new leader to negotiate the future relationship without constant battles in parliament getting in the way.But when she started offering concessions to Jeremy Corbyn’s far left outfitt, the mood in the Tory party darkened.As Chairman of the Parliamentary Conservative Party - the “ Committee” - I had to balance two very strong demands from my colleagues.Firstly, with the failure to exit the EU and the loss of so many brilliant councillors in local elections at the beginning of May, a majority of Conservative MPs had decided that a change of leader was essential.Secondly, most of my colleagues also took the view that Theresa should be allowed the space to leave the stage with dignity.However disappointed or angry people are that we are stuck in a logjam, they know that Mrs May has given it her all. Her dogged determination and absolute commitment to the service of our country have been obvious to everyone.It was sad and painful to be there at the moment that she said she would resign as leader of the party and no one could fail to be moved by her parting words outside No. The ConservativeParty knew that change was needed but I am glad that the process has begun with decency and respect.Some people inside and outside parliament have talked about me being a candidate for leader. As Chairman of the  Committee I would have been in charge of the election process so I stood down with immediate effect so that everything can be seen to be above board.I can now consider my position unconstrained. Whoever stands – and whoever wins, the task is a big one. It is nothing less than restoring the broken trust in British politics.We have to leave the EU as we promised we would and then get back to a radical agenda to let people take back control of their lives. Politicians need to talk less about social mobility and do more to make sure that everyone in our great country can make the most of their talents.The crucial starting point must be to reunite the Conservative Party: faced with the most extreme socialist threat that would destroy business, jobs and savings we owe it not to ourselves but to every decent hardworking citizen.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I couldn’t believe it.I pointed my camera at it and clicked.These Darwinian resonances are of consuming interest.Galapagos itself is today engaged in some kind of Darwinian struggle for survival.For centuries, the islands’ resources were plundered.The population of giant tortoises, for example, which at one time numbered more than ,, was reduced to a tenth of that size.Whaling fleets put in for supplies of fresh meat and the giant tortoises were an obvious and easy target.Tortoise oil lit the lamps in Quito, Ecuador’s burgeoning capital city.Even more signicant, perhaps, was the collateral damage that centuries of exploitation created, particularly as a result of the impacts of invasive species.Feral cats, rats, dogs, pigs and donkeys wrought havoc even after the ships that first brought them had long since disappeared.The plunder wasn’t limited to the land. The health of the seas surrounding the islands was put at risk through illegal and uncontrolled exploitation of the islands’ marine resources.When I first visited Galapagos, almost  years ago, it struck me that the islands’ future was truly balanced on a kne-edge.Though serious attempts were being made to deal with the underlying problems, particularly the impact of invasive species and overfishing, there was still a long way to go.And there were new menaces. Galapagos, or so it seemed, might become the victim of its own success, as tourists by the thousand were poised to overwhelm the islands’ ability to cope.Marine pollution too, including from plastic waste, was another factor to contend with.“The irony of plastic waste in the Galapagos,” Jorge explained to me one evening, “is that a large proportion is generated internationally, outside the islands but brought by ocean currents to our shores.”Even nine years ago, when my we and I last visited Galapagos, it wasn’t clear to me that the corner had been turned.Admittedly, the arrival of cruise liners had been prohibited. Sophisticated methods had been introduced to handle the flow of tourists and new rules prevented, or at least reduced, immigration from mainland Ecuador.On the ground, a radical programme to deal with invasive species was achieving impressive results.On Isabela Island, for example, New Zealand sharp-shooters, patrolling in helicopters, had effectively eradicated the islands’ once-teeming population of feral goats.But still it seemed to me very much a touch-and-go affair. Even as one problem was dealt with, others raised their heads. Though progress had been made as far as the control of invasive species was concerned, there was still a long way to go before every last cat, goat, rat or feral pig was eliminated from the islands.Nor was the problem limited to animals. You had to deal with insects too. A nasty fly , another non-native pest, was attacking the chicks of Darwin’s finches, with horrendous effects.Then there were the invasive plants. Some of them, such as the Himalayan hill raspberry, seem to be as hard to control as Japanese knotweed — and just as devastating.On this latest visit, I have been impressed by how much progress is being made since I was last here. In spite of dire forecasts, the cruise ships are still not disgorging boatloads of passengers. The many tourists who do come, while welcome for the vital income, are carefully managed.And the fight against invasive species is still being prosecuted with determination. If the habitat can be safeguarded, endangered species may once more thrive.Take the giant tortoise, for example, that iconic symbol of Galapagos.We spent an afternoon at the Charles Darwin Research Centre in Puerto Ayora, Santa Cruz.It is an internationally supported institution, which for the past  years has been at the heart of the effort to restore all the still extant species of giant tortoise to their traditional habitats on the ious islands.The animals mate, eggs are laid and hatched and young tortoises reared until they are old and strong enough to be released into the wild. Or take an avian species on the brink of extinction: The wonderful Floreana mockingbird.On the third day of our voyage, we spent an hour snorkeling off tiny Champion Island, just off Floreana.From time to time I took off my mask to stare at the cactus on Champion’s clftops, hoping against hope to glimpse a Floreana mockingbird.I knew it would be a long shot. Ironically, the Floreana mockingbird, one of three mockingbird species studied by Darwin in the Galapagos, is actually extinct on Floreana itself.But around  to  birds are to be found on nearby Gardner islet, with another tiny population of around  to  birds surviving on Champion Island.Amazingly, as I climbed back into the panga, I caught sight of a small bird on the nearby clf, darting from one prickly cactus to another.“Look there!” I pointed. “Isn’t that a Floreana mockingbird ”Jorge took out his binoculars. “I think it is.”I couldn’t believe my luck. There are around , bird species in the world and the Floreana mockingbird is one of the rarest you will ever encounter.Bringing it back to Floreana will be a long, tough job.It’s not just a question of getting rid of the rats which prey on the eggs and the chicks.The Opuntia cactus, whose flowers are the Floreana mockingbird’s staple food and which has been largely eaten out by goats, must be re-established too.As I look back at the week that has just passed, I think of the magnicent wildle we have seen — iguanas on land and sea, albatrosses, petrels and flamingos, blue- and red-footed boobies, frigatebirds, pelicans, sea lions, whitetip reef sharks and marine turtles to name but a few.But that brief and fleeting vision of the Floreana mockingbird is perhaps my most vivid memory of all.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Both are gripped by internal contests that make Bake Off look like a picnic. Most Tories want Brexit, but canapost decide whether to crash out or bind to Brussels. Labour officially wants soft Brexit, but plenty of MPs and members donapost want Brexit at all. For years now, each leader has tried to appease both sides of a warring party by toeing a careful path down the middle. In last nightaposs European elections, the Brexit cake finally collapsed in the oven. And the doughy gloop of support slid out in two directions - either to vehement pro-Brexit parties, or parties that are vehemently against it. As the sun rises yet again on a ided, polarised country, prepare for MPs to launch an almighty spat about which direction the dough slid.  For the Tories, the argumentaposs pretty simple. Theresa Mayaposs party is the Brexit Party that hasnapost delivered Brexit. It seems fair to assume many voters - though by no means all - defected to Farage. Itaposs for Labour that the argument is the most bitter. MPs in Leave-voting heartlands will argue their votes went to Nigel Farage. And theyaposre probably right. Labour MPs in metropolitan areas like London will argue their votes went to the Lib Dems. And theyaposre probably right too. So as both sides seize on the figures to prove theyaposre right, itaposs important to understand exactly how the cake slumped, and what happened on the night.You can read the full results here, and below is a summary of  things we learned.. Tories suffered their worst result apossince apos  It really is impossible to overstate how ridiculously terribly the result is for the Tories.The Conservatives suffered their worst election result for almost  years as resigning Theresa May was annihilated in the EU elections.With every British region declared except Scotland, Brexit civil war finally obliterated the party of government. It won less than % of the vote - landing in fth place behind the Greens - and lost  of  seats. The BBC suggested it was the worst result since . But Brexiteer MEP Daniel Hannan, one of just three Tories remaining in England and Wales, disagreed. He pointedly said it was the worst ever. . The Brexit Party stormed to a landslide  The Brexit Party looked to have picked up virtually all the hardest of Brexit votes, winning .% across England and Wales and  seats.Anti-gay former Tory Ann Widdecombe triumphed in the South West and Jacob Rees-Moggaposs sister Annunziata was elected in the East Midlands. In both those regions the Toriesapos seats were completely wiped out. Farage used his victory speech to warn he could win a general election,  If we donapost leave on October  then the scores youaposve seen for the Brexit Party today will be repeated in a general election, he said. And we are getting ready for it. EU elections are of course a protest vote - but that wonapost stop a chill going down the spines of Tories hearing that message.  This was in no way a story of Brexit winning the night. The Lib Dems had the best night in history in many areas, recovering from an admittedly catastrophic low point in . The party enjoyed an incredible -point surge to % and rocketed their seat tally from  to . The aposbollocks to Brexitapos party even topped the bill in London - including in Jeremy Corbynaposs back yard of Islington. In a statement, Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said: Our clear, honest, unambiguous message has won us our best ever European election result, and pushed Corbynaposs Labour into third place. We have shown ourselves to be the strongest Remain force in British politics. . And Stop Brexit parties officially BEAT Hard Brexit parties aposStop Brexitapos parties got MORE votes in the European elections than Nigel Farageaposs Brexit Party, final results for England and Wales reveal.Despite the Brexit Partyaposs thumping victory, the full results show solidly pro-EU parties beat parties that want to crash out with no deal on October . With all British regions counted except Scotland, the Lib Dems had won .%, the Greens won .% and Change UK won .%. That meant the three biggest anti-Brexit parties won % of the vote - compared to .% for UKIP and the Brexit Party put together. UKIP won .% of the vote while Nigel Farageaposs outfit won .%. The fact that Hard Remain aposwonapos over Hard Brexit, yet trailed so far in the results, shows how failing to have a unity party has punished campaigners at the ballot box.  Happily, ballot papers donapost come with a -page questionnaire delving into your personal existential crisis in politics. So we will never be able to prove how voters switched the way they did. But Labour has erupted into a fresh Brexit row nonetheless after the party came third behind the Lib Dems and Brexit Party. As ever the argument is over whether voters flocked to Hard Brexit, Hard Remain - or both. Labouraposs leader faced fresh calls to come out fully against Brexit after Labouraposs vote share in England and Wales plummeted more than  points to .%, and the party lost eight of  seats. Former Tony Blair advisor Alastair Campbell has revealed he did NOT vote Labour - for the first time in his le - and voted Lib Dem instead.Furious Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry - who is Mr Corbynaposs constituency neighbour in Islington - said Labour got a kicking because the party “weren’t clear” on Brexit. In a blunt message to Jeremy Corbyn , she demanded the Labour leader swing fully behind a second referendum on Brexit.Jeremy Corbyn issued a midnight statement, but it did not commit to a second referendum - only to either going to the public with a referendum, OR holding a general election. Mr Corbyn did however promise “conversations across the party ide” to find a way forward. Elsewhere the Greens enjoyed a surge that was reflected by eco-parties across the continent, including in France, Germany and Ireland. They more than doubled their seat tally to , including a win for Magid Magid, a former refugee who became Lord Mayor of Sheffield aged  and “banned” Donald Trump from the city.Magid branded the US President a aposwastemanapos and barred him Sheffield during his time as Mayor of the city. The councillor, whose mother fled to Britain from war-torn Somalia when he and his siblings were children, is opposed to Trumpaposs views on immigration.   Overall an early projection showed the Greens European Free Alliance group would pick up  of the  seats across the  EU nations - up  since . Germany’s Greens came second behind Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party in the election.  Far right extremist Stephen Yaxley Lennon, better known as Tommy Robinson, failed spectacularly in his bid to join the European Parliament. Robinson, , became known to the public after co-founding right wing activist group the English Defence League . He stood as an independent candidate in the North West, winning just , votes - prompting laughter when the result was read out in Manchester. That amounts to .% which means he loses his deposit. He tried to blame social media sites for banning him over his views. The Brexit Party won more than , while the Liberal Democrats took almost ,.  Ukip lost all of its MEPs in the European Parliament, despite topping the voting figures in .The pro-Leave partyaposs support collapsed after the insurgent Brexit Party came top of the polls in England and Wales, picking up  MEPs.Ukip leader Gerard Batten lost his seat in London, which he had held since . The partyaposs YouTuber candidate Carl Benjamin, second on the partyaposs South West regional list, also failed to get elected after making jokes about rape.  Change UK only just scraped a higher vote share than UKIP, finishing sixth in England and Wales with zero seats and a measly .%. Its launch with Labour and Tory defectors enjoyed a blaze of publicity in February but fell flat after a string of high-profile gaffes. Leader Heidi Allen confessed the fledgling party could now collapse and its members plead to join the Lib Dems. She said: I think we have to learn. We have done really well from a standing start, but clearly the prize is the countryaposs future and we have to look at what went well, what went badly for us. And I think we need to work with other right-minded parties like us that are pushing for Remain. Because the country has to come first, it is not about the brand, we must come together.

For comparison, below are the full results from the  European Parliament election:  How did the vote work The UK elected  MEPs to sit in the European Parliament -  from Britain and three from Northern Ireland. Those MEPs will only sit in the Parliament until Brexit happens, currently scheduled for October  at the latest. Seats are split between  large regions of the UK. In each region, votes are counted for each party and then seats are allocated to those parties along a mathematical formula called the DaposHondt System. In each region, the party with the most votes gets the first seat.Then that partyaposs total vote figure isided by two- and the party with the most votes in the second roundgets the second seat.The process is repeated via a formula until all seats have been dished out. As it goes on,a party wins a second seat in its region, its vote total is then ided by three. If it wins a third seat, its vote total is then ided by four. And so on. Parties decide which inidual candidates get to scoop up their seats through a numbered list system.

Labour were knocked into third place by the Lib Dems, losing  of their  seats and almost immediately descended into infighting over its fence-sitting Brexit stance. But Mr McDonnell, a key ally of the Jeremy Corbyn , appeared to demand his party change their position this morning.It comes after months of hostility to Labour backing a second referendum from key members of Labouraposs shadow cabinet. The Shadow Chancellor tweeted: Can’t hide from hit we took last night. Bringing people together when there’s such a ide was never going to be easy.    Now we face prospect of Brexiteer extremist as Tory leader  threat of no deal, we must unite our party  country by taking issue back to people in a public vote. It is understood that the preference within the party is still for a general election but that in line with their conference motion they could be moving to back votes on the terms of the UKaposs departure from the EU. Senior Labour insiders have also claimed that Mr McDonnell has been supported the idea of a second referendum in private meetings, though has largely stayed silent on the matter in shadow cabinet. Mr Corbyn has hinted the Labour Party may move closer to backing a second referendum after the party received a drubbing which saw it lose half its MEPs and take just % of the vote. But shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon insisted Labour had the right approach in seeking to appeal to both Leavers and Remainers - even though it was not suitable for the European elections. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry and deputy Labour leader Tom Watson both called for a more strident position from the party on the issue of a second referendum. In a statement, the Labour leader said the EU elections had become a proxy second referendum. He said: With the Conservatives disintegrating and unable to govern, and Parliament deadlocked, this issue will have to go back to the people, whether through a general election or a public vote. He added: Over the coming days, we will have conversations across our party and movement, and reflect on these results on both sides of the Brexit ide.    Labour won just  MEPs in England and Wales and although Scotlandaposs result is not yet official, Mr Corbynaposs party is on course to lose its two MEPs there. In  the party won  MEPs across the UK.Mr Corbynaposs party trailed in third place, behind the Brexit Party and Liberal Democrats nationally.But Mr Burgon said: I think the message of trying to bring people together who voted Remain and Leave is the right message.

A general election would be very dferent. He told ITVaposs Good Morning Britain that Labour could support a referendum to stop a new Tory leader taking the UK out of the EU without a deal. Whether it be a no confidence vote in the Government, a general election or a public vote, we will use whatever mechanism necessary to stop a disastrous no-deal Brexit, he said. Mr McDonnell said Labour could not hide from the hit it took in the elections.Faced with the prospect of a Brexiteer extremist taking over from Theresa May , a public vote would unite our party and country.   Mr Watson said the party cannot go into a general election without a clear position on a second referendum and a special conference may be needed to decide a Brexit policy. He tweeted a link to a survey on his website, asking members how the party should agree a new Brexit policy. He said: Following the disastrous EU election results, Labour urgently needs to re-think its Brexit position and realign with members and voters. Ms Thornberry - who was Labouraposs representative on the BBCaposs election programme - tore into her partyaposs position live on air. She said: We went into an election where the most important issue was aposwhat was our view on leaving the European Union apos and we were not clear about it.

Here#xs the statement in full.After three years of Tory failure to deliver a Brexit that works for the whole country, these elections became a proxy second referendum. With the Conservatives disintegrating and unable to govern, and parliament deadlocked, this issue will have to go back to the people, whether through a general election or a public vote. Labour will bring our ided country together so we can end austerity and tackle inequality. Over the coming days we will have conversations across our party and movement, and reflect on these results on both sides of the Brexit ide. We will not let the continuing chaos in the Conservative Party push our country into a No Deal exit from the EU.

But Austin, Rupert and Ethan were safely delivered on April  and mum and babies are doing well, reports Hull Live.Triplet pregnancies rarely run to term so the babies often have a low birth weight, are underdeveloped and need intensive care to survive. Tanya was just  weeks pregnant when they were delivered.Mrs Hall has called her unexpected babies, who were naturally conceived, miracles and set up an Instagram page during her pregnancy to provide support and a success story of giving birth to triplets.    We found out I was pregnant at six weeks. Before we went for my scan my husband Kris joked and said he hoped we had twins, as his brother [the father of] non-identical twins, said Mrs Hall, who also has a -year-old stepdaughter. During the scan, the nurse told us we had not one but two heartbeats, and so twins, then turned the screen and went to get a senior, who came back and confirmed we were having triplets.We then told them that they could stop counting, and they askedwe had IVF, but we hadnapost. Our three boys, Austin, Rupert and Ethan are little miracles as the survival rates of triplets is low, and we had complications through TTTSas the babies were sharing one placenta, which meant one of them was getting an overload of blood flow from the placenta and the others werenapost.    I went to London for laser syndrome to treat it at  weeks where they basically stabbed into my womb to shave my placenta into three places to give each baby a chance, and thankfully they all survived the procedure, and I also had a litre and a half of amniotic fluid drained which shrunk my tummy. At  weeks and three days the triplets were born in Burnley and then we were taken over to Hull, with the babies being transported via helicopter and ambulance after ten days. The babies were born by Caesarean section with Austin arriving first, followed by Rupert and then Ethan. After a quick kiss from their delighted new parents, the babies were taken to the neonatal intensive care unit. The next morning the couple were allowed to meet their children properly and were thrilled with their progress, as despite being born so prematurely, they were already off breathing support.Now Mrs Hall is seeing her boys daily at Hull Royal Infirmary, and is pleased with their development. Austin was born weighing lb, Ethan at lb oz and Rupert at lb oz."},{"url":null,"title":"girl 5 spends school playtimes","story":"NewsGirl, , spends school playtimes alone after shes refused electric wheelchairFrancesca Cirillo relies on an adult to push her manual wheelchair around, meaning she struggles to socialise with other pupilsShareCommentsByAlya Zayed:,  MAY NewsFrancesca with her dad Domenico, mum Magdalena, and sister Maria \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A five-year-old girl spends school playtimes on her own after she was aposrefusedapos a powered wheelchair.Francesca Cirillo has spinal muscular atrophytype  which affects her ability to stand or walk.

As she can walk a few steps at a time, it was reportedly decided she did not qualy for a powered wheelchair which would allow her to move independently and join in with the fun at playtime. Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Wheelchair Services have given her a manual wheelchair which leaves her dependent on an adult to push her around. This means she struggles to socialise with other pupils.Dad Domenico Cirillo told Cambridgeshire Live : “Francesca spends a lot of time by herself.“SMA has really affected her confidence and is holding her back from being able to form social groups, in and out of school – anyone with a five-year-old knows how important that is.”    He added: “Francesca has reached an age where she is starting to ask more questions about her condition – she knows she is dferent, she knows she doesn’t have the same abilities as her friends – but this chair would give her some independence and that is vital for her as she grows.” Her parents have turned to Newle, a charity for disabled children, to raise the money needed for a powered wheelchair. Mr Cirillo said: “We have ploughed all our savings into giving Francesca a safe place to live and making our home more accessible for her. “We just don’t have the money to buy the wheelchair too.”   The company previously providing wheelchair and mobility services to the NHS was Provide, which reportedly shut Francesca’s case saying no further action was required, but AJM Healthcare has taken over since.An AJM Healthcare representative said they will be reopening the case and have booked Francesca in for a new assessment in June. Mr Cirillo said: “Having spoken to the medical team, it might be that they provide some vouchers towards the cost of the chair, and that would help Newle make up the rest of the cost.” He added: “It’s less pressure on the charitythe NHS could provide more support but we’re conscious that the NHS is stretched and we are grateful for whatever we can get.” Cambridgeshire-based charity Wheels for Martin’s Friends has already donated £,, but more is still needed for the £, chair.

The ageing villain recruited major gangland figures to help ship his cut from the infamous £million raid. The Mirror understands the valuables were shipped to Holland before they were moved to Spain. Police have recovered more than £million of the crooks’ total haul, but are still trying to trace booty worth nearly £million. Our revelation comes after millions tuned in on Friday to Ross Kemp’s ITV documentary on the infamous raid, in which a record £million of gems, jewellery, cash and gold was stolen. Kemp’s Hatton Garden: The Inside Story revealed unseen police surveillance footage, secret recordings of the gang’s conversations.    ITV also screened a four-part dramatisation last week, starring Timothy Spall as burglar Terry Perkins and Kenneth Cranham as mastermind Brian Reader. The real-le gang, led by Reader, then , broke into the vault of London’s Hatton Garden Safe Deposit company over the Easter weekend in . On the first night, they entered the building, disabled the lt, climbed down the shaft to the basement, disabled the alarm and drilled three holes through half-a-metre thick concrete. After the ten-tonne jack they were using to topple metal shelving on the other side of the hole broke, the gang ed two nights later – without Reader – to complete the raid. But six of them were caught the following month after one of their vehicles was spotted on CCTV by police.    Reader, Perkins, then aged , John “Kenny” Collins, , Danny Jones, , Carl Wood,  and William “Billy the Fish” Lincoln,  – were jailed for up to seven years each in March  for conspiracy to commit burglary. The final gang member Michael “Basil” Seed, , was arrested last year and jailed in March for  years. Claims that one of the men smuggled £m worth of valuables abroad come in a revised edition of a biography of Brian Reader called One Last Job. A source told the authors: “The gang were made to look like idiots after they were arrested. But nothing could be further from the truth.  “One of them got £million out of the country, through Holland to Spain, and he will be able to enjoy his retirement when it finally begins.” The gang were covertly recorded falling out with each other in the aftermath of the raid, amid suspicions some themselves to a larger share of the spoils. It is possible that claims of loot being moved abroad is a ploy to distract others from the fact that more is hidden closer to home.

Jessica Greaves was born with cerebral palsy and has never spoken a word. In the first first five months of her le, her parents Natalie and Matt didn’t knowthey would ever be able to communicate with her. But things changed when they played her a lullaby and she gave a beaming smile.Since then, the family have spoken through the power of music, Birmingham Live reports. Natalie and Matt have played all kinds of  music with Jessica, including musical instruments.Her sister Bethany, , has Downs Syndrome and loves to sing to her.Over time, theyaposve seen Jessica’s tastes change as she has grown up - today, , she loves listening to Ed Sheeran .   The family has recently started working with Soundabout, a charity that empowers children and young people with special needs to communicate through music. The charity worked with Jessica to create a lullaby that says aposI love youapos using sounds. I know about the positives of music for young people, we know how much Jessica gets from it, said Natalie, who is also mum to Megan, . Music is her love, it takes her out of being so trapped. It enables her to communicate and engage.    Natalie, a paramedic from Stourbridge, added: “Jessica had to be resuscitated at birth and suffered severe brain damage. “She cannot talk or walk or use her hands and she has to be fed through a tube. “Everyone was so unsure of her prognosis but when we played her a lullaby on one of her mobile toys we realised there was a way we could communicate with her. “It was something we knew she enjoyed.”  Soundabout invited renowned composers Dame Evelyn Glennie, John Rutter, Will Todd and Debbie Wiseman OBE to work with Jessica to come up with a lullaby that said aposI love youapos using sound alone. “When I saw the video footage of Jessica vocalising and running her fingers along the guitar, I cried and cried, said Natalie. “They used her vocalising sounds to put the lullaby together. “She loves to listen to it, we tell her it’s Jessica’s song and she’s become very attached to it. “She knows her name and she smiles when we say that.” “We can’t communicate with Jessica in any other way, said Natalie.  I know, as her mum, when she’s happy or sad, but it’s lovely for her to be able to express when she likes something. “She smiles and makes happy sounds when we put something on that she likes, it’s like she’s trying to sing, it’s really quite incredible. “If we don’t put music on, saywe’re talking in the car, she’ll shout and shout until we do. We drove to France last summer and I think we know Now  off by heart now. “Bethany loves to sing and dance and she knows she’ll get some much out of Jessica when she does. She says she knows how to make her sister happy.  Music also helps Jessica to understand her daily routine. “It’s had a massive impact on her routine. She likes to listen to Chris Evans on the radio and she associates this with waking up and knows it’s time for us to get her washed and dressed and ready for school. “When she comes home she loves to watch Disney films because they have lots of music in them, and she like Mary Poppins too, that’s her favourite at the moment. “Then we play lullabies at bedtime and she knows that’s time to go to sleep. “Music helps to relax her.”  The family also have bells, a harmonica and a piano for Jessica to play with their help. Jessicaaposs Lullaby forms part of Soundabout’s #ShareTheLove campaign, raising awareness of the vital role that music plays in the lives of people with complex learning disabilities and autism. Revellers going to see Classic Ibiza at Ragley Hall this summer are helping to raise funds for Soundabout.  Clare Cook, CEO of Soundabout said: “Soundabout works to unlock the potential of children, young people and adults with severe and profound learning disabilities through music, and empowers families, carers and teachers to do the same. We believe that every child should have access to meaningful music provision, both for its own sake and to support their wider development. Our recent report “Sounds of Intent in the Early Years” revealed the signicant impact that music has in “closing the developmental gap” especially for children with complex needs. Global’s Make Some Noise is raising funds to support our “Building Bridges” project which focuses on music making during times of particular challenge for children with complex needs and their families - the moment shortly after birth when diagnosis hits, and the transition out of school when these young people reach .”To download Jessica’s lullaby or find out more, click  here"},{"url":null,"title":"hunt man who attempted snatch","story":"NewsHunt for man who attempted to snatch toddler from mum in seaside townThe man \"took hold of\" the toddler right in front of his mum in Weston-super-Mare, Avon and Somerset Police sayShareCommentsByEddie BinghamBradley Jolly:,  MAY NewsThe alleged incident happened in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe man who tried to snatch a toddler in a seaside town did so in broad daylight and right in front of his mum, it has tonight emerged.Police investigating the attempted abduction, which happened on Thursday , say the man took hold of the boy when he was at a pond with his mother.

Kaiden Jake Shattock, now sixth months old, was born with an undiagnosed condition that meant he was born with only  percent of his skin  - just enough to cover his face. Jessica Kibbler and Jake Shattock, who were  when they had their baby, said Kaiden was in so much pain that even the nurses couldnapost stop themselves from crying. Kaiden, whose hearing is also impaired, was born  weeks into the pregnancy and while Jessica had had some complications while carrying him, there had been no indication of his condition. The parents, from Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, both now , described Kaiden as red raw, like a piece of uncooked meat when they first saw him nine hours after he was delivered.  When the nurses took us into the room to introduce us to Kaiden for the first time, he was red raw, like a piece of uncooked meat, Jessica said. There we were, two -year-old new parents, with no experience of raising children, and our first was born very weak and very ill. Everyone was silent, and everyone was distressed and upset. Jake and I cried, but even the nurses left the room and cried their eyes out because they didnapost know what to say to use and didnapost know how  to help him.  Kaiden was so fragile he couldnapost be held for ten days and even than he had to be wrapped in a mattress before being picked up. Being born with skin on his face only, he couldnapost wear any clothes. He was miraculously able to grow some skin after six weeks, although it is so thin and fragile that itaposs easily prone to tearing and scabbing. The toddler has since battled necrotising enterocolitis, congential herpes, dermolysis, and bronchiolitis thanks to his lack of skin and premature birth. Although doctors warned the parents it was unlikely the baby would make it through, Jessica and Jake said they will do anything in their means to help their son.  Jessica suffered with hydronephrosis - a kidney complication - during her pregnancy, and almost lived at the University Hospital Coventry  Warwickshire. She suffered bleeding and a broken amniotic sac nearly three months before Kaidenaposs due date, and went into an early labour. There had been no sign, however, that her son would be born with something akin to a full body burn. The young mum said after spending six weeks in intensive care and being unable tohome until he was  weeks, Kaiden now weighs lb oz and is very happy. Heaposs so perceptive - heaposs really starting to take everything in, she said.  She said despite his ear impairment, heaposs got the loveliest smile and the prettiest laugh,you get him going. We managed to pull him through - and weaposre so happy. We donapost know how long this will affect him, orthis is lelong but weaposre there to look after him and to love him no matter. Now heaposs very happy, and so much better after all the treatment heaposs had. Doctors originally speculated his skin condition was caused by a sepsis-congential herpes combination, but have since ruled that out and tested for countless skin disorders. Kaidenaposs case is now being examined by specialists abroad.

The -year-old is now sharing her story for the first time in a bid to raise awareness for burns survivors. Jessica said: Iaposm thankful for the house fire because without it I wouldnapost have stumbled across my strength.    She continued: My new pathway in le began in February , there was an accidental house fire in my home which left me with  per cent burns to my body. I needed both my legs, fingers, ear, hair and part of my mouth removed as they were too badly damaged. My injuries were so widespread across my body that they struggled to find skin to graft, they managed to take some from my back, but most grafts were taken from my twin sister who was also in the fire but sustained less burns. Those are the things that I lost but I gained so much more I was given a le that has no limits, I have always had a can-do attitude, so anything is achievable. Jessica says that she has always had a positive attitude and hopes other survivors can adopt her aposcan doapos attitude.apos    She added: Growing up it never really occurred to me that I was dferent, I felt just the same as the other kids. I would always find a way to overcome obstacles, one of my biggest achievements is learning how to swim. I live a normal le it just takes me a little longer to do simple tasks like going up and down the stairs which I have to do on my bum. Some aspects of parenting is a bit more challenging for instance pushing a pram, thataposs easy but hanging on to a pram for dear le when going downhill.

Fty local authorities admit they are burning “low-grade” packaging made from ­polyethyleneas it’s so brittle it needs to be sent to specialist recycling facilities. The problem is we don’t have any. Until last year, China received two-thirds of it, then it shut up shop. Other countries receiving our waste have also imposed restrictions, leaving us to deal with it. So instead of being turned into products, it is burned to generate electricity. There is a logic to turning waste that can’t be recycled into energy rather than being sent to landfill. But only as the last resort. The  incinerators we have in England produce the same amount of toxic particulates each year as , lorries – contributing to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. I try my best to reuse packaging but when I do recycle, I want to know my efforts have not been betrayed by it all being shoved into a furnace.    England is on the brink of burning more rubbish that it recycles. While rates of domestic waste recycling have stalled since , incineration has tripled between   and  , although this is not due to a reluctance to recycle, or to do our bit for the environment. There is a huge gap between the best and worst local authorities. But this doesn’t mean people in Westminster or Birmingham, or any other area with poor recycling rates, can’t be bothered. The system just isn’t working. To find a way out of this pollution crisis we must ­radically reduce how much is produced in the first place. We need to ban plastics that can’t be recycled and businesses should set up proper systems for those that local authorities find most dficult. But in order to be able to stop burning rubbish and dumping it on vulnerable communities abroad, we must also get rid of our ludicrously complex and chaotic recycling system of over  dferent schemes. With bewildering collection systems of multicoloured boxes, bins and bags, it is perhaps not surprising recycling rates have flatlined. A nationally consistent system would mean every household in the country recycling the same items, helped by a set of easily recycled materials.

The disgraced entertainer had allegedly hired a private investigator in a move which was feared would heap fresh agony on his victims. The investigator was said to be gathering “dirt” to discredit his accusers in the hope of reopening his case. But fresh reports from his native Australia claim the -year-old has abandoned hopes of clearing his name. When askedhe was planning to appeal his child abuse convictions, Harris told reporters: “No.”  The former Animal Hospital star added that he was suffering from diabetes, which requires frequent trips to the local doctors, one of his only regular outings. “I’ve got diabetes. I’ve suffered from it for  years,” he said when he was approached near his mansion in Bray, Berks. And a friend - named only as Michael - revealed Harris is rarely seen outside his riverfront property where he lives with his ailing we of  years, Alwen Hughes. He claimed Harris has given up any hope of fighting his convictions. “No. He hasn’t got the energy or the money, all the money’s gone paying lawyers’ fees,” he said. “I’ve already said too much.”  Michael added: “He’s a good guy and he’s doing okay, his we’s poorly and hopefully you will hear from him after July when his probation finishes.” Locals in the Maidenhead village - which is a popular celebrity haunt with Heston Blumenthal’s infamous Fat Duck restaurant less than a mile away - said they had hardly seen the pensioner in recent months.

Born in , by the age of  she was recruited to her first woman’s team – one of many created during the First World War – and played for her country not much later in . Standing ft tall, the chain-smoking left-footed winger was an equal to any man – and one of the best players England has produced. In a -year career she scored nearly , goals. As our Lionesses prepare to head to the World Cup in France next month, Lily will become the first female ­footballer to have a statue when a le-size bronze monument is unveiled at Manchester’s National Football Museum in the same month.    Cousin June Patten, , says Lily would be proud but humble about the honour. “She was strong, she was forceful, she was determined,” says June. “It is safe to say she was the best woman ­footballer in the world. “We all knew her as ‘Our Lil” and we are proud that she was one of us. She may have been fearsome on the pitch, but off the pitch she was one of the kindest, most gentle, funny and loveliest people you could have met.” Lily was born in a rented house in St Helens, Merseyside, the fourth of labourer George Parr and his we Sarah’s seven children. She first honed her football skills playing alongside her brothers on waste ground near their rented family home. The local lads soon counted her as their equal with her fearsome reputation on the pitch becoming the stuff of local legend.    June explains: “The boys used to call for her and ask her to play football. She was just accepted as one of the lads. But one of them one day said to her I bet you can’t kick a ball hard. He said I’ll go in goal and you kick the ball at me. She kicked the ball so hard she broke his arm. She had a kick like a mule. She was a better footballer than all the boys.” It wasn’t long before Lily’s talents were spotted. It was towards the end of the First World War and most men were on the frontline fighting. Women took the helm working in mills and munitions factories in tough conditions, so bosses decided that taking up a sport like football in the fresh air would be good for them. So the beautul game became the women’s game with  ladies teams dotted across the country attracting crowds of thousands, and raising money for war charities. Dick, Kerr Ladies was the best of the bunch. It was run from a munitions factory in Preston, Lancs, with the factory girls grafting hard by day and taking the ­footballing world by storm at weekends.    Lily scored an incredible  goals for them in her first season. And she represented England in the first recognised women’s international ­football game, helping her country beat France -. When Dick, Kerr played St Helens Ladies on Boxing Day of , , people flocked to Goodison Park in Liverpool to watch the game, with ­thousands more said to be locked out. But just a year later, in spite of the popularity of women’s football, the ­Football Association banned women’s clubs from its grounds, deeming the sport “quite unsuitable for females”. The ban remained in place until the late s, but that did not stop Lily from continuing to play. She toured abroad with Dick, Kerr, staying with the team until  and scoring more than  goals in her career, making her England’s most prolic goal-scorer of all time. Lily was also known for her aggressive style of play, which didn’t always go down well with the referee or the opposition. In April  Parr and Hilda Durbar of Stoke United were sent off for fighting in Dick, Kerr Ladies’ ­fractious – win before , fans at The Old Recreation Ground.    But she also had a mischievous side – she was rumoured to swipe balls from the field and sell them for profit and asked for her wages to be ­supplemented with her beloved Woodbine cigarettes. June remembers that cheeky streak well, laughing: “She was a chain smoker. One day she was playing and the ball was at the other end of the field. “There was a man leaning over the rail smoking so she took his cigarette off him, took a big drag of it and then gave it him back. “The smoking didn’t seem to bother her though.” Her cousin lived with a woman called Mary, and June recalls: “Everyone was very proud of her. She used to come on a Sunday evening to my grandma’s house, she used to bring her friend Mary who was a lovely lady, she was delightful, and we used to look forward to her coming. “She and Mary were such a joy to be with. In those days people didn’t contemplate it, but looking back now they were very likely to be gay. They were a very happy couple. “But it didn’t register with us – they were just Lily and Mary.” Lily trained as a nurse working at ­Whittingham Mental Hospital, near Preston, until she retired. She died from breast cancer aged  in , but her legend lives on.    She was the first female footballer to be inducted into the Football Hall of Fame in , and next month her statue, commissioned by chocolate makers Mars, will be unveiled. Football historian Gail Newsham, who has written a book about the legendary Dick, Kerr Ladies team, says there is no doubt that Lily was one of ­England’s greatest players of all time. She says: “The power of her shot was always a great asset and her ability. She was naturally gted and fearless. “The longevity of her career makes her stand out too and enabled her to score so many goals. “The fact that she played for so long obviously shows her love of the game. She was always admired by team mates and opponents alike. “People now look up to her as being one of the first ‘stars’ of the game. There can’t be many more players,any, who have scored more goals than Lily did.”And Gail believes England’s ­Lionesses need look no further for inspiration than Lilythey want to bring the World Cup back homethis summer.“If they can believe in their own ability as Lily did in hers, they won’t go far wrong,” she says. “Be fearless and never give up. I am sure the ­Lionesses won’t let Lily, or the rest of the Dick, Kerr Ladies, down. Let’s hope football is coming home.”Get involved in all the action and support England’s Lionesses this summer on social media using the Mars hashtag #SupportHer"},{"url":null,"title":"fbi has tapes martin luther","story":"NewsFBI has tapes of Martin Luther King laughing as woman was raped in front of himThe FBI tried to destroy the reputation of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr as controversial unearthed files revealShareCommentsByChristopher Bucktin:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsMartin Luther King, Jr. receiving a kiss from his we Coretta Scott King \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailShocking details of the FBI’s smear campaign against Martin Luther King Jr have been found on secret tapes, it is claimed. Its is alleged the agency accused the celebrated civil-rights campaigner of having up to  affairs. As the US Baptist minister rose to prominence in the s and s, he was subjected to years of wiretaps and eavesdropping by infamous intelligence chief J Edgar Hoover, who believed he had Communist Party ties. Details of the covert tapes have been revealed by biographer David Garrow, who says he has unearthed files not scheduled for release until .    The author claims Dr King, who was only  when he was killed on April , , spent  years – almost a third of his le – under the FBI’s watch. The covert surveillance was designed to undermine the civil-rights activist, as Hoover feared his popular movement could destabilise the country. Agents honed in on King’s philandering and claims he fathered a child – claims which Garrow argues could lead to “painful historical reckoning”. Although the tapes, recorded by bugs in two lamps in hotel rooms booked by King in January, , are still kept in a vault at the US National Archives, the author and historian has unearthed the FBI summaries of the ious incidents.    He claims they show King had extramarital affairs with up to  women and, shockingly, even “looked on and laughed” as pastor friend Logan Kearse raped a parishioner. The recording from the Willard Hotel, near the White House, in Washington DC, shows how King was accompanied by Kearse, who died in , along with several female parishioners of his church. In his hotel room, the files claim, they then “discussed which women among the parishioners would be suitable for natural and unnatural sex acts”. The FBI document says, “when one of the women protested that she did not approve, the Baptist minister immediately and forcefully raped her” as King watched. He is alleged to have “looked on, laughed and offered advice” during the attack. FBI agents were in the room next door, but did not intervene.    The following day, King and a dozen others allegedly participated in a “sex orgy” engaging in “acts of degeneracy and depravity”. When one woman showed resistance, King was allegedly heard saying that performing the act “would help your soul”. Senior FBI officials allegedly later sent a copy of the incriminating tape to King and called him an “evil abnormal beast” and told him his sexual exploits would be “on record for all time”. The letter also suggested he should commit suicide before his wrongs were revealed to the world. Mr Garrow said he had no idea of the scale or the ugliness of it, nor of King’s apparent indference to rape until he saw the files. He said: “It poses so fundamental a challenge to his historical stature as to require the most complete and extensive historical review possible.”    Historian and leading American civil rights activist, Edith Lee Payne, told the Mirror she was disgusted at the claims. The -year-old, of Detroit, Michigan, who became the iconic poster girl of the I Have A Dream speech in Washington, said: “This  information on Dr King is beyond disturbing. It’s blatantly obvious that this person is using the sterling reputation of one of the most admired and respected men for personal attention and for what remains to be seen. “Certainly an attack on Dr King would get him attention. Fortunately, there are still people around who were close to Dr King and know him and his character. The le of a dedicated, committed, selfless man, husband, father, pastor, and civil rights leader as Reverend Dr Martin Luther King, Jr. demanded that his time and efforts meet each challenge and responsibility.  His respect as a civil rights leader reached millions of people from every wall of le, race, creed, colour, gender, nationality and religion in this country and around the world. Personally, I am immensely honoured and proud to have marched with him twice. The second time was the August , , March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in Washington DC that rocked the nation and the world and we still celebrate Dr King more than five decades later and by generations who werenapost even born.    He will continue to be celebrated for generations to come. He was that kind of man.  If the FBI really had damaging evidence on Dr King they would have exposed it. From first-hand accounts to me from members of his inner circle, he was never alone even he travelled.  His time was consumed in strategies, meetings and organizing in preparation for acts of civil disobedience or whatever he was called upon to do, and, of course, rest. Heaposs authored scores of books and articles, delivered speeches public and private but his best time was spent with his family, a loving we, who accompanied him often, and with his four children whom he adored. Reverend Dr Martin Luther King Jr. lived a le of selfless service to God first and to humanity. There was no room or interest for anything . To suggest that he would knowingly or willingly engage in anything illicit or criminal would discredit everything he sacriced for, stood for and ultimately died for. Yesterday, the claims ided opinion among posters on social media. Rhonda Veit said: “Do we take down the MLK memorial and rename all the streets named after MLK now ” One wrote: “Goes to show the FBI has been illegally spying on Americans all the way back to Martin Luther King.” Last year, former FBI director James Comey unapologetically and openly criticised Hoover for spying on Dr King. He said the Bureau unlawfully investigated his private le and used intimidation to decrease his growing support.

Amanda Teague was forced to undergo an exorcism after she says her former soulmate turned nasty and possessed her. In , she claimed to have married a Haitian pirate called Jack who died in the s after being executed for thieving on the high seas. But she says her union left her hospitalised after claiming she discovered that her husband was not all he made himself out to be The -year-old - who previously worked as a Captain Jack Sparrow impersonator - is now warning people about casually dabbling in spirituality. She said: After two weeks of marriage, I started to get health problems.  I started to get reoccurring perianal abscesses and I was suffering from cirrhosis. About four or five months in, when things started to go really downhill, I went back to some of the people that had communicated with Jack. I know the symptoms of possession and part of it is ill health. So I was concerned that it was to do with the relationship because of the timeline. But I was assured that he was a lovely spirit who wouldnapost harm me. But after her dog Toby died, Amanda says she spotted a major red flag about the relationship. She said: I knew his passing was imminent and Iaposd asked Jack to keep him until it was my time so weaposd all be together. But Toby wouldnapost go to Jack, he was incredibly aggressive and wouldnapost go near him. In the end, he had to go to my mother because he just didnapost want to be near him. Animals are quite intuitive about people so this was a big red flag to me.    But Amanda, of Downpatrick, Northern Ireland, says that whilst the couple moved on from the incident, her health began to get worse. She said: I was getting abscesses recurring all the time after Jack and I would have any sexual relationship. It was something that was at the back of my mind - I never had these before I was with Jack. The -year-old even cut off sex with the ghost in order to seethat helped. She said: Once I stopped having sexual contact with Jack, the abscesses started to improve. And Iaposd say that was literally the best three weeks Iaposd had since we got married. So anyway, one night, a friend of mine got married to her spiritual partner and Jack and I ended up being intimate. The very next day, the abscess was back with a vengeance. So then I started to get really concerned.    In May last year, Amanda was whisked off to the hospital for surgery after developing sepsis . She said: I almost died and I was in the hospital for a week. I had to take my wedding ring off when I went into surgery. That must have cut the energy link between us because I felt totally dferent after the operation. I reconnected with my own spiritual team and I really saw a pattern about my health. I really saw alarm bells. He had obviously been blocking communication with my spiritual team. So I could see very, very clearly that he had been stealing my energy. Following the surgery, doctors warned Amanda that she might need a colostomy bag due to her ill health. But Amanda sought the help of a former close friend who had warned her against the spiritual union. She said: I had one person who had turned around to me and said what he thought I was doing dangerous.    Iaposd had a big row with him but I picked up the phone and told him that I thought he was right. The pal warned Amanda that she could have been possessed by Jack and that she should talk to him about it. But when she says she confronted him, she claims he threatened to kill hershe attempted to break off their spiritual union. She said: His reaction when I told him he had to leave was that he wasnapost going too. And thatI tried to have an exorcism and get rid of him, he was going to kill me. It was terrying seeing a completely dferent side to the lovely spirit I had seen before. But I knew in my heart thatI didnapost get rid of him, my health was getting so bad, that I was probably going to die anyway. Incredibly, following the exorcism in December, Amanda says her health has drastically improved. She said: Previously, Iaposd had an MRI scan in November which showed that my bowel was perforated. Thataposs something that doesnapost heal without surgery. So I had the exorcism and incredibly it healed up. Iaposve not had any more abscesses or bowel problems at all since then. I went to the hospital recently and the junior doctor called in a consultant because she was like aposIaposve never seen this before.apos If I hadnapost got the exorcism done, I think Iaposd definitely be going around with a colostomy bag. Now Amanda has written a book about her experiences and says she has sworn off all spiritual work. She added: Iaposve quit it all because Iaposm terried.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

It is obvious to everyone that the pier not being open is a resource wasted.#Inveraray Pier has been in existence since . Comprising an older stone-built section and later timber structure, it was once a thriving hub for Inveraray#s herring fleet and a popular destination for passenger steamers. It was used by everything from pleasure craft to puffers, with the military also making good use of it over the years.In more recent times it has fallen into disrepair and was closed off to public access in the last decade.#When we heard it was for sale we decided to make a bid,# continued Mr Byrne.#It would have been a shame to see it fall into the hands of someone who would want to use it just as a private pier. It#s about securing its future.#The Byrne family intends to re-open the pier for public use # but Mr Byrne is keen to dampen speculation about the potential future uses for the structure.Before anything  happens, the condition of the stone and wooden sections must be assessed, and reports have been commissioned from engineers and conservation architects.#I don#t want to raise expectation unnecessarily, but the most likely scenario is that we look to re-open the stone pier first of all,# explained Mr Byrne.Repairs would be needed to the stone structure and ironwork. New handrails and safety equipment would be needed along with lighting and basic security measures such as CCTV.Beyond that, the future of the wooden pier looks less certain.refurbishment is not an option, alternatives might include floating pontoons, while the potential for dredging around the pier and harbour might be considered.Through an agent, The Argyll Partnership, the Byrne family has contacted the Clyde Marine Planning Partnership with a view to having Inveraray included in the fledgling Clyde Regional Marine Plan, stressing that the pier #represents a great opportunity to contribute to the economic, social and environmental needs of the Clyde Marine Region#.And the new owners have said that the community council, Inspire Inveraray and others from the area will be fully involved as the redevelopment takes shape. The plans are also said to have the backing of the Duke of Argyll.Mr Byrne concluded: #Hopefully local people will want to help and come forward with ideas.#I don#t want to raise hopes at this early stage, but I hope that buying the pier is a good thing to do.#"},{"url":null,"title":"sports club lotteries 24 5 19","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe numbers drawn for the Kilmory Camanachd Club lottery draw on Monday May  were ,  and .

When she contacted the council to press for vegan meals they claimed it was not possible to provide vegan meals that complied with the nutritional guidelines for school meals.ldquoThat is quite clearly incorrect. The British Dietetic Association has long recognised that we can get all the nutrients we need on a fully plant-based diet, at every stage of le.ldquoIf Glasgow and East Renfrewshire councils can produce vegan menus that comply with guidelines, so too can Scottish Borders Council.ldquoAs a result of the councilrsquos refusal, the eldest child of the vegan parent had already missed out on free school meals in P-.ldquoI wrote to Scottish Borders Council challenging their refusal to provide vegan meals, pointing out their legal obligations under human rights and equality law. That letter was sent by email on May .ldquoOn May  the vegan parent had a call from the council advising that they would be providing vegan meals for her child from the following Monday.ldquoThat just goes to show how quickly these situations can be resolved and vegan meals put in place when the rights of vegans are brought to the attention of government body.The mother of the two children, Laura, who wishes to remain anonymous, believes the intervention of Go Vegan World was vital.She said: ldquoAlthough the response of the Scottish Borders Council was disappointing three years ago, we are extremely pleased with how things are now developing.ldquoThey are trying hard to meet our daughterrsquos needs and are offering to have a meeting with us to discuss things further.ldquoScottish Borders Council have been great and very quickly we have a vegan option for our child at her school.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos schools are now able to offer meals such as vegetable pizza, with no cheese, and vegan sausages with baked beans and potato smiles.However, Ms Bolton continued: ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be having to make these challenges for inidual vegan families across Scotland vegan options should be available on the standard menu every day for any child to choose, in the same way that vegan options are available in most restaurants and cafes.ldquoThe public sector is lagging far behind the private sphere in providing for vegans, and in making good plant-based options available to everyone.ldquoIt is essential that vegan children are able to live according to their conviction that itrsquos wrong to use and kill animals, including when theyrsquore in school.ldquoThat means food suitable for vegans must be provided. It is not acceptable that vegan children are missing out on free school meals, or that they are excluded from eating in the school canteen with their friends.ldquoWe should be supporting children who have made a moral decision to avoid animal use and killing, recognising the impact their behaviour has on others.

revealed that the council paid the sum over the last six weeks, in order to get a former employee to sign a non-disclosure agreement.The request has also revealed that Scottish Borders Council has spent pound, of taxpayersrsquo money on so-called lsquogagging ordersrsquo since April .Non-disclosure agreements are contracts which are signed by both employee and employer, and which typically prevent staff or ex-staff from publicising certain information.That information can range from commercially sensitive details, such as innovations or company finances, to anything likely to damage an organisationrsquos reputation.Non-disclosure agreements have also infamously been used to prevent employees discussing allegations of misbehaviour, with a number of high profile cases in the UK making national headlines.A Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: ldquoNon-disclosure agreementsare included in ious types of agreement entered into by the council to resolve a situation.ldquoNDAs are included for the benefit of both the council and the other party parties.ldquoIt is important to note that an NDA is one part of an overall agreement to settle a dispute, and the majority of any costs will be met from within the relevant servicersquos budget.The contracts are sometimes used when employees and their organisations have reached a settlement to a dispute, such as a claim of wrongful dismissal, without going through a full employment tribunal hearing.Reacting to the payouts, Hawick and Hermitage councillor Davie Paterson said: ldquoI am a bit concerned at the use of no disclosure agreements, surely council tax payers are entitled to a full and comprehensive explanation as to why the council them ldquoThe public, quite rightly, will be asking why do the council have to pay out this money, they may be asking is there something wrong with the management at the top ldquoThe public would love to know why pound, has to be spent to keep a former employee quiet when this admin are making cuts left right and centre, but yet they can find pound, to give to former employees.However, the councilrsquos leader of the opposition, Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell, urged a more even-handed approach to non disclosure agreements.He said: ldquoSecrecy by a public authority is sometimes necessary, but any overuse does not reflect well on a public authority which should be committed to openness and transparency. ldquoI read of growing concern about the use of non disclosure agreements across a range of public bodies with Westminster MPrsquos, for example, calling for these to be made lsquoa thing of the pastrsquo.ldquoThat said I donrsquot currently think that Scottish Borders Councilrsquos use of these agreements is particularly out of line with their use by other Scottish local authorities. ,params: .pushldquoInformation is limited by some, for example Edinburgh and Aberdeen cities, refusing to respond to freedom of information requests for details. ldquoBut Glasgow City, who have responded to an FOI, and are a much larger local authority than the Scottish Borders, have applied non disclosure agreements more than six times as frequently as Scottish Borders Council over the last five years.ldquoI am minded, as chair of the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee, to discuss with colleagues on this committee whether to suggest we should scrutinise the councilrsquos use of non disclosure agreements. ldquoThis would, of course have to be done in strict privacy, but it might allow some reassurance to the public that these

Impressively, the Belarus fighter rose instantly, but was back on the floor by the roundrsquos end, saved from what looked like certain defeat by the bell.There was no escape for Baranchyk in round seven, however, Taylor hunting him down and connecting with shot after shot.To his credit, Baranchyk soaked up the considerable punishment he was receiving to hold his own in rounds eight and nine, before being rocked again in round  but just surviving to the bell.Knowing now he was well behind on points and that only a knockout would save him, Baranchyk emptied the tank in the final two rounds. Rather than trying to evade him, Taylor threw plenty of punches of his own, leaving the crowd gasping with concern on more than one occasion, but the Prestonpans ace stayed on his feet and knew he had done enough to win the world title he so craved.There was no tense wait for the result to be announced ndash there was no doubt at all who the winner was going to be.And as the words ldquoand the

and it looks sure to be a close contest.But after handling an opponent of Baranchykrsquos calibre as capably as he did, Taylor will fear no one and be confident of adding Prograisrsquo WBA world

He goes to bed with his T rex, plays with dinosaurs constantly and knows even the complicated names of lesser-known dinosaurs.However, we have tried very consciously to allow our kids to be who they are and resist the gender stereotyping that defines what a girl should be and what a boy should be.But here was my youngest daughter, at the age of five, clearly articulating the ision between girlsrsquo and boysrsquo toys.Her list was in line with the way toys are still marketed. Often there are two versions of the same thing, one for girls and one for boys.Even some story books are defined in this way, with images and colours which are used to reinforce the gender identity of the object evengender is not specically mentioned.Donrsquot get me wrong, I have no problem that my son loves dinosaurs.But I do have a problem with marketing directed at my children to force them into a narrow definition of what toys they should like based on a patriarchal version of gender.In truth, itrsquos not so much the toys themselves but the emotions and ways of being that are deliberately connected to them.Itrsquos the idea that boysrsquo stuff promotes bravery, toughness, being fierce and adventurous, while girlsrsquo stuff promotes cuteness, romance, beauty and love.It is changing and itrsquos much better than it used to be because there is so much more awareness and debate about this issue. Gender neutral marketing is more common now, mainly as a result of public pressure.But as the conversation with my daughter shows, we still have a way to go.But does it really matter  Is it just a politically correct obsession that is making a mountain from a molehill ldquoBoys will be boys, after all, and ldquogirls are all sugar and spice, and all things nice.It really matters, of course, and I think it matters just as much for my son as my daughters, perhaps even more so.That may be controversial, but I believe that as gender stereotyping is being challenged, it is often more dficult for boys to free themselves from the traditional definition of male identity than it is for a girl.I say this as a father of four girlsand one boy.Perhaps part of the reason for this is the fact that being male is still in many ways the privileged gender, and so there is an understandable focus on removing the restrictive definition of female roles which limit opportunities for women.But the struggle for gender equality has to be a two-way processit is to be ultimately successful.We must also unshackle our boys from the narrow definition of what it is to be male, a definition which still remains powerfully entrenched in our mindsets and the way society works.I personally suffered from this when at school. I was ldquosoft, sensitive, a daydreamer. I was often made to feel I was not a proper boy. There was no space for me to realise that the lsquoladdishrsquo way of being male was not the only way.Irsquom not advocating taking the dinosaurs away from my son and forcing him to play with a unicorn or Barbie doll. Even I loved dinosaurs when I was young. But it does mean allowing him, and yes encouraging him, to explore sides to his nature that society would still label as feminine: nurture, co-operation, make-up, dresses, dancing, looking after dolls and toys, and feeling vulnerable and being allowed to express it.The best way to encourage boys to express this part of who they are is through role modelling by other men, especially in the early years of childhood when a childrsquos brain is forming, and the childrsquos view of how the world works is being created.This includes how to treat others on a personal level.So nurture and care by male family members can be a crucial part of this. But one gender inequality we rarely hear about is the fact that men make up only two per cent of early years childcare workers. And this is an inequality not just for adults, but for our children.It conveys the message to young children that caring and nurture is not a manrsquos job or a male quality. So we grow up believing this is lsquonaturalrsquo.And this idea is so entrenched that there have even been examples of parents complaining that a man is working in a nursery!Looking after children is as much a manrsquos job as it is a womanrsquos. Or it should be, and seen to be. But itrsquos not just about work, or even childcare or parenthood. Itrsquos about ways of being and understanding that there are hundreds of ways to be a man or woman and we all have the right to make our own path.Thatrsquos why itrsquos important from the beginning to show that therersquos no such thing as boysrsquo toys or girlsrsquo toys: there are childrenrsquos toys.Or perhaps more accurately, to show the emotions and qualities traditionally associated with them are not gender specic.As always, children teach us. When we got home, Lewis put his T rex to bed. ldquoHersquos tired, he said, ldquoand hersquos a nice T rex.This was my lesson from my son: a T rex can be nice.He summed up the issue as only a child can."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-25-years-since-east-lothians-independence","story":"Twenty-five years ago this week, the Courier proclaimed the news with the headline: ldquoItrsquos independence for East Lothian.This week, East Lothian Council chief executive Angela Leitch said: ldquoThe Local GovernmentAct of  saw the abolishment of the two-tier Region and District Councils to be replaced with  unitary authorities across Scotland.\"I believe this has greatly benefited East Lothian communities, as responsibility for major services including education and social work were decentralised from Edinburgh and instead became the focus of political decisions at a more localised level.\"Over the years, our politicians have ensured ongoing investment in all of our towns and villages, providing facilities for local people, developing our infrastructure and continually working to improve the services we deliver. This has been recognised in a iety of inspection reports that have confirmed that East Lothian Council is a high performing council and has an ethos which recognises the importance of working closely with its residents and communities.\"Our elected members all live within the county, understand local issues and can ably represent the views of communities.\"Previously, some political decisions about our county were approved by people who had no real knowledge of East Lothian.\"Local government reorganisation has improved both local democracy and the ability of local people to hold the council accountable for the decisions it takes.Here, we take a look back at how we reported the news that the county had secured its place as a stand-alone local authority in the upcoming local government reorganisation:East Lothian has won the battle for independence.In a dramatic about face, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has given in to the majority wishes of the population and decided it can stand on its own two feet.From , the district will once again become master of its own house as an all-purpose local authority.It means East Lothian councillors will be responsible for running a full range of services ndash from education and social work to rubbish collection and recreation.The Local Government Bill which will end the -year lespan of Scotlandrsquos network of region, district and island authorities is currently going through its final stages in Parliament.And earlier this week, Mr Lang ndash supported by local Labour MP John Home Robertson ndash tabled an amendment to give East Lothian the go-it-alone status it wanted.It was the high point in a hard-fought campaign by angry locals which began last year when the Government announced its original intention to lump East Lothian in with Berwickshire.But their success in fighting off that idea was not the end of the battle ndash they still had to persuade Mr Lang and his local government minister Allan Stewart that East Lothian was NOT too small to become an authority in its own right.They had also to force them to give up alternative plans to create an East Lothian-Midlothian-West Lothian authority ndash and more recently a proposal to merge East and Midlothian.As councillors and senior staff celebrated the announcement with champagne, [district] council chairman George Wanless smiled and said: ldquoWe are absolutely delighted with the outcome.He said it was dficult to say what eventually changed the minds of ministers.ldquoBut I have no doubt that the campaign the district council fought had a lot to do with it.He added: ldquoIf I was being charitable, I would say it was a case where the Scottish Office actually listened to the people for a change...It was, however, a ldquogreat decision for the people of East Lothian, who had supported the campaign from the start.ldquoI would like to thank all those who came out on the streets and took part in demonstrations in the early days of the campaign ndash and all those who wrote to Ian Lang in support of the idea that East Lothian should be an all purpose authority.Councillor Wanless totally rejected the previously-held Government view that East Lothian was too small to stand on its own.ldquoWe currently have a population of something like , and growing.ldquoBy the year  we could have at least , and my colleagues and I along with our officials are confident we can handle all the services that the new council will be responsible for.And he insisted: ldquoWe will do so in the same economic and efficient way the electorate have been accustomed to over the years.MP John Home Robertson said the White Paper to reform local government could have been the ldquodeath knell for East Lothian.ldquoBut people all over East Lothian fought back in a massive local campaign and we have won a magnicent victory.He paid tribute to Councillor Wanless and others who took part in the campaign, saying: ldquoWe have shown that public pressure can move even this Government.ldquoHowever, we are not out of the woods yet.ldquoLocal government is all about providing important services to local communities and we must continue to fight to ensure that East Lothian is properly provided with the funds it requires through revenue support grants.The councilrsquos Conservative group leader, the Rev Dr David Whiteford, said: ldquoI am very pleased that the Scottish Office ministers have listened to the electorate.ldquoThe view of the electors all along has been consistent ndash that East Lothian could and should be an all-purpose authority.ldquoI believe East Lothian has the capacity and potential to become an authority on its own and its staff are well capable of serving very well the needs of all the people.He added: ldquoI am very pleased that that message has now been accepted by the Scottish Ministers and that they have departed almost entirely from their original plan.ldquoLarge is not always beautul and I think we can do better on our own.He believed the transition to a stand-alone East Lothian council would be fairly simple.ldquoThe staff structures are already on the ground and all you really need to do is build on that.ldquoI do not anticipate a great deal of dficulty.ldquoIt is a challenge.ldquoIt is something that we should think through.ldquoWe have a new council coming into being and we should try to run it in a new style way.ldquoI hope councillors will concentrate on the needs of East Lothian people and will try and make that their main concern.Said SNP councillor George Thomson: ldquoEast Lothian has a growing population.ldquoWe have a good district council which is well capable of becoming a single tier all-purpose

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation.

Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship. The human race isnrsquot over yet."},{"url":null,"title":"three-months-after-its-launch-how-strong-is-the-pulse-of-the-nations-newest-tv-channel","story":"Itrsquos a period in which the pound million channel dedicated to Scotland and Scottish content has, at times, attracted record digital audiences, won a quarter share of Scottish viewers, been the third most-watched channel in Scotland after BBC One and STV, reached more people between the ages of  and  than any other channel in Scotland, gained serious traction on social media and, in the best of its content, made good on its promise to give Scottish audiences programmes they wonrsquot see anywhere  and which deal with the issues and subjects that affect, concern and interest them .But itrsquos also a period marked by a wild iance in audience ratings , by whispered rumours of discontent and in-fighting, by a perceived lack of brand identity and by a barrage of negative headlines either questioning the need to have the channel in the first place or pouring scorn on specic programmes, such as The Nine or Catriona Shearer-fronted gameshow Wonderball.:  years of rock and roll - and all that jazzLaunching BBC Scotland in Glasgow in February, BBC Director-General Tony Hall outlined the aims of the channel. As he saw it, they were to celebrate Scotlandrsquos strengths in arts, comedy, science and ldquothought. To reflect the countryrsquos ersity. To allow audiences ldquoto interrogate the things that matter to them and, along the way, to ldquoreinvent public service broadcasting. BBC Scotland, he stressed, would offer space for discussion and debate alongside opportunities to ldquokick back and have fun. It would be about the country speaking to itself but also to the world. It would be local, national and global.In other words it would be a lot of things to a lot of people. Or it would try to be. So, three months after its glitzy birth and with the numbers soon to roll over to Day  of its existence, how is BBC Scotland bedding in  What do audiences think of it  And how well is it measuring up to Hallrsquos lofty claims Steve Carson, BBC Scotlandrsquos Head of Multi-Platform Commissioning, is predictably bullish about its prospects and its track record. To his mind the station is about trying to take risks, giving a  to ldquoa strong range of voices and communities and doing ldquonew things and dferent things. So far the strike rate is good, he thinks. Among the successes he points to are Getting Hitched Asian Style, a documentary series following a wedding planning company in Glasgow, the opening night screening of Nae Pasaran , and Last Breath, a drama documentary about a North Sea er stranded on the sea-bed.Identying a stand-out is ldquolike naming your favourite child, he says. ldquoBut I think Asian Weddings is something I was pleased to see hellip It was quite straightforward but it got into communities you donrsquot often see and certainly donrsquot often see in that sort of context.For an example of risk-taking that paid off he points to Sink Or Skim, which took a fond look at the World Stone Skimming Championship held annually on the isle of Easdale in the Firth of Lorn.ldquoThatrsquos not a subject many channels would have commissioned, but it was a beautully made piece and it was funny watching it go out and looking at social media because people were going lsquoI canrsquot believe theyrsquore doing something about stone skimming. Is this part of their sport portfolio rsquo. But by the end of it the same people were going lsquoThat was really goodrsquo.Sink Or Skim was a one-off but The Peoplersquos News is a weekly discussion of topical events in which ordinary Scots go in front of the camera and have their tuppence-worth on topical events. Those featured might not have the political contacts of a Laura Kuenssberg, say, but they have something just as important: context. They represent the social and political views of people in a spread of communities distant from London and far removed from the Central Belt. Itrsquos another example of the channelrsquos guiding principle that BBC Scotland should be a  for discussion and debate and again itrsquos a programme that wouldnrsquot have aired anywhere .ldquoWe could have done a dferent version of this channel which would have been a lot less risky and done a lot more of what other channels do, says Carson. ldquoA Scottish version of BBC Four, for example, would have been a less risky proposition. But we already have that, so we felt it was important to try new things, go for harder to reach audiences and deliberately take risks knowing that not all of them ndash in fact many of them ndash wonrsquot pay off. Thats what wersquore about.So which risks havenrsquot paid off ldquoThatrsquos like naming your least favourite child, he says. ldquoI think the programmes that we have originated between pm and pm have had a tough time, but again our medium term strategy was not to originate as much there. The Nine has had ratings which have gone up and down, but wersquove always said thatrsquos a competitive slot. But on a digital channel ndash and wersquore already the biggest non-terrestrial channel in Scotland with a three per cent share, which is well ahead of projections ndash audiences will go up and down across the night and the week.:  years of rock and roll - and all that jazzIf therersquos a lightning rod for criticism, The Nine is it. An hour in , staffed by a team of presenters and journalists that numbers  ndash at least in the publicity shots ndash and fronted by Rebecca Curran and award-winning former ITN journalist Martin Geissler, itrsquos the stationrsquos flagship news programme.A lot rides on its wellbeing and it seems a little peaky. It was reported that on one day in late April viewing figures dropped to just . They picked up the following day, to , but even on April , the first day of the inquiry into the Clutha disaster, they couldnrsquot quite hit . From a first night high of ,, thatrsquos a signicant drop.ldquoThe Ninersquos average is signicantly higher than that figure and its reach, which is really important in news, is reaching a quarter of a million a week, Carson counters. ldquoItrsquos offering something dferent. If you wanted to point at a show which is something we wouldnrsquot have otherwise done, The Nine is it ndash an hour long news and analysis programme which looks at Scotland, the UK and the world through Scottish eyes.So is it simply the right show but in the wrong time slot ldquoWersquoll see. Nine orsquoclock is a competitive slot but there is a demand there and people are turning to it. The appreciation for The Nine is very strong and wersquore finding that across the board. You might get some programmes that donrsquot have huge average audiences but the appreciation is strong.In a front page story earlier this month, London-based broadsheet the Sunday Times quoted a BBC source who called The Nine ldquoa turkey. The same source added: ldquoYou canrsquot have a channel that nobody watches. Journalists like their output to be watched and it wonrsquot be long until some of the channelrsquos main talent head for the door. Another source spoke of a ldquopoisonous atmosphere in the newsroom causing behind-the-scenes tensions which could cause key staff to walk. True or   ldquoThat is not the case, Carson says bluntly.Among the keenest watchers of how BBC Scotland has fared over these first three months is Dr Lisa Kelly, a lecturer in television at Glasgow University.ldquoIrsquove been pleasantly surprised, she says. ldquoI think I probably wasnrsquot holding out much hope at the beginning, primarily due to the budget ndash pound million for programming isnrsquot much to play with in the television landscape.To put the budget in context, the BBC is spending nearly three times that amount on the new EastEnders set. But funding aside, Kelly is excited by the apparent focus on nurturing and showcasing new talent. Shersquos also impressed by the choice of programmes and pleasantly surprised at the internationalism of its outlook. One innovation she particularly welcomes is the Next Big Thing strand, which screens short films such as as Meet Me By The Water by Scots-Asian writer-director Raisah Ahmed.ldquoI think therersquos been quite a range of programming. It seems like they are trying to be erse in terms of their representation. So obviously you have Getting Hitched Asian Style and The Nine, which is trying to tackle current debates around issues of representation. So I think it has been quite successful so far.And does it matterratings are low for some programmes ldquoI donrsquot know that it does this early on. I think itrsquos important that we have access to original Scottish programming at a local and national level.There are other challenges, she thinks, besides ratings. One is establishing the channelrsquos identity. ldquoIrsquom not quite sure what its brand is yet in terms of how itrsquos selling itself. I noticed that before the launch it was targeting young people with this notion of fresh and original ideas, but I donrsquot know whether theyrsquoll be able to sustain that.Another is proving that the bold talk ndash of nurturing young talent, giving voice to dferent groups and communities, taking risks and tackling ersity ndash will be backed by bold actions.Wherersquos the Scottish Phoebe Waller-Bridge, for example  And how embedded is the commitment to ersity and inclusion, to actually hearing new voices and seeing dferent stories rather than it just being rhetoric with no change Theyrsquore questions for which Steve Carson has a ready answer. Sothe Scottish Phoebe Waller-Bridge was out there with a project she was aching to make, is he convinced he would find her and commission it ldquoI hope so. And I think we are finding quite extraordinary talent at all levels and also stretching people who might already have done one thing but are now doing something . Like State Of It, which is Robert Florence [co-writer of sketch show Burnistoun] doing quite a scabrous satirical show. Itrsquoll be coming out in the autumn.There is data which can help, however. A measuring system known as ldquosocial listening can analyse social media responses to any subject and from that gain an insight into how that subject is viewed, expressed as the over-riding emotion associated with it.:  years of rock and roll - and all that jazzBBC Scotland set the algorithms running at launch and four weeks later the results came back. ldquoThe strongest emotion in social listening was surprise, says Carson. ldquoThat was really encouraging. So modern Scotland, outward looking, surprising and focussed on new talent ndash thatrsquos the core identity of the channel. SoBBC Scotland is a keyboard emoji, itrsquos a colon and a zero.Three months ago, the channel launched with a Miracle. Whether itrsquoll need another one to make it sing in the long term is harder to judge. As they probably donrsquot teach you to say in continuity announcer school, watch this space.BBC Scotland: The Good, The Bad And The NineGetting Hitched Asian StyleA behind-the-scenes documentary following Glasgow wedding planners Saffron Events as they prepare for a succession of glamorous weddings, Getting Hitched Asian Style proved so successful that it received a repeat run on BBC One and has been re-commissioned for a second series on BBC Scotland. Produced by the Scottish ision of London-based Firecracker Films itrsquos a good example of the channelrsquos stated commitment to programmes which reflect Scotlandrsquos ersity. Verdict: funny, interesting, occasionally jaw-dropping but ultimately humane.A View From The TerraceBorn out of The Terrace, a long-running podcast, AVFTT is fronted by four young presenterswho sit on sofas and talk engagingly about Scottish football. Refreshingly free of Old Firm bias itrsquos fast becoming a Friday night staple for those fans of the Beautul Game who think subjects such as the on- and off-field shenanigans of Partick Thistle legend Chic Charnley or how Eriskay has one of the best pitches in the world are as worthy of discussion as whorsquoll be the next manager of Real Madrid. Verdict: a great signing.Sanjeev Kohlirsquos Big TalkA weekly show in which the comedian is joined by a  of guests for a ldquosideways look at the big issues of the week, filmed in what looks like the foyer of the BBCrsquos Pacic Quay HQ in Glasgow in front of what looks like a smattering of audience members. ldquoI never in my le want to endure another excruciatingly mirthless hour of supposedly witty commentary on the weekrsquos news, wrote one Herald critic. ldquoIt was so awful the only way to hang on to consciousness was to watch what was happening outside the glass-fronted studio. Less trenchant criticism has concentrated on the showrsquos stfness and its uneven format. Verdict: could do better.WonderballItrsquos probably destined for cult status among Generation Z-ers as an endless source of memes, but in the here and now BBC Scotlandrsquos flagship gameshow hasnrsquot been exactly showered with love. Letrsquos not take it too far, though: Wonderball is not, as right-leaning tabloid the Daily Mail has suggested, the worst show of its type ever aired, eventhat paper might like it to be. But you canrsquot say that those who have pointed out its flaws ndash the somewhat complicated rules, say, or the unintentional snigger value of two young men being instructed to play with the blue balls ndash donrsquot have a case. It hasnrsquot been a ratings hit either, with viewership dropping as low as  for one episode. Verdict: not utterly pointless, but not likely to become the next Pointless.The NineA team of talented and accomplished presenters, a  minute running time and a news agenda that blends hard-hitting investigations with quirky or thought-provoking items hasnrsquot stopped BBC Scotlandrsquos flagship news programme taking considerable flak from some quarters. Earlier this month one newspaper talked of a ldquotalent exodus from the channel and quoted a BBC insider who called The Nine ldquoa turkey. Damage has undoubtedly been done as a result: negative news stories about behind-the-scenes tensions and potential resignations may not be true, but they contribute to a narrative of failure which becomes hard to shake over time. What is true is that ratings for The Nine have been disappointing on occasions, though in mitigation its time slot doesnrsquot help. Verdict: a rocky start for a potentially stellar offering that may flourish in a dferent time slot."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9892229.jpg?type=article-full","title":"how-to-plan-your-perfect-tailor-made-holiday","story":"Bespoke luxury holidays are a dominant force within the current climate, with more and more travellers setting their sights on worldwide locations and unique pursuits.

Every opposition party at Holyrood backed the call, meaning that it has majority support in the Scottish Parliament.: Parent groups urge action on process meat in schoolsLabour MSP Monica Lennon said: ldquoProfessor Corpet is right to demand that more public information is made available in Scotland about the risks posed by nitro-meats. Scottish Labour fully backs a ban on processed meats containing nitrites in our school and hospitals. The Scottish Government can act now to protect and improve the health of the nation, and they should act swtly.In , the cancer wing of the World Health Organisation published a report which placed processed meat, which includes bacon, ham and deli products, in the same carcinogenic category as tobacco and asbestos.Experts concluded that a daily intake of g of processed meat - the equivalent of two rashers of bacon, or one hot dog - increases the risk of colorectal cancer by %.The health risk occurs when processed meat which includes nitrites - a preservative - is heated, producing carcinogenic nitrosamines in the body.Previous estimates have suggested that % of bowel cancers and % of all cancers in the UK are caused by eating red or processed meats.Bowel cancer is the third most common type of the disease in Scotland. Every year around , people are diagnosed and around , people die.Herald on Sunday campaign: time to dump nitro meat from schools and hospitalsHowever, although the WHO report was published four years ago, scientists and politicians have been frustrated at what they regard as a lack of action from governments across the world.In February, it was revealed that around three quarters of councils in Scotland are offering nitro-ham to pupils, and nearly twenty local authorities confirmed that they provide other nitrite-meat, including bacon, corned beef and chipolata links.Nitro-meat is also served in hospitals and, on this basis, we launched a campaign to stop these products from being given to pupils and patients.Professor Corpet was one of the scientists behind the WHO report and is based at the French National Veterinary School in Toulouse. He said of the research he carried out: ldquoWe were able to demonstrate that the rats that were given sausage, or sausage roll, or bacon, are at higher risk for colorectal cancer, than the rats that were given the same meats without nitrites.ldquoIt can be prevented by removing nitrites.On governmental inaction since the reportrsquos publication, he said: ldquoThe consumption of processed meat is carcinogenic. That was the true statement. It should be enough to act or to change things.ldquoThey [Governments] did nothing. They were just waiting. I donrsquot know why. Four years later, nothing was issued, in France, or Europe or in the UK. This was very strange.Labour council leader: I want our school meals to be nitrite-freeProfessor Corpet said industry mounted a lobbying effort to claim they were not ready to make changes, but he insisted: ldquoThe Government should say lsquotry to make something which is not carcinogenicrsquo. The Government should say we want safe meat. Some [companies] will just remove nitrites, others will add vitamin e.On removing nitrite-meat from Scottish schools, he said it would be hard to implement a ban when parents feed their children ham at home. However, he backed a public health campaign on processed meat and nitrites: ldquoThey should be told that they should not normally eat it. As soon as the consumers are aware, they will choose [something healthier].He said nitrite-meat could either be phased out over a number of years, or reduced to a level such as once a week: \"It is really stupid to have processed meat [presented] as normal meat.Professor Corpet also said there is a poverty aspect to the debate: ldquoIt is worse for poor people who eat a lot of low price hot dogs, which are full of nitrites while rich people are eating salmon, he said. ldquoPoor people will move more slowly than rich people.However, his main target of criticism is the national food quangos whose job it is to protect the public: ldquoI understand why Governments were not worried, as they have other things to do. But it is the agencies - it is their job.The Scottish Government last year launched a consultation on overhauling the food and drink regulations for schools. One of the proposals is for the introduction of a maximum level for red and processed meat.At First Ministerrsquos Questions on Thursday, Labour MSP Monica Lennon asked Nicola Sturgeon whether she agreed that nitro-meats should no longer be served in Scotlandrsquos schools and hospitals.The First Minister replied: ldquoThere are, of course, international standards, with which we will fully comply. We are absolutely committed to supporting the health and wellbeing of children in schools and have a key role to play in the provision of balanced, nutritious food and drink every day, which our regulations help to ensure.Guillaume Coudray: removing nitro-meat from schools and hospitals is \"urgent\"A Scottish Government spokesperson said:ldquoProviding healthy meals for children and patients is vitally important. We regularly consider what public health campaigns are necessary and will study with interest the comments from Professor Corpet.ldquoWe expect schools and hospitals to serve healthy and nutritious food. We are currently considering responses to our recent consultation on nutritional school food standards that proposed introducing a maximum level for red and red processed meat, which will help to inform future changes to legislation."},{"url":null,"title":"65-years-of-rock-and-roll-and-all-that-jazz","story":"TO -year-old Helen Hardie, ldquoit was music to some people, and it was a heck of a noise to others.David Dowie, , remembers: ldquoIt really affected most of the youth, and dance halls were full all the time.

It is tribal. And it is from America. It follows ragtime, blues, jazz, hot cha-cha and the boogie-woogie, which surely originated in the jungle.Melody Maker, the weekly music publication, objected on musical grounds: in May  it said: ldquoViewed as a social phenomenon, the current craze for rock and roll material is one of the most terrying things to have happened to popular music hellip the rock and roll technique, instrumentally and vocally, is the antithesis of all that jazz has been striving for over the years - in other words, good taste and musical integrity.Nevertheless, rock rsquon roll was already an unstoppable force.From the s alone, there are several high-profile trailblazers in the Rock  Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio: Elvis Presley , Little Richardand Chuck Berry .Popular music has evolved at a breathtaking rate ever since.

The house, designed by John and Robert Adam, is full of furniture designed by Thomas Chippendale, but the grounds are just as glorious.There are plenty of places to start your walk but one of the best is the small car park off the Barony Road near the A at Auchinleck. This is the northernmost point of the Duchess of Rothesay Avenue, a long, straight path lined with lime trees and a quarter of a million daffodils. Go mid-morning and,yoursquore lucky, you will walk all the way in the sun. You can also stop half way at the Temple Gate, a -year-old gatehouse restored as part of the ongoing work on the estate.At the bottom of the avenue, wander round the arboretum and check out the Japanese-style bridge over the River Lugar. The bridge is only a few years old but its design was taken from an original drawing submitted by the Scottish architect Robert Weir Schultz in the th century.Next follow the River Lugar through the woods towards Cumnock. The town is the capital of Ayrshires industrial history and youll see plenty of evidence of it on the walk, including the hoist of the former Barony mine on the horizon, like a giant letter A. Wander along the river before turning north and heading back up to the car park.Pit Stop: The Coach House Cafe on the Dumfries House estate is a great place to stop. Itrsquos open seven days a week and serves that most modern of delicacies: the vegan sausage roll.MARK SMITHThe Commando Memorial and High Bridge, Spean Bridge, LochaberTime: Around - minutes, or longer to fully appreciate the scenery.What makes it special: It might be just shy of three miles but this little walk has everything: breathtaking views of Ben Nevis, oodles of history, a good mixture of flat paths and short inclines and accessibilityIt is easily located, by foot a mile from the village of Spean Bridge, or start half-way up the hill, through a gate off the A. Go through a kissing gate at the foot of the Commando Memorial, the A-listed monument built in  to soldiers who trained here during the Second World War.The walk is steeped in childhood memories and family landmarks, weaving through wooded and open paths along the River Spean, close to my old primary school, Kilmonivaig, and the pebbled shore of the River Spean, where my sister and I were taken for picnics with banana sandwiches in the holidays.The old croft house where my mother grew up, Achnahannet, is visible in the distance, at the start of the route. The first half of the walk is almost entirely downhill, through woodland, grass and heath and a joy to run.The path eventually joins the old railway line, and arrives at the ruins of High Bridge, crossing the steep gorge of Glen Spean.There is an information board about the bridge and its role in the  Jacobite rising. It was the site where the first shots were fired against British troops by Jacobites loyal to Prince Charles Edward Stuart. Three days after the clansmens victory, the Prince raised the standard at Glenfinnan, marking the start of the doomed campaign.Scotlands favourite gentle strolls: Part oneThe path eventually veers away from the river and crosses heathland, ascending gradually and then sharply. There is a welcome seat, ahead of the steepest incline to take in lovely views of Aonach Mor and Ben Nevis.The path is well made and suitable for some all-terrain baby buggies. However, the wooden bridges can be slippery and dogs must be kept on leads.Pit stop: The route ends by the side of the A, around half a mile from the village, where walkers can enjoy a restorative cup of tea and decent scones at Spean Bridge Woollen Mill.CAROLINE WILSONStrathclyde Park, MotherwellTime: Its up to you really. There are so many options. A full circuit on the path alongside the loch is just over three milesWhat makes it special: The park has , acres of mature woodland, rough wetland and open water, providing a home for more than  dferent species of animals and birdsA level tarmac path runs round the loch. This is the one I tend to do, andI am feeling energetic I walk around twice. You will, however, spend your time avoiding the cyclists and dog walkers. I do this walk with my friend who is afraid of dogs, which is entertaining to say the least! From Strathclyde Park to Barons Haugh RSPB nature reserve short sections of the walkway have relatively steep gradients. A detour around the nature reserve will reveal meadow, marshland, scrub and woodland habitats. After leaving the reserve the walkway passes Dalzell Estate, originally a royal hunting forest. In the th century the estate lands were transformed into an orderly and landscaped park. From Dalzell Estate and beyond Adders Gill the path is prone to flooding, especially in winter, so an alternative route is signposted.Pit stop: The waterfront cafe is good for coffee and cake, or a soup and sandwich.JACKIE BROGANUrgha to Rhenigidale ndash The Postmanrsquos Path ndash HarrisTime: - hours.What makes it special: An ancient island route that features stunning coastal views, sheltered coves and abandoned villagesUntil its road was opened in , the tiny settlement of Rhenigidale could only be reached by boat, or via the Postmanrsquos Path, a spectacular and in places challenging, .-mile route across hill, bog and rock. It wasnrsquot only the postie that used the path, of course children walked the route once a week, in all weathers, to and from secondary school in Tarbert.Starting out in Urgha, two miles from Tarbert, the gentle start offers great views of Clisham, the highest peak on the Western Isles, giving way to a steeper descent. The detour to the deserted settlement of Molinginis ndash which once had  residents and its own school ndash is well worth the ersion.Further along the route, the zig-zag descent to the shore at Loch Trolamaraig can be tricky, but itrsquos the perfect place to enjoy a picnicthe weather allows. If yoursquore lucky, you might see seals or even an otter near the shoreline.Heading back upwards, past more abandoned cottages and round steep clfs, Todun, the m hill above Loch Seaforth, dominates the latter stages of the walk. Through a gate, you eventually reach the now famous road, built after a David and Goliath fight by local man Kenny Mackay, the former postman who walked the path three times a week and still lives in the village.Scotlands favourite gentle strolls: Part oneStanding above Rhenigidale, on a clear day you can see to the Shiant islands and beyond. You can see why Mr Mackay and the other residents love the place so much.Pit stop: Facilities are limited ndash there is no hotel, shop or cafe ndash butyou need to rest your head, therersquos a cosy hostel run by the Gatlf Trust and a holiday hometo let.MARIANNE TAYLORNewport-on-Tay and Berryrsquos Den, FeTime: Half an hour to a whole day ... itrsquos up to youWhat makes it special: This lovely community, straight across the Tay from Dundee, is just ripe for a wander around ... and Berrys Den is an unexpected treatDundeersquos all the rage just now hellip and itrsquos all thanks to the VA. But what to do once yoursquove visited this amazing attraction  Whatyou want to get out of the city  Well, herersquos an idea hellipIf you look across the river from the museum, thatrsquos Newport, and yoursquoll notice a huge patch of woodland that seems to cut the village in half ndash thatrsquos Berryrsquos Den.I grew up just along the road from here, and this wonderful labyrinth of tracks, ornamental ponds, giant trees, hidden woodland paths and historic buildings was the ultimate urchinrsquos playground.Nowadays, it still holds the same charm, and you can get to it with a five-minute drive across the Tay Bridge. You can even walk there on a nice day ndash it takes less than an hour. There are a number of ways in: just out of the wee town centre on High Street, halfway up the hill on Cupar Road ... or my recommendation would be to keep walking up Cupar Road until youre almost at Newport Primary School. The entrance is then on your right through the grand gate, and from here you can wander through the whole estate to the bottom gate on High Street .And while yoursquore there, why not stroll around Newport itself .Pitstop: Newport has plenty of shops and places to eat, so you wonrsquot be stuck for sustenance.ANDY CLARKKirkintilloch to Torrance loopTime: Around  hoursWhat makes it special: The glorious backdrop of the CampsiesOK, so its not the most picturesque of starts, in Barleybank car park in Kirkintilloch ndash but it does get better, I promise.Cross Cowgate and head down the slope on to the Forth  Clyde Canal towpath heading towards Bishopbriggs.Meander along the canal ndash its all fairly flat so not too strenuous ndash and after about one mile you come to the Stables. Passing the restaurant ndash or indeed stopping, like me, for refreshment ndash continue along the towpath to Cadder church.From here, its a leisurely stroll to Cawder Golf Course and along the riverbank path towards Torrance .In Torrance, heading up the main streetbeyond The Rambler pub, turn right into a small play park. This park was the former site of Torrance railway station which used to welcome children from inner city Glasgow in the s and s to their first taste of the countryside.Scotlands favourite gentle strolls: Part oneTake the path down to the left and come on to the route of the old Kelvin Valley Railway line.Follow the old railway line through open farmland, with further views of the Campsie fells. When you can follow the old line no further, head down the wide path to the right and go along the edge of Hayston Golf Course to reach a wooden gate and sign for Kirkintilloch. Continue along the path to reach the River Kelvin, head up the path between fields to reach Hayston Road. At the top of Hayston Road, cross the A Glasgow Road and turn right.Take the small path crossing the bridge and leading you up a short steep hill back onto the Forth  Clyde Canal and back into Kirkintilloch.Pitstop: Take your pick of the Stables, The Torrance Inn, The Wheatsheaf and The RamblerVICTORIA BRENANCorstorphine Hill to Inverleith in the footsteps of Robert Louis StevensonTime: frac hours What makes it special: The views, the iety of terrain and the fact that for large parts of it yoursquod never know you were in the cityEven without the RLS connection itrsquos a beautul walk, starting high with a glorious view over the capital from Corstorphine Hillthen dropping down into the lush riparian walkway that accompanies the Water of Leith as it runs from Roseburn to Stockbridge past the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art and St Bernardrsquos Well. But for fans of RLS itrsquos a particular treat.At Rest and Be Thankful on Corstorphine Hill you can stand in the spot where Alan Breck Stewart and David Balfour say their farewells at the end of Kidnapped. From there you can either head east along Ravelston Lane or descend the hillrsquos southern slope to the main road where at Western Corner you find Sandy Stoddartrsquos towering  sculpture of the pair. Then itrsquos on to picturesque Dean Village, fictional home of Catriona MacGregor Drummond, the titular heroine of Stevensonrsquos  sequel to Kidnapped. Finally you end up at super-posh Howard Place in Inverleith, where the author was born in .Pit stop: Do it on a Sunday and Stockbridge Farmersrsquo Market will be in full swing. The paella is excellent. Monday to Saturday, Edinburghrsquos answer to Notting Hill is packed with chi-chi cafes, pubs and eateries. There are also great cafes at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Artrsquos Modern One and Modern Two, and at the Royal Botanic Gardens, which are opposite Howard Place.BARRY DIDCOCKKelvin Walkway ndash Kelvin Aqueduct to Botanic GardensTime: Around  minutesWhat makes it special: In the heart of Glasgow, this walk transports you out of the hustle and bustle instantly ndash a breath of fresh airStarting at the Kelvin Aqueduct, follow the path down through the trees and emerge beside the River Kelvin. The roaring rapids quickly dissipate into calm ndash a haven for birds and other wildle. Itrsquos a matter of following the river, meandering past the remains of the North Woodside Flint Mill and under the huge archways of the Kirklee footbridge. The HaPenny Bridge, rebuilt in , is good for a game of Poohsticks or a nice place to stop and watch the river below. Even on a rainy day, the ancient trees and foliage are a good canopy to shelter under while you watch the dozens of dogs scampering by, swtly followed by their owners.If yoursquore feeling energetic, take a shot on the Scandinavian-style outdoor gym equipment close to the flint mill remains, or give it a miss and continue on until you reach a set of huge iron gates and a bridge crossing the river. At the other side, atop a set of steep, winding steps is the Botanic Gardens and civilisation once again.Pit stop: As itrsquos such a short walk, best focus on the end and make a beeline of the Botanic Gardens cafe once yoursquore done.HANNAH RODGERLanglands Moss, Langlands Road, East KilbrideTime: A leisurely woodland walk through the network of new paths and the forest takes about an hour to  minutes.What makes it special: Sweet-scented trees, an abundance of butterflies, birds and bees, and the knowledge that the peat bog is saving the planet by acting as a huge carbon sinkLanglands Moss is a little gem of a place, on the outskirts of the industrial estates at the southern edge of East Kilbride. The local nature reserve is managed by the mighty Friends of Langlands Moss volunteer conservation group and is a place of great beauty and importance, and a very pleasant spot to escape from the everyday. Schoolchildren and environmental groups have worked hard to preserve the peat bog and surrounding woodland, and there are now frog ponds and a wildflower meadow to admire, plus a network of forest paths. They can get muddy at times so sturdy footwear is essential, but all are accessible.Pit stop: There is no visitor centre, yet, at Langlands Moss, but just along the road in Auldhouse village sits The Lost Lamb, a fantastic restaurant adjacent to the long-standing pub the Auldhouse Arms. Perfect for a hearty lunch, or for relaxing in the outdoor seating area with a cold drink, admiring the countryside views.ANN FOTHERINGHAMAndyoure after something a bit more energetic ...Meikle Bin, Campsie FellsTime: - hoursWhat makes it special: Its a walk into the wilds for the reasonably fit through beautul countryside and rewarded by fantastic views, all within easy reach of the central beltI can see this hill from my bedroom window, and getting there is as much an adventure as climbing it. From Kilsyth, take the brilliantly named Tak-Ma-Doon Road across the Campsies and down to Carron Bridge. As you climb this ridiculously steep and windy road, you really feel yoursquore leaving any last hint of urban le behind.Scotlands favourite gentle strolls: Part oneAs you drive along theof Carron Valley reservoir, Meikle Bin looms large on the skyline on your left. Stop at the car park at the western end and then just follow the path. Itrsquos simple, and beautul, and a great place to take the dog. Cross the bridge over the River Carron, and then its basically a steady but not-too-strenuous climb up through the woods. There are a number of turn-offs along the way, butyou stick to the main path its not too dficult to find your way. Keep going until you get to the path to the summit on the left.Now it gets serious, and steep, but there is the wreckage of a downed plane and a Christmas tree complete with decorationsto find. Besides, the view at the top makes it all worthwhile. Retrace your steps to get back down.Pitstop: On a hot day, take a picnic and stop at the bridge over the River Carron. Let the dog have a swim hellip in fact, why not go for a paddle yourself  Itrsquos a lovely spot.ANDY CLARK"},{"url":null,"title":"snp-msp-apologises-for-fag-comment-about-gay-tory-mp","story":"James Dornan, the MSP for Glasgow Cathcart, said he was ldquohorried at his \"booboo\" after applying the term to Ross Thomson, the Brexiter MP for Aberdeen South.The word means a younger pupil who carries out chores for an older one at a private boarding school, but is also a homophobic term of abuse.Mr Dornan was criticised after using the word on Twitter on Saturday while discussing Old Etonian Boris Johnson becoming the next Tory leader and PM.Mr Thomson is a public supporter of Mr Johnson.Hersquoll be too busy quaffing champagne and telling his new fag, my money is on Ross Thomson for that position, to keep still whilst he uses his back as a table.

And the ldquoalt-right, an umbrella term used to describe the majority of the far-right at the time, were angry.The definition of alt-right, short for alternative right, has been contested by academics and the movementrsquos erse nature makes it almost impossible to summarise.But it can broadly be classed as a set of far-right ideologies, such as white nationalism, anti-Semitism, anti-feminism and centrally, the right to free speech.Like any ideology, the movement has ious levels of intensity from extreme far-right neo-nazis, to those who pick and choose which aspects of the movement to uptake in order to remain socially acceptable.The alt-light is a term often used to describe the movements YouTube personalities, who tend to avoid voicing extreme views, but have been known to espouse many of the movementrsquos beliefs to their hundreds of thousands of followers.Mr Benjamin has previously been grouped in this category, but Mike Wendling, BBC journalist and author of Alt-Right: From chan to the White House, explained the term ldquointellectual dark web may more accurately describe him and the other YouTubers who descended on Berkeley that year.ldquoHersquos cultivated a fan base, hersquos cultivated quite a passionate fan base, but hersquos not alt-right, Mr Wendling said.ldquoHersquos explicitly said that he doesnrsquot believe in the alt-right.ldquoOn the other hand hersquos obviously very offensive. He claims to be for free speech but itrsquos more specic than that, itrsquos not really about free speech itrsquos about the freedom to offend people.Benjamin on the campaign trail in South West EnglandMr Benjamin and many other YouTubers from this so-called ldquointellectual dark web rallied on Berkeley in the name of ldquofree speech, when a number of other far-right speakers were banned from campus following the Milo shutdown.They documented the unfolding ideological clashes between controversial far-right figures and anti-fascistcounter protesters, but events quickly escalated to violence.During one protest, I witnessed a car drive through a crossroads full of people and carry on, full speed, out of the other side with a man clinging onto the bonnet.The incident happened just months before -year-old Heather Heyer was killed at another far-right protest in Charlottesville, Virginia, by James Alex Fields Jr., who also drove his car intentionally into a crowd.These YouTubers depicted the Berkeley protests like war zone.For example, well-known alt-light YouTuber, Canadian-born Lauren Southern, frequently used militaristic language in her content.She titled one video ldquoThe Battle for Berkeley and declared in another, ldquoWe took back lsquocommorniarsquo because of one terrible battle decision by the communists!When Mr Yiannapolous planned a ldquofree speech week on the campus in September that year, Mr Benjamin flew over to join his fellow \"dark web intellectuals\"., who recently came under fire posted a satiric video of a dog hed taught to raise its paw in the manner of a Nazi salute. \" alt\"HeraldScotland: Mr Benjamin on stage with another YouTuber, Count Dankula , who recently came under fire posted a satiric video of a dog hed taught to raise its paw in the manner of a Nazi salute. \" class\"editor-image\"Mr Benjamin on stage with another YouTuber, Count Dankula , who recently came under fire posted a satiric video of a dog hed taught to raise its paw in the manner of a Nazi salute. The violence of the Spring protests had mostly subsided by September, but, like the other YouTubers before him, Mr Benjamin filmed his curbside political arguments with the counter-protesters.In a one-and-a-half hour ldquoFree Speech Documentary on his channel, you can see these arguments in full, as well as the  he gives to the notoriously violent Proudboys, an organisation which claims to be just a ldquopro-Trump drinking club.Speaking to one of their members Mr Benjamin said: ldquoDo you want to tell me about the Proudboys, because I have a funny feeling you guys get a lot of bad press and you donrsquot get to tell your story.This week, leaked chats from the group obtained by The Huffington Post, revealed they were discussing injuring and even killing their ldquoenemies.One message read: ldquoAll I want to do is smash commies too. Actually Irsquom lying, Irsquom way past just hitting them. When the time comes I will stop at nothing to fully eradicate them all!Read more:Boris Johnson under pressure over attacks on Scotlands public spendingIn  many U.S. commentators labelled the Berkeley protests as simply alt-right vs Anta, but ious ideologies existed on both sides and to call either a homogenous group would be a mistake.Nevertheless, through extensive analysis of the videos posted by Mr Benjamin and other ldquointellectual dark web YouTubers who attended the protests, it appeared they operated within an unofficial, online network.By interviewing one another, sharing each otherrsquos content and allowing the far-right voices to dominate over any other, YouTubers such as Mr Benjamin, Ms Southern, and even ex-VICE journalist Tim Pool, established what could be described as a pack mentality during the Berkeley protests.Mr Benjamin did not interview Anta protesters with any veil of journalistic professionalism, choosing instead to mock them in his videos. While when he interviewed far-right figures he gave them uninterrupted airtime to deliver their message.He also frequently used the content of the other far-right YouTubers who were attending the protests, which helped to push a joint narrative that the Anta were the violent ldquocommunist aggressors, while the ldquopro-free speech protestors were justied in their retaliation.Despite their assertions they were not part of any group, the YouTubersrsquo coverage clearly favoured the far-right protesters, in a classic display ofldquoin-group, out-group mentality.They labelled the Anta protesters as one indistinguishable violent faction, while the opposing side were seen as erse and acting in self-defence.Although Mr Benjamin and the other YouTubers videos garnered hundreds of thousands of views, did they actually have any offline effect \" alt\"HeraldScotland: Mr Benjamin was milkshaked while on the campaign trail this month \" class\"editor-image\"Mr Benjamin was milkshaked while on the campaign trail this month That September, Mr Yiannopoulos delivered a speech to a small crowd from the Sproul Steps on the UC Berkeleys campus.Dressed in a stars and stripes hoodie Mr Yiannopoulos shook hands with supporters and made a few dashed words before he was whisked away by bodyguards.The ldquointellectual dark web hailed it as a ldquovictory for free speech, and yet the furore and mass crowds that swelled during that year seemed to ebb away as quickly as they rose.Now Mr Benjamin has stepped out from behind his computer yet again, this time onto the political stage in Britain. But will his huge online fanbase, which donates thousands to him monthly via crowdfunding s, manest into support at the polls Mr Wendling doesnrsquot think so.ldquoIf you have a message that gets so many people riled up then surely you can convert that into a political messageyou do it the right way, he said.ldquoBut maybe that is the problem, maybe itrsquos simply a fact that the actual campaign is not as compelling as your YouTube videos.ldquoThe signicance is that they are people with large YouTube followings, who come from fairly provocative, offensive, or extreme right positions and they have not been able to translate that into a political movement.The majority of the media attention that has surrounded Mr Benjamin during his election bid has centred on the tweet he sent in , in which he said he ldquowouldnrsquot even rape Labour MP Jess Phillips.The tweet Mr Benjamin sent in . Mr Wendling added he has not conveyed ldquoany sort of philosophy during his campaign, ldquoall hersquos known for is a rape joke, he said.But the ability of online power to translate into electoral success is still yet to be proven on both sides of the political spectrum.Following the success of the Black Lives Matter protests in the U.S. one of the movementrsquos leaders, DeRay Mckesson, ran for mayor of Baltimore in .Despite rallying thousands of protestors for racial equality and having a strong online base with over , followers on Twitter, Mr Mckesson received just over , votes finishing in sixth place.ldquoTherersquos always been a disconnect between developing a large social media presence and turning that into a mainstream electoral success, Mr Wendling said.ldquoThe jury is definitely still out on the actual influence of social media.While out on the campaign trail Mr Benjamin has been doused in milkshakes, banned from election hustings and a police investigation has been launched following that  tweet.Despite naming his channel after a conqueror who is remembered as the first ruler of an ancient empire, it appears his political history may be recalled as one which was swtly extinguished by pound. milkshakes."},{"url":null,"title":"most-scots-blame-poor-wages-for-workers-claiming-benefit-says-survey","story":"A total of % of respondents to a YouGov poll for Citizens Advice Scotland gave this response when questioned on the reasons for claiming benefits.One in sixsaid they need extra to look after themselves or family members due to expenses such as illness or childcare.Just over a thirdbelieve claimants have been unlucky with their circumstances, such as accruing unexpected debts.Almost a fthbelieve benefits claimants \"are lazy and dont want to work more than they currently do\".The online survey of , adults also found that three quarters of peopleagreed workers on benefits work just as hard as anyone  and % agreed there should be more help for people to claim what they are entitled to.Around a thirdagreed thatbenefits were not so generous people would learn to stand on their own two feet, but % said cutting welfare payments would have a negative effect on the lives of many.More than halfbelieve people who rely on social security are in that situation through no fault of their own.However, more than a thirdsaid most people could managethey just budgeted sensibly, and % agreed the majority of benefits claimants have it easy because they get everything paid by the Government.The survey results have been released ahead of Citizens Advice Scotland launching a new campaign on Tuesday, aimed at encouraging people to get a financial health check through the organisation to ensure they are receiving payments for which they qualy.Citizens Advice Scotland chief executive Derek Mitchell said: \"This polling busts a series of myths around social security, and shows that the vast majority of people believe that our welfare state is there to help workers who need a hand, especially as the cost of living is soaring while wages have remained broadly the same.\"People should be claiming what they are due.

Theresa May has, so far, announced only that she plans to quit as Tory leader on June , but will remain Prime Minister until her successor is elected , secures the confidence of the Commons and gets rubber-stamped by HM The Queen.On Mrs Mayrsquos track record of promising to leave something, but not managing it, shersquoll still be Tory leader in  and, having fiddled all the rules to get some sort of extension, PM long after the next scheduled General Election. If that appalling state of affairs were to come about, though, she would no doubt insist that it was someone rsquos fault. The EUrsquos fault. The ERGrsquos fault. The Remainersrsquo fault. The votersrsquo fault.:Andrew McKie: Solution to political chaos is as necessary as it is unlikelyNone of that will wash. Itrsquos all her fault. Mrs May is the most catastrophic prime minister since Lord North probably worse. She had lots of room for manoeuvre, as he did not. Thatrsquos a harsh judgment, but itrsquos based on the terms she set, and whichshe was not pushed into, but herself chose. Her dreadfulness is not just a consequence of her own abject failures, but because shersquos made things much more dficult for her successor than they would have been three years ago.Some people think that this judgment is premature, because the next Prime Minister may be even worse. This accords with the narrative ndash popular with Remainers who think the public canrsquot be trusted with a say in their own governance, unless it conforms with the views ofthe political classes ndash that Brexit was an impossible aspiration and any attempt to implement it was bound to be damaging.On this analysis, the worse Mrs Mayrsquos successor fares, the more kindly history will judge her. When whichever of the  Tory MPs standing gets the job, and makes just as big a mess of it, we will see that she was dealt an impossible hand, and played it as well as she could.Irsquom afraid thatrsquos nonsense, too. In poker terms, she was dealt at worst a pair of sixes, and promptly swapped them for seven two offsuit. Those who complain about the lack of specics in the Leave campaign, and a failure to spell out exactly how Brexit would be implemented, canrsquot also maintain that Mrs May had limited options when she emergedas Tory leader in .That would have been that moment at which any halfway capable person would have said: ldquoI promise we will respect the result, but before we go any further, we should establish the terms on which we go, and each of the possibilities involves some trade-offs.Faced with the range of options with which we are now drearily familiar, from Canada +++ to WTO terms, she could have spelt out which might createborder problems in Northern Ireland, restrictions on taking greater control of our agricultural or fisheries, oblige us to continue to abide by EU regulations or ECJ oversight, prevent us from ending unrestricted freedom of movement, and so on.We could even have had, for example, a series of indicative votes in Parliament to see which aspects of Brexit enjoyed enough support to make them worth negotiating for, which were regarded as essential, and which could be conceded in order to protect trade, industry or the financial sector. Did Mrs May even think about any of that  Apparently not.:Andrew McKie: Pointless European elections will just prolong our tormentFor the first nine months or so of her premiership, the only statement we got was ldquoBrexit means Brexit. Unless yoursquore a primary school teacher attempting to explain the reflexive property of the equals sign, this is of limited value in conveying information, evenwe now know that the translation is: ldquoIrsquom not telling you, because I have no idea what Irsquom doing.Worse, the fact that Mrs May didnrsquot know what she was doing didnrsquot stop her from preventing everyone  from pursuing the options. Her succession of Brexit secretaries, who all resigned because she wouldnrsquot let them do their jobs, may have been ndash as the Remain camp naturally claims ndash rubbish, or faced with the impossible. But wersquoll never know, because they never got to negotiate.Instead, at some point, the Prime Minister came up with new definition of Brexit. It was, apparently, a set of red lines. These, as it transpired, were akin to those the teacher puts through the wrong answer, or those used in alarming graphs showing that your approval rating is falling through the floor. And she was dishonest about the limits they created, and theconcessions that she immediately surrendered to Brussels.In part, thatrsquos because of the monomania about immigration she carried over from her time in the Home Office, which immediately ruled out most of the attractive methods of delivering Brexit. But the lessons of Mrs Mayrsquos previous job were not just that she was callous, authoritarian, stubborn, unreasonable and technocratic, though she was all of those. Itrsquos that she didnrsquot even deliverimmigration was her big thing, she failed for  years to do anything about it.A better politician might even have sold her terrible Withdrawal Agreement , but shersquod already proved, in the worst election campaign ever conducted, that she was a terrible politician. Failing to gain a majority against Jeremy Corbyn, Labourrsquos worst and least popular leader ever, was seen, even as her campaign was collapsing almost comically, as an impossibility. Yet she managed it.Itrsquos perfectly possible, perhaps even likely, that the next Prime Minister will prove terrible at delivering a good Brexit, but that shouldnrsquot improve historyrsquos view of Mrs Mayrsquos time in office. Itrsquos her decisions, and hers alone, that have led us to this sorry pass.

The council’s Infrastructure Services Committeedecided on Thursday, May  to introduce alternative arrangements to push up recycling rates and reduce materials sent to landfill. They approved an option to use households’ existing bins in a three-weekly collection cycle while officers continue to work to explore funding opportunities for further changes. One bin and a food waste caddy will continue to be collected every week meaning week one will start with general waste binsand food waste collected, week two will see Recycling binand food waste collected, and week three will also be a recycling bin and food waste collection.The materials that can be recycled on the kerbside remain the same - the only dference is that the blue-lidded recycling bin is emptied more often.The new service will be piloted in some areas in  and rolled out to the rest of Aberdeenshire in .Households will be contacted in advance by post.As over % of the waste produced in Aberdeenshire is recyclable using the existing recycling services, this change should allow an increased recycling rate, while work continues to seek other ways to push that up even further using kerbside services. ISC chair Peter Argyle said: “Clearly the decision by Zero Waste Scotland not to consider our funding bid has had a negative effect on our well-developed plans to push up Aberdeenshire’s recycling rate and send less recyclable materials to landfill.“This was not our first choice as a solution, but this is the position we find ourselves in and we feel that this option makes the most of a dficult situation and will help push up recycling rates. “At present, we see this as an interim measure, while we work to deliver a permanent scheme which provides a service for our residents which enables them to recycle as many materials as possible.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Meldrum Library is located at the Academy campus\"  Help Doctor Who by visiting library viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"“One of the key things we continue to try to impress is that we want residents to simply think for a second about how they dispose of the waste they generate, then use the services we provide as best they can.” Vice chair John Cox said: “It can come as no surprise to anyone that councils are trying their hardest to offer services which push up recycling rates and make the most of recyclable materials. “I’m pleased officers have been able to come up with an interim alternative which keeps us moving in the right direction. “Although landfill capacity is essentially reduced,recycling services are used to their full capacity most households should be able to cope and the use of the food waste bin means there should be no additional hygiene issues either.”Other changes to be introduced under the new Waste Strategy are still going ahead – including improvements to Household Waste Recycling Centres from this month and an increased number of garden waste collection points across the area this summer.Over half the materials in local non-recyclable waste bins are recyclable through existing services – equating to around , tonnes of recyclable materials being landfilled at a cost of £.million a year.Not only does maximising the value of a material benefit the environment, it also frees up money for other essential council services."},{"url":null,"title":"changes to come at aberdeenshire hwrcs","story":"As part of Aberdeenshire#s sht towards greater recycling rates and sending less materials to landfill, tyres and asbestos will no longer be accepted at any of the area#s Household Waste Recycling Centresfrom Monday, June .The change, which also applies to four of the council’s waste transfer stations, is expected to save around £, a year and have minimal impact on householders. The money saved will be used to employ extra staff at recycling centres, who will advise customers how best to dispose of materials, helping to increase recycling rates and reduce disposal costs. Tyres are not classed as household waste and the council has no legal responsibility to deal with them – anyone buying new tyres can pay for disposal of the old ones at the same time. Although one of the lowest tonnages of any materials handled at HWRCs, tyres are one of the most expensive to dispose of. With very limited options to recycle or reuse them, they are currently sent to a cement kiln for use as fuel, at a cost to the council. Asbestos, only currently accepted by the council at four sites under limited circumstances, is currently sent to a specialist landfill site for disposal at signicant cost. Although tyres and asbestos together only account for less than .% of the waste handled by the council each year, neither method of dealing with these materials is classed as recycling. Waste Manager, Ros Baxter, said: “We know a very small number of Aberdeenshire residents bring tyres or asbestos to the council for disposal. This service is an expensive one to provide and only benefits a few residents. “Neither of these materials contribute to the council’s recycling rate, but they do cost signicant amounts of money to deal with and take up space at the facilities where they are collected. “Requiring the person or company which generates this type of waste to ensure it is disposed of correctly at their expense not only saves the council money which is being reinvested in better services, it also frees up space for the recycling of other materials in future.“Many tyre retailers offer a disposal service for old tyres for a small fee and vehicle users should make use of this service where possible, as most people do.“There are commercial companies who will accept asbestos waste for disposal at two licensed landfill sites for a fee and anyone disposing of this material is advised to contact them.” Signs will be in place at facilities which have accepted the materials in the past advising of the change. Information on alternative disposal will also be available at HWRCs, service points and libraries. data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Some participants of this years Twilight Walk make use of a photo prop at the event\"  Twilight Walk marks th anniversary viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"While the facility to recycle these materials is being removed, the council continues to offer recycling for more than  dferent materials at HWRCs and is constantly seeking to expand this number, providing better services to Aberdeenshire residents, recycling more, protecting the environment and saving the council money on waste disposal.Clearly some people may consider disposing of their tyre or asbestos waste by illegally fly-tipping it, butyou see someone dumping waste illegally, or you come across fly-tipped materials, please contact Wasteline with as much detail as possible on  ."},{"url":null,"title":"fundraising to change lives in india","story":"Sarah Franklin, owner of The Hair Shop, Kemnay, has been fundraising for her trip to India to teach the disadvantaged children of the SOS Village in Kolkata a skill for le in hairdressing.Sarah called for the help of members of the local community to dig deep as she set up a Table Sale outside her shop all week, in an effort to raise money.

To enter the competition, members of the public should post a portrait photo celebrating walking in some way, on Twitter or Instagram, using the hashtag #HumansOfTheWalk. Multiple entries are allowed with the competition running until Friday, May , next week. Those who take part are in with the chance of winning a Nikon B Coolpix camera.Ian Findlay, chief officer at Paths for All, said: “Orkney has a number of great walking routes — whether it’s residential streets or local paths and green spaces — and we’re keen for the community to celebrate how they make these part of their daily routines.“We want the photos to be a true reflection of everyday walking — walking that builds friendships, gives you headspace and gets you feeling fitter and out enjoying nature.“Walking can help prevent ill health, build communities and create a happier, healthier, greener Scotland and we know that people can demonstrate just that with their Humans of the Walk photos. “We want to revolutionise the way people use their cities, and stop our spaces from being dominated by cars. Scotland’s towns and cities should be a backdrop for people walking, scooting, cycling or simply spending time enjoying cleaner, quieter, calmer streets.“Paths for All is looking forward to seeing them all and wish everyone who enters the competition the best of luck.”Paths For All#s aim is to signicantly increase the number of people who choose to walk in Scotland, whether it’s walking for leisure, to work, to school or to the shops. The charity works to create more opportunities and better environments for walking, as well as cycling and other activities to help make Scotland a more active and greener place.For more information on Humans of the Walk and the competition, visit: https:www.pathsforall.org.uk humanscopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This is both the highest volume of advance sales ever achieved in the voluntary-run festival’s -year tenure, as well as the greatest number of pre-festival sellouts. Stromness, the festival’s hometown in Orkney’s West Mainland, has already begun welcoming early arrivals, including some of this year’s furthest travelled visitors # Cape Breton’s globetrotting powerhouse quartet, Còig # as well as famed Irish singer Cara Dillon and Irish firebrands Four Men and a Dog, who are currently celebrating their th year on the road.Whilst early arrivals are no rarity for the festival, a far greater number than usual are already in Orkney, owing to a one-day Air Traffic Controllers’ strike across Scotland’s Highlands and Islands taking place today. As well as the closure of Kirkwall Airport, Inverness — a hub for flights from Ireland and England, before the final hop up to the islands — is also shut. With just a fortnight’s notice,  inbound arrivals originally scheduled for today, Thursday, have been rerouted, leading to early arrivals for most.Those already enjoying Orkney’s famed hospitality will soon be joined by fellow headliners including the groundbreaking Scottish three-piece, Lau a newly formed trio of celebrated Irish musicians John Doyle, Dermot Byrne and Éamonn Coyne and internationally renowned Hebridean vocalists, Julie Fowlis and Kathleen MacInnes, who visit Orkney as part ‘Between Islands’ # a collaborative project led by Stornoway’s An Lanntair, uniting musicians from Orkney, Shetland and the Outer Hebrides. Emerging artists are also prominent in this year’s festival programme, with appearances from BBC Radio Scotland’s Young Musician of the Year , Benedict Morris new Scottish six-piece Heisk and Helensburgh fiddler Ryan Young, whose accompanist, Jenn Butterworth, will work a double-sht across the next four nights, also playing with the high-spirited Glasgow group Kinnaris Quintet. In total,  acts will meet in Stromness — with the  visiting acts welcomed and outnumbered by Orkney’s thriving local folk scene, which itself features internationally renowned artists such as Saltfishforty, The Chair, The Wrigley Sisters and Gnoss, alongside local favourites including Hullion, the Kirkwall City Pipe Band # currently celebrating their centenary year # and many more. This amounts to an estimated  featured musicians # though many more will meet in Stromness, with the town’s pubs and hotels bursting with informal pub sessions from opening to closing time across the four days, alongside the ticketed programme. As well as Stromness, this year the festival reaches out to communities in Birsay, Burray, Finstown, Kirkwall, Orphir, Quoyloo, Sanday, Sandwick, St Margaret’s Hope, Stenness and Tankerness.In order to stage such a large event, the festival gratefully receives generous support from public bodies and corporate sponsors, from throughout the local and national business communities. This year’s principal supporters are Orkney Islands Council, Creative Scotland, NorthLink Ferries, Loganair — who also facilitated the rebooking of all those affected by the air traffic strike at zero cost, the Pier Arts Centre, and EIS, alongside many more inidual event sponsors and corporate patrons. The festival also benefits from many thousands of hours donated by hundreds of volunteers, who give their time freely to bring the world-renowned event together. From the twelve-strong year round management committee, to those who might work on just one event in their local community hall, each one of the festival’s community team is vital to its long standing, continued and increasing success.Festival director, Bob Gibbon said: “After many months of preparation we are delighted to be welcoming visitors and artists from far and wide, friends old and new, musicians from across the globe, to Orkney for what is set to be a memorable weekend of fun and good times. #Everyone has come together create a magnicent programme of events, and the festival just gets better and better. Orkney should rightly be very proud of what we can share, and this weekend is about sharing music, memories, time and happiness. Enjoy it everyone!”The festival’s chair, Elaine Grieve added: #I say this every year but I#m really excited about the programme for the weekend. There#s something for everyone fabulous visiting acts and a great number of local artists — and that#s something we really want to share with audiences. #It#s such a lovely time with many familiar faces ing and new joining the fold # a bit like a huge family reunion!#Alan Morrison, head of music at Creative Scotland said: “There are few places in Scotland with a more magical atmosphere than Orkney, where the stones of past civilisations sit alongside the buzz of the modern world. That’s also true of the Orkney Folk Festival, where the island’s heritage is woven into music being made by some of our best standard-bearers and rising stars. #It’s great to see so many brilliantly talented artists sharing a bill with musicians from far and near – andsome of them had to arrive a day early, well, that just means the sessions are already underway.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The final, which was held in Essex on Saturday, May , saw the finalists complete five tough physical challenges, as well as an interview with judges focusing on mental health.The competition was launched to promote mental and physical health in agriculture in a fun and engaging way.Mr Cursiter was announced as the men#s winner today, with -year-old Fiona Penfold, from the West Country, announced as the women#s winner.Asked about the importance of fitness to both mental and physical health, Sean said: #Farmers are constantly being required to produce cheap food while input costs rise. In Orkney there are a lot of farmers on their own, with  cows, living a lonely existence — they might not see another person for weeks.#He said that#s why he makes a conscious effort to socialise with others. Playing rugby for Orkney#s first team is a big part of this.#If folks close themselves in and just farm, then that#s not a good state of mind to be in. It#s hard to come away from the farm and be social, but it does have its benefits, and sometimes the lack of time is over-used as an excuse.##There are  hours in the day, so you need to give one to yourself.

To be fair, neither could my reaction.In July , I had watched Theresa May speak on the steps of Downing Street with a feeling that, even as a Liberal Democrat, I was prepared to wait and see what this Prime Minister could do.That may sound like a surprising sentiment, but towards the end of the Cameron premiership, even before the disastrous EU referendum, what I had felt was something more approaching despair.I knew this new Prime Minister came from the Home Office with what one might diplomatically describe as ‘baggage’. But, listening to her promises of support for the “just about managing”, and thinking that her position on the EU as a Remainer might help temper some of the most extreme of Brexiteers around her, I hoped this might be a leader to find a route through the chaos we knew was coming.Looking back three years that now seems almost ridiculous.Having had a close-up view of the May premiership, I wonder how I could ever have doubted that it would come to this. I almost think it wouldn’t have mattered who the Conservative Prime Minister was for the past three years – the internal isions, adherence to two-party tribalism and refusal to confront either, would have made the job almost impossible.Do I feel a little sorry for Theresa May  Sort of. But not entirely.Watching her resignation speech, it was clear that she is a woman who tried with everything she had to do what she believed was the right thing.I know something of how dficult politics can be and how she continued to this point with the weight of public and private criticism she faced is astonishing. But, in between those two speeches we’ve hardly progressed an inch since .: Why Boris Johnson won’t get a no-deal Brexit – Ian Murray MPDuring that time, many have spoken about the Prime Minister’s bullheadedness and unwillingness to listen to suggestions or take advice on board.In some aspects of leadership, these can be positive qualities, and no one would say that sticking to your guns when you absolutely believe you are doing the right thing is something to be criticised.But in Brexit that has been a major contributory factor in creating the deadlock in Parliament, which has left the Government with no clear strategy.How much the internal Tory squabbling contributed to the inability to break that deadlock, and which iniduals made it impossible for the Prime Minister to create party consensus, we will only know when the memoirs are published.What is surely clear though is that the country would now be in a much better positionthe outgoing Prime Minister could have reached out across the House from the very beginning.On more than one occasion, the Liberal Democrat’s – and others – offered compromise. But all that was offered inwas a lecture on why it had to be this deal.Tory party interest always trumped what would be best for the country. And, in that, Theresa May did not act alone. That the party in Government could not be unied, that neither side could compromise is not just sad, it is dangerous for all of us.When Theresa May recounted the tale of being told by Nicholas Winton to remember compromise, I could not help but wonder what she was hinting at. Could it be that the criticism was aimed at those on her own benches  Perhaps it was not the PM who was so averse to compromise that stalemate became the order of the day : EU: Theresa May’s resignation ‘changes nothing’ in Brexit talksCertainly the Liberal Democrats have been clear – we would have been content to vote her Brexit deal through Parliament, so long as it provided for the people to have the final say. Compromise. It was there. it was rejected.Of course, I’m confident that faced with the question “this is what Brexit will look like – is this what you really wanted ”, the public would think again and vote to remain in the EU.

Mr Stedman-Bruce looked set to seize a seat north of the Border for Mr Farage’s party backing a ‘no-deal’ departure form the EU and it was primed for widespread gains.The SNP, which came out on top as expected with around  per cent of the early votes, saw Mr Smith and Mr Allard heading to Brussels as MEPs.Mr Smith said last night: “Scotland’s a dferent country. We’ve got a dferent view of how we see our place in the world.“We’ve got a dferent view about how we want to interact with our European continent. We voted clearly remain in the initial EU \u2028referendum and that vote has been clearly replicated with the vote which is doing well for my party.“Taking the results in the round, it’s clear that Scotland’s for Europe – we have voted Remain again. That will cannot be ignored.”Scots voted  per cent in favour of staying in the EU in the  referendum but the weight of votes south of the Border swung the outcome in favour of Leave.The three other Scottish seats remained up for grabs as results were being counted last night with the SNP in the running for an unprecedented third seat.Mr Stedman-Bruce’s victory came at the expense of Ukip, which lost the seat it won in Scotland.There was better news for the Lib Dems, who looked on course to finish second across the UK.The outcome is likely to heap the pressure on the contenders for the Tory leadership to take a hard line and getting Brexit finalised without a deal.Among the early results in Scotland saw the SNP top in East Ayrshire with . per cent while the Brexit Party took . per cent. Labour was third on  per cent with the Tories on  per cent.The Brexit Party’s victory across the UK saw it claim over  per cent of the vote while the Tories were struggling to take  per cent just days after Theresa May announced her departure as Prime Minister. The first seats declared on the night saw former Scottish Tory MSP Brian Monteith win a seat in the north-east of England for the Brexit Party, which took two seats in the region, while Labour took one seat. The Brexit Party’s  per cent share of the vote wasdouble the  per cent racked up by Labour.: Scottish Parliament’s Presiding officer on tour for anniversaryLabour’s shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry blamed the lack of clarity about the party’s position on Brexit for its poor showing.“We went into the election where the most important issue was what was our view on leaving the European Union and we were not clear about it.“We were not clear on the one single thing that people wanted to hear and sent people out to campaign on that and unfortunately we just weren’t clear enough.”She said the party must now come out clearly in favour of a second vote on leaving the EU.The misery for the Tories continued just days after the announcement of Theresa May’sdeparture as leader, as the party was left heading for about  per cent of the vote. The omens were bad for the big two when the first results of the night came through in Leeds and saw Brexit claim victory with  per cent of the vote. Labour slumped to  per centwhile the Tory vote was down by  per cent. Tory leadership contender Boris Johnson tweeted a link to hisarticle, adding: “The message from last night’s results is clear. It is time for us to deliver Brexit and set out our positive plans for the country.”Other results in ares like Sedgmoor in Somerset and Newcastle in the north-east saw big wins for the Brexit Party. Turnout was up considerably north of the border by  per cent in some places, despite a lacklustre campaign, suggesting that Scots have been prompted to turnout by the recent Brexit turmoil. Edinburgh recorded a . per cent turnout, an increase from . per cent in the  vote.It was a similar picture across the EU, where the traditional parties had a bad night, while the far right enjoyed a surge in support.

Rorysays Boris is dishonest. Amber Rudd has said many things about Boris but is currently staying schtum because she wants to be his running mate. Gove has entered the Tory leadership race as the “unity candidate” – implying Boris is as disruptive now as he was in  when Gove challenged the world’s most famous zipliner, split the vote and let Theresa May become Prime Minister. Now the two “Big Beasts” are facing off again in what one BBC political correspondent has described as “a tantalising and fascinating contest”. That statement sums up the self-obsessed nature of the Westminster bubble. For the majority of British voters who are neither Tory party members or voters, there is nothing tantalising about the sorry procession of brazen liars parading with pomp and ceremony across our TV screens right now. Like Theresa May, they assure us Brexit will make Britain great again. It won’t. Like the “strong and stable” leader who torpedoed the value of sterling, they predict an economic meltdownanyone but a fearless Tory stands at the helm. Like the rest of the cabinet, they continue to drive through social security “reforms” which have left citizens hopeless, despairing and suicidal. Apparently Rudd will complain to the UN about the damning report on austerity delivered by Philip Alston, despite the fact she oversaw the most punitive parts of the new Universal Credit regime. Doublethink, living in a parallel universe or simple mendacity – who knows why leading Tories still think that simply asserting a preferred version of reality makes it true. But they do. One thing’s certain. As the deckchairs are rearranged on the Tory Titanic, the vast majority of the public do not buy the BBC’s “tantalising and fascinating” narrative. In addition to appalled progressive Labour, SNP, Plaid, Lib Dem and Green voters, sits a large group of furious former Tories, now backing the Brexit Party. And as today’s European Election results will surely reveal, hell hath no fury like a Tory voter turned.Boris v Gove is neither tantalising nor fascinating to most Scots. Instead, the meaningless, ego-ridden face off is confirmation of the Groundhog Day that’s gripped Scotland since the Brexit vote laid bare the existential crisis facing English democracy. Here we are, three years on, with the same flawed characters grappling for the same Tory leadership position, addressing roughly the same bunch of deluded Conservative party members who believes a superhuman exists to square the impossible circle of Brexit.Of course, a wheen of other candidates is available but the message is clear.The centre of the British political universe is now Boris. His past, his views, his latest pronouncements, his unconscionable mistakes – but whilst opponents rub their hands at the prospect of such a wildly unsuitable man becoming Tory party leader, his star continues to rise – south of the Border at least. Incredibly, Boris’ gaffes serve only to make him seem more human and approachable to a certain sort of voter. And he’s the talk of the steamie. As Oscar Wilde observed, the only thing worse than being talked about, is not being talked about. So, Boris has won pole position already. Everyone’s talking about the former foreign secretary – not the tattered state of the political vessel he looks set to captain. It’s as disappointing as it is predictable.If democracy mattered,the principles underpinning government mattered one iota, Scotland’s future would not lie in the hands of  Tory MPs and , Conservative party members. But it does. And this is still called a democracy.So what lies ahead Much energy will be expended in coming months to guessBoris has a cunning plan to produce a dealor simply intends to roll straight towards a no-deal Brexit on Halloween.So how can we rate his Brexit intentions now  Is his latest tough talk another bluff  Will the distraction of the Tory leadership contest produce a no-deal Brexit by default as time runs out on this bunch of self-absorbed, hopeless politicians  Or will a Boris-induced Tory meltdown precipitate a general election before Halloween  And as these large fragments of Britain’s collapsing democracy break free, will Scots sht the opinion polls decisively towards independence, demand the chance to steer our own path and give greater moral authority to the request for a Section  order The stakes will only get higher. Boris may keep changing his mind on Brexit, but his desire to cut Scottish spending is pretty consistent. A Sunday newspaper listed a decade-long litany of subsidy-junkie style remarks culminating in the former London Mayor’s  observation: “If London isn’t moving, the UK is nowhere. A pound spent in Croydon or Tottenham… will generate far more for the rest of the economy than a pound spent in Strathclyde. This is the place that drives the rest of the UK.”So Britain’snext prime minister is capable of whipping up anti-Scottish feeling and is likely to generate fresh conflict with the Scottish Government even before he enacts the power grab planned for Brexit – and all this without the endorsement of voters at a general election. Nicola Sturgeon is set to announce plans for citizens’ assemblies leading up to a second independence referendum, within days of Theresa May’s departure. So whatever decision the Tory party makes about its new leader and our prime minister, one thing’s almost certain. Scotland’s democratic deficit is set to deepen and it’ll be increasingly hard for No voters to ignore the looming storm.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon theresa may s departure enhances case for indyref2","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Theresa#s May#s departure as Prime Minister makes the case for a second Scottish independence referendum #essential#, Nicola Sturgeon has said.But Tory leader Ruth Davidson rejected the call and warned that the new Prime Minister must show a commitment to Scotland’s place in the union.\u2028The First Minister warned that the prospect of a hardline Brexiteer replacing Mrs May as “deeply concerning” as it could mean the UK being ripped out of the EU without a deal on future arrangements.The SNP leader has already set out plans for a second referendum in the next two years and indicated that she is preparing to seek a Section  order, which would allow this, from Mrs May’s eventual successor.\u2028“For Scotland, the prospect of a hardline Brexiteer Tory becoming Prime Minister is not a happy one,” Ms Sturgeon said.“The people of Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU – and not only has that been completely ignored, but it is now clear that a devastating no-deal Brexit - which would cost jobs, businesses and livelihoods - is firmly back on the Tories’ agenda.“That makes it all the more essential that Scotland has a choice of becoming an independent country.”The Scottish Government is expected to publish legislation next week to hold a secopnd referendum but control over the constitution lies with Westminster and Mrs May had rejected calls from Ms Sturgeon for a repeat of the  vote.But Mrs May’s exit will not resolve the Commons stalemate over Brexit, Ms Sturgeon added.“It will not resolve Brexit itself,” he said.“Putting another Tory leader in Downing Street without a general election is not the solution to this crisis. “The only way to resolve Brexit is to put the issue back to the people.”But the SNP leader wished her departing Tory counterpart well for the future.“While we had many political disagreements - not least over her handling of Brexit and her disregard for Scotland and the Scottish Government - leadership is not easy, and Theresa May should be thanked for her service.”But Ms Davidson was quick to warn that any potential leadership candidate must take a strong line against a second referendum in order to win her endorsement.“Theresa May knew when she took on the job of Prime Minister that the challenges facing our country were unprecedented,” Ms Davidson said“Her time in office has been characterised by the hard work, resilience, quiet dignity and attention to detail for which she is known.“Above all, by opposing the SNP’s call for an immediate second independence referendum in , the Prime Minister demonstrated her resolute commitment to the Union, and to Scotland’s place in it.“As Britain’s second female Prime Minister, she has been a role model for girls and women across the United Kingdom, showing that there is no glass ceiling to their ambitions.“As leader of the Scottish Conservatives, I want to see candidates show that same level of commitment to Scotland’s place in the Union, an ability to advance our interests at home and abroad and, crucially, demonstrate how they intend to bring our country back together after the isions sown by two constitutional referenda.”West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine MP Andrew Bowie who served as Mrs May’s parliamentary private secretary paid tribute.“It has been the privilege of my le to serve such a dedicated, loyal, patriotic and thoroughly decent woman,” he said.“We saw again today why we have been so lucky to have her as leader of our party and country.”Labour leader Richard Leonard said Mrs May leaves the country “more ided” and has fallen short on her promise to tackle the “burning injustices” in society.“She will leave the country in chaos as a direct result of her refusal to compromise over self-imposed red lines on Brexit,” she said.Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said Mrs May faced “an impossible job” to deliver Brexit that would not damage the country. he said: “People have lost patience with the Conservatives.

May has always ruled out a section  order and Scots Tory leader Ruth Davidson has already warned any prospective UK leader must take a strong stand on Scotland’s place in the UK and rule out a second referendum.The growing expectation is that new leader could be Johnson, the former foreign secretary, who has indicated he could be ready to pursue a no-deal Brexit, prompting fears over the impact on Scotland’s economy and population growth. SNP deputy Westminster leader Kirsty Blackman said: “The prospect of Boris Johnson as Prime Minister is utterly horrying to people across Scotland, as he panders to calls from extreme Brexiteers to deliver a deeply damaging no-deal Brexit.“With Johnson the clear favourite to take over at No , it is absolutely no surprise that more and more people believe Scotland’s future should be as an independent country in the EU.“Andhe does actually make it to Downing Street, that will simply send support for independence soaring even higher.“A no-deal Brexit simply isn’t an option – it’s time to end this Westminster impasse and put the question back to the people with the option to remain on the ballot paper.”Plans to introduce Irish-style citizens’ assemblies in Scotland will also be set out by Russell in an update to MSPs. These would adopt a more collegiate approach to issues which “sharply ide” opinion and were unveiled by Sturgeon last month as she set out plans for a Holyrood Bill to enable a second referendum.

The UK political system is broken and failing the people badly.“Massive pennies are dropping for many people who voted No in the  independence referendum.“What was previously unimaginable for them is now absolutely necessary.” But the prospect of Johnson or another hardline Brexiteer resulting in a huge spike in support for independence was played down by polling expert Sir John Curtice from the University of Strathclyde.“What we know about Boris is that he’s capable of reaching parts that most Tory leaders can’t reach,” Curtice said.“If he can win voters in inner London, why can’t he win voters in Scotland “The more serious point is what he does as leader.“I think what would be more relevant would bea Tory leader was to pursue no-deal, and that goes pear-shaped, then that might have an impact in Scotland. “But basically, because of the state of the House of Commons, that ain’t going to happen.“Thereafter, my argument would be it depends how he performs as prime minister and what he does and all the rest of it.“In the meantime, Boris may actually be the one person who’s capable of winning some votes back and might help the Tories in Scotland.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

They were among the first pioneers in planting English and Scots settlers in Ireland. But by , Smiths settlement failed and the lands reverted to the crown.On  May , King James I granted the Ballymena Estate to another native Irish nobleman, Ruairiacute Oacuteg MacQuillan. The estate passed through several owners, eventually passing into the possession of William Adair, a Scottish laird from Kinhilt in southwestern Scotland.The estate was temporarily renamed Kinhiltstown after Adairs lands in Scotland. The original castle of Ballymena was built in the early th century, situated to take advantage of an ancient ford at the River Braid.In  Charles I confirmed the grant of the Ballymena Estate to William Adair, giving him the right to hold a market at Ballymena on every Saturday. He hired local Irish as workers on the estate they served as tenant farmers for much of the next two centuries and more.And from those early days, Ballymena became a commercial hub for central Co. Antrim, steadily growing in prosperity through the years of the linen boom in the th century.Until recent years, the traditional market had been held at the area known as the Fair Hill on lands bordered by upper Broughshane Street, William Street and Thomas Street.When the area was sold for the development of what is now the Fair Hill Shopping Centre, the Saturday market was moved to its current venue near the Seven Towers Leisure Centre.And that is pretty much where the whole tradition kicked off nearly  years ago as the site is pretty much right in the front garden of what used to be the Adair familys residence in Ballymena!Mid and East Antrim Borough Council is urging you to come enjoy, explore and love your local market this May as part of UK wide campaign to support our local traders. ‘Love Your Local Market’ runs from - May.

Parents Charlotte and Sammy Watson, from Slatt, who lost their son Theo Philip Watson last year, want to thank all involved at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast.The Unit’s involvement allowed Charlotte and Sammy to spend precious time with Theo, who was born with Patau Syndrome, before he passed away.The Watsons are keen to give something back to the hospital.They aim to raise pound, so that the hospital can purchase a Neonatal incubator for the unit.

Farm attacks in South Africa are reported almost on a daily basis to the rest of the world and must be condemned. There is no denying they happen, the tragic results are plain to see. But what can be done about it  How does this affect how other farmers get on with le and their daily work I’ve been fortunate enough to visit and report from South Africa on five separate occasions now over the past  years and come away each time with a sense of dismissal but also hope.South Africa is a beautul country, physically, and produces some of the best food and wine demanded by consumers around the world.Politically, it’s a dferent place. A place where the state is not in charge. A state that cannot even control its basic power supply, without some form of corruption.But where does that leave agriculture and the farmers  No matter what political persuasion anyone holds, everyone must eat. Over the years of visiting farms in South Africa I noticed farmers becoming despondent, feeling let down, feeling a sense of ‘what’s the point of it all ’I’ve talked to farmers who were attacked, who lost loved ones, and who gave up.However, during my latest visit in early March this year I witnessed a positivity among farmers that really I never experienced before.Yes, nothing politically has changed, except for the worst, but farmers are more defiant, more ambitious and are investing to make their farms more efficient in order to give them a future.During the big livestock equipment show EuroTier in Germany last November I talked to a few South African farmers interested to see how technology could make their farms more efficient. It was really comforting to visit a number of farmers on this trip who are putting new technology to play in order to improve their businesses. Visiting Greenway Farms Ltd with headquarters at Tarlton to see how business partners Vito Rugani and Vincent Sequeira handle over , tonnes of carrots per year grown on , hectares was really inspiring.The passion and ambition shown by these leading vegetable farmers has resulted in a range of Rugani juices that are now being exported across the world. They have invested heavily in new state of the art equipment to extract juice from vegetables. The science is baffling, the set-up is extremely professional and as for the juice, well…..I have to admit this was the first time I ever tried carrot juice and it was absolutely delicious. The knowledge I gained from Vito and his team will stay with me for a long time. I just hope he finds a way to export the range to the UK!Next visit was to Corne Nel’s Doornfontein Melkery in Randfontein where they milk  cows. Dairy unit manager Pieter Barnard gave me a very informative tour around the farm.Having been brought up on a dairy farm myself in Northern Ireland this visit was particularly interesting and I was also impressed to see more investment in equipment to make le easier. A new rotary parlour installed two years ago certainly speeds milking time up and perhaps investment into robotic milkers will help too with the dferent milking groups in the future. The sun can be a challenge where livestock are concerned and it was good to hear plans to build new housing in the corals to keep the cows cooler. With excellent production figures and a sound understanding of the cows, this farm is certainly gearing up for an exciting future.Before travelling across the border to visit farms in Botswana I went to see Sarel Haasbroek’s grain farm in the Carletonville area of Gauteng. Again this is another progressive farmer positive about the future and was excelling in importing the Horsch machinery brand into South Africa. Up in Francistown, eastern Botswana, I was warmly hosted by the Munger family at Wayside Brahman Stud Ltd for four nights. During my stay there I was given a comprehensive run down of the breeding herd, commercial herd, game farm, and the egg laying enterprise. What a farm! Rowland and his son Rowly are certainly well respected in the area and for the cattle they produce. Wayside was started by Rowland’s father Keith who was also present during my visit. And then it was off to see another beef farmer, this time with Bonsmara cattle, Calla Visser, for a very early start checking his cattle. Every night Calla has to go and round up over  cattle on his farm and herd them into outdoor corals for the night to protect them against theft and predators such as hyenas or leopards!And, every next morning Calla and his staff start very early going around the five dferent corals on his , hectare farm counting all the cows, calves and bulls hoping they all made it through the night alive.This, of course, is a new line of management for me but was nonetheless interesting to learn. A visit to Bobbsies Chickens Ltd based in the east at Tshesebe guided by general manager Gerhard van der Merwe was another super visit. Botswana, too, impressed me, as did the farmers there. I received detailed insight into the beef and poultry industries there and look forward to the next time I can visit.Some of the Botswanans though need to learn how to drive!

It has not been transferred to council ownership, as it is being sold to Translink to enable a bus terminal to be developed on the site.Patrons of the car parks should note local car park signage and council websites for information on tarfs.So far no changes are planned for tarfs - with the Leader specically asking on the fate of the five hours for £ tarf.A Transport NI spokesman said: “Drivers are still expected to park properly and where applicable, pay the appropriate tarf in the charged car parks.“NSL traffic attendants will continue to patrol the car parks as normal and issue Penalty Charge Notices to illegally parked vehicles.”People can continue to use the telephone cashless parking system, Parkmobile where you can register and phone    to avoid your parking time expiring. Province-wide drivers should not notice any changes. The transfer excludes park and ride sites which will continue to be looked after by DRD.A council spokesperson said : “Armagh City Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council has agreed to continue with the £ for five hours charge in respect of those car parks where charges were previously in place.

Over the years my da became sole owner of the butchers, it was always called A’town Meats,” he said.Gerald said his father was the eldest of five children and that Tom’s three brothers and late sister all emigrated to Canada, with his father opting to stay in Ireland to raise his young family.“At one stage he had opened up a butchers shop in Poleglass, inside a group of shops at the time and a shop in Ladybrook which my brother Vincent ran. Dad sold the business in September  and stayed on because it was coming up to Christmas, up to the Christmas club and what is a very busy time. After Christmas he stayed on, right up until around March, April time when he started to feel unwell. He was told it was cancer and started radiotherapy in October last year.”Gerald continued: “The Christmas period was very bad as he was very anxious waiting on results following the treatment. It wasn’t that he got the all clear, but he was told everything seemed ‘positive’. He knew by the end of January, early February something wasn’t right, the pain started coming back and he was told that ‘it’ was back.“A week or so later he was told that it was terminal.”“He was in hospital about a fortnight and we took him out to bring him home. He was only out three weeks and one day when he passed away.”Gerald spoke poignantly of how A’town Meats was known as a “meeting place, a place for people to come and talk”.“People would come in for a yarn, for many it was their way of getting out of the house and a chance for conversation.”Gerald said his father was a founding member of the Donegal Celtic Football Club and loved the GAA, especially local clubs Lamh Dhéarg and Rossa.“Last year was the best year of his le as he got closer to his kids. He was always working. His kids, his grandkids,you wanted to go see him you went to the shop. Eventhe children were being baptised, made their communions, their confirmations, you brought them to the shop. He was there six-days a week. I would have seen him on Christmas Day going into the shop and getting burgers, getting whatever was needed for restaurants who would’ve contacted him needing food. He went round, opened up and made sure they were catered for.”As well as a prominent businessman, Gerald said his father was a “bookmaker as well”.“He applied his trade at Celtic Park, Drumbo, Dundalk and Dunmore, it was a hobby as much as anything . He loved to see people winning.”He added: “One of the first times he ever done the book, a fella ended up owing him over £, and he said he would have it up to the shop that Tuesday. When the guy came up to the shop, my da was still meeting and greeting the customers, they came first, they were the be all and end all.“Dad gave the man a large meat parcel and said to him ‘take that down to the house with you’. The fella said it was the first time he had owed someone money, paid it and actually left ‘with a smile on his face’. The fella brought it down to his family and they were saying how nice the meat was and he replied: ‘Well of course it is, it cost me £,!’”Gerald said his father could pick up on when his customers were going through hardship.“He knew without them having to say anything. He would give them some food just to help them out, he never spoke of it, it was the people who would come in and tell you how he had helped.“A wee woman came into the shop one Christmas and she couldn’t afford the turkey so she said she was just going to take a ‘wee chicken this year’ and offered a ring as a means of payment. He wouldn’t hear of it but the wee woman insisted on giving over the ring. The wee woman passed away and her daughters came into the shop months later and he said he had something belonging to them and brought out the ring.“He was a very private man and religious in his own ways. He would’ve walked from his house in Donegall Park to Clonard, walked down for the Rosary and to St Paul’s as well. He always kept himself fit, he did Slimming World in his ’s and went out of his way to get the accreditation to sell the Slimming World endorsed food in the shop. He had people coming from all over to buy it.“He was always reading and went back to get his Degree in History. He loved the horses, he was always saying I would ‘scud’ his bets, that I was the worst ‘picker in the world’.“At the end of the day he was a very hard working, very generous, honest man. All his le he would’ve said ‘I’m doing this for you, I’m doing this for you’, in terms of working so hard at the business. He loved his family.”Gerald’s daughter and Tom’s granddaughter, Charleen Straney, described her “granda” as “a much loved man and very highly thought of by everyone who got to know him.”Tom Straney’s Requiem Mass will take place todayin St Agnes’ Church at noon."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"its second time out for the adventures","story":"ONE of the big hitters of the s pop scene, West Belfast’s very own The Adventures, will bring their back catalogue of melodic classics to County Down next weekend as part of the Harmony Live festival.Fans will be able to hear familiar singles Your Greatest Shade of Blue, Feel the Raindrops and of course ’s cracker Broken Land – the ‘most played song on Radio ’ during that particular year.In between rehearsals at Springfield Road’s Blackstaff Mill, lead singer Terry Sharpe told the Andersonstown News that the band aren’t going to be stepping away from the stage anytime soon.“We did a couple of shows at the Empire in January, all the lyrics, the cords, the tunes are hard wired into my brain. It’s like getting a record out again, all you have to do is just dust it down a bit.”Terry stressed that their Harmony Live performance, along with Irish duo Aslan and The  Of Us, definitely won’t be their last following speculation that circulated at the start of .“We didn’t say anything about final shows, I’ve actually discovered how this happened and it’s usually the venue or the agent who come out with the story. The next thing I was doing a radio interview with Johnny Hero and he was asking ‘is this going to be your last show ’ I said, ‘Johnny I don’t know, it was out of my hands’. Even when you deny it, it appears in the papers as well, but it’s not the case,” he said.Terry spoke of how nowadays outdoor festival gigs are planned to within an inch of their le – unlike back in the ’s.“Back in the day the first thing you did when you arrived at an open air thing, was the itinerary would be on the door, first thing you’d do is take it down as it had no resemblance to reality because everything then would run half an hour, to an hour late.”With the Spice Girls set to appear at Croke Park this weekend, Elton John taking two years to complete his ‘farewell’ tour and a Let’s Rock ’s festival set to set out its stall this summer in Boucher Road, Terry spoke of how nostalgia is a “new aspect” of the rock ‘n’ roll industry.“There is a big nostalgia industry, people who might have bought a record of ours when they were teenagers are now in their ’s. People want to go out and see what they spent their money on in their youths. Nostalgia is not part of the rock ‘n’ roll business, it’s a new aspect. Now rock ‘n’ roll is old enough to be nostalgic. It’s good for us, it’s good for everybody who was around at that time.”As the band fine tune their set list, Terry said that he along with songwriter Pat Gribben have been talking about making “another record”.“We’ll see,there is a demand there. We have talked about it.”A limited number of tickets for Harmony Live are still available. Tickets for the Friday May  line-up which includes Aslan, The Adventures and The  Of Us are priced at £..

The amount of lads leaving here for England but ing a year later is far too high. It is not about their football ability but due to a lack of support network for them.“There is that fear factor of moving away and we want to help them stay on the ladder.“It is an important moment for New Era. There is so much talent in Ireland and now we have a place to facilitate them.”The Innovation Factory office will be run by former professional footballer, Lee Mudd, who says the agency was drawn by the vast untapped potential talent throughout the island of Ireland.“There are a lot of talented young players here and having an office in Belfast will provide them with the opportunity to make it on a bigger stage. We currently have  players on our books from Ireland and Northern Ireland and I would expect this to grow considerably in a short time as there is so much potential here.“We recognise that it is an enormous challenge for a young person to leave this country and go to live in England. It is important to provide them with a support network. It can be a tough, ruthless environment and they need a caring team behind them to look after them, not just now but throughout their careers.”Lee points to the example of New Era Ambassador, Rio Ferdinand who has seen many highs and lows during his career and is now a successful businessman, media pundit and mentor to many young professionals.“Rio has been with New Era since the start and is the perfect example of how the company has helped him on his journey and shown him that there is a le after playing football. We want young players here to have access to all that experience.“We are in a growth phase and the Innovation Factory gives us the chance to build our business and increase capacity as needed. We also liked the networking opportunities with other businesses that have ambitious plans it offers us the chance to feed off this energy and new ideas”Shane Smith, Innovation Factory’s Community Engagement Officer added:“We are very excited to welcome such a prestigious sports agency to Northern Ireland.“New Era Sports has recognised the facilities and support we have to offer and we look forward to helping them expand their activities in Northern Ireland.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dup refuse to name preferred conservative leader but they must deliver brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He is one of eight candidates to so far declare their intention to run for the leadership.DUP leader Arlene Foster said her party would be \"listening very carefully\" to what each of the candidates has to say about Brexit and, in particular, around the backstop. Yesterday, three of the partys most prominent MPs declined to state their preference, saying it was a matter for the Conservative Party.However, they did indicate it would need to be someone who could deliver Brexit and scrap the backstop, which the DUP is fiercely opposed to.Writing in this newspaper, academic Prof Jon Tonge, who has written a book about the DUP, indicated Mr Johnson or Mr Gove would likely be the partys preferred picks.And he believes that Mr Goves scepticism around the  Agreement would appeal to many.\"Success for Gove would probably please the DUP, as he is one of the few Conservatives who has always been Good Friday Agreement-sceptic,\" he said. \"In common with the DUP, Goveargued that the  deal was a capitulation to republicans and that a military solution - the defeat of the IRA - would have been better.\"The DUP struck a confidence and supply deal with Mrs May to keep her in power in the wake of the  General Election, which left the Tories short of a Commons majority. The Westminster arrangement which saw the DUPs  MPs vote with the Government on key issues delivered a £bn funding package to Northern Ireland.But the party has been particularly critical of Mrs May in recent months for her handling of the Brexit process.It was opposed to the contentious border backstop element of the deal Mrs May struck with the EU, claiming it would see Northern Ireland treated dferently to the rest of the UK.DUP MPs would not be drawn on who they would like to see as the next Conservative leader, when contacted by the Belfastyesterday. North Antrim MP Ian Paisley would only say that the choice of Mrs Mays successor was \"entirely a matter for the Tory Party\". Sir Jeffrey Donaldson added: \"It wouldnt be appropriate for the DUP to be seen to be backing a particular candidate. However, we are clear that we want someone who will deliver Brexit and help us to address issues around the backstop.\"We will view any leadership contender in that light and await the outcome of the contest.\" East Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell said: \"When we were choosing our party leader, we wouldnt have relished or welcomed any intervention from Tories about who we should choose, so its a matter for them. \"Hopefully it will be someone who sees the problems that have to be resolvedand is able and prepared to do so. In particular, I hope its somebody who gets the importance of the backstop issue being resolved and understands the need to drive home to Europe that there is no such thing as a hard border. \"Its a total impossibility, so we have to get beyond that fear of creating something that cant come about.\" DUP Strangford MP Jim Shannon hinted that he had a preferred candidate, but would not reveal their identity. He said: \"The best result will be someone who leads the party forward to deliver on the referendum result of , but who that will be is the responsibility of the Conservative party. \"I really hope that the person chosen has the ability, commitment and the wherewithal to negotiate, unlike the previous Prime Minister who unfortunately didnt have that long-term understanding of the position of Northern Ireland.\"Our only red line was and continues to be the backstop and we hope that after this three year Brexit process the new leader will be able to deliver on that and secure our position within the United Kingdom.\"Meanwhile, Northern Ireland minister John Penrose has thrown his support behind Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, saying that he is the ideal choice to \"heal Brexit wounds\". Writing in The Sunday , the MP for Weston-super-Mare said that for him, Mr Hunt \"stands out\" among \"plenty of credible candidates\". Yesterday Mr Gove became the eighth candidate to enter the race after Mr Hunt, Mr Johnson, Mr Raab, Esther McVey, Andrea Leadsom, Matt Hancock and Rory Stewart.The new Tory leader looks set to take over as Prime Minister at the end of July. The timetable for the contest will see nominations close in the week of June , with MPs involved in a series of votes to whittle down the crowded field to a final two contenders. Tory Party members will then decide who wins the run-off."},{"url":null,"title":"casement park would be only northern ireland stadium to meet world cup 2030","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Nothing could be further from the truth.\"The first night I slept aboard was during a dark, stormy, flooded night, her rudder thumped loudly on its metal housing posts, the clanging echoing through the riveted iron hull.\"Tying the tiller up in an attempt to slice this sent her into a rage and the banging grew much louder.\"It wasnt long before Hilary did get used to her and now admits she is a novice sailor.She purchased the barge from a man who used it as his home but then married and ed back to live on land.\"Getting to know her was a little awkward,\" added Hilary. \"There was a period of long-distance love and uncertainty but I soon learned of her huge personality.\"I love this boat and I love being spending time in it.\"I find it so peaceful and relaxing being so close to water.\"I have a real passion for natural healing. Everyone leads such stressful lives and a lot of people are increasingly going to GPs and a lot of problems people have now is all down to stress.\"People enjoy being by the water, stress levels go down and they lead much healthier lestyles as a result.\" "},{"url":null,"title":"insult to injury it is reprehensible for the secretary of state to insist that any compensation has to be agreed by the assembly","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Simon and his twin brother Nigel were among almost , haemophiliacs who received blood contaminated with HIV and hepatitis C in the s and s.Today Simon, who is married to Olive and has one son, Ethan , lives with cirrhosis of the liver and must be tested every six months to determinehe has cancer.Q. You are a haemophiliac, how does that impact on your le A. I have got what is called Mild Haemophilia A.I lack a clotting factor in my blood. The likelihood of me bleeding is considerable.I have about %-% clotting factor instead of %. Therefore the risk of bleeding in joints, the risk of bleeding from bruising in muscles, the risk of internal bleeding - I try and avoid these because they can lead to joint destruction and internal bleeding and more serious things. It can be fatal at times.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetI dont play contact sport. From an early age my parents encouraged us to keep fit, as it would enable us to be stronger and build some strength against the risks.I row and I have always rowed. It has been a great benefit to me in terms of keeping me strong and healthy and fighting the risks.Haemophilia is something that you absorb and try to live with. But there are times when you do worry,you have a problem - like, for example, with the hepatitis virus, or with the destruction of your liver.And you worry about ityou have internal bleeds or a bad knock.Q. How did you come to receive infected blood A. We have special concentrated treatments, the plasma or blood from thousands of litres, and they take the factor out of those, and they produce concentrates which you are injected with.The substance in the injections strengthens the coagulation of your blood, so it brings my coagulant up to %. It lasts for two or three days and you have to inject yourself again.I was infected while I was getting treatment for an internal bleed on my thigh.As a result of that I had to get injection treatments and in that was the virus hepatitis. I was in my mid-s when it happened.I was being monitored by the hospital for around  years and it became apparent that I had hepatitis. Apparently it had been known for around four years before they told me I had it.In a sense I felt like I was the last to know, because everyone  did. Andyou dont know what is in your medical records, you are not aware of it.But it was clear from my medical records that they were very much aware of issues before I found out.When I got the diagnosis I was extremely worried and concerned about the consequences.I sought as much guidance and advice as I could get, which there wasnt much of.It was just something that all of a sudden burst forth in lots of haemophiliacs. It appears that between % and % of haemophiliacs who were exposed to the virus ended up getting hepatitis C and then from that a number of people go on to get cirrhosis of the liver. I developed that.I have to have my liver checked every six months in ultrasound to look for anything of concern - because they are looking for a cancer tumour.Q. How does hepatitis C impact on your health and le A. It makes you very tired, you have cold sweats, it makes you feel like you have the flu. Your memory goes a little bit and people have a iety of reactions to it on top of that.I went through two treatments to cure me of the hepatitis. They are very severe, they are almost like a chemo treatment.They kill your immune system and they give you these injections which actually suppress the virus. The virus sort of goes to sleep andit stays asleep after the treatment, hopefully it wont wake up again.The first time I had it done, the virus reappeared. The second time it stayed asleep and thankfully it is still dormant.But I have cirrhosis, which is a direct result of hepatitis.My twin brotheris in exactly the same situation, only he was infected earlier than me. And he got cirrhosis and ended up with cancer and had to have a liver transplant a year ago. He has made a wonderful recovery, and is a very, very lucky man to still be here.We have heard from people in the inquiry who have had more than one liver transplant, as the virus is still in the system and in the blood and attacks the second liver.Q. Is the threat of liver cancer always hanging over your head A. Yes. Every six months I go for a scan and they do tests andthey see anything in the scan, I would have a MRI.They have discovered nodules in the past. But they are always looking for a tumour.I had a brain haemorrhage a number of years ago.They believe that because of the severity of the treatment for hepatitis, people react in dferent ways.Some people get diabetes, some people end up with higher blood pressure. And there is a belief that there is a connection with my second treatment and my brain haemorrhage.I came close to death there. I thought I was a goner. I was in intensive care for a long period of time and the medical staff did a great job of getting me back up to where I am now. Dr Gary Benson has my eternal gratitude.It changes your perspective on le.Q. Such near death experiences must surely make you ponder your own mortality A. They very much do - when you think that you are going to die and you have to decide whether you are going to make your peace or not. I did at that stage make my peace and was prepared to die. But thankfully I am still here.My situation makes me feel dferently about le and death.I am  and I have got used to living with these things. But there are times when you wonder whether or not you are going to be still here.But I live my le with the glass half full, so I am a battler and a fighter. I stay positive and Ill never be otherwise. I have a very strong faith.I have very good friends and family and we are all very strong together. And my colleagues at work are extremely supportive.I cant complain. That is my lot and I have to get on with it. I have accepted my fate. It is what it will be.Q. A journey like this would have a huge impact on your family. Tell me about that.A. It has had a huge impact on my family. They carry the worry. They worry every six months about what the next test is going to bring or when you have other complications or other bleeding episodes and what comes out of those. Its the worry about what way that will leave you.When I had the brain haemorrhage I saw my we crying in the arms of her friend at the hospital and I realised that it was bad.But my we Olive is very strong and she keeps her problems and worries to herself. She doesnt let me see it very often. But seeing it this time made me realise it was bad.My son constantly monitors me and is very, very caring towards me.It has had a huge impact on their lives also.Q. You say that your mother feels guilty, why is that A. Because mothers bear the haemophiliac boys. A cousin of hers had haemophiliac sons and we have all been infected.And as a result of that my mum Elizabeth feels that guilt.Mothers do feel the guilt because they see what you have to go through and even as a haemophiliac there are so many impacts on your le, with bleeds and hospital stays and damaged joints and everything . It is just a lelong health risk.Q. Why do you feel that its important to speak out about your journey A. I think that the truth has to be told. I listened to a very harrowing statement last week from a woman whose husband died. I knew him very well.There are so many people in our community of infected and affected in the contaminated community whose voices need to be heard, both here and across the UK.We want to make sure that the truth gets out there. And this public inquiry is doing something that the others didnt do. It is getting to the truth. \u2029We have great confidence in Sir Brian Langstaff, the chairman.Q. Do you feel empathy with victims of Historic Institutional Abuse A. Yes, I do feel a lot of empathy with the HIA victims.I cant for the le of me understand why they are not being given the justice that they deserve.Judge Hart concluded that inquiry three years ago and his conclusions were that they had been abused and that they should be compensated.It is morally reprehensible that the Secretary of State says that this is something that needs to be agreed when the Assembly gets together.She has millions of pounds at her fingertips at the Treasury and they are talking about £, to £, after their lives were destroyed. And so many of them are dying. And in that there is a similarity.For us, in relation to the payments, the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State and all the departments all agree that it should never have happened.They all believe that there should be a parity in the payment schemes across the UK for the contaminated blood people.Q. What do you hope to get from the inquiry A. We hope for truth. We hope that the reality of what really happened, who took the decisions and why, comes out and why government has shuffled its feet for  years and not taken responsibility.We want to know who, what, when, where and why  Because this wasnt necessary and government was not duly diligent.We also want to know why the pharmaceutical companies have been hiding, because they created these products.Q. Has your experience destroyed your le A. My le is dferent than it might have been.I am a positive person and I try to live the le that God gives me as well as I can.I have been close to death and therefore every day is a blessing and a bonus.When you meet people like you who are suffering, you meet special people and you share special experiences and special understandings.Everyone suffers in some way. We have just been allocated a specic type of suffering because of this contaminated blood.Q. What hope do you hold on to in all of this A. I hope that we get closure from this inquiry. I hope that this will lead to better practice.I will live as long as God gives me, but I hope that I live every day in a healthy and happy way.And I will feel better, having had the chance to speak for those who are no longer here."},{"url":null,"title":"mays disastrous deal unaltered and we wont back it dup leader","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The fatal flaws still remain. The backstop is still there meaning Northern Ireland could be cut off from its main market in Great Britain by a new regulatory border. \"Unless there are treaty level changes, Brussels would always have the whip hand.\"Mrs May yesterday set out a -point compromise package in her final attempt to secure approval for her deal, which has already been rejected in Parliament three times.She is to offer MPs a vote on whether to hold a second Brexit referendum in a last-ditch effort to secure support in the House of Commons.Her new Brexit deal, which was agreed by Cabinet only after a stormy two-hour session, will be brought to Parliament in the first week of next month.As well as a vote on a second referendum, MPs will be offered a choice over the UKs future customs arrangements with the European Union.TUV leader Jim Allister rounded on the Prime Minister for opening the door to a second referendum. He said Mrs Mays deal was nothing new but \"rather another attempt to force her failed, rejected plan through Westminster\".He added: \"What it does contain is another massive climbdown this time on a second referendum. What an unprincipled inidual, that shed offer anything to try and get her disastrous deal through.\" He said it was \"empty rhetoric\" to pledge that the Government would seek to have alternative arrangements to the backstop by . \"Once the principle of detachment of Northern Ireland is accepted, it will become a template for going forward in the long term arrangement.\"That is totally unacceptable constitutionally and economically. Effectively, it leaves us in the waiting room for Irish unity,\" he added.Sinn Fein vice president Michelle ONeill said: \"The majority of people of the North did not consent to Brexit and rejected it at the polls. \"The new offer announced by Theresa May contains little new thinking. Westminster is in chaos and what we heard today from Theresa May will do little to convince the business community or anyone  here that is likely to change.\"Ulster Unionist EU election candidate Danny Kennedy said: \"The very fact that the Prime Minister has made this speech less than  hours before polls open in an election to the European Parliament is symptomatic of the chaotic state of her Government at this time. The fact remains there should never have been a backstop in the first place and it was poor negotiations that resulted in its inclusion.\" Alliance leader Naomi Long said: \"Those saying the case for another vote was delusional have been proven wrong. We have not left the EU yet - the decision can be reversed and Brexit stopped.\"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he would consider the Prime Ministers plan, but warned: \"We wont back a repackaged version of the same old deal, and its clear that this weak and disintegrating Government is unable deliver on its own commitments.\"Mrs Mays proposals were immediately rejected by Tory Brexiteers. Boris Johnson tweeted: \"We are being asked to vote for a customs union and a second referendum. The Bill is directly against our manesto - and I will not vote for it. We can and must do better - and deliver what the people voted for.\""},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

The parties are currently engaged in talks attempting to restore devolved government with civil servants responsible for running the country.Asked about her message to the local politicians, Baroness Paisley said they needed to \"lay aside their baggage and face facts\".\"So many petty things, they dont see the big picture,\" she said.\"So many people are crying out for help and they are failing them by not taking responsibility.\"It is going to get worse and that leaves us open to all sorts of trouble.\"She added: \"I would say to them cut out the petty things and dwell on things that matter - think of the people.She said she was \"aggrieved\" the  MLAs were still taking a salary and it was not fair on civil servants to be doing the job of elected representatives.\"It is abominable for people to take money for nothing,\" she added, \"they are not doing the job they were elected to do.\"Baroness Paisley also said the parties needed to be more open with the public, adding: \"There is nothing in the open, what goes on is hidden.\"We are all sinners no matter who we are or what we are.She was asked about the DUP fielding its first openly gay candidate, Alison Benningtion and the subsequent resignations from the party after her successful election, including her late husbands brother in law and how some have said the late Ian Paisley would be \"turning in his grave\".\"We are all sinners no matter who we are or what we are.. that girl may not know Christ died for her,\" she said.\"I do not hate Ms Bennington, I dont know the girl. I dont hate anybody no matter who they are or what they have done against me.\"But we have to love Christ first and what He says we have to obey his word. These things are written for our benefit.\"Baroness Paisley said she hoped the party was not making a move away from the ethos her husband established the party under.\"It was a decision taken at the time and I think it was taken as a defiance to see what would happen.\"And I think it should be put to the whole party and a proper decision made on what should be done.\"Turning to Brexit and Arlene Fosters comments on leaving the countrya united Ireland came about, Eileen Paisley said it would take an \"awful lot\" for her to move saying so long as their was freedom of religion she would remain.\"I would not like a dictatorship or someone whatever their religion was to be persecuted because of that.\"It is a big question. If we go right back to the beginning, the iding of Ireland. The people or Ireland, north, south, east and west, I think are a great people.\"No matter what part of Ireland a person is from.. they are a fellow country man or woman.\"I just wonder why it had to be ided at that time and I think that was the wrong ision. It is too big an issue for me to ponticate on.\" I dont want my mind and soul to be poisoned with an unforgiving spirit.Baroness Paisley said she missed her late husband more, and more every day and she was told many times by others across the political ide and the communities his leadership was missed.She recalled how her husband wanted to be a farmer when he was a young boy and it was when sowing corn he heard the call from God that it was not he seed He wanted Ian to sow.She said in his first sermon in Sixmilecross in Co Tyrone he spoke for only  minutes before running out of material and immediately vowed to never speak again.\"And the man that was taking him told him youll speak all right, and so his words were fulfilled,\" she said.In his final years the Free Presbyterian Church ostracised its founder. Baroness Bannside said it was \"very callous\" but pointed to Jesus and how despite all he had done for his people, was crucied.Baroness Bannside said she no longer worships at the Free Presbyterian Church as it would \"leave her open\" instead going to her granddaughters husbands baptist church.\"I just put it away, I dont bother... I live my own live with my own family and I am content to do that,\" she added.\"It was dficult to forgive them but I have to get on.

In  the party won  MEPs across the UK.Mr Corbyn’s party trailed in third place, behind the Brexit Party and Liberal Democrats nationally.But Mr Burgon said: “I think the message of trying to bring people together who voted Remain and Leave is the right message.“It was never going to work in this kind of low-turnout EU election where the people most interested in this important issue of Brexit, whether it is to Remain or Leave, came out to vote. A general election would be very dferent.”He told ITV’s Good Morning Britain that Labour could support a referendum to stop a new Tory leader taking the UK out of the EU without a deal.“Whether it be a no confidence vote in the Government, a general election or a public vote, we will use whatever mechanism necessary to stop a disastrous no-deal Brexit,” he said.Mr McDonnell said Labour could not hide from the “hit” it took in the elections.Faced with the prospect of a “Brexiteer extremist” taking over from Theresa May, a public vote would “unite our party and country”.Can’t hide from hit we took last night.Bringing people together when there’s such a ide was never going to be easy. Now we face prospect of Brexiteer extremist as Tory leader  threat of no deal, we must unite our party  country by taking issue back to people in a public vote— John McDonnell MPMay , Mr Watson said the party cannot go into a general election without a clear position on a second referendum and a special conference may be needed to decide a Brexit policy.He tweeted a link to a survey on his website, asking members how the party should agree a new Brexit policy.He said: “Following the disastrous EU election results, Labour urgently needs to re-think its Brexit position and realign with members and voters.”Following the disastrous EU election results, Labour urgently needs to re-think its Brexit position and realign with members and voters.

staff “poverty wages” despite a recent upsurge in visitors.The comments were made by the Derry Trades Union Councilwhich met with delegates from the Aegis union and representatives from the Low Pay Commissionin the city.The DTUC has called on the local tourism and services sector to justy its low pay policy which is forcing families to foodbanks and leaving greater numbers in poverty.Last year leading accountancy firm, ASM Chartered Accountants, published a bellwether report on the tourism industry in NI which described Derry as the “star of the show”.It said the city had turned a corner through growing occupancy rates which brought about improved profitability of .% in  compared to .% in .With that increase in demand came a very substantial improvement in room rates which increased by .% year on year to an overall average of £..A record number of cruise ships are also set to dock in the city this year, according to Visit Derry.Commenting after the meeting on the need to hold large employers to account, Aegis Divisional Secretary, Gareth Moore, said: \"We welcome the visit from the LPC and the opportunity to highlight the damage that poverty wages has on workers, their families and their communities.“In the current economic situation where record levels of employment coincide with record levels of foodbank use and workers in poverty, there is a necessity for wages to be increased to a real living wage.“We cannot accept the current situation where full-time workers are struggling to survive from month to month, falling further into debt and relying on foodbanks to get by.“Aegis, along with our comrade in the DTUC, will be very active this year in challenging large employers who refuse to pay a real living wage to their staff while those at the top live lavish lestyles.”ExploitationThe Low Pay Commission is an independent body that advises the government about the National Living Wage and the National Minimum Wage.Niall McCarroll of Unison and Chairperson of Derry Trades Union Councilhas thrown down the gauntlet to local businesses to end exploitation and urged them to pay workers a living wage.He said: “DTUC officers along with our colleagues from UNISON Community Branch, Foyle Health Branch, Derry Education and Aegis collectively provided a voice for local workers when we met the Low Pay Commission in Derry.“DTUC used the opportunity to impress upon the LPC the precarious and unstable nature of employment across the City and District and how the scourge of low pay leaves workers and their families struggling to have any decent standards of living.“These demoralising standards of living are no more prevalent than within the localtourism and service industry where basic minimum wage and zero hour contacts are used by commerce groups and employers to maximise profits at the expense of local people.”Mr McCarroll continued: “How can this be justied when local hotels are regularly at full capacity and restaurants and cafes also busy and yet poverty pay is the dish of the day.“The LPC assured DTUC that they would report back to government, presenting their findings which included the call from DTUC for a minimum living wage of £ an hour for all workers, no matter what their age.“DTUC are committed to building on our campaign to stand in solidarity with local workers, whilst exposing bad employers and we will be engaging with all newly elected DCSDC councillors to end the exploitation of local workers.”DamagingThe Northern Ireland Hotels Federationis the representative body for the hotel sector.NIHF Chief Executive, Janice Gault, described accusations of low pay as \"very damaging\" to an industry which has \"done much to improve its image\".She said: \"Our members are subject to the same legal and employment framework as other sectors. Hotels currently have a wage content of around % of turnover.\"The sector has a iety of roles from entry level at the appropriate national minimum wage level of the candidate through to supervisory, management and executive roles.\"The Federation has not seen the evidence that the LPC received last week and therefore is not in a position to answer the specics. Nor have the NIHF been made aware of working conditions contra to current national minimum wage levels by any trade union official or employee in the Derry-Londonderry area.\"Ms Gault added: \"Allegations of this nature are very damaging and without having specic examples are impossible to abate.\"As an industry we have done much to improve our image: improving working hours, providing strong and well rewarded career paths and supporting qualications that give employees the opportunity to have greater skills to work globally.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: Niall McCarroll, chairman of the Derry Trades Union Council, and members of Aegis in meeting with the Low Pay Commission."},{"url":null,"title":"foyle hospice weekly draw results winner","story":"Winners in this weeks Foyle Hospice Weekly Draw are - st prize: £,, Paul Breslinnd prize: £,, Rollover : rd prize: £, Terry Monaghanth prize: £, Diarmuid Campbellth prize: £, William Linton .googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"spencer road closed traffic travelling city side","story":"Traffic travelling from Craigavon Bridge is currently being erted away from Spencer Road after a bus became stuck at the junction of Spencer Road and Fountain Hill.It is the same junction where lorries have become stuck in recent months.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe PSNI said: \"Spencer Road and Fountain Hill remain closed due to a vehicle blocking both Roads and will be for a period of time.\"Please avoid the area and delays should be expected.

Some say while those carrying out the work are obliging, they are not responsible the delay or the lack of communication.Businesses are also hoping that customers they have not seen for some time willwhen Irish Street s to a sense of normality.They say the loss of parking spaces has impacted on trade with the work forcing people not to use one of the townrsquos main car parks nearby.During last weekrsquos protest, one trader revealed that her business has been forced to go mobile, visiting the homes of elderly people who cannot safely access her premises in the town centre due to the public realm scheme.Restaurant owner Mizba Uddin says things have been ldquoterrible for his business since work on the project began.ldquoThe business has literally collapsed, he declared, standing outside his restaurant surrounded by barriers used by contractors.ldquoThe situation is very, very bad and we have even have people driving down the one-way system the wrong way. Parking spaces have been lost as a result of the work and not all will be ed when the scheme is completed. People are going where as we do not provide a delivery service.Mizba said one of his main concerns has been the lack of communication from those overseeing the project. He also urged those in charge of the scheme to talk to traders to let them know what is going on.He added: ldquoI was told that the scheme would end in March and have heard nothing since. I am relying on other people to tell me what is going on but it should not be like this. I cannot even clean my windows because there is so much dust everywhere.ldquoSummer time can be quiet for me. Everyone in Irish Street wants this project completed as quickly as possible. As the work continues, there are simply no customers going to any of the shops. The work is killing businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygalget woman’s two week walk meeting inspirational people  ","story":"A BALLYGALGET woman is one of two volunteers who are spending a fortnight walking in towns and villages around Northern Ireland meeting inspirational people who are improving their communities.Patricia Fleming, a former camogie player with Ballygalget John Mitchelrsquos GAC, called into her old club last Sunday accompanied by Rory Mullan from Derry.They were hand-picked from a raft of candidates to be Big Lunch walkers for this year.Starting last Friday, they are visiting dferent places in Northern Ireland ahead of the Big Lunch weekend on June -.The Big Lunch event is where over six million people through the UK will meet to share food and eat together.Patricia and Rory visited Ballygalget to hear about all the great work the club does in the surrounding area.Patricia, who now lives in Belfast with her family, told the club how its community work was inspiring.ldquoThe reason I picked Ballygalget is that Irsquom from here, Irsquove played on that pitch many times, but I also know the community spirit that exists within Ballygalget. It blows me away when I come home and hear all the things that are happening.ldquoWhen I went for my interview after applying to be one of the Big Lunch walkers, I said thatI was chosen I would like to bring the Big Lunch community walk into rural areas and to Ballygalget.ldquoPeople here are very community oriented. That is not the case everywhere. A lot of people donrsquot feel able to knock on their neighboursrsquo doors.The club hosted a Big Breakfast fundraiser on Sunday towards sending the clubrsquos U- boys and girls to next monthrsquos Feile in Cork.However, the club is also trying to gather support for a huge number of projects, including cross-community work and is also going to host its own event over the Big Lunch weekend.A new cross-community gym opened in the club grounds a year ago, which has proven immensely popular with all sorts of people in the local area, including many who had no links with the GAC.The new building also has space for social workshops and some of the wider community schemes the club wants to pursue.Last year, Ballygalget won an Alzheimerrsquos Society Diversity Award for its work in the community.Club member Roisin Coulter said: ldquoWe are working to become a dementia-friendly community. The idea is to educate people about dementia: what are the signs and symptoms, and how to support someone living with the condition.ldquoEvery month we run a free two-hour workshop, with materials supplied by the Alzheimerrsquos Society.ldquoOur club is very much affected by dementia. Quite a number of people in the club are living with a diagnosis within their families. We want to reduce stigma and the social isolation people can feel.Aoe Savage, Ballygalget GACrsquos Health Club Officer, added: ldquoWe are working against social isolation within our area.ldquoWe are trying to improve health and wellbeing ndash both physical and mental health ndash of people who live nearby, on a cross-community basis.Ballygalget was the walkersrsquo third stop on their tour around Northern Ireland. They have already visited Belfast and Balmoral Show.Over the next two weeks will visit other places including Lisnaskea, Portadown, Ballymoney and Derry.There is still plenty of time to sign up at www.edenprojectcommunities thebiglunchhomepage..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Businessman calls for work to be completed quickly  ","story":"IRISH Street businessman Darren Trainor said the public realm scheme needs to be completed quickly for the benefit of everyone in the town.He saidthose in charge of the scheme told traders that they planned to deploy more men to finish it earlier they would put up with the disruption for a just a little longer.And asking for businesses to be provided with up-to-date information, Mr Trainor appealed to those in charge ldquocome and talk to us.He continued: ldquoWe received a letter informing us that the work would be completed on March .

The video was well received and no doubt there will be more versions in the future.Bruce Grobbelaar then rose, to a rapturous reception to deliver one of the slickest and wittiest after dinner speeches the club has heard.Stories from his early days as a  year old lsquokeeper with Highlanders FC, a Zimbabwean football club based in Bulawayo, to an eventual move to Vancouver Whitecaps and subsequent transfer to Crewe Alexandria until the legendary Bob Paisley signed him for Liverpool in .Grobbelaar played  times for the Reds in a trophy-laden career. Among the stories he told were e the events of May , , when his antics in a penalty shoot out against Roma helped Liverpool to win the European Cup.He also talked about his career after Liverpool and working with Alan Ball at Southampton at the height of the match fixing allegations that were made against him.When Ball was asked by the media why he was playing Grobbelaar in goal ahead of England international Dave Beasant, Ball reputedly said: ldquoI would rather have Bruce in goal trying to throw the game than Dave doing his best to save it.By common consensus, Bruce was one of the best speakers the club has had and has whetted the appetite for the future to renew the clubrsquos tradition of bringing over guest speakers.Bruce was presented with a small gt from the club by youth team coach Simon Thornton, a set of golf balls and towel from the Royal County Down Golf Club.Club secretary Andy Hall then spoke for a few minutes to highlight some of the highs and lows of the last  years and to thank IFA regional development officer Seamus Heath for all the work he does in promoting football across the Newry Mourne and Down Council area.Andy then invited IFA vice-chairman Jack Grundie to say a few words with Jack presenting the club with a gt to mark the occasion.County Antrim FA president Jim Jess also spoke warmly about the club and presented a memento to mark the occasion with Maurice Johnston, vice chair of the Mid Ulster Football League, congratulating the club on their th anniversary and presenting Tollymore chairman John McIlvenny with a gt to recognise the achievement.Newcastle League secretary Alan Craig was unfortunately taken ill before the dinner and was unable to attend and the club sends its warm wishes to him for a speedy recovery.The final official speaker was Elaine Junk, the former chair of the NI Womenrsquos Football Association during the period when Tollymore had a successful ladiesrsquo side.Elaine congratulated the club on its th anniversary and encouraged them to get a ladiesrsquo team back up and playing.With the official proceedings drawing to a close there was one last surprise with Adrian Howard presenting a le time achievement award on behalf of players and members to Andy Hall in recognition of all his work for the club.It was a wonderful gesture by the club and much appreciated by Andy.The evening concluded with dancing to the wonderful Fth Avenue with Bruce continuing to sign autographs and pose for pictures into the wee small hours..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Locals flying high in F15 championship  ","story":"ROGER Chamberlain and Charlie Horder won the Northern Ireland Flying Fteen Championship on Strangford Lough at the weekend.It was a deserved triumph for the Whiterock duo and also for Strangford Sailing Club, which hosted the event less than a month after the re-opening of its clubhouse which was gutted by an accidental fire in September .The five-race championship attracted a -strong fleet, which included a sizeable contingent of southern visitors, mainly from Dun Laoghaire.After three races on Saturday Chamberlain and Horder were in third place, behind Killyleagh pair Andrew McCleery and Colin Dougan mdash who got off to a flyer by winning the opening race mdash and overnight leaders Brian McKee and John Gibson, also from Whiterock, who were second and seventh in the first two races before winning the final race of the day.Chamberlain and Horder came out of the blocks early on Sunday and comfortably won the fourth race before sealing the championship with fth place in the final race.McKee and Gibson were a disappointing th in the fourth race, but with the discard brought into play, they still had a chance of outright victory.

beyond his power’ in Loughinisland report  ","story":"NORTHERN Irelandrsquos Police Ombudsman went beyond his legal powers in publishing a report ldquoreplete with determinations that RUC officers colluded with loyalists in the Loughinisland massacre, the Court of Appeal heard last week.Lawyers for two retired senior policemen claimed the watchdogrsquos damning findings on the Loughinisland atrocity should only have been releasedit had recommended prosecutions or disciplinary action against any of those under scrutiny.Judgment was reserved in the renewed bid by Raymond White and Ronald Hawthorne to have the report quashed.UVF gunmen opened fire at the Heights Bar in Loughinisland, Co Down as their victims watched a World Cup football match in June .The men killed were: Adrian Rogan , Malcolm Jenkinson , Barney Green , Daniel McCreanor , Patrick OrsquoHareand Eamon Byrne .Five others were also wounded in a sectarian attack for which no-one has been brought to justice.In June  the Ombudsman, Dr Michael Maguire, said collusion between some officers and the loyalists was a signicant feature in the murders.He found no evidence police had prior knowledge, but identied ldquocatastrophic failings in the investigation.Mr White, representing the Northern Ireland Retired Police Officersrsquo Association, and Mr Hawthorne, a former sub-isional police commander, have been involved in a long-running legal challenge to the published findings.A first hearing resulted in a ruling in  that the report was procedurally unfair and had failed to make clear it conclusions did not apply to Mr Hawthorne.At that time the watchdog agreed to remove any references to him to ensure he is not connected to any alleged wrongdoing mdash a move seen as complete vindication for the former police commander.A limited re-hearing before a dferent judge focused only on issues around the extent of the powers to publish the findings.In November last year a High Court judge rejected the retired officersrsquo case that Dr Maguire had exceeded his legal remit.Mr White and Mr Hawthorne are now now appealing that ruling.The former policemenrsquos barrister, David McMillen QC, stressed their complete support for the Ombudsmanrsquos role in scrutinising and holding officers to account.He argued, however, that the watchdog lacked the legislative authority to publish such ldquoconclusive findings in the Loughinisland report.ldquoHe simply does not have that power, Mr McMillen said.ldquoThis is an organ of the state, an important and very public organ of the state finding police officers guilty.Askedhe believed the Ombudsmanrsquos report had concluded police officers may have committed criminal offences, Mr McQuillen replied: ldquoIt was replete with those suggestions.But Mr McMillen rejected suggestions that the document could be amended to state there ldquomay be evidence of criminal or disciplinary offences.ldquoThe report is so infected with conclusive language all the way through, about what he found, that a simple rider would not make sense, he said.Barra McGrory QC, for the Ombudsman, countered that the legislation allowed him to

households  ","story":"A PROVINCE-WIDE recycling survey carried out last month has claimed that one third of householders in the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area were unhappy with how the local authority had asked them to recycle.The survey mdash carried out by polling and market research organisation Lucid Talk mdash revealed that only % of those surveyed would recycle when it was convenient for them.The survey revealed that of those who said they would recycle only when it was convenient, % indicated that they would be encouraged to recycle morethere was one bin that took all recycling, including glass mdash a service that until last month was unavailable in the former Down Council area.In addition, the survey showed that where the council area could lsquocomminglersquo glass in the same bin with the rest of their household recyclables mdash plastic, paper, card, tins and cardboard etc mdash householders were on average % happy with their glass collection method, compared to % of those in council areas that did not.Re-Gen Waste Ltd managing director, Joseph Doherty, said the survey results indicated that prioritising simplicity and convenience was the best approach to ensuring a high level of household recycling.He continued: ldquoSince April , glass can now be commingled with household recycling waste in the Down legacy council area, meaning that all householders across Newry, Mourne and Down can now put their glass into their blue bins.ldquoWe should see an marked improvement in recycling figures and a decrease in the percentage of glass placed in black bins across the entire council area.Mr Doherty said local authorities need to encourage the maximum number of people to recycle the maximum volume of materials, weighed against the cost of processing the material, and the potential financial benefits from reducing landfill costs, and selling on recyclable material.ldquoThe councils we with work in Northern Ireland, England and Scotland tell us that household friendly schemes such as commingling recyclables, plastic, paper, card, tins and cardboard and glass in one bin, are much preferable to residents than any pre-sort scheme using smaller containers or bins and that it is actively improving their recycling rates, he said.Last March, of the households in the Newry, Mourne and Down area that could commingle their glass with their recyclables in the same bin, % of respondents said they would recycle lessthey had to separate their household waste, including glass waste into separate caddies.Mr Doherty added: ldquoMore and more local authorities are seeing the benefits and cost savings achieved by switching to commingling collection services, alongside an ultra-modern Materials Recycling Facilitylike ours that receives, separates and prepares recyclables for productive use where.The Lucid Talk survey was carried out across all of Northern Irelandrsquos  district council

Kielty has called for an end to the segregation of education along religious lines in Northern Ireland.He believes that someone like Good Friday Agreement peace talks chairman George Mitchell could be the man tasked with the job of overhauling the countryrsquos ldquoided schools.At an Ulster University event in Belfast last week focusing on sectarianism, the Dundrum man said the segregated education issue needed to be addressed.He also criticised what he described as the ldquocasual sectarianism and ldquotribalism which characterises parts of society.He continued: ldquoI think we really have to address education, segregated education and I think that as a society we kind of have to start calling out that casual sectarianism.ldquoWhenever we had peace here we thoughtwe move on to a Glaswegian level of sectarianism that is fine, so we only hate each other every week when we go to football. That is not good enough. The tribalism of that is not good enough.The comedian also suggested that the integrated education term was ldquoinsulting.He explained: ldquoAround the rest of the world that is called education. What we have in this country is segregated education.The Dundrum man also paid tribute to the ldquobrilliant work of teachers but said people felt those high standards were enough and did not tackle the underlying ision.ldquoThe natural  of mixing and realising that we are exactly the same and having a school that has got a rugby team and a GAA team, you donrsquot have to go to that schoolyou like GAA. There are just certain things that we really need to have a look at and I am not sure that we are necessarily ready for it.Speaking at the Belfast event, Mr Kielty argued that changing the education system would have to be done by an international figure like former US senator George Mitchell.ldquoOnce we actually get through it we will go, lsquogee why didnrsquot we do that before now rsquo, but it is a dficult one, he conceded, suggesting that social media is contributing to the lack of exposure to dferent views.ldquoYour own opinion is folded back into yourself on the screen every day, he said. ldquoMore than ever, we actually have to put the screen down and make an effort to realise that we are the same.ldquoWe talk too much about dference here. You are either a British person living on the island of Ireland or you are an Irish person who is currently actually in the UK. You are actually a bit of both.Mr Kielty added: ldquoThe minute that we accept that that is going to move in a fluid way, and it is perfectly fine to be a bit of both, that is kind of where we need to be.Meanwhile, the charity which has been working for almost three decades to bridge the gap between starting integrated schools and securing full government support has welcomed Ulster University proposals for a concerted effort in Northern Ireland to eradicate sectarianism.The university, supported by the Sir George Quigley Fund, launched lsquoSectarianism in Northern Ireland: a Reviewrsquo at a conference at the UUrsquos Belfast campus last week.The Integrated Education Fundmdash which was established in  mdash praised the conference for addressing the issue and welcomed Patrick Kieltyrsquos comments that educating all children together is the way forward for a shared future.The review contains more than  proposals for how bodies including government, business, education, youth services, arts and sport could work collectively over a sustained period of time to foster greater collaboration and understanding across communities.As well suggesting that a government department should be established specically to tackle sectarianism, the researchers propose establishing a new civic body to help shape community efforts toward reconciliation.IEF chief executive Tina Merron said the organisation ldquoshares the vision, held by the overwhelming majority of citizens, of a united community and a shared future.Ms Merron said that at the signing of the Good Friday Agreement there were , pupils in  integrated schools, compared with more than , attending  integrated schools today.She said that with no government plan for integrated education, the growth was down to ldquodetermined campaigners and pioneering parents.She added: ldquoWe see a reformed education system as an essential ingredient of this future an education system which brings children, staff and governors from Catholic and Protestant traditions, as well as those of other faiths or none and of other cultures, together in schools, an education system which recognises and respects ersity and ensures that all young people feel confident and welcome in their school environment..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Sinn Fein’s Casey chosen as district’s first citizen  ","story":"SINN Feinrsquos Charlie Casey is Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos new chairman.The Newry politicianrsquos appointment was confirmed at the local authorityrsquos annual meeting on Monday night when he succeeded the SDLPrsquos Mark Murnin as the districtrsquos first citizen.The new council vice-chairman is Rowallane SDLP councillor Terry Andrews, who succeeded Sinn Feinrsquos Oksana McMahon, who represented the Crotlieve area but lost her seat in the recent local government election.The new chairman was presented with his chain of office by his predecessor, who also losthis Slieve Croob seat at the recent election.The new first citizen said he was delighted to be nominated for the position by his party and hoped to do the position justice, urging all councillors to unite to protect services under the threat in the council area, particularly those in relation to the health and welfare of all, in particular, the most vulnerable.Cllr Casey also took time to thank Mr Murnin and Mrs McMahon for their work over the past year and the other councillors who were not ing to the council following the election.Addressing members as chairman for the first time, Cllr Casey urged them to fight for lesaving and le-changing services, champion the cause of equality and take forward the councilrsquos commitment of putting the organisation at the heart of everything it does.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos mission is to lead and serve the district as a prosperous and healthy area and ensure it is sustainable from an economic, environmental and social perspective.

But the men behind the project, Professor Richard Grayson from Goldsmiths, University of London and Belfast historian Jason Burke, say there are thousands more stories to be told.Prof. Richard Grayson. Pic: Ger Holland Photography“This is the coming together of two projects,” Prof Grayson explained. “I wrote a book  years ago about west Belfast called ‘Belfast Boys: How Unionists and Nationalists Fought and Died Together in the First World War’ and then Jason used that methodology to research east Belfast. We were both interested in telling the story of all the people who served in the war from across those parts of the city, but also analysing them academically. The reason for now focussing on the story of just the UVF members is that it is far more complicated than has been handed down in the popular narrative.”Prof Grayson, whose paternal grandparents were from Lurgan, stressed that not all UVF men served in the thDivision and fought at the Somme.“UVF men didn’t only serve in the thDivision, but also the thDivision, regular battalions of the Royal Irish Rles, the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers and the Royal Irish Fusiliers, some English and Scottish regiments, and even one man in the nationalist thDivision,” he said.“This is really just an effort to show that even in the well known group of people who served in the war, the former UVF members, their story is far more complex than just joining the Ulster Division and serving at the Somme.”Belfast historian Jason Burke.Echoing that point, Mr Burke, the historian who led the East Belfast and the Great War research project, said: “In east Belfast the UVF were around , strong at their peak in the summer of  they were one of the strongest UVF regiments in Ulster.

Votes were sorted and veried on Friday ahead of today’s count.Despite the intense focus on Northern Ireland in the Brexit debate, the turnout of .% is down more than % from the  election.It would represent a seismic political shockthe two largest parties in the region - the pro-Brexit DUP and anti-Brexit Sinn Fein - failed to hold their respective seats.The Ulster Unionists could be facing a fight to retain the third seat. Former Stormont minister Danny Kennedy stood as the party’s candidate following the retirement of long-serving MEP Jim Nicholson.The UUP campaigned for Remain in , but the party now advocates for Brexit - insisting the result of the referendum must be respected.Northern Ireland voted % to stay in the EU three years ago, so the pro-European SDLP and Alliance Party are both confident they can wrest the seat from the UUP - a result that would see the regiontwo Remainers and one Leaver.Alliance leader Naomi Long is aiming to build on the momentum of a successful local council election for the party earlier this month, while SDLP leader Colum Eastwood is hoping to win back a seat former leader John Hume held for  years.Sinn Fein’s Martina Anderson topped the poll in  and will be hoping to repeat the feat after what has been a disappointing electoral performance for the republican party south of the border, both at European and council level.The DUP’s Diane Dodds will also be confident of retaining a seat she has held since .Counting is taking place at the Meadowbank Sports Arena in Magherafelt, Co Londonderry. It started a day later than the rest of the UK, due to historic reticence to count on Sundays in Northern Ireland.Other candidates in the race are Green Party leader Clare Bailey, Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister, Conservative Amandeep Bhogal, Ukip’s Robert Hill and independents Neil McCann and Jane Morrice.Major reversal for Sinn Féin in southern elections Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingN.I. bullock on the loose incident resolved say P.S.N.I.Stephen Nolan shocks social media with astonishing weight loss photosMajor delays as lorry loses load on N.I. roadDrink driving collision at lunchtime today -

Ms McDonald gave no hint that she is considering resignation, saying: “It’s easy to lead and to be a political activist when things go your way and when the surge is on. “Those are great days, but you also have to be ready and fit for purpose when things are more challenging.“Notwithstanding our disappointment, Sinn Fein remains a very strong organisation.”Sinn Féin suffered particularly because of a surge to the Green Party.With the southern economy booming, widespread support for Leo Varadkar’s tough stance on Brexit and a series of internal Sinn Féin scandals, the republican party has seen its support dip in the polls over recent years.In last year’s Irish presidential election, Sinn Fein’s vote plummeted to .% – down from .% in .Last night, with  of  first counts in the council elections completed, Sinn Féin’s first preference vote share stood at .% – down from .% in .The party won  seats in the last southern council elections but last night, with more than half of all seats declared, Sinn Fein was still on  councillors.The undisputed story of the election has been the surge of the Green Party, which last night stood on  council seats, up from just three.Sinn Fein has been beset by a series of internal rows – especially in councils – where some former councillors have quit the party over recent years alleging bullying or other inappropriate behaviour by some party colleagues. celebrates being elected after the European Parliamentary elections count at the Guildhall in Southampton.

Today is the Greens’ day. They have surged on this occasion and more power to them. It would be churlish not to acknowledge that and to wish them well... “Sinn Féin aren’t crybabies.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Members of local chapels and churches processed from the Twyn through Dinas Powys passed Tesco at Nica, ending at Bethesda Chapel.Fish and chips sustained around  walkers by the end of the evening.Rev Jon Davis of the Baptist Church and the Revs Carole and Phil Challis of the Methodists led the service with the first hymn, Light of the World. The reading of Markrsquos gospel was by David Cocks.At Nica the hymn lsquoHere is love, vast as the oceanrsquo was sung.The next reading was given by Ciara McAlpine. Finally at Tesco the hymn lsquoWhen I survey the wondrous crossrsquo was sung, with Sarah Long reading.Matt Lewis of Bethesda commissioned the new cross and led the short service at Bethesda.Many thanks go to Councillor John Fanshaw for the loan of the excellent PA system. Everyone was kept safe by the traffic marshal Brian West.The Friends of Belle Vue Park held an Easter celebration of their own.They said: ldquoWe had a fantastic time with crafts, games, seed planting and selfies.ldquoThere were so many amazing Easter hat designs, it was hard to choose!ldquoThanks to all the hard-working volunteers who made the event possibleAs well as events held by churches and chapels, Easter egg hunts were a recurring theme for many venues.Cosmeston Lakes hosted their own hunt over the course of the weekend, inviting people to try their luck at solving clues for prizes.Llantwit Major Surf Lesaving Club held an Easter egg hunt on Easter Monday, with face painting, name the bunny, refreshments and hot drinks.St Fagans National Museum of History held their own ldquoBig Museum Easter Trail, asking visitors to solve clues and follow the trail around the museum infor an ldquoegg-citing prize. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They havenrsquot had any unpleasant encounters.ldquoBut itrsquos inevitable as a person of colour, whether they see something on the news or it happens in a social environment.ldquoBefore it gets to that point they should consciously or subconsciously have enough references to their own self worth in media, be it movies, books, or cartoons to handle it.Mr Banda was spurred into writing by a comment made by Tancho after school. ldquoI donrsquot knowit was a book or a lesson, but Tancho made a very generalised comment ndash he said they have no water in African homes so they have to walk really far.ldquoI told him: lsquoYou know Africa is not a country right  They all have their own experiences the same way Europe is made up of a lot of dferent countries.ldquoIt worried me. Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France.

If these columns hadnrsquot been removed public safety could have been compromised due to the seriousness of the corrosion damage on many of the column heads.Councillor Lis Burnett, who represents Penarth, told the outgoing leader ldquothere has been widespread concern in the town over the removal of these lamp posts and asked for a review of the ldquowisdom and cost effectiveness of replacing the lamp poststo be published. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There is a piece of disused waste groundwe have had it signed over to us. Tullygally PS pupils in a game of Tug of War at Lurgans Centrepoint“Pat will come over and he will introduce his Train B Smart and we can work out of his Hub.“Early intervention is key to get those children knowing the mental and physical well-being is the way forward. That will also have a bigger influence then on the parents and the wider community.”Ms Andrews is mindful that the school pitch is currently unused because of the anti-social behaviour. She is keen that this project moves forward for the sake of the children and the community.“But without the funding, we can’t move forward. The EA has already signed over the pitch and council are working hard to give us the waste ground behind it but without a working Assembly, I am afraid this will be a missed opportunity.Tullygally PS pupils in a game of Tug of War at Lurgans Centrepoint“We need £, to make this project work and start building the Train B Smart Hub at Tullygally Primary School,” she said.But the Hub won’t be just for Tullygally PS, as Pat explains: “The whole idea with Train B Smart is for the local and wider community to be able to participate in multi-sports. That’s the key aim. We know not everybody is going to be an elite athlete, that’s not the point. The point is that everybody can get enjoyment out of it. This is why the children are here. We want them to enjoy sport.”And Pat has the backing of some big names from his former manager Alex Ferguson and team mates Roy Keane and Roy Carroll.Police probe arson attack and suspected gas leak in Craigavon Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Former Manchester United goalkeeper and Wigan Athletic player, Roy Carroll popped into Centrepoint in Lurgan on Thursday to help train some of the pupils.And he was very impressed, spotting potential stars of the future.Former Northern Ireland player Roy is fully behind Pat’s bid for a Train B Smart Hub in Craigavon.He said: “Pat and I used to play football together at Wigan Athletic. I came home about three years ago and Pat asked me to come up and help out and it is always a pleasure to come and work with him again.“I just came here today to give the kids a bit of training. It is great what they are doing.“Sports takes a lot of pressure of kids and that’s what its all about. It takes a lot of pressure of adults as well when they go out on the pitch and play, whatever sport they want to play. “It’s a great release. It’s great what Pat McGibbon is doing here.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sto1.jpg","title":"ni business rates to undergo full review","story":"Posted on Thursday May  by John Mulgrew There will be a full review of Northern Ireland’s business rates system, a top civil servant has revealed. Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary of the Department of Finance, announced the full review into the taxation system for companies here, during a Local Government conference, with Retail NI and law firm DWF, at Titanic Belfast. The reform and re-examination of business rates has been one of the core concerns among the retail and hospitality sectors for the last few years. It’s one of several key business issues which had been kicked down the road due to the ongoing impasse at Stormont. The news has been welcomed by Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster. In a joint statement, the groups said: “Both our organisations are delighted that the Department of Finance have announced this review into non-domestic rates. We have consistently lobbied for this over a number of years and are pleased that our joint call has been heard” “While this is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end. This review provides us with a roadmap for radical change to an antiquated and not fit for purpose system of business rates which is a major burden for our members “In this review we will be outlining signicant changes to rates, including our proposals for a targeted approach to small business rates relief, a revamp of the rates hardship fund, green rates rebate for business who invest in carbon neutral technology and greater relief for new start businesses. “At the last UK Budget, the Chancellor gave independent retailers and hospitality businesses a third off their rate bills in England. We want nothing less than this for our members in Northern Ireland.\" Ms Gray says that \"in recent years signicant changes have taken place in our high streets and town centres. It is critical from a business perspective, as well as a government funding perspective, that our rating system is capable of responding to this wider process of change. That’s why today I am announcing a full and comprehensive review of business rates. “We must create a rating system which generates the funding our public services need while supporting businesses in all sector and enabling economic growth right across Northern Ireland. “In an environment where we are working without ministers, there are limitations to what we can do by way of policy change. But we need to be ready with updated advice for incoming ministers for theirto office. This fundamental review is therefore a critical part of this process.” And Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said: “We wholeheartedly welcome the announcement of this review and it is a credit  the Permanent Secretary’s drive to make positive change. “The fact that retail is % of the economy and pays a quarter of all business rates is simply not sustainable especially give the seismic structural changes going on in the industry. “We have some of the highest business rates in Europe and they are a disincentive to investing in Northern Ireland. We are already playing catch up to the rest of the UK on business rates reform where our businesses pay p in the pound more than the UK average. “This review must look at all aspects of the system. There must be equity in any new system that allows for a widening of the tax base and an audit of the plethora of exemptions some of which have been in place since the s. “If we don’t get business rates right, we risk further shop closures which will  not only cost jobs  but leave a gaping hole in NI finances.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"could a new dawn boost ni business development","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business While Brexit is still upon us, John Simpson says the business sectors finances have proved stronger than predicted and lending could be boosted on the outside as the veil of uncertainty lts The darkest hour comes just before the dawn: an apt reference to the prospects when Brexit is finally taken out of the daily diet of news, concern about business disruption, and foreboding about dficult trading prospects. Brexit is proving to be a slow departure. This year the economy has proved more resilient than many feared. Employment has remained at high levels, jobs for skilled employees are available, and with less certainty personal incomes have been maintained.Political uncertainty and efficient business management are an uneasy mix. In the recent winter and springbusinesses have had to live with an intense series of destabilising influences. For over  years, businesses in Ireland and the UK have grown accustomed to near frictionless EU market conditions. customs duties had disappeared on all internal EU trading. For businesses on this island, the memory of cross-border customs duties had all been but forgotten.   Looking at the lending performances of some of our own banks, the numbers seem to be adding up. In its full year accounts for , Danske Bank posted pre-tax profit of £.m, while new lending rose % and overall business lending increased by %.Across Donegall Square, Ulster Bank saw its income rising from £m to £m during , while profit after impairments stood at £m. There was a % rise in new corporate lending, while small business rose by %.Meanwhile, across the UK as a whole, Barclays has announced a £bn lending fund as part of a series of initiatives to help small and medium-sized businessesto succeed and flourish through Brexit and beyond.Only older colleaguescan remember the perils of railway journeys interrupted by a one hour stop at Goraghwood station, close to Newry, while all passengers were asked by customs officersthey had ‘anything to declare’. More affluent older travellers would more likely recall the cross-border queuing requirement for the predecessor of the ‘green card’ for cars. Today, the challenge is of how to deliver the political agreement that the border on this island should be either frictionless or non-existent as the UK plans to leave the EU. In the new era there will be redefined relations between NI and the Republic, within the framework of UK-EU relations. The important part lies in negotiations on working arrangements that have not yet officially started.For the remaining part of  and going into , the business scene might be described as getting ‘ready for le after Brexit’.In the last three years the business community which forms the core of the private sector in Northern Ireland has been trading successfully.  The evidence from local reviews of the larger profit making businesses has been encouraging. Year-on-year turnover has been increasing faster than inflation and, even more critically, profitability has been maintained and often improved.Work to identy how well locally owned and controlled businesses have performed has been reassuring. To be included in the review of the Top  more profitable Northern Ireland business, which will be published in more detail, the cut-off point has risen to just on £m annual pre-tax profits. In a further reassuring feature and in contrast to the preceding year, during the year  the number of business casualties fell to a very small number.While the overall performance of businesses in the private sector has been better than is sometimes appreciated, there is a mixture of features in the complex matrix of business performance. The evidence is often from personal subjective sources but the elements do point to a consistent pattern. Businesses have been trading, in general, with improved profits but with turnover rather less buoyant. Employment has been increasing, now more slowly, but pay rateshave not fully recovered from the fall in real earnings in the past decade. Interestingly at a regional and national level, changes in wage rates have not shown the boost of an inflationary increase that might have been expected when unemployment levels have fallen to near record lows.Bargaining in the labour market has been restrained, probably influenced by the siren voices of emerging problems as the Brexit withdrawal agreement has dominated the political and economic policy agenda. This points to the emergence of a contrast between the trend in overall business profitability, which has improved, alongside the trend for inidual personal incomes to lag behind the real levels of the past decade. To a modest degree, business profitability may have improved relative to changes in the costs of the payroll.While the scale of the dference should be treated with caution, as business evolves during the rest of , business finance may be better placed to activate improving investment plans.The post-Brexit business scene should be pointing to reduced uncertainty, even with some predictable new business obstacles, and a helpful change in government economic policy to incentivise faster economic expansion. That prospect, alongside a business sector that has a stronger capacity to invest and grow, makes the months ahead more encouraging than many experts expect.In summary, the business sector is understandably anxious to see aof greater business stability and, for a mixture of reasons, may now be more likely to implement more ambitious investment programmes. Add to this combination the possibility that official Government economic policy will be more flexibleand there is a hope that, out of the recent grey clouds of possible recession, there will be incentives leading to a more buoyant economy here.Just one moment of caution: the brightness of a new dawn in  may be dimmedthe political processes constrain the application of improved economic policies through a refreshed local administration. Business has been performing well, despite the huge levels of uncertainty. However, the political environment could drown out an improving economy. That challenge has not changed.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/graham_11.jpg","title":"word from the wise graham lapsley","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by Ulster Business Name: Graham Lapsley, head of private banking, Danske Bank How did you start out in business   Banking has always been in my blood as my father joined Belfast Banking Co Ltdin . As a boy I remember being in Northern Bank branches ‘helping out’ when my father was completing regular evenings doing overtime. This was an environment that I was familiar with, although I didn’t ever think I would make banking a career. In  I found myself in Limavady branch and thoroughly enjoyed branch banking at a time when there were no computers, no autobanks and lots of staff. I’ve benefited from lots of dferent roles at the Bank in my career, each bringing its own challenges. I left my role as head of personal credit last year to take up my current position as head of private banking. What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far On a personal level changing job roles always brought new challenges. Change is a constant which I accept and while I’ve worked in Danske Bank for  years I have had senior roles in branch banking, wealth management, business banking, risk management and now private banking.   As an area manager in branch banking, I found the leadership of the transition from Australian ownership to Danish ownership in  a huge challenge. This change was as exciting as it was challenging as we benefited from huge investment and the Dane’s leading edge technology. I didn’t go directly from school to university, but I’ve been lucky enough to have had employer support to complete a business studies degree and a masters’ degree in executive leadership. I’ve also attended business schools in Boston, Lausanne and London, with each giving me new tools to add into my skill set.  How would you describe your management style  I am energetic and enthusiastic. I love working with our relationship managers and customers to build a financial solution. I am very results oriented and prefer a direct style. I am very self-awareand have a positive outlook.  What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I’m not sure that I would change anything. I’ve learnt from my mistakes and that made me a better banker in the long term. Perhaps my ambition in my early career took me into roles that didn’t match my skill sets, but I did take away vital learnings from these experiences  Have you done it all on your own  Absolutely not. My we Sonya and family have always been a great support and this enabled me to have a good work le balance. I have a strong network personally and professionally, which is mutually supportive. I’ve also been lucky enough to have worked with many leaders who have greatly inspired me.  What’s more important, your product or your people  In Private Banking, without a doubt our people. We are a people business and our strength in Private Banking rests with the professionalism of the private banking team. We offer premium relationship management to our private banking customers, supported by leading edge digital solutions. Our customers value our expertise and the ability to meet up in person to discuss financial plans.  What makes your business stand out from the competition  There are numerous competitors in the marketplace, but we are the biggest private banking relationship management team in Northern Ireland. Danske is also the leading corporate and business bank in Northern Ireland, and many of these customers have their personal needs looked after by my private banking team.  What piece of advice would you give to a  year old you  You’ll never be judged on what happens to you, but you will be judged on how you react to it. And you won’t get the experience you need, until the day after you needed it.

I’ve heard employers bemoan the fact that this generation can’t communicate face-to-face or they place more emphasis on their passions outside of work than their own career development.While some of this is no doubt grounded in their experience, employers perhaps need to adjust how they engage with the new generation beyond just offering them quirky perks and trendy working environments. Hays recently sponsored The GoodIdea, the biggest ever AI hackathon in NI organised by AINIand Hackily – a two-day event hosted by QUB School of Computing and Ulster University Magee campus for around  hackers in Belfast and  in Derry.The hackathon provided a welcoming and collaborative environment for hackers to build out brilliant, innovative, and impactful ideas using AI under a theme of ‘AI for good’, where hackers were challenged to utilise open data sources to create an innovative solution to a real-world problem.It was an opportunity for students – who made up % of the attendees – and experienced professionals to meet fellow hackers, learn new technologies, and work alongside seasoned mentors.Far from being underwhelmed by Generation Z, we were inspired by the talent pools from dferent backgrounds such as computer science, physics and maths, coming together to collaborate with each other, learn about bleeding edge technologies and also to put their skills to use in creating something that was a benefit to society. For example, one of the teams invented an algorithm for a computer to read British sign language using a webcam.These were ambitious, driven, competitive young people who worked brilliantly in their teams and certainly didn’t struggle to communicate, eventhey arrived alone and joined a team. A team from Glasgow made the journey across to take part and the hackathon ran right through Saturday night – so we couldn’t fault their work ethic.There were prizes, mentorship and funding available to the winners of the hackathon, as well as recruitment advice and workshops provided to students and professionals by Hays’ own experts across software development, data engineering and cyber security.But the main attraction was undoubtedly in the opportunity to co-create new ideas about how to apply technology to the world they will run in future. That is hugely positive and our challenge as employers must be to make sure the students who will be the candidates of the future in NI’s thriving tech community are encouraged to put that passion into their careers.The undergraduate community is an under-served community of future leaders in terms of recruitment and our desire is to equip undergraduates with the right understanding of what employers in the tech sector want and how they can build their personal brand for the future.Employers need to get past the myths about Generation Z and focus on helping younger employees find meaning in their workthey are to unlock their potential.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/5g1.jpg","title":"belfast to get superfast g mobile broadband this month","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by John Mulgrew Suzanne Wylie, Belfast City Council with Karen Dundas, EE Victoria Square store manager Belfast is to become one of six UK cities to get superfast G mobile broadband later this month, it has emerged.
