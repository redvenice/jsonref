With a turnout of 53 per cent which amounted to 1.2 million people, nearly 67 per cent voted Yes and over 33 per cent voted No.          Ireland held a referendum on the Eighth Amendment of the country’s constitution on May 25It read: ‘The state acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.’ This gave equal rights to the mother and the unborn, but did not ban abortion.However, in 1992 in what is referred to as Case X, a 14-year-old girl who fell pregnant after being raped claimed to be suicidal and therefore, a risk to her life and the unborn. She was stopped from travelling to Britain for an abortion and the case sparked debate across Ireland.Three separate referendums were held in November of the same year: the 12th Amendment attempted to remove suicide as grounds for abortion, but this was defeated.However, the 13th and 14th Amendments, which meant that women could travel abroad to have terminations and be given information about this, were both passed and added to the constitution.Another referendum was held in 2002, which tried to remove suicide as grounds for abortion, but it was ultimately rejected with over 50 per cent voting No.However, in 2010, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Ireland was violating the European Convention of Human Rights because the rules surrounding what is and isn’t a legal abortion were blurred.          A woman lays flowers next to a mural of Savita Halappanavar in Dublin, as Ireland votes In addition to this, the case of Savita Halappanavar also sparked debate around Ireland and the world watched as the Galway dentist died following complications from a septic miscarriage, after she was denied an abortion.In 2013, the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act was passed which clearly defined what a legal abortion meant. These three scenarios were risk of loss of life from physical illness, risk of loss of life from physical illness in emergency and risk of loss of life from suicide.What is Repeal the 8th?On May 25 2018, Ireland has the opportunity to repeal the country’s abortion law and the Eighth Amendment, to allow the government to legislate terminations.A Yes vote would mean that the text added to the constitution back in 1983 and 1992 would be changed to: ‘Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.’Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Sinn Fein and the Labour Party all support #Repealthe8th. If Ireland votes No, the Eight Amendment will remain.

Parents of children classed as obese are sent warning letters.The figures were compiled by the Local Government Association who warned that children were ‘gaining weight at a drastic rate as they go through schools’.One in ten children were obese in reception, of whom 2.4 per cent were severely obese. Severe obesity is as bad for health as a lifetime of smoking and shortens life expectancy by ten years on average.It puts them at much risk of heart disease, strokes, diabetes and cancer, which in turn place a huge strain on the NHS.

A severely obese boy of the same age and height would weigh almost 9st. The worst rates for severe obesity were in Barking and Dagenham, in east London, where 7.8 per cent of children leaving primary school were in the most dangerous weight category last year. They are only slightly better in Southwark, south London, at 7.2 per cent and in Wolverhampton at 7 per cent. But the rates are just 1.5 per cent in Wokingham, Berkshire, and 1.6 per cent in Tunbridge Wells in Kent.Izzi Seccombe, of the Local Government Association, said: ‘Unless we tackle this obesity crisis, today’s obese children will become tomorrow’s obese adults whose years of healthy life will be shortened by a whole host of health problems.’Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said the figures were ‘an indictment on successive Whitehall governments’, adding: ‘For decades they have failed to take the action required to help our children from becoming so unhealthily fat.’Professor Russell Viner, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: ‘Preventing children becoming overweight and obese is vital if we’re to stand any chance of beating the obesity epidemic. Not only does obesity have a high health cost for iniduals, it also has huge cost implications for the NHS.’A government scheme in 2014 spent £450million on providing healthy lunches for young children. It was scrapped last year and replaced with a programme giving free breakfasts in disadvantaged schools. Since 2013 schools have been given a ‘Sports Premium’ to improve PE lessons.The Government is due to announce a new childhood obesity strategy within weeks.A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘We have not ruled out further action if the right results are not seen.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/29/00/4CB6569000000578-5780735-Kishan_Takahashi_pictured_with_dog_Bonnie_who_had_treatment_for_-a-14_1527549037371.jpg","title":"Magical healers cured pets vets written off","story":"    Thomas the cat pictured with Clyde Hughes who also treated Dylan the dog.

He had to have an urgent operation and remained at the vet’s for five days.’Two years later it happened again, spontaneously. ‘The vet told us it would probably keep happening — there was obviously an underlying problem. Each time we were looking at £3,000 for an operation plus £1,000 for physio. The insurance wouldn’t pay out because it was a pre-existing condition.More importantly, could we keep putting Dylan through all that? The pain and surgery?‘The vet said we should consider putting him to sleep. It was an awful, awful time. Dylan’s so cheeky, extremely loyal, and losing him was unthinkable.’It was then that Nicci recalled how a friend’s Alsatian had been helped by a healer called Clyde Hughes.‘I wasn’t convinced — we were talking about a dog needing major spinal surgery — but my partner, Phil, said “What have we got to lose?”’ By the time they got to the clinic, Dylan had deteriorated. ‘He was looking at me as if to say, “Mum, give me a break!” and lying on the floor, unable to move. It was unbearable. ‘Clyde put a crystal either side of Dylan and ran a ining rod — like a wooden wand — over him. He put his hands on Dylan, saying there was a blockage in his energy in his back and he was channelling lots of good energy.

Minutes after the pair had sat down at the coffee shop, the manager called the police and had Robinson and Nelson arrested.\u0027It was a reprehensible situation that we took complete ownership of,\u0027 Shultz said of the incident, that he called \u0027embarrassing\u0027 and \u0027horrifying.\u0027The CEO said that the company had decided to use the experience as an opportunity to improve their training. \u0027I think we\u0027re living in a time in America where there is a fracturing of humanity,\u0027 he continued.          Starbucks will close 8,000 stores for training after the incident at this Center City Starbucks, in Philadelphia (pictured early Tuesday morning) where staff called the cops on two black men who were waiting for their friend          The Starbucks website shows that stores across New York City will all shut down at 2.30pm for training \u0027We have an opportunity given the fact that we have stores in every community in America to begin a very important conversation. We\u0027ve been in business for almost 50 years. This is probably one of the most important transformational moments in the history of our company.\u0027Schultz explained that the training would aim to teach people about unconscious bias against race, ethnic background, sexual orientation, or class, and would train staff to address customers with empathy and compassion.  \u0027We want to be a welcoming environment to everybody regardless of their position in life,\u0027 he said. The company says their training afternoon will cost them $12million in lost revenue, according to USA Today. But many have questioned how much can be achieved within just four hours, with several branding it a \u0027publicity stunt\u0027.However, not everyone was against the move, with some praising it as a step in the right direction.The plan has brought attention to the little-known world of \u0027unconscious bias training\u0027 used by corporations, police departments and other organizations.           Reaction to the training has been mixed, with some branding it a PR stunt, and others praising it as a step in the right direction It\u0027s designed to get people to open up about implicit biases and stereotypes in encountering people of color, gender or other identities.A video previewing the training says it will include recorded remarks from Starbucks executives, including CEO Kevin Johnson and Executive Chairman Howard Schultz, as well as rapper and activist Common.  From there, the company says, its 175,000 employees in the U.S. will \u0027move into a real and honest exploration of bias.\u0027 Starbucks will also be opening stores in areas of poverty, and had hired 100,000 staff members from Opportunity Youth - a scheme which works to improve the lives of impoverished, abused and neglected youth. The training session may help to restore Starbucks\u0027 tarnished image after video of the the two black customers being arrested went viral and caused a huge backlash towards the company, prompting CEO Kevin Johnson to fly to Philadelphia to personally apologize to both men.The manager who called police was also fired.Nelson and Robinson settled with Starbucks this month for an undisclosed sum and an offer of a free education. They also reached a deal with the city of Philadelphia for a symbolic $1 each and a promise from officials to establish a $200,000 program for young entrepreneurs.   Donte Robinson (right) and his friend Rashon Nelson (left), both 23, had been waiting for a potential business partner to discuss real estate development when one of the men asked to use the bathroom and was knocked back             The viral video sparked angry protests and calls for a boycott of Starbucks last month. (Protesters are seen outside a Philadelphia Starbucks where two black men were arrested)Starbucks worked with the Perception Institute, a consortium of researchers, to create their training to tackle implicit bias.It defines implicit bias as attitudes - positive or negative - or stereotypes someone has toward a person or group without being conscious of it. A common example, according to some of its studies, is a tendency for white people to unknowingly associate black people with criminal behavior.Many retailers including Walmart and Target said they already offer some racial bias training. Target says it plans to expand that training. Nordstrom has said it plans to enhance its training after issuing an apology to three black teenagers in Missouri who employees falsely accused of shoplifting.According to a video previewing the Starbucks training, there will be recorded remarks from Starbucks executives and rapperactivist Common. From there, employees will \u0027move into a real and honest exploration of bias\u0027 where, in small groups, they can share how the issue comes up in their daily work life.Starbucks has described it as a \u0027collaborative and engaging experience for store partners to learn together.\u0027Developed with feedback from the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, the Perception Institute and other social advocacy groups, Tuesday\u0027s four-hour session will give workers a primer on the history of civil rights from the 1960s to present day.Workers will also view a short documentary film.Alexis McGill Johnson, Perception\u0027s co-founder and executive director, says anti-bias training is about awareness.\u0027The work that we want to do is not say you\u0027re a bad person because you have a stereotype about a group, but say this is why your brain may have these stereotypes,\u0027 she said.Johnson declined to elaborate on the details of the Starbucks training. But she said Perception\u0027s workshops typically include mental exercises to show participants how bias creeps into situations. A session can include personal reflections, she said, such as, \u0027I was socialized to think about a group this way.\u0027Johnson said the real work is for employees to apply what they learn in their everyday lives. She likened it to exercising a muscle. Some ways to practice counter-stereotyping, she said, are to look for something unique about a person that is beyond their social identity.\u0027It could be having a question that elicits something more interesting than, say, the weather or the traffic,\u0027 Johnson said, stressing the need to \u0027go well beyond the superficial.\u0027Starbucks said the arrests never should have occurred and announced the mass closures of its stores for the afternoon of training.Calvin Lai, an assistant professor of psychological and brain sciences at Washington University in St. Louis, said people should not place high expectations on this one day.      According to a video previewing the Starbucks training, there will be recorded remarks from Starbucks executives and rapperactivist Common            Johnson, the company\u0027s president and CEO, is also featured on the training video            Howard Schultz, the company\u0027s founder and chairman, also appears in the video\u0027We find that oftentimes ersity training has mixed effects, and in some cases it can even backfire and lead people who are kind of already reactive to these issues to become even more polarized,\u0027 Lai said. One afternoon wouldn\u0027t really be \u0027moving the needle on the biases,\u0027 especially when it\u0027s a company with as many employees as Starbucks, he said. \u0027A lot of those employees won\u0027t be here next year or two years or three years down the line.\u0027Starbucks has said Tuesday\u0027s sessions serve as \u0027a step in a long-term journey to make Starbucks even more welcoming and safe for all.\u0027 It is working with volunteer advisers including Heather McGhee, president of social advocacy organization Demos, and Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.\u0027One of the things Starbucks has to wrestle with is how to incorporate this kind of training into the onboarding of every employee,\u0027 Ifill said.That takes a sustained effort, McGhee added.\u0027We have really made it clear that one training is not enough, and this needs to be part of an ongoing review of their policies,\u0027 McGhee said. \u0027They really need to commit.\u0027  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/28/19/4CB550BF00000578-0-image-a-20_1527531611678.jpg","title":"Wales country UK ban smoking outside","story":"Smoking is set to be banned in hospital grounds under the Welsh Government\u0027s banThousands of teenagers are left stranded after Buckfast...Winston Churchill\u0027s half-smoked Cuban cigar left in an...Share this articleWhile most hospitals already have no smoking policies in their grounds, it is currently difficult for staff to enforce this. The changes will make it illegal to smoke in the hospital grounds, with legal backing for fines for smokers breaking the rules, \u0027therefore improving the environment for patients, visitors and staff,\u0027 says the government. Smoking contributes most to the current burden of disease in Wales, causing approximately 5,450 deaths each year and costing the NHS an estimated £302m annually."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/28/14/4CB1BBDB00000578-0-image-m-67_1527512677485.jpg","title":"Home Office make U turn deporting Afghan teachers family","story":"    Customers at the east Oxford Co-op where Hassan Bamyani, 49, works have helped keep his wife and child in the UK after a massive campaign involving hundreds of shoppersThey were reunited and granted a visa extension in 2014 -

The Ayn Foundation – which currently boasts Andy Warhol’s The Last Supper – opened in Marfa in 1993, and art galleries like IndeJacobs and Rule Gallery, as well as design boutique Wrong Marfa, are all set up in Marfa. So is a landmark fake Prada boutique on the roadside, which is an artwork by Elmgreen \u0026amp Dragset from 2005.Just last year saw the small town of 2,000 people host Solange Knowles at a concert for Judd’s Chianti Foundation.Next up, Marfa will see a new solar powered Stonehenge project by British artist Haroon Mirza. The piece, entitled Stone Circle, is a set of black marble-like rocks in the Texas desert until 2023 (but potentially indefinitely). Every full moon, there will be a musical concert and light show in what Mirza calls “solar symphonies”, with the first one held on 28 June.“On full moons, the stones will start to play composed electrical signals, which will be quite musical,” said Mirza over the phone from his London studio. “You will hear the electricity as sound.”The stone pieces stand in a circle, like the ancient Stonehenge or the famed Nine Ladies site in Derbyshire. Set in the high desert, eight chunks of marble will sit in a circle with the ninth as the “mother stone”, charging the circle through a bank of batteries underground. “You see the electrical current as light and you hear it as sound,” said Mirza.The stones are made of marble shipped from Mexico, which light up at night. “During the day, they look like quartz crystals, but at night they glow with electricity,” he said.Mirza, who is the winner of the Silver Lion for Most Promising artist at the 54th Venice Biennale in 2011, has made solar-powered artworks in the past, like wall-works which generate sound from electricity, including Duet for a Duo (Solar Symphony 7) from 2015. He recalls his first mystified experience with the Stonehenge as he drove past it decades ago. “I remember thinking it was an alien thing, like a UFO landing,” he said. “It has an incredible aura to it, from a distance and up close.” It wasn’t about replicating the Stonehenge, but presenting a new experience. “The feeling of being at the Stone Circle is a sense of commune with nature,” said Mirza. This artwork is more than just a journey out into the desert, as it also promotes solar power in the south. Freedom Solar, the Austin-based solar panel company, donated half of the solar panels for the project. They’re also offering a rebate for new solar customers referred through the gallery which is presenting this project, Ballroom Marfa. (Freedom Solar also offers local workshops for west Texans wanting to switch to solar power at home and at work.) Surprisingly, it’s working. “When I first visited Marfa, I didn’t see one solar panel anywhere, which I thought was surprising because there is a lot of sun,” said Mirza. “There is controversy around it, but there is potential for solar energy in that part of Texas and people have started installing solar panels, which is a positive move.”“It’s a no brainer, actually,” he adds. “If you live in a climate like that, it makes a massive difference.” The project was no easy feat, as Stone Circle took five years to materialize, and it didn’t help that the marble was stuck at the Mexican border for nine months. “I thought it was going to be easy, but it was complicated and expensive,” said Mirza. “Sometimes it’s better to be naive and have ambition and think big.” For the first full moon gathering, the marble ‘stones’ will light up and play sounds that call to mind electronic music. “I’ve composed the electrical signals,” said Mirza. “It depends what you regard as music.” Even though the Stonehenge was used as a site for worship, there will be no sacrificial lambs. “People are perceiving and preaching it as a spiritual gathering, but I don’t have an intention of it being a spiritual thing,” said Mirza."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31efb6b8926d9e0735f7622f3027c14439935987/0_0_5488_3293/master/5488.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df8cc596d1a1ab152e065930e7fc1a12","title":"westminster abbey weston tower ptolemy dean gallery","story":"The Weston Tower, a sci-fi-style wonder by Ptolemy Dean, opens up a hidden gallery above the nave where William and Kate’s wedding certificate is likely to draw crowdsNestled into an armpit of Westminster Abbey, hidden behind a flying buttress that leaps up to the chapterhouse, stands what appears to be a gothic space rocket. Sinuous bronze tracery loops its way up the faceted shaft, framing crystalline windows between bands of lead arrowheads, like go-faster stripes shooting towards the heavens.“We’ve had enormous fun doing this,” says architect Ptolemy Dean, surveyor to the fabric of the abbey since 2012. “It’s not every day you get to add a new tower to Westminster Abbey.”Dean’s curious Weston Tower is the most significant addition to the building since Nicholas Hawksmoor’s west towers were completed in 1745. It has been deftly inserted in a south-eastern corner, between the 13th-century chapter house and the 16th-century Lady Chapel, to provide the public with access to the triforium for the first time, a hidden timber deck that snakes its way around the rafters, seven storeys above the nave. After five years and a combined project expenditure of £22.9m (privately fundraised), this atmospheric attic has been reborn as the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Galleries, stuffed with regal and religious treasures dating from across the abbey’s thousand-year history.Dean, whose first project at the abbey was wittily disguising a waste compactor in the form of a green timber taxi drivers’ shelter, has clearly had a great time developing his tower design. He has raided the back-catalogues of architectural history with promiscuous relish, sampling from the abbey’s many different layers to concoct a ripe confection of his own.An intersecting rotated square motif, found in the Henry VII Chapel, provides the basis for the star-shaped plan of the tower, which has been glazed with leaded windows, based on Christopher Wren’s late 17th-century additions to the abbey. The arrow detail of the leading and the elaborate crown rooftop are both inspired by Ely cathedral, while the looping bronze tracery over the windows is a nod to Isambard Kingdom Brunel’s trainshed at Paddington Station.The result is less pastiche than an energetic collage of bits and bobs. It could have been a gaudy eyeful, but the resulting sci-fi gothic lantern is somehow in keeping with the general riot of competing ornamentation with which the abbey is encrusted. Endlessly extended and remodelled over the centuries, the complex is not the result of a single hand: it is a patchwork of accretions in various versions of gothic. Dean’s Weston stair tower is simply the latest intriguing layer.The history lesson continues inside, where a stepped corner of the abbey’s ancient raft foundation has been revealed, built from 11th-century blocks of stone from Caen in France. The discovery was the architect’s cue to take visitors on a geological journey: he has wrapped his new lift shaft with 16 different kinds of stone sampled from the abbey’s history, laid in alternating bands. There’s pinkish Purbeck marble seething with fossils white Portland stone left with tooling marks as Hawksmoor used it hard grey Kentish ragstone Yorkshire magnesian limestone and even Reigate stone, of the kind used in the original west front from 1243. “No one has used Reigate in London for hundreds of years,” Dean claims. “We had to reopen a quarry in a corner of the M25.” He sadly refrained from adding a final layer of concrete breeze blocks at the top, in reference to the 1950s lavatory block that used to occupy the site of the tower.Visitors will spiral around this great mineral totem pole as they climb the new oak stairs, catching views across to the stained glass windows and carved stone details of the abbey, never before seen up close. Once at the top, the triforium galleries themselves open out as an enticing world of ancient oak beams crisscrossing their way around the attic, where exhibits have been beautifully spotlit in mercifully minimalist vitrines by museum design experts Muma (McInnes Usher McKnight Architects), the firm responsible for the V\u0026ampA’s medieval and Renaissance galleries and Manchester’s Whitworth Art Gallery revamp.Dean’s whimsy is all very well for the Weston Tower, but in the galleries, the cool, restrained hand of Muma allows the 300 precious artefacts to sing. Simple plinths of Purbeck stone appear to hover slightly off the floor, while seamless glass cases rise flush from the bases, containing everything from Wren’s 2.4-metre high model of his (unrealised) tower design, to the eerie funeral effigies of English kings and queens that were once paraded through the streets to the abbey. One jaw-dropping highlight is the elaborate concertina paper model of the interior of the abbey, made for the coronation of Queen Victoria in the 1830s, a kind of “peep show” designed to allow a wider audience to appreciate the spectacle of the ceremony. From the sublime to the prosaic, the artefact likely to draw the biggest crowds is apparently the wedding certificate of William and Kate.The designers’ greatest triumph is allowing natural light to flood in without the possibility of damaging any of the priceless pieces on show. They carefully modelled all the sunbeam paths so that no sensitive objects would ever be touched by direct light, ensuring that none of the elaborately carved windows that ring the edge of the triforium would have to be blocked up. It would have been so easy just to make it a black box, but the presence of shafts of sunlight streaming in through the tracery is what makes this such an atmospheric place. It gives you the feeling of exploring a secret realm, formerly only inhabited by gargoyles, pigeons and the ghosts of dead royals – who now feel more present than ever."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fddb34eb9814f2dd8c10bb77ab1b344a6ec26350/6_0_1908_1145/master/1908.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf7ad570a8186c151b5be12495dda7a0","title":"brexit vote uk economy may verdict","story":"Each month we look at key indicators to see what effect the Brexit process has on growth, prosperity and trade• ‘Brexit is a disaster’ – experts debate the latest economic data• UK economy feels chill from spectre of disorderly BrexitThanks to a drop in imports of ships and aircraft from non-EU countries, Britain’s trade deficit narrowed in March.

While that showed some progress, it was below the consensus estimate of 53.7 predicted by City economists on a gauge where 50 splits the difference between growth and contraction.Philip Hammond was handed good news from the government borrowing figures in the first month of the new financial year, as the budget deficit for April came in well below forecasts, boosted by stronger tax receipts and reduced spending. The figures showed public sector net borrowing, excluding state-owned banks, was £7.8bn last month, versus an estimate of £8.6bn. The government’s annual spending shortfall for the last financial year to the end of March was also revised down by almost £2bn to £40.5bn, with the figures raising the prospect of the chancellor moving to loosen the purse strings at the budget later this year. Uncertainty triggered by Brexit, coupled with tax changes and consumers coming under pressure from inflation and weak wage growth have played havoc with the housing market since the referendum. Over the past month, the closely watched Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) gauge of house prices dropped to the lowest level since 2012. The index, which measures the balance of surveyors expecting price rises fell to -8 in April from zero in March. That was worse than a Reuters poll of economists for a reading of -1.

It is expected to publish its campaign manifesto on 8 June.Soros, 87, said: “Brexit is an immensely damaging process, harmful to both sides ... Divorce will be a long process, probably taking more than five years. Five years is an eternity in politics, especially in revolutionary times like the present.“Ultimately, it’s up to the British people to decide what they want to do. It would be better however if they came to a decision sooner rather than later. That’s the goal of an initiative called the Best for Britain, which I support.“Best for Britain fought for, and helped to win, a meaningful parliamentary vote which includes the option of not leaving at all. This would be good for Britain but would also render Europe a great service by rescinding Brexit and not creating a hard-to-fill hole in the European budget.“But the British public must express its support by a convincing margin in order to be taken seriously by Europe. That’s what Best for Britain is aiming for by engaging the electorate. It will publish its manifesto in the next few days.”Soros said he feared the EU could be heading towards another major financial crisis triggered by austerity and populist political parties intent on blowing the bloc apart.Sounding the alarm as financial markets fell into turmoil on Tuesday amid a deepening political crisis in Italy, Soros said the EU had lost its way since the 2008 banking crash and required radical transformation in order to survive.“The EU is in an existential crisis. Everything that could go wrong has gone wrong,” he said.However, Soros said he was convinced it was the ideal time for the EU to reform itself and prepare the ground for the UK staying inside the bloc.“The economic case for remaining a member of the EU is strong, but it will take time for it to sink in,” Soros said. “During that time the EU needs to transform itself into an association that countries like Britain would want to join, in order to strengthen the political case.“Such a Europe would differ from the current arrangements in two key respects. First, it would clearly distinguish between the European Union and the eurozone. Second, it would recognise that the euro has many unresolved problems and they must not be allowed to destroy the European Union.”Italian bonds dropped sharply on Tuesday, pushing the country’s borrowing costs to the highest levels in more than four years as concerns grew that the EU’s third-largest economy could exit the single currency. Sergio Mattarella, the country’s president, vetoed the appointment of a Eurosceptic as finance minister over the weekend, laying the ground for fresh elections later this year.Hungarian-born Soros said an “addiction to austerity” at the heart of Europe was harming economic development, which had in turn been exploited by populist politicians to stoke anti-EU support.The UK could sign up to all the EU’s rules and regulations, staying in the single market – which provides free movement of goods, services and people – and the customs union, in which EU members agree tariffs on external states. Freedom of movement would continue and the UK would keep paying into the Brussels pot. We would continue to have unfettered access to EU trade, but the pledge to “take back control” of laws, borders and money\u0026nbspwould not have been fulfilled. This\u0026nbspis an unlikely outcome and one that may be possible only by reversing the Brexit decision, after a second referendum or election.Britain could follow Norway, which is in the single market, is subject to freedom of movement rules and pays a fee to Brussels – but is outside the customs union. That combination would tie Britain to EU regulations but allow it to sign trade deals of its own. A “Norway-minus” deal is more likely. That would see the UK leave the single market and customs union and end free movement of people. But Britain would align its rules and regulations with Brussels, hoping this would allow a greater degree of market access. The UK would still be subject to EU rules.A comprehensive trade deal like the one handed to Canada would help British traders, as it would lower or eliminate tariffs. But there would be little on offer for the UK services industry. It is a bad outcome for financial services. Such a deal would leave Britain free to erge from EU rules and regulations but that in turn would lead to border checks and the rise of other “non-tariff barriers” to trade. It would leave Britain free to forge new trade deals with other nations. Many in Brussels see this as a likely outcome, based on Theresa May’s direction so far.Britain leaves with no trade deal, meaning that all trade is governed by World Trade Organization rules. Tariffs would be high, queues at the border long and the Irish border issue severe. In the short term, British aircraft might be unable to fly to some European destinations. The UK would quickly need to establish bilateral agreements to deal with the consequences, but the country would be free to take whatever future direction it wishes. It may need to deregulate to attract international business – a very different future and a lot of disruption.Soros said there were still steps that could be taken to make the EU more appealing to ordinary voters who had been let down by Brussels since 2008. Calling for an EU-funded Marshall-style plan for Africa worth about €30bn (£26bn) a year, he said migratory pressures across Europe could be relieved by helping developing nations. He called for the EU to abandon rules requiring member states to join the euro, lest they eventually combine with other EU rules to “destroy” the project altogether.Echoing a call made by David Cameron before the Brexit vote, he argued for the EU to allow member states to pursue “multi-track” relations with the bloc, rather than “ever closer union”. “Europe needs to do something drastic in order to survive its existential crisis. Simply put, the EU needs to reinvent itself,” he said.This year, Soros moved to defy his critics over his £400,000 donation to Best for Britain by pledging an additional £100,000 to support efforts to fight Brexit. OSF’s total funding for pro-Europe campaigns and organisations is now at more than £800,000."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4114f77facaf6e59758fd15a71b13caf3e650c08/0_143_4368_2620/master/4368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47da49cae16baed8b8bb93fe21afdedc","title":"john lewis revamp brent cross expansion london","story":"Retailer signs new lease as north London shopping centre plans to double in sizeJohn Lewis will rejuvenate its 40-year-old department store in London’s Brent Cross as part of a £1.4bn redevelopment of the shopping centre. Brent Cross, which opened in north London in 1976, will double in size to include 150 new shops, 50 new restaurants and other leisure businesses including a luxury cinema.John Lewis has signed a new lease as part of the development, which comes despite difficulties on the high street leading to the closure of hundreds of stores as shoppers shift to buying online. A net 1,700 chain stores closed their doors in the top 500 towns and shopping centres last year, according the Local Data Company – the worst figures since 2010. The pain has continued this year, with New Look, Mothercare, Carpetright and House of Fraser planning to implement, or already implementing, mass closures.As shoppers trim the time they spend in physical shops, the big destination malls, such as Brent Cross, Westfield in west and east London and the Trafford Centre in Manchester are bucking the trend because of the breadth of choice they offer in one location.Westfield in White City is opening a massive extension that includes 90 new shops, restaurants and leisure outlets, including a John Lewis, a bowling hall, fitness centre, cinema and bars.Brent Cross is expanding because it is struggling to cope with the level of demand in its stores. It also needs to introduce more leisure activities to appeal to younger people who want fun experiences – from crazy golf to pop-up markets and street food stalls – alongside shops. Tim Harrison, director of store design and development at John Lewis, said: “We’re delighted to have signed a new lease with Hammerson and Aberdeen Standard Investments and are excited to be embarking on a full refurbishment of our Brent Cross shop. Our plans will allow us to showcase our latest thinking in shop design, creating a more modern space for shoppers with customer experience at its heart.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9527e20aa0f4e3105c860042322588cdbebc884c/0_17_4724_2834/master/4724.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c42f850c5ef8e29dd29540a2c86d87d8","title":"mother of all rivers volga russia kazan samara volgograd","story":"The World Cup will be the first time most westerners will be exposed to the great cities of the Volga – and their tense tug-of-war over identityby  Andrew Roth, Moscow correspondent. All photographs by Dmitri Beliakov for the The World Cup will be the first time most westerners will be exposed to the great cities of the Volga – and their tense tug-of-war over identityby  Andrew Roth, Moscow correspondent. All photographs by Dmitri Beliakov for the The Alexander Nevsky is a dingy time machine that bears 196 passengers – war veterans bound for the city formerly known as Stalingrad side by side with boozy weekenders – down the Volga river like a floating Soviet sanatorium.It was built in East Germany in 1957 by the shipbuilders of Wismar, who sent 49 comfort-class riverboats to their new brothers across the Soviet bloc.Not much on board has changed since.Crooners belt out Soviet ballads and pensioners sun themselves on flimsy deckchairs. The cheaper cabins below deck show their years, smelling of musk and occasionally varnish, with chipped, frosted glass on the cabin doors. When the nights are cold, passengers wrapped in woollen blankets walk in circles from bow to stern to bow again, as barges with salt and timber pass in the dark.“Not everyone can handle travel like this in a closed space,” said Viktor Chekhovskikh, a passenger and former sailor who has captained Volga riverboats himself for 25 years, and who passes the days in his private cabin building custom model ships – of Imperial Russian Navy vessels, or the tankers he sailed on in the Black Sea in his youth.Many of its sister ships have long since been retired, but each summer the Nevsky plies the 2,193 miles of the great river. Crooked like an elbow, the Volga passes from the Valdai hills near Moscow down to Astrakhan by the Caspian Sea.Four of the 11 host cities for this summer’s World Cup sit on this river. For many foreigners, the world’s biggest football event will also mark their first interaction with these erse Volga cities, far from the touristy streets of Moscow and St Petersburg.Nizhny Novgorod, once called Gorky and closed to foreigners, and the second world war “hero city” of Volgograd – formerly Stalingrad – will host England matches. Games will also be played in the Tatar capital of Kazan and in Samara, the aeronautics hub that produced jet fighters and space rockets.Russia’s answer to the Mississippi, the Volga ties them all together – a thread through the Povolzhye region that for decades has drawn artists and explorers in search of an authentic Russia among its farmers and barge-haulers. Last month it drew myself and the photographer Dmitri Beliakov, who joined me on a boat down the river, in pursuit of a similar goal. Moscow and St Petersburg have embraced globalised tastes and careful urban planning, but what of Russia’s other cities – the heartland?“Every Russian man should sail the Volga at least once in his life,” Margarita Petrovna, a prim blockade survivor in a cardigan, said over a dinner of spaghetti and stewed beef in the Nevsky’s dining hall.The Volga was old Rus’s frontier with the Tatar east. Centuries later, the Soviets harnessed the river for the country’s postwar industrialisation through a cascade of dams. Tolstoy wrote fairytales about the river, and Chekhov took a river cruise for his honeymoon.Joseph Roth, the Austrian-Jewish novelist and journalist, observed in 1926 how the farmers who stormed first class after the Bolshevik revolution found it awkward and eventually returned to steerage by choice. In the end, Roth also jumped ship and joined barge haulers on a ferry instead.I too was sailing in coach, on the lower deck, more or less the lowest class there is. The ship was due to arrive on Victory Day, which commemorates the surrender of Nazi Germany.We set sail from Kazan at dusk, the ship’s loudspeakers playing Farewell of Slavyanka, a military march. In the distance, the white and azure minarets of the Qol Sharif mosque jumped out of the gloom.More than 500 years ago, Kazan was the capital of a Muslim khanate that rivalled Moscow for influence. Anthony Jenkinson, the explorer and first English envoy to Russia, arrived in the city just six years after it had been conquered by Ivan the Terrible in 1552, bearing letters of introduction from the tsar.The tug-of-war over religious and ethnic identity continues in Kazan to this day. The state promotes an official, loyalist Islam, watched over by a religious committee. Moscow has pushed Kazan to scale back Tatar-language classes in school, which causes the local activists to bristle, though they carefully avoid open conflict.“It isn’t about plotting a course against Russia, but fighting against inertia, fighting for our culture as an equal,” said Rozalina Shageeva, an art historian and poet who writes in Russian and Tatar. “Without our language, who are we as a people?”The neighbourhood of Old-Tatar Sloboda, where Tatars settled in the 16th century after being expelled from the inner city, is more museum than living city these days. At its centre is the Märcani mosque, which has benefited from the state’s largesse ever since Catherine the Great approved its construction in 1766, breaking two centuries of tradition. It was the city’s first stone mosque, and the only one to remain open under the Soviet Union.The imam, Mansur Hazrat Dzhalyaletdin, and I strolled through the cavernous mosque – the banquet halls, the kindergarten where children recite Qur’an verses from memory, the bridal shop with modest dresses decorated with lace flowers. A vacation brochure for nearby Kazan Halal City includes an Islamic college, a travel agency, a hotel complex, a souvenir shop and an apiary in the forest.For Dzhalyaletdin, the link between religion and the state is innate – a partnership illustrated by the pictures of Vladimir Putin and other officials on his sitting room wall.“Yes, the constitution says that religion is separate from the state, but our people are believers,” he said. During communism, he said, the people had faith in the party. When that disappeared, their faith brought them to the mosques. “How can you separate the people from their government? It’s forbidden.”Across town, the Mirgaziyan mosque has a more bitter history: it was seized by police in 2013 after extremism charges were brought against a former imam. The mosque was built from a Soviet boiler room and its minaret was fashioned from a 72ft brick chimney. Its founder, Mirgaziyan Salavatov, chose the site after his dead wife appeared to him in a dream and repeated “111” until he awoke. He interpreted that as the street address where he should establish the mosque, which he called Al-Ikhlas, or The Purity. It opened in 2004.The current imam, Azgar Hazrat Valiullin, grew up poor in rural Tatarstan, and had always worked with his hands. He was the one who repaired the minaret, climbing the 22 metres and cementing down the loose bricks in two rows. He was there one Friday in 2006 when Salavatov came to him and asked him to “safeguard the mosque”. The next day, he said, Salavatov died of a stroke. In 2013, control of the mosque was transferred to the state. Law enforcement accused a dozen congregants of ties to Hizb-ut-Tahrir, a Sunni political movement that has called for an Islamic caliphate. The movement is banned in Russia. Its supporters say they are peaceful.The mosque was condemned as unsafe and the brick minaret torn down. It was rebuilt under a different name.Valiullin, who has a white tufted goatee and wears a velvet-blue taqiyah, shakes his head when he recalls the arrests. He denies links to the banned movement, and says he believes some of the young men were mistreated in prison.As to the minaret, he sighed, “They tore it down for nothing.”The Alexander Nevsky sailed through the night and arrived at the dam by Zhiguli the next day. It is one of eight hydroelectric works in the Volga cascade systems, which stretch from the city of Dubna, north of Moscow, all the way down to Volgograd. For a few years after 1961, the Volga hydroelectric station was the largest in the world.The journalist Bruce Chatwin, who sailed down the river with German veterans and war widows in 1982 for the Observer, wrote that the dams had “turned this Mother-of-all-the-Rivers into a chain of sluggish inland seas the colour of molasses”.But inside the great locks, there is a majestic moment as the metal doors part to reveal hills dotted with fir and pine or a fading riverside village, like a snapshot framed in rust. On one of the lock walls someone has etched: “We won’t forget you. Petya Savkin ...” There’s more written but it has been erased by the daily rise and fall of the waters.Yelena Sedykh, 62, pointed toward the dacha in a sunlit valley just across the Volga from Samara. It brought up memories of her son, she said, who died a decade earlier of cancer. She prefers to spend weekends at the dacha with her husband and daughter now, but decided on a weekend trip just to “get away from everything”.In Samara’s heyday, which passed a century ago, local merchants made it rich on the city’s grain commodity exchange and the city’s growth rate was compared to Chicago’s. The newly rich built themselves ornate wooden houses and art nouveau mansions with asymmetrical facades and butterfly ornaments, a break from the concrete monotony in most post-Soviet cities. During the second world war, Samara – then known as Kuybishev after a Soviet revolutionary – briefly hosted the Soviet government and foreign embassies as the alternate capital to Moscow. After the war, the city closed itself off to foreigners as a base for aerospace production.The city has about 140 blocks downtown with historical wooden or wood-and-brick buildings, said Andrey Kotchetkov, a local journalist and activist. As interest from developers for valuable downtown real estate has increased, so have grassroots attempts to stop the wooden houses from being condemned or burned to the ground in arson attacks.“People don’t understand what a valuable thing it is,” Kotchetkov said during a tour through the city. “They talk about Europe but don’t realize what they have around them.”Kotchetkov founded the Tom Sawyer Fest, a yearly volunteer festival to restore blighted houses. It’s only in its fourth year, but the movement has snowballed into prominence. One rule? Politicians can’t use it as a photo op. That evening the sun set over the Volga and turned the sky a shimmering purple. Kuybishev Street, the city’s main avenue, has been touched up, while the roads through the less scenic manufacturing zone will be closed for the World Cup.Samara is unusual for a Volga city for not having a bridge to the other side, and the island across the river is mostly pristine.Each monk is assigned work duties. Dmitry Voskresensky, dour but with a good sense of humour, was assigned to breed sturgeon.“When the father blessed me he said: ‘Dmitry, your job is the fish,’” Voskresensky recalled. “I had no idea what he was talking about.”Born in the Urals, Voskresensky served his military service in missile silos north of the Arctic Circle before entering the monkhood. Asked why he’d come, he said: “That’s between me and the father.”The monastery, founded in 2006 near a waterfront village, has a lax atmosphere, he said, and should be walled off from the outside world.Villagers can appear uninvited. “Sometimes without clothes on,” he added.In a storeroom, Voskresensky keep tubs full of Russian sturgeon, beluga and starlet. It’s still a small operation, but he has built it from scratch, learning through trial and error to engineer pumping systems and the basics of marine biology with the goal of farming meat and roe. The fish farm is just starting to become self-sufficient and yield caviar, he said. The next step is to scale it up exponentially.Voskresensky said his ultimate goal is to repopulate the Volga. With reasonable yearly growth, he estimates, that will take something like 500 years.On the road back we drop into Mezhdurechensk, a roadside town on an isthmus between the Volga and Usa rivers that hosts a well-known fish market, where women hawk dried perch, grayling, bream and burbot. The fattier fish come from the slow-moving Usa, they say, the ones with more muscle from the Volga.A fisherman’s daughter in her 20s named Lena, her black hair combed forward in a fringe, said the fishermen pay in product for the fishmongers to sell their goods. They would be down in the waterfront dugouts, she said, but it was spring and they are banned from fishing during the spawning period. Only commercial boats like the Nevsky can sail the Volga at this time of year.The streets were empty in Volgograd the morning of the Victory Day parade. It had been warmer on board the previous night as the ship made its final leg down to Volgograd. The bar was doing brisk business. Two teenage boys struck up a Stevie Wonder tune on guitar and a drunk businessman from Moscow sauntered up. “I want to give you money,” he said, holding out £25 in rubles. The singer, the slighter of the two boys, accepted it. The other looked on in horror.Volgograd itself is a dusty city in the great steppe. It stretches for miles like a banana around the bended Volga. At nearly any point in the city, it is difficult to forget its wartime legacy: 1.9 million were killed, wounded or captured in the bloodiest battle of all time.At a walkthrough of the city’s new stadium for next month’s World Cup, construction director Sergei Kamin said builders had found the remains of 386 shells and two Soviet soldiers on the building site.The parade in Volgograd turned out to be more reserved than Moscow’s. No intercontinental ballistic missiles made an appearance on the square, and the only relish came from an announcer rolling his r’s endlessly as he introduced the Tornado multiple rocket launcher, which passed the Intourist Hotel on to the Square of the Fallen Fighters.The real display came later, as tens of thousands of people made the pilgrimage up the Mamayev Kurgan hill to the Motherland Calls statue, which stands monumental at 280ft tall. The hill’s steepness gave the impression that the procession was balanced on a ridge-top. Ushers kept errant children off the grass, part of a mass grave of soldiers who died on the hill.“The atmosphere was eerie, and religious: all too easy to scoff at but the crowds, with their rapt and reverential expressions, were no scoffing matter,” Chatwin wrote of the climb in 1982.Valeria Petrovna, 68, who did not give a last name, climbs the hill each year with a religious procession to honour her father. He survived the battle but was never quite himself again, and withdrew in his final years. “My mother says he died here,” she said. “But I know that he was alive … with the understanding of the cruelty a people can inflict on another.”To reach Vladimir Kharchenko’s experimental motorbike workshop, meanwhile, you have to drive north past the old T-34 factory and across the great Volgograd dam into a quiet neighbourhood of factories.There, if you’re lucky, he’ll bring out his prized motorcycle and even take a spin around the block, weaving in and out of traffic over potholed roads. It’s the same one he custom-made for the Surgeon, a celebrity motorcycle-gang leader who has pledged fealty to Vladimir Putin and rode the motorcycle in the annexed city of Sevastopol in 2015.The bike’s name? The Stalinist. It’s written right on the engine.In his office, Kharchenko sat under a portrait of Stalin that he was told is an original. “This country was self-sufficient under Stalin, we were independent,” he said. Asked about those killed and repressed, he said western countries are no better. “What did Stalin want for his country? The rise of the country. Who ended up in the gulag? People who opposed that.”“These days you need to write bad things about Stalin, you need to write bad things about Putin, and show that in Europe,” he told a reporter. “But I think as long as things get worse with the United States, you’re going to see Stalin become more popular.”Valeria Petrovna, the woman on the hill, had a different opinion. “I think we’ve had enough of that time in general, and I don’t see much reason to go back,” she said, and excused herself to walk further up the hill.The Nevsky will take nearly three days straight back upstream to Kazan, with just five hours stop in Samara for passengers to stretch their legs. Chekhovskikh, the captain, says the longest journeys down the Volga can take three weeks, with some passengers opting to stay on the boat the whole time rather than tour the cities they pass.On the back deck one evening, two middle-aged couples were deep in their cups discussing the intricacies of Islam – and particularly circumcision. Mikhail, 47, owns a handful of garages in Samara and has taken a half-dozen Volga cruises, both toward Moscow and Astrakhan. “I never travel to Europe, barely to Moscow if I can avoid it,” he declared proudly. Then he swept his hand across the water and praised the Volga, and the city of Kazan. “There’s really nowhere else in Russia like it. Of course we’re different from them in some ways, this whole thing with religion – but can you really visit that city and not be proud of the history and of the fate that brought you together?”For more on life inside the Russian cities hosting the World Cup, visit  Cities or follow on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7289523c88802950c52d7886656c3f4fd69b9328/0_7_4238_2543/master/4238.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=263c5d2c78528844409dc0989a820e87","title":"russia stray dogs world cup cull sochi yekaterinburg","story":"After the mass culls before the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, animal rights activists in the World Cup cities of Sochi and Yekaterinburg fear history could be repeating itselfEarlier this year, Russia’s deputy prime minister, Vitaly Mutko, met with animal rights activist to discuss their fears that stray dogs would be exterminated ahead of the football World Cup. Mutko pledged to stop all cruelty, and said he had ordered the construction of shelters for stray animals.But activists allege dog killings have continued and that Mutko’s words are meaningless as city governments are not compelled to follow recommendations made at a federal level.“If you put it in plain Russian, they said ‘sod off, we’re going to carry on killing’,” says Yekaterina Dmitriyeva, the head of NGO the Foundation for the Protection of Urban Animals, who was present at the meeting. She set up the popular Facebook group, Bloody Fifa-2018, last year.There are approximately two million strays in Russia’s 11 World Cup host cities and it has been estimated that local authorities will spend up to £119 million on catching, caging, sterilising and euthanising animals this year.But activists warn that image-conscious officials are trying to remove strays from the streets by fair means or foul before the arrival of players and fans next month.While contracts to regulate the number of stray dogs are won by private companies in Russia annually, there is some evidence that the size of these tenders have been increased this year. An online petition launched by Dmitriyeva late last year calling on Russian President Vladimir Putin to cancel contracts ahead of the World Cup has almost two million signatures, but there has been no response from the Russian leader, who is known to have several pet dogs and often speaks about his love for animals.Though Russian cities’ policies about stray animals differ, these contracts can be extremely lucrative. In the World Cup host city Yekaterinburg, for example, the state is paying £380,000 for the capture of 4,650 dogs. Some Russians have even advertised their properties online as housing for dogs during the World Cup, hoping for a financial windfall as the companies that won tenders struggle to cope.Russian officials deny euthanasia is state policy, and some NGOs say the same. The allegations of mass extermination are just “gossip”, says Yekaterina Ublinskaya, deputy director of Right to Life, an animal rights NGO operating in the western exclave of Kaliningrad, which won a £21,400 contract to provide temporary accommodation for dogs picked up off the streets for the World Cup. “There are some instances of poisoning, but these are private incidents and there is no mass poisoning.”But even top animal welfare officials have admitted there have been cases of animal cruelty linked to the World Cup preparations. Vladimir Burmatov, the head of the Russian parliament’s committee on ecology and environment protection, was horrified when he visited a dog shelter in Yekaterinburg earlier this year. “The effect from what I saw was very painful. Malnourished dogs and conditions that you couldn’t even call satisfactory,” Burmatov wrote afterwards.He said a “large quantity” of dogs were being put down unnecessarily for £1.20 each – a price strongly indicating the methods used were likely not humane. He also revealed that the company running the shelter was not an animal specialist organisation, but focused on rubbish collection and disposal. Fears about the treatment of animals ahead of the World Cup have been fuelled by activists’ experience of the 2014 Olympics in Sochi when they say homeless dogs were exterminated in a coordinated campaign. The fate of Sochi’s strays became an international scandal before the tournament as photographs appeared of dogs dying in the streets and activists desperately tried to evacuate them from the city. In protest, some Olympic athletes adopted Sochi dogs and took them back to their respective countries and, in one case, dedicated an Instagram account to them. There are fears that what happened in Sochi could be repeated in all Russia’s World Cup cities, as well as in Sochi itself, which is hosting World Cup matches including those of footballing giants Germany and Spain. “We are scared there will be a repeat of what happened before the Olympics when, over a week, there were mass poisonings and shootings,” said Ksenia, a Sochi-based animal rights activist. Documents on the state procurement website show that Basya Service, the company that carried out the culls before the Sochi Olympics, has won four contracts to catch 3,501 stray dogs and cats in 2018. Angry officials in a village in the nearby Tuapse district pledged to tear up a similar agreement with the company earlier this year after the remains of dead dogs were found by the side of the road. The mayor of Sochi, Anatoly Pakhomov, has denied the city has authorised the killing of stray animals and says there are no plans to do so before the World Cup. Basya Service also denies that it uses inhumane methods. But Sochi activists are calling on their local networks to watch out for those targeting stray dogs and to film, obstruct or call the police about any animal cruelty.The situation is less volatile in other World Cup host cities. In the western city of Kaliningrad and the Volga city of Nizhny Novgorod – both due to host the English team during the group stages – local activists say authorities use a “Trap, Neuter, Return” policy . In Moscow, killings are rare.  In Kaliningrad, Ublinskaya said clearing dogs from the streets during the World Cup was actually in the animals’ best interests. “During such events, there are a lot of people – not always sober – and it is best to have animals as far away as possible.” But activists point out that euthanasia programmes allow much greater scope for corruption: while it is relatively simple to check whether a stray dog has been sterilised and tagged, it is almost impossible to tell if dogs have been killed and whether corners have been cut.“It’s a catastrophe,” says activist Dmitriyeva. “How do they choose who lives and who dies?”More on life inside Russian cities hosting the World Cup can be found here, or follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8c06f6e7f0281ef074ffc5d5ff2458cb7f9f8b2/1_0_2719_1631/master/2719.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64fd89063bb871ac57a57dfa0dcafb50","title":"brexit ireland referendum experiment trusting people","story":"In all the excitement of what happened in Ireland’s referendum on abortion, we should not lose sight of what did not happen. A vote on an emotive subject was not subverted. The tactics that have been so successful for the right and the far right in the UK, the US, Hungary and elsewhere did not work. A democracy navigated its way through some very rough terrain and came home not just alive but more alive than it was before. In the world we inhabit, these things are worth celebrating but also worth learning from. Political circumstances are never quite the same twice, but some of what happened and did not happen in Ireland surely contains more general lessons.If the right failed spectacularly in Ireland, it was not for want of trying. Save the 8th, one of the two main groups campaigning against the removal of the anti-abortion clause from the Irish constitution, hired Vote\u0026nbspLeave’s technical director, the Cambridge Analytica alumnus Thomas Borwick.Save the 8th and the other anti-repeal campaign, Love Both, used apps developed by a US-based company, Political Social Media (PSM), which worked on both the Brexit and Trump campaigns. The small print told those using the apps that their data could be shared with other PSM clients, including the Trump campaign, the Republican National Committee and Vote Leave.Irish voters were subjected to the same polarising tactics that have worked so well elsewhere: shamelessly fake “facts” (the claim, for example, that abortion was to be legalised up to six months into pregnancy) the contemptuous dismissal of expertise (the leading obstetrician Peter Boylan was told in a TV debate to “go back to school”) deliberately shocking visual imagery (posters of aborted foetuses outside maternity hospitals) and a discourse of liberal elites versus the real\u0026nbsppeople. But Irish democracy had an immune system that proved highly effective in resisting this virus. Its success suggests a democratic playbook with at least four good rules.First, trust the people. A crucial part of what happened in Ireland was an experiment in deliberative democracy. The question of how to deal with the constitutional prohibition on abortion – a question that has bedevilled the political and judicial systems for 35 years – was put to a Citizens’ Assembly, made up of 99 randomly chosen (but demographically representative) voters. These so-called ordinary people – truck drivers, homemakers, students, farmers – gave up their weekends to listen to 40 experts in medicine, law and ethics, to women affected by Ireland’s extremely restrictive laws and to 17 different lobby groups. They came up with recommendations that confounded most political and media insiders, by being\u0026nbspmuch more open than expected – and much more open than the political system would have produced on its own.It was these citizens who suggested entirely unrestricted access to abortion up to 12 weeks. Conservatives dismissed this process, in Trump style, as rigged (it wasn’t). They would have been much better off if they had actually listened to what these citizens were saying, and tried to understand what had persuaded them to take such a liberal position. The Irish parliament did listen – an all-party parliamentary committee essentially adopted the proposals of the Citizens’ Assembly. So did the government. And it turned out that a sample of “the people” actually knew pretty well what “the people” were thinking. If the Brexit referendum had been preceded by such a respectful, dignified and humble exercise in listening and thinking, it would surely have been a radically different experience.Second, be honest. The yes side in the Irish debate handed its opponents a major tactical advantage but gained a huge strategic victory. It ceded an advantage in playing with all its cards turned up on the table. Technically, the vote was merely to repeal a clause in the constitution. There was no need to say what legislation the government hoped to enact afterwards. But the government chose to be completely clear about its intentions. It published a draft bill. This allowed opponents of reform to pick at, and often distort, points of detail. But it also completely undercut the reactionary politics of paranoia, the spectre of secret conspiracies. Honesty proved to be very good policy.Abortion will not immediately be available to women within Ireland.The eighth amendment – article 40.3.3 of the Irish constitution – which prohibited abortion, will be replaced with a clause stating: “Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.”The Irish government is planning to bring legislation before the Dáil, providing for abortion on request up to the 12th week of pregnancy, with a three-day “cooling off” period before medication is administered.The prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said he wanted the new law to be enacted by the end of the year.Between 12 and 24 weeks, abortion will be available only in cases of fatal foetal abnormality, a risk to a woman’s life or a risk of serious harm to the health of the mother. After 24 weeks, termination will be possible in cases of fatal foetal abnormality.There will be provision for conscientious objection among medical practitioners, although doctors will be obliged to transfer care of the pregnant woman to another doctor.Finally, the old feminist slogan that the personal is political holds true, but it also works the other way around. The political has to be personalised. The greatest human immune system against the viruses of hysteria, hatred and lies is storytelling. Even when we don’t trust politicians or experts, we trust people telling their own tales. We trust ourselves to judge whether they are lying or being truthful. Irish women had to go out and tell their own stories, to make the painful and intimate into public property.This is very hard to do, and it should not be necessary. But is unstoppably powerful. The process mattered, political leadership mattered, campaigning mattered. But it was stories that won. Exit polls showed that by far the biggest factors in determining how people voted were “people’s personal stories that were told to the media”, followed by “the experience of someone who they know”.Women, in the intimate circles of family and friends or in the harsh light of TV studios, said: “This is who I am. I am one of you.” And voters responded: “Yes, you are.” If democracy can create the context for that humane exchange to happen over and over again, it can withstand everything its enemies throw at it.• Fintan O’Toole is a columnist with the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/225e336dafe4439ce1d6ca592a848455fdad9f60/0_136_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24cbb9774f55a2144730b42d4720afd6","title":"the guardian view on devolution think twice but change must come","story":"There are good reasons of principle and practice why any central government should think twice before crudely overriding a devolved one. The clue to the reason of principle lies in the word devolution itself. Devolution is a solemn act of delegation, allowing decisions to be taken closer to those affected by them and not centrally. To override a devolved assembly or administration risks negating the entire spirit of that process.The reason of practice is that overriding a devolved authority will cause resentment and can trigger unintended consequences. In Scotland, for instance, Nicola Sturgeon’s SNP seems increasingly to be banking on the possibility that a future decision by Theresa May’s government to override the Scottish government over Brexit will backfire in the separatists’ favour. If Mrs May decides not to devolve returning EU powers, as the Scottish parliament wants, the SNP thinks this could boost support for a fresh independence referendum.The UK government, parliament and political parties would be wise to take such considerations into account when assessing the way forward for abortion law reform in Northern Ireland. On Tuesday Mrs May’s spokesman appeared to do just that, repeating that abortion is a devolved issue (which it is) and that any change can only be made by the Northern Ireland assembly. So far, so impeccably in the spirit of devolution.What the spokesman did not say, however, is that there are practical calculations too. Mrs May may be a feminist and a supporter of liberalisation. But she fears to antagonise the unionist DUP, who unbendingly support Northern Ireland’s oppressive (and strictly enforced) 19th-century abortion law for a variety of reasons. With a series of crucial Commons votes pending on the Brexit bill, Mrs May needs the DUP’s 10 MPs firmly onside. Faced with a choice between women’s rights and the DUP, she has unhesitatingly chosen the latter.Yet Mrs May’s position rests on a transparent deceit. Her spokesman is right: abortion in Northern Ireland is a matter for the assembly. But the assembly is not sitting. It has been suspended for 16 months. There is no immediate likelihood that it will resume work any time soon. It therefore could not liberalise Northern Ireland’s abortion law even if it wanted to.When Northern Ireland was put under direct rule in 1972, some hoped that the 1967 Abortion Act might be extended there. It never happened. UK governments always feared setting off a backlash from and between the Northern Ireland parties that would make other politics more difficult. In that sense, Mrs May is acting as her predecessors did.Yet attitudes to abortion are transformed since the 1960s, including in Northern Ireland. Action is harder to avoid, and rightly so. Northern Ireland’s politicians should resume work and change the abortion law. MPs and UK ministers should turn the screw on them to do it. If Northern Ireland’s politicians refuse, they will bear all the responsibility for whatever follows."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e5270d41fb49bbf19a3e00eb63f9ac147ebe718/0_71_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a92e3ee1b526492d3ff5142f4f372da5","title":"roseanne barr tweet valerie jarrett ape","story":"Network pulls Barr’s revived show and condemns racist tweets towards ex-Obama adviser Valerie JarrettRoseanne Barr’s revived sitcom has been cancelled after she posted a racist and Islamophobic tweet that attacked former Obama White House adviser Valerie Jarrett.The sitcom star falsely alleged that Jarrett, who was born in Iran to American parents, has connections to the Muslim Brotherhood, and compared her to an ape. Barr wrote “Muslim brotherhood \u0026amp planet of the apes had a babyvj,” using Jarrett’s initials.ABC swiftly announced the show’s cancellation. The network said in a statement: “Roseanne’s Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values, and we have decided to cancel her show.”Bob Iger, the chief executive of Disney, which owns ABC, supported the decision. Iger wrote on Twitter: “There was only one thing to do here, and that was the right thing.”Barr, one of Donald Trump’s most high-profile supporters, apologized for the post as outrage grew, and announced she’d be quitting Twitter. She also deleted the tweet.Barr was replying to a post from a user that accused Jarrett, a long-serving adviser to the president, of covering up the Obama administration’s alleged “misdeeds”.When a Twitter user told Barr that her tweet was offensive and racist – Jarrett is African American – Barr responded by writing: “Muslims r NOT a race.” Shortly after, Barr reiterated her stance in another post: “ISLAM is not a RACE, lefties. Islam includes EVERY RACE of people.”Barr later apologized. She wrote: “I apologize to Valerie Jarrett and to all Americans. I am truly sorry for making a bad joke about her politics and her looks. I should have known better. Forgive me – my joke was in bad taste.”Barr’s tweets sparked condemnation from many prominent figures, including one of the sitcom’s top writers, Wanda Sykes, who announced that she would not be returning for the proposed second season.Barr’s co-star Sara Gilbert, who plays Darlene, condemned the tweets as “abhorrent”. Gilbert wrote: “Roseanne’s recent comments about Valerie Jarrett, and so much more, are abhorrent and do not reflect the beliefs of our cast and crew or anyone associated with our show. I am disappointed in her actions to say the least.”The 65-year-old Barr has been in the public eye recently after her eponymous sitcom returned after a two-decade hiatus. The now-cancelled show was ABC’s most-watched “new” series, averaging almost 18 million viewers per episode. In the show, Roseanne Conner plays a working-class Trump supporter, but Barr herself has not been shy about her allegiance to the president, frequently engaging with his critics online and peddling conspiracy theories shared by Trump’s base, such as “Pizzagate”, “Pedogate” and theories about the murder of former Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich.Barr also retweeted a post comparing Clinton to Donkey from Shrek.After Clinton replied with a tweet of her own, Barr apologized in sarcastic fashion. “Sorry to have tweeted incorrect info about you!,” she wrote, again invoking Soros, a frequent target of Trump and the right. “I Please forgive me! By the way, George Soros is a nazi who turned in his fellow Jews 2 be murdered in German concentration camps \u0026amp stole their wealth-were you aware of that? But, we all make mistakes, right Chelsea?”A spokesperson for Soros called the tweet “an affront”.After her tweets and the outrage that followed, Barr announced she was quitting the site. “I apologize,” she wrote. “I am now leaving Twitter.”News of Roseanne’s cancellation was met with cautious positivity in Hollywood. Actor and comedian Kumail Nanjiani tweeted: “I’m glad Roseanne is canceled. The backlash to its cancellation is going to be a deafening nightmare. Nothing good has come of this entire thing.”Westworld star Jeffrey Wright was also concerned about the reaction from the right. “Aaaaannnd cue the people who just celebrated the NFL targeting player protests defending Roseanne Barr now on 1st amendment grounds. 3,2,1....popcorn,” he tweeted.Bruce Helford, the Roseanne show’s executive producer and showrunner, said he was “horrified” by the comments. Helford wrote: “On behalf of all the writers and producers, we worked incredibly hard to create an amazing show. I was personally horrified and saddened by the comments and in no way do they reflect the values of the people who worked so hard to make this the iconic show that it is.”Barr has also been dropped by her agency ICM Partners. “We are all greatly distressed by the disgraceful and unacceptable tweet from Roseanne Barr this morning,” a statement read. “What she wrote is antithetical to our core values, both as iniduals and as an agency. Consequently, we have notified her that we will not represent her. Effective immediately, Roseanne Barr is no longer a client.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/616179d4fb47b2465edad7621da8f20a8df0b2ac/285_0_3715_2229/master/3715.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=337d5cbc3006ac63c5fa347d48905977","title":"oxford and cambridge university colleges own property worth 35bn","story":"News of bigger portfolio than Church of England comes after £21bn in total assets revealedOxford and Cambridge colleges collectively own more land than the Church of England and have a portfolio of properties across the UK worth £3.5bn, a  investigation has found.From a Scottish castle conquered by Robert the Bruce and the O2 arena in Greenwich to a betting shop in Brent, north-west London, the land and buildings owned by the universities’ colleges encompass ancient and modern possessions amounting to 51,000 hectares (126,000 acres) – an area more than four times the size of Manchester.The Oxbridge holdings dwarf the 42,000 hectares owned across 41 dioceses by the Church of England, which is often said to be the UK’s largest private landowner.The figures follow the revelation on Monday that estates, endowments, investments and other assets held by Oxford and Cambridge are collectively worth almost £21bn. The property details come from the most extensive survey of Oxbridge landholdings since 1873, through a combination of freedom of information requests, archival research and Land Registry records.The property holdings of Oxbridge colleges are worth a combined £3.5bn, while the universities collectively hold property investments worth £863m. These figures do not take into account the value of many historic college sites, which are held at depreciated cost.The total size does not include unmeasured land held by several colleges “under ancient possession”, or the holdings of the universities, which could not give a full account of their land ownership but own at least 1,800 hectares, according to information available online.The two major Cambridge landowners are St John’s and Trinity, which have 10,500 hectares worth £1.1bn and make up more than half of the 17,000 hectares owned by Cambridge colleges.Trinity values its property investments at £850m, and in early January, the college sold a block of retail and residential space in Kensington High Street, central London, to Unitum Ltd, a Malta-based holding company, for £28m.All Souls, Christ Church and Merton are Oxbridge’s biggest UK landowners, owning 14,000 of the 34,000 hectares held by Oxford colleges at a value of about £460m.The oldest property owned by any college is Buittle Castle in Dumfries and Galloway, built in the 12th century and given to the Scottish nobleman John de Balliol, who, with his wife, Lady Dervorguilla, founded Balliol College, Oxford, in 1263.Though the castle was captured by Robert the Bruce in the 14th century, it later reverted to the crown and is now back in the hands of Balliol College.One of the most lucrative holdings is the O2 arena, originally known as the Millennium Dome, which Trinity College owns on a 999-year lease after buying it for £24m in 2009.Trinity collects rent from Anschutz Entertainment Group, which operates the concert arena, and over the past two years, the college has registered a profit of nearly £22m from the site.Other well-known holdings include the site of the Top Gear test track, also owned by Trinity, and the Rose Bowl, the home of Hampshire cricket club, owned by Queen’s College, Oxford.One of the most unlikely holdings belongs to St John’s College, the alma mater of the former prime minister Tony Blair, and Oxford’s wealthiest college. It is the landlord of Millwall’s training ground. Less glamorous are swaths of rural farmland and woodland, which include an Isle of Wight farm bought by Queen’s College from Henry VIII, multiple Leeds industrial estates, several gastropubs across England, and the freeholds to more than 100 retail outlets and shops, including branches of Caffè Nero and HSBC.The most concentrated commercial land ownership is in Brent, where All Souls College, one of Oxford’s wealthiest, owns more than 300 properties. The vast majority are residential houses, but they also include the freehold of a Ladbrokes betting shop.The London borough had the highest proportion of housing benefit claims by private tenants in the country, according to research by the Financial Times in 2015.Several colleges have received agricultural subsidies amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds, according to data from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).These include £117,000 in common agricultural policy subsidies paid in 2016 to Waterside farm in Berkshire, owned by St John’s College, Oxford, which sits on wealth of £582m.The farm has received the taxpayer-funded grants, intended to conserve the environment by protecting wildlife and maintaining rural landscapes, despite West Berkshire council putting forward plans in 2016 to extract 200,000 tons of gravel over an 11-year period from the farm, located in the North Wessex Downs – an area of outstanding natural beauty.The plans were met with widespread anger at the time from locals, including one who wrote a letter to the college vowing to “highlight the damage that St John’s College is intent on inflicting on the environment, the ecosystem, the neighbourhood, the town, and not least, the residents”.Meanwhile, Cambridge, which holds net assets of £4.8bn, also received £180,000 in CAP subsidies in 2016 for its university farm. That is despite research from the university in 2015 describing such funding as “perverse” subsidies “promoting negative actions in both the long and short term by being bad for the environment and costly to the economy”.An Oxford spokesperson said: “The central university’s strong balance sheet allows us to fund new initiatives for our students, staff and outstanding teaching and research.”Oxford’s endowment includes 600 trusts with funds earmarked for specific purposes such as teaching posts, buildings and research. About £270m of the endowment supports student scholarships.Cambridge declined to reply to requests for a response.

But the practice of intensive beef farming in the UK has not previously been widely acknowledged – and the findings have sparked the latest clash over the future of British farming. The beef industry says that the scale of operations involved enables farmers to rear cattle efficiently and profitably, and ensure high welfare standards. But critics say there are welfare and environmental concerns around this style of farming, and believe that the farms are evidence of a wider intensification of the UK’s livestock sector which is not being sufficiently debated, and which may have an impact on small farmers. In contrast to large intensive pig and poultry farms, industrial beef units do not require a government permit, and there are no official records held by DEFRA on how many intensive beef units are in operation.But the  and the Bureau has identified nearly a dozen operating across England, including at sites in Kent, Northamptonshire, Suffolk, Norfolk, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. The largest farms fatten up to 6,000 cattle a year.Drone footage and satellite images reveal how thousands of cattle are being kept at some sites in outdoor pens, known as corrals, sometimes surrounded by walls, fences or straw bales. Although the cattle will have spent time grazing in fields prior to fattening, some will be confined in pens for around a quarter of their lives, until they are slaughtered. Supermarket demand is believed to be, at least in part, driving the trend. In addition, some smaller and medium-scale beef producers have struggled to farm profitably in recent years, with sometimes tight margins and fluctuating costs. Most of the units identified are believed to have grown incrementally, rather than setting up from scratch.A number of retailers, including the Co-op, Lidl and Waitrose, are among those found to be sourcing beef from UK intensive industrial scale farms, most of which are privately owned but sell to beef processing companies, which in turn supply retailers.Chris Mallon, director of the National Beef Association (NBA), the industry trade body, said the reason the largest units have come about was purely down to “efficiency”.“What we’re talking about here is commercial production, for feeding people. It’s not niche market. A lot of this will be on supermarket shelves – that’s where it’s coming into its own. In the catering side as well, they’ll be doing it,” he said.“One of the things we’ve seen over the years is supermarket domination of the beef trade. What they want is specification, size of cuts, size to fit certain packaging, size of roasts – this has all become incredibly important.”“The difference is we’re getting some larger units now and that will be because of economies of scale … if you can give the people you’re supplying a constant supply of cattle that are in the right specification, that makes you more valuable. And that’s one of the reasons we’ve seen a move towards it.”Dr Jude Capper, a livestock expert who has studied intensive beef units in the US and elsewhere said that due to economies of scale “it’s almost inevitable that a larger farm can produce a greater quantity of a more affordable product – we see this in almost all agricultural sectors globally, just as we do in other industries”. and Bureau last year revealed that 800 poultry and pig “mega farms” or CAFOs have appeared in the British countryside in recent years, some housing more than a million chickens or about 20,000 pigs.Following the revelations, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, pledged that Brexit would not be allowed to result in the spread of US-style agribusiness: “I do not want to see, and we will not have, US-style farming in this country,” he said in a parliamentary statement.Although the number of beef units is tiny in comparison with intensive poultry or pig farms, the latest findings have further fuelled fears that the UK could be embracing industrial-scale practices.Caroline Lucas, MP for Brighton Pavillion, said the farms were “gravely concerning” and that “with Britain hurtling towards Brexit, and with our animal and environmental protections facing an uncertain future, I’m worried that we could end up adopting more of this US-style agricultural practice”.Richard Young, Policy Director at the Sustainable Food Trust, said: “Keeping large number of cattle together in intensive conditions removes all justification for rearing them and for consumers to eat red meat... More than two-thirds of UK farmland is under grass for sound environmental reasons and the major justifications for keeping cattle and eating red meat are that they produce high quality protein and healthy fats from land that is not suitable for growing crops.”Young added that that smaller scale beef farmers might feel the impact, as larger farms were likely to be “more efficient in purely economic terms”, allowing the supermarkets “to drive down the retail price of beef below the price at which more traditional farmers can produce it. As a result they go out of business.”Beef production in the UK typically involves three distinct stages - calf rearing, growing and fattening - with many farms specialising in one part of the rearing process. Cattle may move between a number of different farms during their lifecycle. (A smaller number of farms rear cattle from birth and keep them on the same farm until being sent to the abattoir.)After spending time on pasture many cattle are moved to dedicated “finishing units” and are typically housed in barns or grazed whilst being fattened ahead of slaughter, often for around 6 months. Many are fed specialist diets designed to encourage weight gain.But in the US, much beef fattening takes place in “feedlots” with cattle held in vast outdoor pens where the largest facilities confine up to 85,000 livestock. Such “feedlots” have proved controversial in the past, both because of their size and because many cattle were given hormones and antibiotics, sometimes to encourage rapid growth. (Such practices are not permitted in the UK).Despite acknowledging the arrival of intensive beef farming in the UK, experts reject the notion that the British beef sector will see a wholesale shift towards farming on a US-scale.Caroline Lucas called for the system of permits to be tightened up, and said “the Government should be officially recording the number of feedlots rather than letting reporting slip through a loophole … we need a proper debate in this country over what kind of agriculture we want in the future.”A spokesperson for DEFRA said that “beef farms are regulated in exactly the same way as any other farms”. But it later acknowledged that “Defra does not have a database of feedlot style units...The Cattle Tracing System can provide figures on the number of holdings split by premised type e.g. Agricultural Holding, Slaughterhouse, Market etc. and the number of animals registered to each. However, it does not hold any data in respect of the feeding practices on the holdings.”Waitrose said of its own supplier: “Animal welfare is of the highest importance to us and a large farm does not equal poor animal welfare standards. The farm is run under a bespoke environmental management plan in conjunction with Natural England. All the cattle graze the marshes during the summer season then during the winter months, when the grass is dormant the cattle are bought back to the yard when the finishingfattening cattle are housed in covered sheds. For clarification the length of grazing season is weather dependent, once the grass stops growing the cattle need to be yarded and fed a forage based ration in accordance with animal welfare and best practice.”A spokesperson for the British Retail Consortium said: “Our members take their responsibilities to animal welfare very seriously and work closely with trusted suppliers so that high welfare standards are upheld. They have strict processes in place and will thoroughly investigate any evidence of non-conformity to ensure that any problems are immediately addressed.” approached several of the largest units but all declined to comment.Pressure group Compassion In World Farming (CIWF) have raised concerns that some cattle held at in “feedlots” are kept in “high stocking densities” with little or no shelter or shade and “no dry ground to rest on.” The group says it believes “cows belong on pasture”.Evidence compiled by the Bureau and  suggests that most intensive beef farms appear to operate to high welfare standards.

Some online have already been getting creative:Trolling the fashion world seems to be working out well for Balenciaga: last week the chief executive of Kering, a global luxury group that manages the likes of Alexander McQueen, Saint Laurent, and Gucci, said that Balenciaga was the fastest growing brand within its group. They attributed this growth to men and young millennials most of whom, one imagines, aren’t actually buying the more outlandish items like T-Shirt Shirts but Balenciaga’s more down-to-earth designs. Like the $915 black leggings or the $395 leather wallets with ‘leather wallet’ stamped on the front – only marginally more sensible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93053111754f0c0580bec011d084e795d0bb1ad5/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0476b5ef597bd0adac6b6a7643f59773","title":"roll with it the jade roller is the alternative beauty fad of 2018","story":"Used in Chinese medicine since the seventh century, Alicia Keys and Victoria Beckham swear by the green device but the benefits are inconclusiveLike current-season Valentino and Balenciaga, jade rollers are green and irrefutably on trend. In Chinese medicine, this has been the case since about the seventh century, but this season, they have been borrowed and monetised by an industry elbow-deep in what is known as lo-tech wellness – AKA the alternative beauty fad of 2018. Lo-tech because they don’t need batteries and you keep them in the freezer, and alternative because you move a jade roller over your face like you might a rolling pin on pastry, which is a bit weird.Still, there are supposedly rewards to be reaped. The benefits of massaging your face each day with one of these range from the ironclad (cold things pressed against our skin feel nice), to the possible (such pressing is supposed to have an anti-inflammatory, lymph-draining effect), to the dubious (jade is said to represent healing and wisdom and protection).There is also the makeup artist who reportedly massages Meghan Markle’s face with one, various flight attendants who swear by them and Victoria Beckham’s inclusion of a jade roller in her skincare routine – although it was arguably Alicia Keys who kickstarted the whole thing in 2016 when she posed for a photograph ostensibly without makeup. All she had used, said her paradoxically tasked makeup artist, Dotti, was a little brow pencil and a jade roller. Dotti has been using a jade roller on clients for 10 years, and on herself twice a day. The trick, she says, is to keep it in ice. It is now, she says, a “permanent part of my makeup kit”.The cynical answer, of course, is what they say about their owner: that they don’t wear makeup and that they have time to massage their face for several minutes, twice daily. In using one, you are flagging up a disdain for a world dominated by a contoured aesthetic while embodying that gentle talismanic quality so beloved by millennials.Whether they work is almost incidental. I use mine onoff and I don’t doubt there is something beneficial in massaging your face. But what does it matter? Like its much-maligned edible forefather, the avocado, the jade roller has become a cultural siphon, something modish, yet with a long, historic past that we don’t quite understand. But it looks good on Instagram, nonetheless."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/770b9f62631cfab840c738102d7d6462f1b68309/15_216_6682_4009/master/6682.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8925a4ca6b31f594c9df8426eedf7814","title":"fa sale wembley financial boost grassroots facilities shahid khan","story":"• Stadium sale could mean 10-year bonanza, claims FA• Martin Glenn says proposed sale is not selling ‘soul of the game’The Football Association has told its council members that selling Wembley could enable more than £1bn to be spent on community football facilities over 10 years, while having £450m from the sale still untouched in the bank.The FA chief executive, Martin Glenn, said in a speech to the council that the proposed sale of Wembley for £600m to the Fulham and Jacksonville Jaguars NFL team owner, Shahid Khan, is not selling the “soul of the game” but “an opportunity to unleash an unprecedented amount of investment into community football”.According to people present, some council members did voice opposition in principle to the FA selling the national stadium, having worked hard to pay down much of the £426m it borrowed to have Wembley rebuilt and opened in 2007.Other council members spoke in support, persuaded that a sale will release investment to improve dilapidated grassroots facilities nationwide. Others asked Glenn and the chairman, Greg Clarke, specific questions about the deal’s main essentials, including how far England and other prestige football matches will be guaranteed to take place in the stadium – the FA has said these and the stadium’s name will be protected until 2057 – how the money would be spent and whether £600m is enough money.The FA is relying on the City bank Rothschild for advice that the price represents good value Clarke stressed to council members last week that £600m was not the first offer from Khan, who wants Wembley as a London base for his NFL franchise.Glenn explained that reaching the £1bn figure relies on the FA securing further “match” funding for facilities improvements locally, which will be difficult given severe government cuts to local authorities.From next year investment in community facilities by the FA, Premier League and government via the Football Foundation will be £70m annually.Glenn projected that only £150m of the £600m proceeds of the Wembley sale would be spent initially, with the other £450m invested, to generate £30m annual interest.Of the £150m, Glenn said £50m a year would boost annual investment from the current £70m to £120m every year for three years. With “match funding”, he forecast this £360m would increase to around £500m “accelerated investment”. In succeeding years, the £30m interest would be added to the £70m regular capital investment fund, with a further £30m expected from match funding, Glenn said.“By 2030, just over 10 years from the completion of a potential sale, we could have invested over £1bn on community football facilities – and still have a £450m capital fund untouched,” he told the council.A major focus of investment is more 3G all-weather pitches. Glenn told the council the proposed investment would produce a doubling of 3G pitches, a “hub facility” for every County Football Association, “major investment” into grass pitches and other improvements.He also addressed the demand made by the EFL, which has insisted that under the FA’s financial arrangements half the proceeds should go to professional clubs for community‑focused investment. FA executives believe that can form part of the deal, Glenn referring to professional game “community trusts and foundations” having improved facilities for football projects.“Receiving an offer to sell Wembley Stadium is not a betrayal,” he said. “It is not selling the soul of the game. What we have in front of us is simply an opportunity.”The FA will continue to consult its council and board members, who include Premier League and EFL representatives, before a decision is reached."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23d79a4657f2db2c4e6f9a00552b85b918dab87f/0_319_6031_3619/master/6031.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d05745091494238c223e91d35411b83","title":"matias vecino midfielder uruguay italy inter antonio conte","story":"Midfielder was 14 when his dad died in a crash but his response has taken him to Inter and caught Antonio Conte’s eyeThis article is part of the ’s 2018 World Cup Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 32 countries who have qualified for Russia. the is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 14 June.Matías Vecino was 14 when he lost his father, the man who taught him the secrets of football. With the support of his family he has recovered to conquer Italy and grab the attention of Óscar Tabárez.It had been a long and difficult journey, from the trips from his childhood home in San Jacinto to train with his first club, Central Español, 50km away in Montevideo, to his debut in their senior side, his transfer to Nacional, and eventually to Italy and international recognition. Along the way he has been inspired by memories of his father, whose signature is tattooed on his right hand. On 1 August 2017 he opened a new chapter of a remarkable story by moving to one of Europe’s great clubs. On the day he was introduced as Internazionale’s latest signing he turned to his mother and asked: “What would Dad say if he saw me here?”Mario Vecino was also a footballer, whose career peaked with a spell in the Uruguayan top flight with Liverpool. When he died, killed in a car crash on his way to work, Vida Nueva, the local club in San Jacinto, renamed their ground the Estadio Municipal Mario Vecino in his honour. “That night I gathered the family around the table and told them what had happened,” says his mother, Dolly. “But we all got on with our lives, because the family was strong and we did not just sit down to cry or look for pity.” At one point Dolly, an English teacher, was doing three jobs in an effort to support her family.Dolly still lives in San Jacinto with her younger son, Nicolas. Her daughter, two years older than Matías is a lawyer. “Nicolas was the one most affected by the death of his father,” she says. “For months he was looking for him. He thought it was his dad every time someone knocked on the door or the phone rang. He was two and a half years old.”Matías had taken his first steps into the world of football as a four-year-old, when he joined his local kids’ team, with his father as coach. “Mario spent hours teaching him,” says Dolly. “He didn’t want Matías to win, he wanted his kid to learn.”He was taken on by Central Español and travelled every day to train in Montevideo. When he returned home he would give his grandmother Esther his white football boots and she would clean them for the next day. “They were the only boots he had and they are something that reminds him of how far he has travelled to get where he is today,” his mother says.“There were days when I would see him heading out with his little backpack on, walking in heavy rain, and I’d ask him: ‘Are you sure training’s going to be on?’” his uncle Raul Falero remembers. “And he’d say to me: ‘We’ll find a way.’”Daniel Sánchez was the manager at Central Español when Vecino made his debut in 2010. “When I first joined the club to work with the under-15s, he was already there,” he says. “Then I was head of youth and finally first-team coach. When Matías was in the under-20s his coach told me he was the best player he had.”Eventually he was promoted alongside Diego Riolfo, the other star of the club’s youth system, a striker who plays in the Argentinian top flight for Godoy Cruz. It was a difficult time for the Palermitanos, who were fighting relegation. On 6 March 2010 Vecino made his debut, playing the final half-hour of a 4-1 win over Tacuarembó.“In his first few games we played him in a more attacking role, to free him of responsibilities,” Sánchez says. “But game by game he was becoming more integral to our tactics, and he kept his place in the team.”He was called up to represent his country at junior level, and played in the 2011 South American under-20 championship in Peru, where he scored the goal that earned his country a place at the 2012 Olympics. “He told me that he didn’t want to be remembered for that goal,” his mother says. “He wanted to continue writing his story.”His performances in Peru earned him a move to Nacional, and after 18 months there he was bought by Fiorentina. In Italy he had loan spells at Cagliari and Empoli and it was at Empoli, under the guidance of Maurizio Sarri, that he flourished, playing as one of two defensive midfielders. His performances were so impressive that Antonio Conte, then the manager of Italy, tried to convince him to take citizenship of his adoptive country. “He told me that it didn’t feel right, and he wanted to wait for the chance to play for Uruguay,” says his mother.In March 2016 that opportunity arrived. He was in the starting lineup as Uruguay went 2-0 down to Brazil in Recife before fighting back to draw 2-2. “I couldn’t have been more nervous,” says his mother. “There’s no way I would have missed it. I’ve seen every one of his debuts.” Unless injured or suspended, he has played for his country in every game since.His final appearance of the season for Inter came at Lazio on the last day, a match in effect a winner-takes-all Champions League qualifier. The Nerazzurri twice came from behind, and in the 81st minute Vecino headed the winner to take his club into Europe’s premier club competition for the first time since 2012. “I haven’t scored that many goals,” he said, “but this is the most important of my career.”His story, however, has a few chapters still to be written.Pablo Benítez writes for El Observador.

Here are the 13 rules of survivalFortnite is a “battle royale” game in which 100 players land on an island, run around collecting weapons, resources and items from abandoned houses, build forts for protection, and then attempt to blast each other right back into the starting menu. The last player standing wins.When you first start out, it can be a little bewildering – but not nearly as bewildering as not playing and then trying to understand what your daughter means when she tells you she just took out two John Wicks with nothing but an uncommon silenced pistol.If you’re thinking of dipping your toe in, here are 13 tips to get you started.1. Stay on the battle bus until the endIf you want to live long enough to collect a couple of guns and some resources, stay on the bus until the last few seconds and then land somewhere near the coast. Very few players will be around, because most of them eject immediately over Tilted Towers. This way, you at least get to arm yourself and have a little look around before being pulverised by a stranger dressed like Harley Quinn from Suicide Squad.2. Land on a roof when you eject from the battle busYou’ll want to land near a house, where you’re most likely to find weapons and chests. But it’s even better to land on the roof. This gives you a height advantage on anyone else nearby, and also means you can quickly chop your way through each floor, grabbing all the goodies from the top of the house to the bottom.3. Prioritise weapons over resources in the opening secondsAs soon as you’ve landed, you need to find something useful to fight with just in case someone else has dropped nearby – you don’t want to be running at them with your pickaxe. At this stage anything will do, though a tactical shotgun or submachine gun will be best because it’s likely to be a close encounter. Don’t engage anyone unless you really have to. You’re not Rambo.4. Learn about weapon gradingThere are five grades of weapon in Fortnite: gray (common), green (uncommon), blue (rare), purple (epic) and orange (legendary). With each grade, the weapon’s damage capabilities improve, so always prioritise rarer weapons.5. Learn to make a basic fortAs quickly as possible while you’re exploring the world, start smashing stuff up to get you the three basic resources: wood, bricks and metal. Wood is the weakest but also the quickest to build with, so, if someone is firing at you, this is what to go for first. The basic defence is to surround yourself with four walls, then build a ramp in the middle and jump on to it as its forming. This gives you height and cover. Building other identical levels on top of this will accentuate your height advantage, but only building upwards makes you vulnerable to someone blowing up your lower levels with a rocket launcher, destroying your whole tower. If you can, it helps to build around a scenic structure like a house, as that gives you a head start on gaining height and a decent foundation. As you get nearer to the endgame, start making stronger buildings out of brick and metal, but always use ramps so that you have cover.6. An assault rifle and a shotgun are your must-have weaponsThese will see you through most encounters. Prioritise automatic assault rifles over burst fire models as the latter are trickier to use in a sudden firefight. There are scoped ARs, giving you the long-range aiming of a sniper rifle with the rapid fire of an AR (handy for when you’re exploring), and then there are special combat assault rifles, which do lots of damage and reload fast. They’re the motherlode of the assault rifle world.There are three types of shotgun. The pump model delivers more damage but takes longer to reload, while the tactical shotgun is quicker but weaker. The heavy shotgun – available in epic and legendary flavours – is powerful, quick to reload and has a longer effective range – it is very much the Incredible Hulk of short-range combat. Many players line up a pump next to a tactical in their armoury, getting away an opening shot with the former, before quickly switching to the latter. If you’re unsure, stick with any AR and a tactical shotgun.7. If you want to practise shooting, go to Tilted TowersIf you’re new to the game, it’s worth getting some practice in with combat, and that means dropping down in a city and becoming bullet fodder for all the young scamps who have been doing this for three hours a day since September. Just land, find a weapon and try to shoot it at someone. Fortnite has an authentic – if rather exaggerated – physics system, so the further away your target is, the more you need to lead your shot, firing just over their heads, and slightly in front if they’re running past.8. Pack your perfect inventoryEvery player has their own priorities when it comes to filling their backpack. Many go for three weapons (short, medium and long range), bandages or a health kit, and some sort of projectile, such as a grenade or clinger. If you’re new to the game, it’s probably not worth wasting an inventory slot on remote mines, impulse grenades or boogie bombs. If you pick up anything that boosts your shields, use it immediately – it’ll free up an inventory slot and there’s no benefit to saving them. If you’re not planning to get in many firefights, prioritise health kits and large shield potions over bandages and small bottles. As a newcomer, when you do get into a fight, it’s likely you’ll need massive medical intervention rather than a plaster and a kiss on your sore bit.9. Use sound to your advantageIf you can, wear decent headphones, preferably with 7.1 surround sound. This way you get excellent audio feedback on where another player is in relation to you. (Footsteps are really noisy in this game.) Also remember that everything you do, from changing weapons to slurping some shield potion, is audible to nearby players. Oh, and crouching makes your movement harder to detect. Start weighing up every action in terms of how it gives away your position - especially in cities.10. Stay away from open groundYou are basically cannon fodder when walking through open fields, so try to vary your movement, using jumping and weaving, rather than legging it in a straight line, which is basically the equivalent of shouting: “Shoot me now.” Use scenic elements such as hills, trees and walls as cover. Chopping down trees sends leaves flying into the air, alerting everyone within 500 metres to where you are. 11. Stay away from close encountersLet’s face it, the chances are, you’re going to lose in close, open combat. So be sneaky. If you spot another player, try to engage them from a distance using a scoped rifle – and wait until they’re standing still. Alternatively, watch them for a while, hold off until they’re engaged in exploring or building, then get into the crouch position and tiptoe up to them. Use a shotgun and aim for the head. It’s also a good idea to swoop in after you’ve observed two players fighting each other as they’ll both be low on health and shields. If all else fails, don’t feel bad about running away.12. Tweak the controlsSome people find the controls over-sensitive, which can make it tough to construct forts at speed. If that’s the case with you, go into the menu and change the settings. You can also tweak the button configurations depending on whether you want to prioritise combat or building. Once you’ve learned what your strengths and weaknesses are, there’s no shame in using the controller options to augment them.13. Watch the expertsIf you really want to immerse yourself in Fortnite’s surrounding culture (or properly get good at it), head to YouTube or Twitch and watch experienced players. The likes of Ninja, Myth and Dakotaz are considered the best in the world, but Britain’s Ali A is a really good starting point – he explains his strategies clearly and makes professional, watchable videos."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdac0cded250e09670bc399e1f76e13832662c74/120_307_7186_4313/master/7186.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=315f02c720242ea1c670855fc9493aea","title":"nigel slater beetroot fritters recipe","story":"A glorious tangle of crispy roots spiced and seasoned to perfectionMix together 6 tbsp of rice flour and 3 tbsp of gram flour.

Further details are likely to be announced on Wednesday.The deal, agreed provisionally, will involve the acquisition by Derriston of S4 Capital. The latter entity has been established by Sorrell. Its name reportedly refers to four generations of his family.Sorrell, one of the UK’s best-known businessmen, is most closely associated with his time at WPP Group, a firm he built up from obscurity to a £16bn valuation during his 33-year tenure.His actions are reminiscent of his early days there, people close to the deal have said. “He’s borrowing from the same playbook,” Sky News quoted one of his backers as saying.When he left WPP six weeks ago, he told staff that the firm’s future was “more important than a matter of life or death”. He said: “As I look ahead, I see that the current disruption we are experiencing is simply putting too much unnecessary pressure on the business. That is why I have decided that in your interest, in the interest of our clients, in the interest of all share owners, both big and small, and in the interest of all our other stakeholders, it is best for me to step aside.“As a founder, I can say that WPP is not just a matter of life or death. It was, is and will be more important than that. Good fortune and godspeed to all of you … now back to the future.”He had been the longest-serving FTSE-100 executive. His £70m remuneration in 2015 was among the biggest in UK corporate history. But his reign at WPP ended after the group hired a law firm to investigate allegations of improper use of company funds and improper personal behaviour.

The audience was greying, supportive and eager to join in with It’s All Over Now Baby Blue, The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down and The Boxer, the song with which she concluded her 100-minute set.Whether this extended tour will be her last is another matter – the programme contains a flyer advertising dates in London next year: there could be quite a few final bows. Baez, now 77, has been performing for 60 years and isn’t going quietly.Baez is 77 and her voice, as she freely admits, is not what it was. That outrageously pure soprano is long gone, replaced by a lower, less reliable instrument, skilfully deployed on her recent album Whistle Down the Wind, a self-conscious statement of survival, her first disc for 10 years and, she says, possibly her last. Her set was a clever combination of songs from the new disc and classics – Phil Ochs’ glorious There But for Fortune, Bob Dylan’s Farewell Angelina, a powerful rendition of Woody Guthrie’s Deportee (as relevant now as it was 70 years ago, she pointed out), a less successful version of Joe Hill with a curious rolling piano accompaniment by multi-instrumentalist Dirk Powell. There was also a slow, more-wistful-than-angry Diamonds \u0026amp Rust, her great lament fordemolition of her former lover Dylan. It was a tribute to the new songs, including the angry eco-protest Another World and the heartfelt The President Sang Amazing Grace, a modern civil rights song echoing the struggles of the 1960s - recited rather than sung - , that they didn’t pale in that exalted company.Her protege, Grace Stumberg, accompanied her on Diamonds \u0026amp Rust, and the power and flexibility of the younger woman’s voice sometimes emphasised the decline of Baez’s own. But that was the point really: none of us are what we were, but we are still standing, still fighting, still singing. “Ten years ago  I bought you some cufflinks  You brought me something  We both know what memories can bring  They bring diamonds and rust,” she sang back in the 1970s. At the Albert Hall, that famous doomed relationship forever receding, “10 years” became “50 years”. It’s been a long, sometimes painful journey, but Baez was here, beautiful and assured to proclaim victory."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7b8d9e2f3c06ccaa77b0f2be3c0bea8cd9c9954/0_0_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1422c20359c54eb3b32fb0715e02e03d","title":"online forums musical culture messageboards social media music essay","story":"In the first of a new monthly essay series on music, we explore how messageboards became a meeting point for 00s music fans – and how, after being killed off by social media, they might rise againBack in the 00s, I ran an online music forum, most of whose regulars were bored office workers. Once, we made a sketchy calculation, based on rates of posting and average wages, of how much the site had cost the UK economy in terms of time wasted arguing about Daft Punk, Outkast, Britney and more. We estimated that around £1.7m of productivity had been gloriously frittered. Music attracts conversation like a magnet pulls iron filings, and the form that talk takes changes according to where music lovers hang out with one another. Milk bars in the 50s “head shops”, fuggy student digs and record stores in the 60s and 70s fanzines in the 80s and 90s. These days, the word gets spread via memes, like those earnest pleas for 10 Facebook friends to share their favourite teenage albums. And in the early 00s, there were music forums: Drowned in Sound, my own I Love Music, Barbelith, Dissensus, Hipinion and dozens of others, fierce little enclaves of snark, in-jokes and bubbling enthusiasm. Starting a music forum in 2018 feels like a quixotic endeavour. But the London-based electronic duo patten have done just that. Their 555-5555 messageboard shares its name with the alias they use for other creative side projects – zines, club nights and the like. They saw a niche for serious music chat that the current social landscape, for all its advantages, wasn’t truly filling. According to patten, there has been a surge of interest in their new board, and an impressive level of quality to the discussion: “Feels like it was something a lot of people were waiting for, maybe without realising it.”Patten’s new posters have been bitten by a powerful bug. For their regular patrons, these forums existed in that familiar internet interzone where distraction shades into obsession with every new refresh. But for all the passion and energy invested in them, the termite activity of music forums rarely breaks into the consciousness of non-participating fans, let alone the wider public. In 2017, Jared O’Mara, a newly elected Labour MP, found himself in trouble over crass jokes he’d made on the Drowned in Sound messageboard over a decade before. O’Mara’s comments – jokes about having an orgy with members of Girls Aloud and the idea of Jamie Cullum being sexually assaulted by his piano – were nasty but hardly unusual: music boards were riddled with insecure young guys trying to be outrageous. Mostly, forums mattered not because of what was said on them but because of what they were: places for fans to gather before Facebook and its imitators co-opted the very idea of being “social” online. The rise and decline of music forums offers a miniature of every strain of online conversation, and the optimism and naivety of the people who thought starting those conversations was worthwhile. There was plenty of music discussion on the 80s and 90s internet, mostly on mailing lists devoted to inidual bands, and on the sprawling newsgroup network of Usenet. Mailing lists and Usenet newsgroups each had distinct advantages. Lists were focused their membership could be policed and off-topic infractions punished. But they were hermetic places – gated communities that weren’t always friendly to newcomers or easy to find.  Newsgroups had the opposite issues. They were porous, endlessly ertable by gleeful troll invasions and crossposting – publishing the same thread on multiple newsgroups, often in wickedly bad faith. A 1997 thread about the Prodigy’s Smack My Bitch Up landed on the band’s own newsgroup, on UK and US alternative music newsgroups, on electronica newsgroups, and on politics and censorship newsgroups, creating a discursive fatberg of circular arguments, bad spellings and endless stacked indentations that carried on for months, each pointless new post dutifully retrieved and downloaded by your 28kbps modem. Music forums offered a solution to all this, or seemed to. They were public, so anyone could jump in, but also bounded and – in theory – moderated. Many had their beginnings in a specific webzine – Drowned in Sound and Popjustice, for instance, set up forums using cheap or free bulletin-board software, and found that readers were desperate to join in the conversation. Others were set up to discuss particular topics or labels and expanded, some adding music talk later. Barbelith had its roots in the countercultural comics work of Grant Morrison, for instance. And some emerged in response to the perceived faults of existing sites – the late cultural critic Mark Fisher helped set up Dissensus in reaction to the cosiness he saw on other forums, while Hipinion became a backchannel for grudgeful indie journos. Each board had a somewhat different culture and taste. When critic Kelefa Sanneh wrote a New York Times article on “rockism”, a tendency of critics to assess music by how closely it conformed to the expressive, album-length virtues of the guitar rock canon, he drew on sprawling arguments from the I Love Music forum. Sanneh’s piece has been sparking tetchy rebuttals for 15 years. But on ILM itself the accusation of rockism was mostly a tactical ploy, a half-joking way to nudge conversation on to something less predigested than Astral Weeks or the Clash.  There was, after all, a whole world of music to hear. The rise of music forums took place alongside the rise of the mp3. For a while, until label crackdowns put paid to it, most threads would be studded with YouSendIt or MediaFire links for new tracks. They were places to find out what new music had leaked online, and to hear it communally, bouncing reactions and ideas off each other. These moments were music forums at their best, communities delighting in the hobby they loved. When an anticipated record emerged, threads would become a blizzard of instant reactions, jokes, theories, wild hyperbole and friendly argument. When I think of the giddy high points of early 00s pop – from Beyoncé’s Crazy in Love to the Knife’s Heartbeats – that surge of discussion is inseparable from the music and the dancing, all part of the excitement. A forum might collectively elevate some barely known newcomer, such as Annie, into a cult figure, or cling to its darlings long after the industry had given up on them deep down, I’m still waiting for one-hit R\u0026ampB wonder Cassie to get her due. And not every bet paid off. The last the world saw of country duo Big \u0026amp Rich, lauded by ILM for 2003’s Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy) they were playing at Trump’s Great America Alliance inauguration gala. For fans who had grown up reading the music press, unable to talk back, the chance to add to the babble was irresistible. It was also very modish. The early 00s heyday of music forums coincided with a wider buzz for the ideas of “online communities” and “the conversation”. “Markets are conversations”, proclaimed hip business book The Cluetrain Manifesto in 1999, helping to popularise the idea of the internet as a kind of digital souk, full of vibrant haggling, where opportunity lurked in every interaction. What people really wanted, the theory went, was to talk to brands, and to talk to each other about brands.  This idea flattered big corporations, who were keen to get involved. In 2001, for instance, Procter \u0026amp Gamble launched Toejam – Teens Openly Expressing Just About Me, a community designed to let teenagers “express themselves as members of their generation”. The firm’s previous attempt, Swizzle, closed when its members unaccountably rejected wholesome talk about brands and expressed themselves openly in sex chat and cyberbullying. Record labels, locked into an attritional battle with file-sharing and fearful of the web, preferred not to jump the Cluetrain. Sony and Universal had no interest in launching Toejams of their own. That helped give the music forums a niche. But the issues that bedevilled corporate forums affected the independent ones, too. There was trolling, stalking, abuse and fakery – the now familiar downside of online interaction. The culture of any internet platform grows out of what its users do and care about, but their behaviour is also guided by limits and defaults baked into the technology. What the platform lets its users do is important, but just as important is what the platform lets its moderators stop. And with the off-the-shelf bulletin board software that drove most music forums, admins had less power than they liked to pretend. On I Love Music, we would talk about banning unruly users, but had no ability to do anything but delete inidual posts. Any really determined abuser could get around whatever limits we imposed. To be a moderator was to wake up and find threads on pop bands flooded overnight with Japanese enema pics, or wearily deal with a new troll whose gimmick was pretending to be a werewolf. Music forums aligned themselves with the libertarian spirit of the pre-social media internet, the idea that open discussion was always a good, and that online communities would police themselves. That attitude was partly ideological, partly naive, and ultimately wrong, but it was also pragmatic. Given the real limits of what admins could do with the technology and time they had, they were always likely to lean towards being permissive. For a while, it worked. The forums were small and friendly enough to become virtual communities, happy to pick up electronic litter and give undesirables a wide berth. They developed their own habits and in-jokes – a gif of French pop star Alizée, or a picture of rapper Ma$e, used as proto-memes. They spawned offline meet-ups, where adults would awkwardly introduce one another as DJ Martian or the Pinefox. People came for the music and stayed for the friendship. This sense of belonging, like the passion for argument, is something music forums had learned from the old pop press, where part of the trick of Smash Hits or the NME was making readers feel they were part of a secret gang. Now you could hang out with the gang all day. But as the focus of online life shifted to Facebook, Twitter and other social networks, the music forums faded. Conviviality wasn’t an accidental by-product of these new platforms, it was their fuel. But perhaps their time will come again. Hip-hop discussion board Kanyetothe endures, as does the forum connected to audio engineer Steve Hoffman’s website. The social element of music is something streaming services have barely tried to exploit. Yes, your friends’ playlists drive your Spotify recommendations, but there’s no real way to geek out about them to one another, let alone meet new enthusiasts. The current experience of streaming is great at zooming in on you as an inidual, or subsuming you into a vast playlisted datamass. It can replicate a record collection or the radio. But the middle ground between inidual and mass – the small groups of friends who could thrill to or fight about new music – is entirely neglected. Many of the forums I’ve mentioned still exist, trundling along, quieter and more insular now, with a trickle of newcomers at best. And if music forums do come back, it’ll be to a less naive internet, one that recognises the problems of online platforms and how easily “conversation” can be a cover for harassment and abuse. Having experienced the venomous entitlement of fan mobs or self-proclaimed nerds, it’s hard to be hopeful about the prospects for geeky subcultural spaces. Encouragingly, patten’s 555-5555 board understands the issue – it proclaims a zero-tolerance for racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia.I hope they get it right: the music forums succeeded in being places for music lovers to thrive, but they were never as welcoming or erse as I had hoped they would be when I set one up. Running one, I eventually learned the lesson Twitter, Facebook and other platforms are struggling with: good intentions are never enough. Left to its own devices, any online community, whether small or huge, will reflect the society it’s built in. Making something better takes effort and intervention."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f87fbea9b64f7912d8e65dcd0bec9862f53cf0e8/97_0_2305_1383/master/2305.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64a2ad81f96dad7230bc9c90ba98e70e","title":"slam dunk festival review leeds","story":"Various venues, LeedsThousands of devotees descended on the alt-rock festival, lapping up everything from Chapel’s synthpop to Brutality Will Prevail’s anvil-heavy riffingSlam Dunk has come a long way from its origins as a club night in Leeds’ now defunct Cockpit. A staple fixture in the alternative rock calendar, the festival runs over three days at three sites – Leeds, Birmingham and Hatfield in Hertfordshire – with a travelling bill of more than 50 bands across eight stages. Leeds’ unsuspecting Saturday-afternoon shoppers must have thought the heat was making them see things as the city centre was invaded by 17,000 fans in various forms of punkish apparel, sporting everything from green hair to banana costumes, with a bright yellow “Bollocks to Brexit” sticker proving particularly popular. Sunshine, music and circle pits gave proceedings a carnival atmosphere, although two revellers took this too far and were arrested for climbing up a crane to get a better view of Scot rockers Twin Atlantic.Slam Dunk’s USP is officially “pop-punk, ska punk, hardcore and metalcore” but this year’s bill was a broad church that stretched from Chapel’s radio-friendly synthpop to the anvil-heavy riffing of Brutality Will Prevail, whose moniker is in full compliance with the Trade Descriptions Act. Queues, time clashes, the distance between stages and security searches on entry to each one meant that seeing a hit list of bands involved military planning, but there was a lot of music for a day ticket costing less than £50. Pop-punk fans were particularly spoilt for choice. In Leeds Arena, Four Year Strong’s hurtling Wasting Time (Eternal Summer) and headlining fellow perennials Good Charlotte prompted sing-songs at each end of the day. American bands dominate the genre, but from the unlikely pop-punk bastion of Eastbourne, fast-rising Roam’s rousing outdoor set culminated with the comical spectacle of someone crowdsurfing in a rubber dinghy.When pop-punk got generic, it was time to explore. “It’s taken me three bands to get here,” announced the former GallowsPure Love singer now fronting Frank Carter \u0026amp the Rattlesnakes, but he made the most of his arrival, sporting a leopard print faux fur coat for an entertaining Arena set that sounded like punk rock played by Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars. What was lacking – not in the crowd, but on every stage – was women. Slam Dunk doesn’t yet reflect the campaign for gender equality in festival lineups. Still, Dream State frontwoman CJ Gilpin rocked very hard and Pvris’s Lyndsey Gunnulfsen sang, played keyboards, guitar and drums in a lovely Arena set that ranged from dreamy and ethereal to big-chorused and thumpy. As the sun went down and spirits flagged, emo Millennium Square headliners Jimmy Eat World caught the mood perfectly with their melancholy songs and lifted it with their euphoric ones. The Middle, a genre classic, generated a 7,000-person sing-song.Slightly earlier, 150 people in Beckett University witnessed the performance of the day from Palaye Royale, whose livewire mix of hair metal, T Rex and the New York Dolls teetered thrillingly on the edge of chaos. The young Torontonians dressed up, rocked hard, threw guitars, fell over, rolled on the floor and had their small but devoted audience singing along ecstatically. When Iggy Pop-style singer Remington Leith clambered atop the speaker stack, he caused a panic among security staff, who were presumably grateful that he wasn’t anywhere near that crane."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0d9d2bf7edb2942d60d194777ce5b32ccead8e5/0_44_1798_1078/master/1798.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0db58ba5270d4fb116e1c83238c16b12","title":"off the wall pin up posters from glam to new wave","story":"From David Bowie to X-Ray Spex, Richard Hell to Suzi Quatro, a new book collates some of the best posters of the 1970s and 80s to be tacked up in teenage bedrooms everywhere"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9df8ab5a67c3ec0f9ce0fe6a81bbddcea5e71ba/0_0_5086_3391/master/5086.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54f634c75eeacb339c9332eac886b8ef 480w","title":"chris froome cycling bernard hinault giro ditalia","story":"Bernard Hinault has launched a stinging attack on Chris Froome, claiming the Team Sky rider should never have been on the Giro d’Italia start line owing to his anti‑doping battle.Froome joined Hinault and Eddy Mercx by becoming the third man in history to win three consecutive grand tour titles. The 32-year-old executed an extraordinary comeback to win the Giro d’Italia and add to his Tour de France and Vuelta a España victories from last year. Hinault claims Froome’s name should not be uttered alongside his own. “Froome does not belong on that list,” the 63-year-old Frenchman said, according to the Belgian newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws. “He should never have been allowed to start in the Giro.

On day three of his second visit to Roland Garros, De\u0026nbspMinaur – yet to reach 11st, standing a tad under 6ft and one of six teenagers in the draw – stuck doggedly to a muscular game that shone in bursts but ultimately played into Edmund’s unforgiving hands.While Edmund took less than two hours to win 6-2, 6-4, 6-3, the British No\u0026nbsp1 acknowledged on court that it was not as easy as the numbers might\u0026nbspsuggest.De\u0026nbspMinaur – the hustling young wildcard, who lives in Spain with his family and burst on to the scene in his native Australia in January – broke once from four chances but made inroads on his serve that stretched Edmund in the second set.“I played well, with intent,” Edmund said. “I knew the game style – me dictating the points, him making a lot of balls, forcing me to come up with the answers. I gave up too many points with errors in the second set, and double faults, but in the third set\u0026nbspI\u0026nbspgot it back.“Conditions were a little heavier at the start but, when the sun came out at the end, the ball was pinging off the court a bit more. Throughout the match my concentration was generally very good. It’s something that doesn’t come overnight, and he’s the sort of opponent who is really up for the battle if he gets a sniff.”Edmund has a day to rest before taking on the world No\u0026nbsp45 Marton Fucsovics, who defeated the Canadian Vasek Pospisil 6-3, 6-3, 7-6 (5) on Court No\u0026nbsp12. The 26-year-old Hungarian is coming off a win in the Geneva final against Peter Gojowczyk, who was beaten by Cameron Norrie on Monday.This was always going to be a tricky opening fixture for Edmund, even though he is protected from the tournament’s bigger beasts for a while by his 16th seeding. De\u0026nbspMinaur, who hits and chases with a flourish, refused to back down at any stage, which was both his strength and his weakness.Most of his success sprang from machine-gun thrashes and determined running-down of half-chances, but his potency dimmed as the lactic acid drowned out the adrenalin.He is Australia’s No\u0026nbsp5 and oozes promise. He has the rare gift of being able to compartmentalise the point, ignoring the one just wasted and embracing those left. He showed that tunnel vision when he was 3-1 down in the first set yet pushed Edmund in every rally, getting back to 2-5 before the favourite served out just on the\u0026nbsphalf‑hour.De Minaur, ahead in the serving cycle, moved through the early stages of the second set with renewed energy. He got break point in the second game but Edmund, unhappy with a line call,\u0026nbspwas fired up as he wrong-footed him with a rifled forehand on the way to a crucial hold.Edmund’s concentration dipped again and he found himself under pressure on his serve in the fourth game. But, as in the first set, he found the big guns when he needed them and levelled.His thin teenage foe struggled to maintain his buzzing tempo and Edmund broke for 3-2. They exchanged breaks in a knife-edge stretch illuminated by some brilliance on both sides of the net, before Edmund regathered his composure to serve out for a 2-0 lead – about the same time as Rafael Nadal was wrapping up a tense three‑setter in the tie-break against Simone Bolelli, held over from the previous evening.Edmund still had work to do but there was always going to be more weight left in his punch. And only after being broken in the third did De\u0026nbspMinaur begin to fade, recognising perhaps that he was banging his little fists up against a tank.As the sun finally shoved the clouds aside, Edmund held to love for 4-2 and despondency spread across De\u0026nbspMinaur’s young features, even as he continued to let the blows flow, the final one too long, bringing the fight to a merciful conclusion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3e4e4bcb02f524434bfd1b3e6255b5bdbfc65e0/0_63_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59b28719764613a99e4c947e4944f287","title":"cricket looks the loser after series of loose allegations from al jazeera","story":"The story goes that when the Australian Cricket Board knocked back Kerry Packer in 1976, Packer told them: “there’s a little bit of the whore in all of us, gentlemen, so name your price”. That line came to mind early on in al-Jazeera’s new documentary, Cricket’s Match-Fixers, when its undercover journalist, David Harrison, meets the alleged match‑fixer, Aneel Munawar, for the first time. Harrison asks Munawar if he ever has problems arranging fixes. “Actually,” Munawar tells him, “if you have the money, you will do anything.” Harrison opens up a suitcase full of cash and says: “I need to know from you what you are going to do to get that money, to earn it.”It turns out that what Munawar is willing to do to get Harrison’s money is tell him stories about how he has fixed two Tests. He says he has arranged to have three English players score a certain number of runs in a 10-over section of the Test between England and India at Chennai in 2016, and two Australian players to do a similar thing in Australia’s Test against India at Ranchi in 2017. According to the documentary, Munawar told Harrison’s middle-man in advance roughly how many runs would be scored in those two passages of play, and his predictions were right both times.The precise details of who was batting, when the passages of play occurred, and exactly how many runs were scored, have all been redacted. Which makes it impossible to say whether Munawar’s “fixes” were anything other than crude lies and clever guesses about how those passages of the Tests were going to play out. It is not really clear who’s conning who here, or what Harrison’s suitcase full of money is actually paying for. He thinks it has bought information about a fix, but given that his whole shtick is to present himself as a rube with a suitcase of money to lose, he may just have paid for a pair of tall stories.England seemed completely baffled to find they had been dragged into this. “Ridiculous,” said Joe Root, “outrageous” said Trevor Bayliss. The England and Wales Cricket Board released an emphatic denial in which the chief executive, Tom Harrison, said: “There is nothing we have seen that would make us doubt any of our players in any way whatsoever.” Australia’s captain, Tim Paine, said they were “unsubstantiated claims” and, just like Harrison, the Cricket Australia chief executive, James Sutherland, questioned the credibility of the evidence. Rightly so, given that al-Jazeera bought it off a self-proclaimed crook. Best, as Root said, to “leave it to the people in charge to look after, because I’m sure it’s nothing”.The people in charge are the ICC’s Anti‑Corruption Unit. It is going to be busy, because al-Jazeera bundled Munawar’s allegations up with two others from another source, one involving a scheme to doctor pitches in Galle, and another to set up a private league in Dubai. Five former cricketers, three of them internationals, appear on screen in this section of the film.Two of them, Jeevantha Kulatunga – who insists he is innocent and is threatening legal action – and Tharindu Mendis, have already been suspended by Cricket Sri Lanka, and so has the curator at Galle.It has been clear for some time that fixers are now going after people on the periphery of the game. Groundstaff who earn so little but who have so much influence over the conditions are an obvious target. The curator at Pune in India was suspended for failing to report an approach after being caught in a sting just last October, and there have been problems at Galle in the past, too, when a previous curator was suspended for two years after failing to cooperate with an ACU investigation.It is not just groundstaff. Two umpires were banned by Sri Lanka in 2013 after they were caught promising to help fix matches, and just last year Zimbabwe Cricket banned the treasurer of a regional cricket association because a bookie had persuaded him to try and recruit players into fixing a game against West Indies.Then there is the business of the new private league in Dubai, which was never actually launched but was allegedly being designed with the sole aim of enabling the organisers to fix games. And again this fits with what we already know, in that the ACU launched an investigation into a private T20 league in the United Arab Emirates in January this year.The problem is these three strands of the al-Jazeera investigation seem to contradict each other. Because the very reason that fixers have started exploring other ways to fix games, by going after groundstaff and setting up entirely new leagues is precisely because the security around international players is so much tighter.Al-Jazeera presumably presented the three cases together because it wanted to build the impression that, as Harrison says, “match‑fixing in cricket is more widespread than ever”. Which is not true, but is at least a good reason for being in James Pycroft’s account of fixing in the Victorian era, from his book, The Cricket Field, which he wrote in 1854.“Matches were bought, and matches were sold,” a former player tells Pycroft. But then another contradicts this: “You will find some to persuade you this is true, but don’t believe it.” Pycroft found that no one really knew who to believe. There was just too much scuttlebutt and innuendo. “Many was the time I have been blamed for selling when as innocent as a babe,” a player tells him. “In those days, when so much money was on the matches, every man who lost his money would blame someone. Then, if A missed a catch, or B made no runs – and where’s the player whose hand is always in? – that man was called a rogue.”Cricket cannot afford to blithely dismiss any of al-Jazeera’s accusations, and the ACU will investigate them all, but Pycroft’s book is a good reminder that loose allegations can damage the game too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5106512937eacc1b99f90ae7cbb72facaa657d45/1_0_4172_2504/master/4172.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a56ae0e85fd81d282d02c2346e8e1c4","title":"honor 10 premium smartphone huawei ai camera","story":"Huawei has another hit on its hands with a good balance of features, price and feel for £400 – if you forget the AI cameraThe Honor 10 is Huawei’s cut-price premium smartphone offering that hopes to go toe-to-toe with iPhones and Samsungs for about one-third less than the average price.Strangely, the Honor 10 is the second Honor phone with 10 in its name launched this year, following the Honor 10 View released in February, which has essentially the same specifications. The Honor 10 View is still on sale for £450, which is £50 more than the Honor 10, and has a slightly bigger screen.The Honor 10 follows the trend set by Samsung with the Galaxy S6 three years ago of having glass on front and back. The glass on the back is curved, the phone’s edges are polished metal, making it feel almost exactly like a Samsung Galaxy S8 or S9. It’s smooth, feels very well made and is undoubtedly the most premium-feeling Honor yet that belies its “budget” market positioning.The 5.84in LCD screen fills most of the front of the device, short of a fingerprint sensor at the bottom and a notch into the screen at the top containing a selfie camera, earpiece speaker and sensor. It is proving to be the “year of the notch” and the Honor 10 is bang on trend.The screen looks very good, with solid brightness and colours, and it is pretty crisp. It isn’t as good as Huawei’s OLED screen on its top-end P20 Pro, nor the OLED screen on the closer competitor OnePlus 6, but it is still a good-looking display and most will be very pleased with it.Positioning fingerprint scanners on the front of the device isn’t a new thing, but the Honor 10 has one of the first commercially available ultrasonic fingerprint scanners (most others are capacitive). As such there’s no groove or other physical marking separating it from the glass. It works with damp hands, but requires a much firmer press than capacitive scanners and was a little slower than the Honor 10 View’s traditional fingerprint reader.At 153g and 7.7mm thick the Honor 10 feels pretty light and slim, stacking up well compared with top-end competition. The thin bezels around the relatively small screen mean it’s also quite small for a modern smartphone, and therefore easy to handle. There’s a headphone jack in the bottom, which is becoming a rare feature.The Honor 10 has the same processor as the Honor 10 View, Huawei Mate 10 Pro and P20 Pro, but has a smaller amount of RAM with only 4GB compared to 6GB. You can notice the difference – the Honor 10 is a little slower when switching between apps, but on the whole is a fast and smooth device to use. You have to pay another £69 to buy a phone that feels faster.Battery life is great, but not quite class-leading, lasting about 32 hours between charges, starting up at 7am on day one and dying at 3pm on day two.That was while using it as my primary device, browsing and using apps for five hours while receiving hundreds of push emails and messages, watching 90 minutes of Netflix, taking about 20 photos and listening to seven hours of music via Bluetooth headphones.The Honor 10 runs Huawei’s modified version of Android called EMUI 8.1, based on the latest Android Oreo 8.1.It is essentially the same version as running on the Huawei P20 Pro, and very similar to every other recent Huawei phone, including the Mate 10 Pro and the Honor 10 View released earlier this year.EMUI looks like a cross between Android and Apple’s iOS. Out of the box it lacks Android’s app drawer, meaning every installed app has an icon on the homescreen, just like iOS, but there is an option to enable the drawer. Google Feed is available on the left-most homescreen pane, there’s a light customisation of notifications, but the big additions EMUI has over standard Android are power-saving features.For the most part these work very well – stopping apps from draining your battery in the background for example – but occasionally they will cause issues, stopping you receiving notifications or background functions. EMUI also handles the screen’s notch well, including the ability to hide it with an always-black status bar either side, just like the P20 Pro.The camera system on the Honor 10 is a bit of a mixed bag. On the back you have two cameras, one 16-megapixel and one 24-megapixel, which work in conjunction to produce images, simulate depth of field effects and other tricks.The cameras themselves are capable of producing some good photos. Low light isn’t the best, but it isn’t terrible either and on the whole the Honor 10 holds its own with the competition. The “AI camera” element is probably the worst bit.It’s meant to identify the scene and objects, but generally just produced photos that look like ultra-processed Instagram photos. It was particularly bad with grass, turning it highlighter green. I got much better results with it switched off.The selfie camera is good, but struggled to produce images that were pin sharp in dim indoor lighting.The Honor 10 comes in either blue, black or grey and costs £400.For comparison, the 6.28in OnePlus 6 costs £469 with 64GB of storage, the 6in Honor 10 View costs £450 with 128GB, the 6.1in Huawei P20 Pro costs £799 with 128GB, the 6in Huawei Mate 10 Pro costs £699 with 128GB, the 6.2in Samsung Galaxy S9+ costs £869 with 128GB, the 6in Google Pixel 2 XL costs £799with 64GB, and the 5.8in iPhone X costs £999 with 64GB.The Honor 10 is another example of an excellent smartphone that comes very close to matching the latest top-of-the-range phones, but costs significantly less. On the whole Huawei has cut the right corners to make the Honor 10 shine against the competition.Of course it isn’t perfect, and lacks wireless charging and water resistance. But it has many redeeming features, feeling every bit as good in the hand as a phone costing twice as much. The screen is good, the camera (if you turn off the AI mode) is good, performance and battery life are good, and it even still has a headphone socket.The Honor 10 is so good I’m not quite sure why you would buy Huawei’s other 5.8in phone with a notch, the P20, that costs another £179, which means Huawei is competing with itself. Compared to rivals, you have to spend another £69 to find a better phone in the OnePlus 6, meaning the Honor 10 is arguably the best phone you can get right now for £400.Cons: no water resistance, no wireless charging, AI often makes the camera worse, no Bluetooth 5 support, glass back more fragile than metal"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29fbb2f8547331911306715effeecb272054a304/92_232_3672_2203/master/3672.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee233c3662f0f714d78cfa382aa07742","title":"carlo cottarelli italy mr scissors gives markets jitters over fate eurozone","story":"The choice of Carlo Cottarelli as Italy’s caretaker prime minister is a massive political gambleCarlo Cottarelli will not be Italy’s first caretaker leader. Nor will he be the first technocrat to take over the reins of power in Rome. But he is the first to be handed the job by a supposedly apolitical president in defiance of the democratic will of the people as manifested in the support they gave for two populist parties in the recent March election.Hence the turmoil in the financial markets that greeted the controversial decision by Italy’s president – Sergio Mattarella – to invite Cottarelli to form a government. If the idea of appointing a safe pair of hands to be prime minister was to reassure jittery investors, the plan was not immediately successful. Italian bond yields – the interest rate paid on government borrowing – saw their biggest one-day jump since 1992.Those who voted for the Five Star Movement (M5S) and the Lega did so because they were fed up with austerity, fed up with two decades of nugatory growth, and fed up with a political establishment deemed to have run out of ideas. In those circumstances, the choice of Cottarelli – a former International Monetary Fund director with the nickname “Mr Scissors” due to his reputation for cutting public spending – is a massive political gamble.And not just for Italy. George Soros has warned that the eurozone faces an existential crisis, and he is not alone in thinking that. What’s more, any evidence of disintegration would have much wider ramifications. For years, financial markets have been wondering where the next global crisis will come from. A breakup of the euro caused by “Italeave” would certainly do the trick.Soros says Europe needs to reinvent itself and jettison its addiction to austerity. That, though, doesn’t seem remotely likely, judging by the remark of Germany’s European commissioner, Günther Oettinger, who said the markets would “teach the Italians to vote for the right thing”.Oettinger’s comments reflect the view in Brussels and Berlin that Italy can be given the same hardline treatment as Greece. The populist parties say a relaxation of the EU’s strict budget rules would lead to faster growth, but that is seen as unacceptable. The assumption is that sooner or later Italy will cave in, just as Greece did in 2015. Yet Italy is in a different category from its Mediterranean neighbour. It is much bigger and has never been comfortable as a member of the single currency. Growth is slow, living standards have stagnated, unemployment is high. Monetary union would have survived the departure of Greece it would not survive the loss of Italy.Italians still support the euro, although not as enthusiastically as they once did. Bringing back the lira would be disruptive and economically painful, which explains why neither M5S nor the Lega will make exiting the euro the centrepiece of their campaigns.Instead, they will argue that the next election will be about democratic legitimacy and the right of Italians to get the sort of government they want. Euro departure is very much a fallback option, but it is an option nonetheless. Which is why the markets are so nervous."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09070b32dfb60fe7a8ebd092088e112b6f17207f/56_108_2889_1733/master/2889.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2c66f0acbcc735af4c5be71e23a978b","title":"roman abramovich cannot work in uk israeli passport chelsea fc","story":"Roman Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea football club, who has faced difficulties obtaining a new UK visa, will not be allowed to work in Britain if he travels here on his new Israeli passport, Downing Street has said.It emerged on Monday that the formerly Russian-based billionaire, a regular presence in Britain since he bought Chelsea in 2003, had been granted Israeli citizenship and was moving to Tel Aviv.Abramovich, who had reportedly faced delays in renewing his UK visa, will be allowed to visit the UK visa-free for up to six months at a time with his Israeli passport, but cannot work in the country, Theresa May’s spokesman said.While stressing he could not comment on inidual cases, the spokesman outlined the general situation, saying: “Those with Israeli passports are non-visa nationals, which means they do not need a visa to come to the UK as a visitor for a maximum period of six months.”He added: “Israelis are required to obtain a visa if they want to live, work or study in the UK.” The spokesman said it was up to immigration authorities to monitor how these conditions were adhered to, and the Home Office would have more details on what could constitute work in such instances. The Home Office was contacted for details.Israel’s interior ministry confirmed the offer of citizenship on Monday. “Roman Abramovich arrived at the Israeli embassy in Moscow like any other person,” an Israeli government spokesperson said. “He filed a request to receive an immigration permit, his documents were checked according to the law of return, and he was indeed found eligible.”Israel grants citizenship to any Jewish person wishing to move there, and a passport can be issued immediately. Abramovich, who is Jewish and has been a regular visitor to Israel, has donated millions to Israeli research and development projects and invested in local firms. Abramovich has not commented on recent developments. However, it is believed he could have been asked to explain the source of his wealth before he could be granted a new UK visa.His previous tier-1 visa, which allows anyone who invests more than £2m in the British economy to stay for 40 months, was granted before tighter regulations were introduced in April 2015.Last week Downing Street said that while it could not comment on inidual cases, it was the “logical conclusion” that some wealthy iniduals who had applied under the investment visa route before the changes would no longer be eligible.The government launched a further crackdown on wealthy investors coming to the UK after the Salisbury poisoning, increasing tensions between Britain and Russia.

To critics, the deal is an example of an autocrat who runs one of the poorest countries in the world indulging a private passion while subsidising one of the richest clubs in world football. But to Kagame’s supporters and some in the marketing industry, it’s a canny move that is already getting people thinking about the impoverished country’s tourism industry, which offers lakeside resorts and walks with mountain gorillas – with one expert estimating that the £30m investment could help to bring in £300m of new revenue.“Rwanda wouldn’t have occurred to me as a place for tourism, so perhaps you do need to shock people,” said Kelvyn Gardner, the head of international development at the Licensing Industry Merchandisers’ Association. “What you’re buying with sponsorship it’s brand recognition. Football shirts can be overmonopolised by things like online gaming companies, so it will stand out.”In that time he has attempted to transform the mountainous central African country into a prosperous nation. The capital, Kigali, is largely safe and clean, with a construction boom that includes five star hotels. Despite this there are few dissenting voices in the media, limited political opposition and it remains one of the poorest countries in the world.Much of the development work locally has been assisted by aid from western nations, with British and Dutch politicians this weekend complaining that they are sending money to a country that is now supporting a high-profile football team. Clare Akamanzi, the Harvard-educated chief executive of the Rwanda Development Board, defended the agreement, saying the money for sponsorship came from a different pot from international aid. “Anyone who criticises our deal with Arsenal on account of Rwanda being poor or an aid recipient, either wishes for Rwanda to be perpetually so, or doesn’t understand that in any business marketing costs are a key component of a company’s expenditures,” she said, insisting the country is determined to double its revenue from tourism to $800m over the next six years.That said, the deal could be as beneficial within Rwanda itself as abroad. Premier League football is ever-present in the country, with countless radio phone-ins dedicated to the Premier League. Fans crowd into bars and betting shops to watch matches while local minibuses are covered in the colours of English teams – with the north London club among the favourites.“Many Rwandans, especially in urban areas, are fans of Arsenal,” explained Rwandan accountant Charles Sac, who is a supporter of Unai Emery’s side. “I think it’s entertainment and associated success involvement of black players in earlier years was a factor.”Sac said the reaction to the sponsorship deal had been positive in his country: “Rwandans were pleasantly surprised by the news and still excited.”As part of the deal Arsenal players will visit Rwanda to hold training camps, while the country’s logo will appear at the side of the pitch at the Emirates stadium and on the backdrops for post-match interviews.“This decision demonstrates Rwanda’s continuing reorientation from a francophone to an anglophone country,” said Timothy Longman, a professor at Boston University and author of Memory and Justice in Post-Genocide Rwanda.“The group that dominates Rwandan politics, society, and economics today grew up mostly in refugee camps in Uganda, They brought back to Rwanda with them a connection to many things associated with Britain, including Premier League football.”He speculated that while the decision “may be popular with the English-speaking elite in Kigali” many Rwandans could think of a better use for the money. Regardless, at least one person will be happy. Earlier this month Kagame delivered his verdict on Arsenal’s recent performance after they were knocked out of the Europa League by Atlético Madrid.He said the defeat “should not have been the kind of ending of an era” but insisted their recent lack of trophies was “long coming”.“Blame the owners,” Kagame concluded, shortly before his country signed the sponsorship deal."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Murdered 18-year-old Co Louth student remembered as kind, funny and gentle personGovernment says UK\u0026rsquos exit from the bloc has \u0026lsquoundoubtedly\u0026rsquo influenced spike in demandMercury passes 25 degrees in Newport in Mayo, Moorepark in Cork and Markree, Co SligoVaradkar says he and Simon Harris both want CervicalCheck records handed overJudge says garda let down her Garda colleagues and her communityTD applauded by colleagues after impassioned speech during first D\u0026aacuteil sitting since referendumBookmaker was driving to race meeting when car halted by a number of armed menMan in his 20s detained over death of English man during a holiday to Co MayoThose affected, between 1946 and 1969, had adoptive parents wrongly registered as birth parentsD\u0026oacutenall \u0026Oacute Cual\u0026aacutein says deaths of Ana Kriegel, Jastine Valdez, Cameron Reilly \u0026lsquoappalled public\u0026rsquoColm O\u0026rsquoBriain had sleepless nights, suicidal thoughts after perceived error, inquest toldWoman is arrested after car mounts footpath following a fight between four menJudge says comments made in phone calls heard during case show stress bankers facedTaoiseach warns that clinical guidelines will need to be drawn up as well as legislationFormer Garda press chief withdraws series of claims he made about N\u0026oacuteir\u0026iacuten O\u0026rsquoSullivanAn Post launches competition to decide Christmas stamp themesThe proportion of cases reporting problem use of opiates has steadily decreased since 2010Senior Conservatives call for free vote in on Labour bill to extend abortion rights to Northern IrelandFormer Garda commissioner tells tribunal she could not recall sexual allegations being discussed until late 2014"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3513041.1527621230!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit aids surge in irish passport applications","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Department of Foreign Affairs has appealed to people to renew passports online.The UK’s exit from the European Union next year has “undoubtedly” contributed to a 25 per cent spike in applications for Irish passports, the Department of Foreign Affairs has said.The number of applications in the first four months of this year has increased by 25 per cent when compared with the figures for the same period in 2016.The department said the Passport Office, which falls under its remit, was currently experiencing “peak season”, adding that the number of applications received is up by 10 per cent compared with last year, continuing a recent trend.Each year, the Passport Office recruits additional temporary staff to assist with the seasonal increase in applications. This year, sanction was received for 220 temporary clerical officers to assist permanent staff in processing applications.“The increase in the volume of applications is undoubtedly in part influenced by Brexit-related demand, with around 10 per cent of all applications this year from applicants living in Great Britain,” the department said in response to queries.“However, there are also other drivers of demand, including a trend towards early renewal of passports, a growth in outbound travel, and a growing population.”As of the end of April, more than 276,000 passports had been issued since the turn of the year. In the same period, 39,000 passport applications were received from applicants residing in Northern Ireland, and more than 41,000 were received from applicants residing in Britain.The department said that in addition to taking on temporary staff, the Passport Office was working to improve services, including plans to expand the online renewal project, as part of its response to increasing application volumes. It said iniduals seeking to renew their passport should do so online, as waiting times for this service had been reduced significantly in recent years.“Adults renewing their passports are strongly encouraged to renew their passport online,” it said. “The online passport application service is fast, convenient and secure, and is processing applications in 10 working days, plus postage time.“In fact, in 50 per cent of cases, the processing time is currently down to five working days. “Applicants can apply from anywhere in the world, with no need for a paper form, witness or printed photos. Renewal applications received through Passport Express are currently processed in 16 working days.”It also said that applications from first-time applicants, as well as from those with loststolen passports, take longer to process.“For these categories of applications, robust identity verification and entitlement checks, as well as vital fraud and security procedures, are necessary to ensure that the integrity and security of the Irish passport is maintained,” it said. “These checks take additional time to complete.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"joyous and tearful scenes in dublin castle as eighth amendment to be repealed","story":"  May 27, 2018Ireland has voted No to tribalism and fear in overwhelming decision to remove the Eighth   May 27, 2018Thirty-five years after its introduction, Eighth Amendment repealed after bitter campaign   May 28, 2018Cheers and tears greeted the verdict \u0026ndash a just reward for decades fighting the good fight "},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord it took 35 years to build this stunning result","story":"Thirty-five years after it was placed into the Constitution, the electorate voted for the Eighth Amendment to be repealed and for provision be made for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day.

The CBI, the Institute of Directors, the British Chambers of Commerce, the Small Business Federation and the EFF, the manufacturers’ organisation, want the UK prime minister to “get on” with the enlargement of Heathrow airport. A vote had been planned before parliament’s summer recess in July. If the deadline passes, the dread is a political class too lost in the next stage of Brexit to address the footling matter of national (in Heathrow’s case, global) infrastructure.Notice what the employers fear is trickling away here: not support for their cause, but the time and space for it. May wants an expanded Heathrow. The Conservatives made it a manifesto pledge last year. The parliamentary votes can, with effort, be assembled. What troubles business is Brexit’s potential to crowd out the project, as it does so much else.The parable of Heathrow illuminates Britain’s predicament since 2016. History might come to record the real cost of Brexit as all the other things not done. A generation of MPs, civil servants and public intellectuals are engaged with one open-ended mission. It is where they must spend their energies and political capital.People who entered public service to reform the economy or see the National Health Service through the costly dotage of the baby boomers will lose vital years to the dry work of unmooring from the EU and recreating the best bits of it. Even if the direct cost of exit turns out to be as exaggerated as Leavers suggest, the opportunity cost is, if anything, underplayed.A sense of those forgone opportunities is free to read online. In Square Deal, the Conservative MP Nick Boles has written a programme for national renewal that touches on healthcare, housing and employment. His muse is the US presidency of Theodore Roosevelt, who neutered the appeal of America’s early 20th-century populists with his own blend of active government, popular capitalism and assertiveness abroad. There is in Square Deal the filling, not just the outlines, of an electable form of Toryism.The difference is that Roosevelt’s federal government was not occupied with a huge constitutional project. Reformers closer to home, namely the prime ministers Clement Attlee (after 1945) and Margaret Thatcher (in the 1980s), had the same good fortune to govern while the basic rules of state did not constitute a distraction. The next prime minister who will be able to do the same is probably not in parliament yet.It is possible that the “next election will not be defined by Brexit”, as Boles predicts, but the business of state still might be. Twelve years passed between Britain’s first application to join the European project in 1961 and its ultimate accession in 1973. It would be no shock if, in 2028, 12 years after the vote to leave, Britain were still negotiating features of its relationship with an EU that is itself in flux.The political, diplomatic, technical and intellectual work that goes into the management of this bilateral tie will allow for few other undertakings of real weight. And even this does not budget for the emotional rawness of an electorate that is ided on the matter. Would the nation tolerate another round of isive change on, say, housing?Leavers will contest this neat line between constitutional change and the “real” work of government. They see the EU’s curbs on a member state’s freedom of action as the true block on domestic reform. A bold government must be sovereign in the first place. But even leaving aside the obvious rejoinder (which Thatcherite idea was stymied by Brussels?), there are only so many hours in a day and only so many high-risk ventures the public will bear in one phase of history. Central to politics is the picking of battles, and Britain has picked an all-absorbing one.It is a lapse into mawkishness to say that the best minds of their generation are being wasted on a fool’s errand. The best minds are not in parliament, Whitehall or the commentariat. Nor can anyone be certain that Brexit will look foolish in a decade’s time. What is going to waste is what the modern argot obliges us to call “bandwidth”.Britain has not the time or energy for much besides Brexit. It volunteered for a new challenge before fixing such old ones as productivity and infrastructure. If a third runway at Heathrow is to be a good idea postponed, it will not be the only one.These are the Lost Years. We can but guess how many of them there will be, and what we might have done with them instead. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018"},{"url":null,"title":"hawaiis erupting kilauea volcano

pigeon eggs devastate bordeaux vineyards","story":"A violent storm left vines damaged and without leaves in this vineyard in Macau, near Bordeaux Hailstorms have devastated thousands of acres of prime Bordeaux vineyards, prompting the French government to promise support for winegrowers, some of whom have lost their entire crop.Cyril Giresse, a winegrower, said hailstones “the size of pigeons’ eggs” destroyed grape buds and left vines bare on Saturday.“The storm lasted only about 15 minutes, but in some places, there’s nothing left at all,” said Mr Giresse, who runs the Château Gravettes Samonac in Bordeaux’s Côtes de Bourg appellation. “No leaves, no grapes, just the vines stripped as if the grapes had all been picked.”Jean-Dominique Château, another claret producer, said: “I’ve got nothing left. I’ve been growing grapes for 33 years and this is the worst storm I’ve ever seen. Last year we lost 40 per cent of our crop to hail but this year it’s going to be an even worse disaster.”A series of storms in the Bordeaux region has ruined dozens of vineyardsStéphane Travert, the agriculture minister, said the government was assessing the extent of losses and would aid wine producers. “We’ll take the necessary measures and we’re ready to meet Bordeaux winemakers,” he said.Franck Jullion, the head of the producers’ association in the “Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux” appellation, said: “It’s a desolate vista, as if the vines had gone back to winter. Estates hit by frost last year will not recover. We’re going to need a lot of support and solidarity.”Saint-Emilion, one of the most prestigious Bordeaux appellations, was spared, but parts of Médoc were badly hit, as were Cognac brandy producers in the Charente and Charente-Maritime departments.Didier Gontier, director of the Côtes de Bourg appellation, said: “Winegrowers say they’ve got no vines left for next year so this is going to affect two years of production.”  Bordeaux produces more than 700 million bottles of claret a year,Bordeaux is France’s largest wine-growing area, with about 300,000 acres of vineyards producing more than 700 million bottles of claret a year, ranging from cheap table wines to some of the world’s most acclaimed and expensive vintages.French wine and spirits exports amounted to more than £11 billion last year. Wine industry leaders have opposed moves to tighten 1991 laws restricting alcohol advertising. President Emmanuel Macron has backed them, saying he drinks wine at lunch and dinner. He has infuriated doctors by minimising public health concerns over wine and arguing that spirits and beer pose more of a problem because they are favoured by binge-drinkers.Please review our commenting policyPapua New Guinea blocks Facebook for a month to assess impact on societySNP minister claims Brexit could turn Scottish farms into moss and brackenRoseanne Barr\u0026#39s sitcom cancelled after her Twitter rant comparing Obama adviser to an apeComment: You might not like it but Donald Trump is right about America\u0026#39s \u0026#39fake news media\u0026#39Comment: Mamoudou Gassama\u0026#39s heroism is a reminder that we\u0026#39re all capable of more than we imagine  Three Israeli soldiers wounded as dozens of mortars fired from Gaza in heaviest barrage since 2014 warRuth Davidson urges Conservatives to make NHS funding a higher priority than tax cutsComment: Vegans aren\u0026#39t interested in compromise: they would rather farmers like me didn\u0026#39t existAustria plans to cut benefits for non-German speaking immigrantsEDL founder jailed for contempt of court after broadcasting tirade on FacebookRival Libyan leaders in Paris agree to hold elections in DecemberBoris Becker and wife Lilly separate after nine years of marriageCycling must be made more attractive to BME audience, commissioner announces as he says ersity targets should be introducedSkeleton of Roman beheaded by giant flying rock slab found at PompeiiFlash floods turn M2 \u0026#39into a river\u0026#39 as Britain battles storm which could see two inches of rain fall in just a few hoursHollywood revenge porn: jilted boyfriend sent naked pictures of his ex to her film company boss in California, court hears My son died in Grenfell inferno because we followed fire brigade advice, father tells inquestWorld Health Organization cautiously optimistic about Ebola responseDonald Tusk tells EU officials to \u0026#39stop lecturing Italian voters\u0026#39 for supporting Eurosceptic partiesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"prosecco no longer considered luxury experts say","story":"Sales of the Italian fizz have boomed in recent years as it successfully overtook Champagne as a toast at weddings, birthdays and other special occasionsBritain has reached peak prosecco because it is no longer seen as a luxury, figures suggest.Sales of the Italian fizz have boomed in recent years as it successfully overtook champagne as a toast at weddings, birthdays and other special occasions.But now, for the first time, prosecco\u0027s seemingly unstoppable climb is slowing, according to accountancy group UHY Hacker Young.Last year saw the smallest sales rise since 2011, amid a rising cost of imports from Italy and France because of sterling\u0027s weakness, it found.Some 35.8 million gallons of sparkling wine were sold during the past year, an increase of 5 per cent on the previous 12 months.UHY Hacker Young suggested that prosecco may be suffering from brand overexposure through overstocking at supermarkets.Prosecco has lost its luxurious edge due to over marketing in supermarkets, experts saySpokesman James Simmonds said: A five per cent increase in sales is not at all bad but that comes after several years of double-digit growth.Unless the industry can revitalise its image this year, we may now be reaching \u0027peak prosecco\u0027. It is hard for a luxury product to make the leap into the mass market without losing its reputation for exclusivity.A lot of English wine producers are now vying to capture the space left, as prosecco moves to the mainstream.Meanwhile the English wine market is booming and gearing up to give prosecco and champagne a run for their money in the global market.Partly fueled by business experts looking for a change of scenery, a record 64 new wine producers and vineyards launched their businesses last year, a 73pc increase compared to 2015.Crémant vs crémant - the new fizz warsWine producers in England are expected to plant more than 1 million vines over the next 12 months, which will result in some 2 million more bottles of English wine being made each year, according to data from industry body English Wine Producers.Also gaining popularity are French crémant sparkling wines, which have muscled in on the party circuit and are challenging the domination of the old favourite fizzes.In the first two months of the year Waitrose saw its crémant sales increase by 28 per cent on last year, peaking on Valentines Day as shoppers opted for it as an alternative to other bubbly.SNP minister claims Brexit could turn Scottish farms into moss and brackenRoseanne Barr\u0026#39s sitcom cancelled after her Twitter rant comparing Obama adviser to an apeComment: You might not like it but Donald Trump is right about America\u0026#39s \u0026#39fake news media\u0026#39Comment: Mamoudou Gassama\u0026#39s heroism is a reminder that we\u0026#39re all capable of more than we imagine  Three Israeli soldiers wounded as dozens of mortars fired from Gaza in heaviest barrage since 2014 warRuth Davidson urges Conservatives to make NHS funding a higher priority than tax cutsComment: Vegans aren\u0026#39t interested in compromise: they would rather farmers like me didn\u0026#39t existAustria plans to cut benefits for non-German speaking immigrantsEDL founder jailed for contempt of court after broadcasting tirade on FacebookRival Libyan leaders in Paris agree to hold elections in DecemberBoris Becker and wife Lilly separate after nine years of marriageCycling must be made more attractive to BME audience, commissioner announces as he says ersity targets should be introducedSkeleton of Roman beheaded by giant flying rock slab found at PompeiiFlash floods turn M2 \u0026#39into a river\u0026#39 as Britain battles storm which could see two inches of rain fall in just a few hoursHollywood revenge porn: jilted boyfriend sent naked pictures of his ex to her film company boss in California, court hears My son died in Grenfell inferno because we followed fire brigade advice, father tells inquestWorld Health Organization cautiously optimistic about Ebola responseDonald Tusk tells EU officials to \u0026#39stop lecturing Italian voters\u0026#39 for supporting Eurosceptic partiesHow Italy faces a long summer of political turmoil as furious populists demand fresh electionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/28/TELEMMGLPICT000164866705_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"regular meetings ruin productivity workers worry running late","story":"Staff anticipating a meeting mentally subtract the time they have availableRegular meetings ruin productivity because workers are constantly worried about running late, a study has found.Staff anticipating a meeting - or people expecting a friend for dinner - mentally subtract up to 30 per cent of the time they have available.Scientists found that having created an unnecessary buffer “in case something comes up”, people perform fewer tasks, or smaller tasks, than if their next appointment was not looming over them.Researchers at Ohio state University’s Fisher College of Business asked participants how long they could spend reading an hour before an appointment for which they were fully prepared.  Respondents said they had 50 minutes available, and even said that subjectively it felt like they had only 40 minutes..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}You don’t feel like you can get as much done when you have a task coming up soon.

Since 2014, it has been split between competing political and military groups based in Tripoli and the east.The four leaders included prime minister Fayez al-Sarraj, head of the UN-backed unity government in Tripoli, and 75-year-old military strongman Khalifa Haftar, whose Libyan National Army dominates the country\u0027s east.Also present were Aguila Saleh Issa, the parliament speaker based in the eastern city of Tobruk who opposes the UN-backed administration, and Khalid Al-Mishri, the newly-elected head of the High Council of State.Tunisia President Beji Caid Essebsi (L) stands with French President Emmanuel Macron as they bid farewell at the International conference on Libya held in Paris on May 29, 2018. All four agreed verbally to the eight-point joint statement, without signing, as originally planned.It calls for the immediate unification of the central bank and the phasing out of parallel government and institutions. It commits to supporting the creation of a national army and discussing the issue in Cairo.The parties have committed to set the constitutional basis for elections and adopt the necessary electoral laws by September 16, 2018 and hold Parliamentary and Presidential elections on December 10, 2018, the statement said.Europe sees restoring stability to Libya as vital to stemming jihadist threats and migration flows from the country, from whose shores hundreds of thousands of Africans have tried to reach Europe in recent years.There is no solution other than via you, Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi told the leaders. If things go badly, it\u0027s your responsibility.President Emmanuel Macron of France hailed the conference as “historic” for bringing the rivals together around the same table for the first time, and said the final agreement was an essential step toward reconciliation”.Rivals suspect France of favouring Libya Chief of Staff, Marshall Khalifa Haftar, whose rival Libyan National Army dominates the country\u0026#39s eastHowever, analysts and diplomats advised caution regarding swift hopes of progress on the ground.“It’s positive that they brought together four people from very ergent camps, four big personalities to agree to these set of principles, even if they didn’t sign anything,” said Libya political analyst Tarek Megerisi.“But I think we shouldn’t be overly convinced that this is a sign of meaningful progress. Even last year’s Paris conference when Haftar and Fayez did sign sign something it turned out to not mean much on the ground,” he told the . “And if you look at the set of principles signed, they still leave many vagaries, and many areas where not only these four personalities but other stakeholders on the ground in Libya who either refused to come or were not invited will still fight over formalising and seeing how or whether elections can be held at the end of the year.“So a nice start, but I’m not holding my breath.”There are security concerns for elections given the amount of arms swilling around Libya. The situation is muddied by competing interests among Middle Eastern countries, which have sometimes backed opposing sides in the fighting, as well as rivalry between European states.Some rivals within Libya suspect France of favouring Mr Haftar, a military strongman who has fought Islamist militias and who was recently treated in a Parisian hospital for an undisclosed ailment.Some in Rome have intimated that the French president deliberately held the conference at a time when Italy, which has major oil interests in Libya, is in political turmoil.Mr Macron referred to foreign countries pulling strings behind a curtain but claimed that Tuesday\u0027s agreement had rallied all regional players.I\u0027m optimistic, said Ghassan Salame, the UN envoy to Libya, at the end of the talks.“It\u0027s the Libyans who agree all together in our presence. This is crucial,” he said, adding that he had “never seen such convergence between the Libyan popular will and the international will”.SNP minister claims Brexit could turn Scottish farms into moss

beheaded giant flying rock slab found pompeii","story":"The Roman man was crushed by a giant slab of rock at Pompeii The skeleton of a Roman man who was decapitated by a giant slab of rock has been discovered by archeologists in Pompeii.They believe the man, aged in his thirties, was attempting to flee the eruption of Mt Vesuvius when the 300kg rock slammed into him, beheading him and killing him instantly.He had struggled to escape the doomed city because he had an infection in his leg.Archeologists found the rock sticking out of the ground at an angle, with the remains of the man protruding and intact from the chest down.The rock, which they think may have been part of a stone doorway, was hurled into the air by the force of the eruption, which devastated Pompeii in AD79.Archeologists say the man was fleeing the eruption but was impeded by a leg bone infectionThe skeleton was uncovered in an area of new excavations, close to a newly-discovered alleyway of houses with balconies.Massimo Osanna, the director general of the archaeological site, called the discovery dramatic and exceptional.“A formidable stone block (perhaps a door jamb), violently thrown by the volcanic cloud, collided with his upper body, crushing the highest part of the thorax and yet-to-be-identified head, which probably lies under the stone block,” archeologists said in a statement.The experts found lesions on his tibia which indicate a serious bone infection.That “could have caused significant walking difficulties, enough to impede the man\u0027s escape at the first dramatic signs which preceded the eruption,” they said.Earlier this month, archeologists made another unusual discovery – the carbonised remains of a horse which died during the eruption of Vesuvius.The remains of a Roman horse were found earlier this monthThe horse was found in the remains of a large Roman villa, which tomb raiders had been excavating illegally in search of artefacts and valuables.By pumping plaster into the space where the horse was found, experts produced an accurate cast of the animal.It was the first time that a cast was made of a horse at Pompeii – the technique has previously been used for the human victims of the cataclysmic eruption.Experts believe the horse was used in military parades and ceremonies.It was found in the remains of a stable attached to the villa.Please review

The WHO acknowledged however, that identifying all potential contacts remains challenging.  Since the start of the current outbreak earlier this month, 54 cases -  including 35 confirmed instances - of the disease have been reported, mostly in the remote areas of Bikoro and Iboko in the country’s north-west Equateur province. Twenty-five people have died. No new cases have been reported in the past two days. Although only a minority of cases have been reported in Mbandaka, the vaccination effort has to date focused on the densely populated city of 1.2 million due to fears the number of Ebola cases could rise rapidly in an urban environment.Dr. Salama said that take up of the vaccine among people deemed to be at risk of the disease has been high. “The vaccine is proving to be a very acceptable intervention to the community,” said Dr. Salama.He acknowledged however, that the WHO and partner agencies were “still at an early stage in this outbreak response”. He said: “We can’t conclude that we have safeguarded the city of Mbandaka.” Dr Salama did not rule out the possibility of further cases in the city.   The WHO is now expanding the vaccination campaign into the rural areas at the centre of the outbreak. On Monday, WHO began vaccinations in Bikoro, where the outbreak was first declared.  The WHO is also expecting to receive approval in the next few days from the government of the DRC to use five new drugs on patients in Ebola treatment centres. The drugs are all unregistered and will be used as part of a clinical trial.  Dr. Salama said that it was not a simple effort to do this kind of trial in this kind of environment. The WHO hopes that the trial will pave the way for future Ebola treatment efforts. Earlier this month, WHO experts concluded that the current Ebola outbreak did not constitute a “public health emergency of international concern. The health agency is however, continuing to monitor potential locations, including 80 ports on the Congo river in DRC and neighbouring Republic of Congo for new cases of the disease.The current outbreak in the DRC is the worst outbreak of Ebola since the 2014 - 2015 outbreak which killed  11,300 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health SecuritySNP minister claims Brexit could turn Scottish farms into moss and brackenRoseanne Barr\u0026#39s sitcom cancelled after her Twitter rant comparing Obama adviser to an apeComment: You might not like it but Donald Trump is right about America\u0026#39s \u0026#39fake news media\u0026#39Comment: Mamoudou Gassama\u0026#39s heroism is a reminder that we\u0026#39re all capable of more than we imagine  Three Israeli soldiers wounded as dozens of mortars fired from Gaza in heaviest barrage since 2014 warRuth Davidson urges Conservatives to make NHS funding a higher priority than tax cutsComment: Vegans aren\u0026#39t interested in compromise: they would rather farmers like me didn\u0026#39t existAustria plans to cut benefits for non-German speaking immigrantsEDL founder jailed for contempt of court after broadcasting tirade on FacebookRival Libyan leaders in Paris agree to hold elections in DecemberBoris Becker and wife Lilly separate after nine years of marriageCycling must be made more attractive to BME audience, commissioner announces as he says ersity targets should be introducedSkeleton of Roman beheaded by giant flying rock slab found at PompeiiFlash floods turn M2 \u0026#39into a river\u0026#39 as Britain battles storm which could see two inches of rain fall in just a few hoursHollywood revenge porn: jilted boyfriend sent naked pictures of his ex to her film company boss in California, court hears My son died in Grenfell inferno because we followed fire brigade advice, father tells inquestDonald Tusk tells EU officials to \u0026#39stop lecturing Italian voters\u0026#39 for supporting Eurosceptic partiesHow Italy faces a long summer of political turmoil as furious populists demand fresh electionsWomen and children among 10 beheaded in gruesome attack amid Islamist insurgency in MozambiqueWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"cities highest salaries earn most world wage countries","story":"The world\u0027s\u0026nbspcities where earners take home the most money every monthEvery May, Deutsche Bank releases its annual “Mapping the world’s prices” report, cataloguing the cost of goods and services in a cross section of the world’s biggest and most powerful cities.To determine the cost of living all over the globe, the bank looks at everything from the cost of a packet of cigarettes to how much the average rent costs on a two-bedroom apartment.One factor Deutsche’s survey examines is how much people earn on average every month.

There is a rising interest\u0027Parents are raising funds to fit air purifiers in schools to protect their children from air pollution. More state schools are looking to install purifier units, which cost between £1,000 and £5,000 per classroom, amid growing concern about the impact of dirty air on children’s health. Last year, Notting Hill Preparatory School, a private school in west London, fitted high-tech air purifiers – and now parents of state school children are crowdfunding for similar devices. Parents should be banned from parking at school gates, charity saysChristian Lickfett, managing director of Commercial Air Filtration, which installs air purifiers, said he was working with state schools but most of his requests were from private schools. “Parents have a greater awareness of airborne contaminants and children are among the most vulnerable,” Mr Lickfett said. “There is a rising interest.”Parent Kimberley Hickman, who is raising funds to set up air purifiers in her son’s school in London, told The Times that it was unfair that state school pupils were less likely to receive protection. Speaking to The Independent, Ms Hickman, who has a son with asthma at Goose Green Primary School in East Dulwich, said: “Funding is always going to be tighter in state schools. It is a given.”But she added that local councils and the government have funding available to support environmentally-friendly schemes – including setting up air purifiers in state schools. “Once one school does it, you will see others follow suit,” said Ms Hickman, who works part-time at the schools as a fundraiser.  UK news in picturesUK news in picturesA view at Westminster Abbey from the medieval Triforium that is hosting an exhibition in London.

Is the adoption of other people\u0027s customs and cultures fair game or has political correctness gone mad?\u0026nbspDavid Barnett treads warily\u0026nbspLet’s get this out of the way: I am a straight, white, middle-aged man, so what follows you may take with a pinch of salt or disregard completely. But we’re going to talk, you and I, about the thorny issue of cultural appropriation.It was only a year ago that Oxford Dictionaries put the phrase into their official lexicons, with the definition, “the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society.”Cultural appropriation is sometimes so blatant it smacks us in the face. The Black and White Minstrel Show ran on British television for – what seems now to us, looking back at it – and astonishing 20 years, from 1958.Even halfway through its run the show, in which white entertainers “blacked up” to sing songs in a Deep South of America style, was the subject of petitions calling for it to be taken off the air because of its in-your-face racism. It can hardly be seen now without an overwhelming feeling of embarrassment. How did we ever think that was acceptable?The show was harking back to the minstrel shows in 19th-century America, and blackface was a popular form of entertainment until the enlightenment of the 1960s, coupled with rising racial tensions across the US, finally put paid to it. Even Al Jolson, dubbed “the world’s greatest entertainer”, was renowned for performing in blackface. Jolson was Jewish, and while there can never be any excuses made today for blacking up, it’s interesting that in their 2008 book the Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, authors Stephen Harlan Norwood and Eunice G Pollack talk of Jolson’s 1927 movie The Jazz Singer in terms which suggest some kind of what we would today call intersectionality. For example: “Is there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not…The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world\u0027s history.”Can a Jewish man really pretend to be a black man without racism? Is this cultural appropriation of the very worst kind or solidarity that only two historically subjugated peoples can appreciate? And what, then, of a Jewish woman who dresses up as a Japanese woman for entertainment?The cries of “cultural appropriation” were resounding around social media even before Netta Barzilai had finished her (ultimately competition-winning) performance of Toys, the Israeli entry in this month’s Eurovision song contest held in Lisbon.Netta wore a stylised kimono and was surrounded by dozens of maneki neko waving lucky cat statues. Twitter in particular was rather exercised by the thought of the cultural appropriation taking place before its very eyes. Or, I should say, mainly white Western Twitter. It seems the only people not too fussed were the Japanese themselves.According to the website soranews24, which repackages and discusses Japanese news stories for an English speaking audience, the overwhelming response on the ground seems to be a mildly nonplussed reaction.The site quoted from Japanese social media accounts which included the responses, “Culture is meant to be stolen. If it’s not worth stealing, then it isn’t culture”, “If people keep claiming ‘cultural appropriation’ then people will not touch our culture. Then, people will not understand our culture and it will be easier to become our enemy”, and, perhaps crucially, “Westerners care too much about silly things”.Is that the problem? Are we, Westerners, liberal Westerners, too over-sensitive of the feelings of others brought on by white guilt? Or are we right to call out what we think is wrong when we see it? Should we wait before speaking, to see what the actual people affected think? Or is it our duty to step in first?Perhaps it’s now we should go back to the Oxford Dictionaries definition of cultural appropriation, particularly the bit that talks about the “more dominant people or society”. Is Israel a more dominant culture than Japan? Or vice-versa? What do we think? What do they think?A couple of weeks before Eurovision, Eastern dress was setting Twitter alight again, this time when a Utah teenager posted online pictures of her wearing her prom dress which was actually a qipao, traditional Chinese dress. The 18-year-old was accused of cultural appropriation and casual racism. People of Chinese heritage chimed in with arguments on both sides of the debate, with some pointing out that the outfit was originally worn by women carrying out domestic duties, and thus not something to be really celebrated, and another writing, “I’m Asian and Chinese, you looked beautiful in that dress, I’m sorry you got bashed for it.”Cyprus\u0027 singer Eleni Foureira performs the song FuegoIsrael\u0027s singer Netta performs the song Toy Belgium\u0027s singer Sennek performs the song A Matter Of Time Estonia\u0027s singer Elina Nechayeva performs the song La ForzaCroatia\u0027s singer Franka performs the song Crazy Albania\u0027s singer Eugent Bushpepa performs the song MallCzech Republic\u0027s singer Mikolas Josef performs the song Lie To MeIreland\u0027s singer Ryan O\u0027Shaughnessy performs the song TogetherSwiss duo ZIBBZ\u0027s singer Corinne Gfeller performs the song StonesBulgarian group Equinox\u0027 singer Zhana Bergendorff (R) performs the song BonesLithuania\u0027s singer Ieva Zasimauskaite performs the song When We\u0027re OldFinland\u0027s singer Saara Aalto performs the song MonstersGreece\u0027s singer Yianna Terzi performs the song Oniro MouAustria\u0027s singer Cesar Sampson performs the song Nobody But YouAzerbaijan\u0027s singer Aisel performs the song X My HeartIceland\u0027s singer Ari Olafsson performs the song Our ChoiceArmenia\u0027s singer Sevak Khanagyan performs the song QamiMacedonian duo Eye Cue\u0027s lead vocalist Marija Ivanovska (R) and guitarist Bojan Trajkovski perform the song Lost And FoundBelarus\u0027 singer Alekseev performs the song ForeverNorway\u0027s singer Alexander Rybak performs the song That\u0027s How You Write A SongRomanian band The Humans perform the song GoodbyeSerbia\u0027s band Sanja Ilic \u0026amp Balkanika perform the song Nova DecaSan Marino\u0027s Jessika featuring Jenifer Brening perform the song Who We AreDenmark\u0027s singer Rasmussen performs the song Higher GroundPoland\u0027s singer Gromee feat.

The fashion shows routinely feature collections riffing off a range of global cultures. For the coming autumn, Gucci recently unveiled a series of headwear inspired by Sikh turbans. Vogue ran a photoshoot in its “Diversity Issue” last year with a model in full Japanese geisha outfit. Not unusual, and perhaps nothing wrong with it… save for in both cases (and in the Victoria’s Secret show last year in which a model flaunted a Native American-style headdress) all the models were white.Here’s where cultural appropriation smacks up against representation. Maybe if Victoria’s Secret had employed a Native American model, if Vogue had used a Japanese model, if Gucci had – as the Sikh Coalition suggested in the aftermath – used Sikh models who would have properly observed the correct way to wear what is, after all, a sacred clothing item, then the later dissemination of these items on to the high street might not be quite so problematic.There’s a difference, too, between fashion and performance. When I was very young, on a holiday at a Pontin’s camp on the North-West coast, I was wrapped in a blanket, had two stripes of lipstick put across my face, and a feather from a passing seagull taped to my head. I was entered into the fancy dress contest (I didn’t win). I was of course, a Red Indian, as Native Americans were called in those less-enlightened times.As bad as the Black and White Minstrels? Possibly. But “Red Indians” back then were almost a fictional, fairytale group of people, the image drawn from Monday matinee westerns not renowned for historical accuracy, from Peter Pan, from Hiawatha and Little Plum. Would I have dressed my children like that when they were the same age? Undoubtedly not. Times change. Sensitivities alter.Utah teenager, Keziah Daum, sparked a huge debate on Twitter about cultural appropriation after posting photos of her traditional Chinese prom dressAnd I look down at what I’m wearing right now as I type this. A T-shirt, which has its origins as an undergarment in 19th-century America. A pair of jeans, which were originally developed in Italy (Genoa, which gave rise to “jeans”) and France (the fabric of Nimes, or de Nimes, from which is derived “denim”). A pair of flip-flops (don’t judge me), evolved from the Japanese zōri which servicemen took back to America post-Second World War (though early flip-flops have been discovered in ancient Egyptian burial sites).I am a melange of styles borrowed, begged and stolen from around the world. Is this cultural appropriation, several generations down the line? Should I be wearing what my grandfathers wore? Polyester slacks and an Oxford shirt, a cardigan, brogues? Where is the line, and on which side of it are we?Music is another cultural appropriation battleground. Every time Katy Perry or Taylor Swift goes “ghetto” for another video, or Lana Del Ray puts on a Native American headdress, it’s there to see. White folks stole rock’n’roll from African rhythms filtered through the American South, we stole electronic dance music from the predominantly-black post-disco clubs of Chicago and Detroit, and Italy. Take away the cultural appropriation, and what’s left? A couple of rousing choruses of Knees Up, Mother Brown or The Lambeth Walk, perhaps.Should we talk about food? Those great British traditions such as pizza, or chow mein, or curry? A few miles from me, Bradford is awash with curry houses. The clientele is largely white. Is that cultural appropriation? Well, no, because most of the restaurants are owned and worked in by people of South Asian heritage. But what was deemed cultural appropriation was when, earlier this year, a restaurant called Fanny’s announced it was opening a venue for the purveying of “posh kebabs” in London’s Stoke Newington.The move was lambasted on Twitter because, for one, Stoke Newington is a hub for Turkish restaurants and takeaways… the people who, you know, invented the kebab. For another, because the people behind Fanny’s weren’t Turkish (one of the founders is called Claude Compton, for your information), and the tag-line “posh kebabs” intimated that these “lads from Fulham” were basically going to beat the Turks at their own game (as a side note, Fanny’s subsequently dropped the “posh” bit from their marketing and logo).Fanny\u0027s Kebabs finally dropped the \u0027posh\u0027 bit from their marketing (fannyskebabsInstagram)If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering where I’m heading with all this. And the honest answer is, I just don’t know. Cultural appropriation seems, on the face of it, like it should be something that all of us should fight against, but the flip-side of that is knowing exactly just what it is and when we should call it out.As I said at the top of this piece, take what I say with a pinch of salt, given that I am a middle-aged white man. But where does that leave me, if we remove years of embedded cultural appropriation? Dressed in my grandad’s clothes, listening to a 78 of George Formby classics, and clutching a chip butty? And on that score, should I be calling cultural appropriation on the New York magazine The Insider’s awestruck piece last month on a Turkish restaurant that was selling this remarkable new thing, a sandwich stuffed with fries?The answer’s no, of course, because cultural appropriation will never affect me in the way it does other, marginalised people. I have working-class roots but I’m still pretty close to the top of the privilege chain all I can realistically get away with is some faux outrage at posh kids slumming it at Wetherspoons and Greggs for Instagram likes.But maybe those who identify as white, liberal allies should hit the pause button before calling out cultural appropriation, and just take a moment to think. The obvious stuff, the outright horror of the Black and White Minstrels and the more subtle but by no means any less problematic racism, yes, by all means, dig in. Dog-piling on teenagers for wearing a prom dress, maybe hold off a bit.Cultural appropriation is a big desert, and one on which we might have to draw our own personal lines in the sand as to what we know in our guts is wrong, and what we think might be, possibly, a little bit off.And with that, I bid you sayonara.Black and White minstralsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It will decimate our public services and see household incomes plunge.“Those supporting it must come clean over the likely consequences of ‘no deal’, or they must stop beating the drum for inevitable economic ruin.”Brexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUBrexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUA key point in the negotiations remains Britain\u0027s access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union. Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does?\u0026#13Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026#13Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit.\u0026#13The Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear.\u0026#13Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU.\u0026#13The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London.\u0026#13Banks in the UK will be hit hard regardless of the Brexit outcome. The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.\u0026#13The prime minister’s official spokesman dismissed the criticism and insisted the government was actively planning for all Brexit scenarios.The spokesman told a Westminster briefing: “The prime minister has said many times, most recently in her Mansion House speech – we take the issue seriously and as a responsible government we continue to plan for a range of scenarios.“At the budget the chancellor committed an additional £3bn of funding so that departments and the devolved administrations can continue to prepare effectively for all Brexit scenarios, and over £1.5bn of this was allocated for 201819 in the spring statement.“That’s in addition to the £700m already made available to prepare for Brexit.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In the same period wages have increased by just 6 per cent, suggesting the scheme is increasingly helping only those with higher incomes.The average household income in the UK is £25,700, although this is after direct taxes have been deducted, whereas the Help to Buy data relates to pre-tax wages.Last year £2.9bn of loans were paid out – a jump from £2.1bn the year before. Despite criticism of where the money is going, Theresa May has promised a further £10bn of investment in the scheme – enough to help fund more than 400,000 new homes.Labour said the figures were proof that Help to Buy is not helping those who most need support with housing costs.The world\u0027s least affordable cities for housingThe world\u0027s least affordable cities for housingThis is the fifth year that Melbourne has won top placeJohn Healey, the party’s shadow housing secretary, said: “With the number of younger people who own a first home in free fall, government ministers need to be doing much more to help people on ordinary incomes buy a first home of their own.“Deep cuts to housing investment mean that the number of new low-cost homes to buy like shared ownership have halved since 2010, and badly targeted schemes like Help to Buy aren’t focused on those who most need a hand up.“Labour would refocus Help to Buy to help first-time buyers on ordinary incomes.”It comes after the Resolution Foundation suggested Help to Buy should be scrapped, saying it drives up house prices and takes money away from other areas of housing.The average new build property now costs £50,000 more than when the scheme was introduced in 2013, it said.The think tank said in a report: “HTB appears to have served a useful purpose when it was first introduced – restoring confidence to developers and promoting a pickup in house building. But its effect looks increasingly distortionary, suggesting that it may be time to phase it out.”It added: “Since early 2016 the growth in new-build prices has outpaced price growth for existing resold property, strongly suggesting that equity loans have enabled developers to set prices at higher levels than otherwise.”In the meantime, it said, a household income cap should be introduced on Help to Buy loans to ensure public money is benefiting people on low and middle incomes.Number of social housing properties in England drops 11 per cent in one yearOfficial data reveals that the scheme, designed to help aspiring homeowners get on the housing ladder, also continues to directly benefit thousands of people who already own a property.Almost one in five Help to Buy beneficiaries are already homeowners, and on average these recipients are wealthier than first-time buyers, with an income £8,500 higher.The Independent has previously revealed how millions of pounds of public funds are being loaned to people with an income of more than £100,000.The latest figures reveal that more than 6,200 households with an income of more than £100,000 have benefited from taxpayer-funded loans.A spokesperson for the Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “Our Help to Buy scheme has assisted over 440,000 people buy a home of their own since 2010, with a majority of households having an income of £50,000 or less.“Help to Buy is getting people onto the housing ladder and last year we saw the highest number of first time buyers in over a decade.”help to buyor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Boma also sees frequent and violent cattle raids from neighbouring states.As the rainy season sets in, much of the food people depend on has to be flown in from Juba, however this sustenance is unaffordable for many. A rebel fighter near the town of Kaya on South Sudan’s border with Uganda a day before the 26 August assaultThousands of rebel troops have been killed since civil war broke out in 2013SPLA-IO (SPLA-In Opposition) rebels pray in Yondu, the day before an assault on government SPLA (Sudan People\u0027s Liberation Army) soldiers in the town of Kaya, on the border with Uganda, South Sudan, August 25, 2017SPLA-IO (SPLA-In Opposition) rebels parade in Yondu, the day before an assault on government SPLA (Sudan People\u0027s Liberation Army) soldiers in the town of Kaya, on the border with Uganda, South Sudan, August 25, 2017SPLA-IO (SPLA-In Opposition) rebels parade in Yondu, the day before an assault on government SPLA (Sudan People\u0027s Liberation Army) soldiers in the town of Kaya, on the border with Uganda, South Sudan, August 25, 2017.

Officials have said the power plant is safe but lava has never engulfed a geothermal plant anywhere in the world, leaving a measure of uncertainty. Authorities have shut down the plant, removed 60,000 gallons of flammable liquid and deactivated the wells.Lava from Hawaii volcano covers potentially explosive wellThere are fears that Kilauea will continue to erupt since there remains a plentiful supply of the magma which has drained from its summit lava lake and flowed 25 miles east underground At least 82 homes have been destroyed in the southeast corner of Big Island and about 2,000 people have been ordered evacuated since Kilauea began erupting on 3 May. The eruptions are expected to cut tourism revenues.The sole reported serious injury from the eruption so far came when a man was hit by a flying lava “spatter” as he sat on his balcony.Additional reporting by Reutersor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Effing and jeffing, he sped off.After managing to hail down an approaching car, Scott blurted “Jeremy Thorpe” to the driver.A police investigation lead to a trial in the Old Bailey with the Liberal leader accused of conspiracy to murder along with three other men. But the jury did not feel convinced that Thorpe, a man of hitherto unblemished reputation and a national figure with a very distinguished public record could be capable of the crime.

And it looks like there might be turbulent times ahead off-screen too.Actress Eleanor Tomlinson, who plays feisty Demelza, believes she should be paid the same as Aidan Turner, the star turn as Captain Ross.Eleanor isn’t sure how much Aidan takes home.But it has been confirmed this week that he tucks a heck of a lot more cash into his tight britches than her.Bosses at the company which makes the hugely successful Poldark series — back on TV next month — say it’s because he has significantly more screen time than any other character.I think they are quite right, and not just because of those half-naked scything scenes. As Ross Poldark, Aidan is ably supported by a splendid cast. But he carries the show and his character’s name is in the title.On the other hand, it was ludicrous that the luminous Claire Foy, who portrayed the Queen in The Crown, was paid less than Matt Smith, who played Prince Philip.Claire was the true shining star of this production and had more lines to learn, more scenes and many more long hours in front of the cameras than anyone else.Bosses were shamed into giving her £200,000 in back payments.I hope she enjoyed every well-earned penny, but she should actually have been paid a lot more than Matt.You also wouldn’t expect any actress playing Miss Marple to be paid the same as her male co-stars.She obviously deserves a bigger share of the pie, and likewise you wouldn’t for a minute acceptBrenda Blethyn being given equal pay with her young whipper-snapper sidekicks in Vera. She merits a far bigger salary.Brenda is the reason we tune in, and as the lead, she has more pressure to shoulder. Just like Poldark, if Vera had been a flop, then Brenda and Aidan would have taken all of the flak and their careers would have suffered.If actors and actresses are doing exactly the same work they should be paid exactly the same amount of money.That should apply across the board to every job in the land.It’s unfair for a female professor to earn less than her male counterpart, or someone working on the factory floor or in a shop to take home less just because she’s a woman.That’s why I was taken aback when new Strictly head judge Shirley Ballas defended the BBC for paying her less than her predecessor Len Goodman.Shirley graciously said it was because she was “on trial”. But I’m delighted that for her upcoming second series, bosses have apparently had a rethink.Whether this is because they feel Shirley has “proved herself” or is due to the outcry over equal pay, it is, at least, a baby step in the right direction.I would love to see the same applied in teaching, medicine, finance — every other job where men and women are putting in the same hard graft.When it comes to acting, equal pay is more complex.Marlon Brando was paid £2.6million in 1978 to appear as Superman’s dad. He worked for 12 days, refused to learn his lines and was on screen for less than ten minutes.It was thought his presence would put bums on seats, but it must have been hard to justify to the rest of the cast.Then there was Elizabeth Taylor, who cashed a cheque for a million dollars to appear as Cleopatra in 1963. Co-star Richard Burton was paid buttons in comparison.Stars are worth as much money as their agents can grab and it depends on their box-office appeal. It’s the same when it comes to certain West End shows or pantos.Talented singers and dancers have to watch half-witted reality stars being parachuted into lead roles and paid fortunes to shift tickets.So while I understand why Eleanor is a bit miffed, I don’t think she had a leg to stand on.But at least it has got people talking about equal pay and highlighting injustices.And if she is the undisputed star in her next role and getting most of the screen time, then she absolutely should get a bigger pay packet.MEGHAN MARKLE went from elegant, alluring, ultra-modern bride to a frumpy wife in less than 72 hours.Her gown was perfect, but this outfit she wore to a party for Prince Charles after her big day looked like one of Princess Anne’s recycled horrors.I’m not sure if it was because Meghan is now a duchess she felt she had to conform to a safe and stuffy look, but it really didn’t work.There’s obviously a lot more to the newest royal than being a fashion plate. She’s bright as well as beautiful and has always had impeccable style.It’s easy to dismiss fashion as being trivial and shallow, but what you wear makes a statement, especially if you are globally renowned.Meghan’s outfit for her father-in-law’s birthday bash at Buckingham Palace screamed that she had been assimilated into the royal “Firm” and was going to be a good girl.We just expected more from the feisty 36-year-old. I hope it was just an unfortunate blip.WOODY ALLEN’S life reads like one of those particularly dark and warped indie movies.He married one adopted daughter and still stands accused of sexually abusing another.He has been disowned by his biological son, the campaigning journalist Ronan Farrow, who helped expose the Harvey Weinstein scandal, over the alleged abuse of Ronan’s sister, Dylan, when she was just seven.Allen, who is now 82, remains lauded by Hollywood luvvies and besotted film buffs who think of him as a cinematic genius, although those who believe Dylan would describe him as a “dirty old man”.He was in a relation- ship with actress Mia Farrow, but their unconventional family fractured after Mia discovered he had been having a sexual relationship with her adopted daughter Soon-Yi, who he went on to marry.JEFF GOLDBLUM is one of the coolest guys on the planet.He’s quirky, eccentric and paddles his own canoe.There aren’t enough endearing characters like him on the planet, and he’s one of the best things about Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, the newest movie in lucrative franchise. Jeff reprises his role as Dr Ian Malcolm, who first appeared in the original movie 25 years ago. Dr Malcolm doesn’t think human beings should mess around with nature and is consistently proven right.Jeff shares many of those views and behind that arm-waving, kooky exterior is a man of fierce intelligence and laser-sharp insight.If we were ever to be stupid enough to clone dinosaurs, he’s the man you would want in charge of sorting the whole mess out.Maybe Trump could get him to fix North Korea before Jeff starts on peace in the Middle East.Now the story has hit the headlines again with another of Mia’s brood of adopted children breaking their silence to support Allen.Moses Farrow, 40, wrote a blog this week about the man he calls Dad stating that Allen is completely innocent of any charges of abuse, which inevitably means he thinks his sister Dylan is a liar.No charges have ever been brought against Allen, but the family is broken and poor Dylan has been badly damaged by the alleged abuse claims that have haunted her for 25 years.There are no winners in this sad situation, apart from Allen himself.Actors still queue up for parts in his films and he continues to live his life as a privileged New Yorker.The breath of scandal has barely touched him, but his son is a tenacious investigative journalist and if there ever is a case to answer, it will one day be father against son, brother against sister and mother against father – and will inevitably be turned into a movie.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The knife is not the crime. Children seldom randomly pick up knives and decide to stab people. In my experience it often starts when the child is young.This spate of killings will pass but for now it affords the attention and opportunity to reflect.Currently, the debate is cyclical and futile. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan says it’s not his fault, he needs more police. The police say we need more of them. The Government says you’ve had more police but it didn’t make a difference. Meanwhile, children are dying on the streets.The search for solutions must stretch beyond the police. Aside from outrage, there needs to be a focus on the causes, as well as the symptoms, of these crimes.This shouldn’t detract from taking knives away from those carrying them, but we can’t ignore the fact that replacing a blade is as simple as going to the kitchen drawer.Those of us who are more able to look at the world through the eyes of young people who carry knives for protection and status get closer to how they think.What we are witnessing is a sophisticated type of group mind. Some of our boys are so mentally zoned into a culture of violence. All of my youths know, directly, someone murdered, or at least seriously injured, on our streets. Some have been involved.How did we get to this place? Slowly. As the influence of parents, pastors and school principals has waned, all our young people speak of a distinct feeling of powerlessness.The tried and traditional levers and sanctions affecting the development of children are not functioning effectively. For too many, the family bond is damaged and so ruptured we overlook its devastating effects. My young people need something to fight, something to believe in. Like everyone else, they want to be someone, and sometimes that means fighting each other.It is a sad day when, for some, employment prospects are more plentiful with local dealers selling weed and crack than the only other job on offer at the local barber’s.Some of the young people I work with speak about the role of their family’s socio-economic status in their life choices. If they’re lucky, they see their parents locked into dead-end, minimum-wage jobs with no security or satisfaction. Knives, they conclude, are a type of urban qualification. As one put it: “Everyone wants to be someone, this is my way.”Digging deeper, I learned that 85 per cent of my students had never patronised a black-owned business in the past five years, aside from a barber shop. Too many of them carry the assumption that blacks are inferior. “This is how it is,” Adamu told me. “Our business is on the road, we are designed for the hustle.”I began this work with an agenda to keep black boys from being arrested in their droves.Sadly, a lot of our kids have ended up in prison, but they started the three-lap race of life two laps behind. For some, it is almost impossible to work through all the scars.For many of our children, entrance to crime and urban violence is connected to a sense of wanting to be accepted and acceptable — violence is currency.Their hope is that they survive long enough to one day grow out of it. The desire to belong is so real that any community, including gangs, will do.The more law enforcement is used, the more of a challenge it becomes. It almost acts as encouragement because it is something else to beat.Drugs are also a way of life. For some it’s about using, for others it’s selling. It’s simply a way to earn money. A visit to our social housing estates will reveal high levels of organisation. Like any business, you have distribution points, a clear marketing strategy and, most of all, plans to deal with the opposition.I also see the age of involvement getting younger and they don’t care if they live or die. In that sense they are like suicide bombers.Recently I was involved in the rehabilitation of two nine-year-old boys. One was tasked with moving weapons from location to location and the other given addresses for drug drops. He would deliver the packages during school lunch breaks in exchange for McDonald’s, KFC and clothes.Children like these do not grow up seeing themselves as having a future in business or leadership. They are crying out for genuine role models. When our young men find more employment opportunities from businessmen than “road men”, real change will begin.Until that time, we need to love these children back to sanity. They are simply not able to make the rational choices our education and social systems demand.We experience a ruling class committed to maintaining the status quo. Talk about social mobility is just air. Our children are left with the crumbs that fall from the master’s table.The Government is afraid of the mob — but in some areas there is little less than anarchy breaking out.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government has no credible policy and the whole world knows it.“Whitehall’s real preparations are for the continuation of EU law and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.“The State has made no preparations to leave and plans to make no preparations to leave — even after leaving.”Barring a last-minute change of tune, Mrs May is walking into an ambush which will sour relations with Brussels and condemn Britain to a generation of rancorous civil discord.A botched deal will be dressed up in Brussels newspeak as a triumph for all sides.In fact it will almost certainly betray 17.4million British people who explicitly voted OUT in the biggest democratic mandate ever seen in this country.Voters who hoped for clear and unequivocal freedom from EU laws and regulations are unlikely to stay silent for long.They expected Brexit ministers to carve out a prosperous and independent future.Instead, they have watched defeated Remainers mount a ruthless and successful counter-attack.From a position of strength as a major trading nation, Britain has surrendered on all fronts, caved in to Brussels bullies — and handed over a £39BILLION ransom for the privilege.We are likely to remain bound by a version of the EU customs union, the single market and the European Court of Justice for years to come. Meanwhile, mass immigration runs out of control.Perhaps to his own amazement, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has succeeded in his aim to make Britain worse off outside.We will not be allowed to flourish as a free-trading sovereign state.Nobody can be more vividly aware of this than Mrs May as she prepares for her looming summit.Yet she has only herself to blame, starting with the catastrophic snap election which destroyed her Commons majority.She needlessly coughed up that £39billion with nothing in return from Brussels and allowed herself to be derailed by phantom threats of IRA violence if the UK establishes any sort of border with Ireland.The sad truth is that Mrs May is not up to the job as Prime Minister at a momentous point in our history.In an age when words really count, we are lumbered with an ultra-cautious leader who cannot think on her feet or speak without notes.At a time when we should all be doing our best to make Brexit work, we have a Prime Minister who would much prefer to Remain.For the moment, Leavers such as Iain Duncan Smith and Jacob Rees-Mogg are pledging their loyalty.But a bad deal would provoke die-hard Tories into the only honourable action they feel they can take — and put her premiership on the line.They already have the votes needed to trigger a leadership contest.They will not support key Commons votes to dilute Brexit, risking Government defeat by an unholy alliance of Labour opportunists, Lib Dem and SNP wreckers and Tory Remainers.A disastrous combination of weak leadership, cack-handed communication and dismal diplomacy has plunged Britain into a needless constitutional crisis.It says something about Mrs May’s position as leader that her strongest card is the prospect of yet another general election — the third in three years.And the nightmare of political throwback Jeremy Corbyn storming the barricades and leading his Marxist extremists to power.[boxout featured-image=6392734]AS PM, Tony Blair insisted 50 per cent of school leavers must go to university.The result was grade inflation across the board and “Ology” graduates struggling to find a decent job.Now his sensible son Euan, 34, is arguing for tailor-made apprenticeships, giving kids a chance to earn while they learn.His views coincide with new Tory policy – T-levels, technical and trade qualifications which fit pupils to the work they want.They can range from plumbers and computer wizards to City bankers.Many will be driving their own car and buying a home by the time pals leave university with mountains of debt.It is the way forward in skill-hungry Britain.[/boxout] Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

All we need now is to rediscover that global spirit.Mr Rees Mogg, who heads up a powerful bloc of Brexiteers, hit out: “Planning for no deal ought to be an essential part of the negotiations strategy.“To show we could easily walk away would worry the EU, strengthening our position and failing to do so would be both incompetent and weak.”And another Tory MP who serves as a government aide said they had been left “deeply unimpressed” by the attitude of the civil service.Last year Philip Hammond announced £3 billion of funds in his Autumn Budget to prepare for “every possible outcome” of Brexit.But critics say half of this cash will not be available until next 2019 - when Britain is due to leave.It comes as a fresh rift between Mr Hammond and the Bank of England opened over how close Britain stays to Brussels after Brexit.Insiders say relations between the Treasury and Old Lady of Threadneedle Street are “very, very bad”.The chancellor is reported to want to keep the City tied as closely as possible to the European rulebook, while the Bank fear the UK will simply become a “rule taker.”The best card we have to play in our negotiations with Brussels is that we can walk away if their hardline demands aren’t in our interests.That makes for a very strong hand.The EU would have a huge hole in its budget without our cash, and the Continent’s businesses will be livid if trading with the world’s sixth largest economy becomes more difficult.Yet if EU negotiators don’t take us seriously because we haven’t got regulators and standards bodies on standby if we do decide to go it alone, Brussels will serve us up nothing but thin gruel.And we’ll have no choice but to meekly surrender.The Prime Minister must ensure that Whitehall is prepared for Britain to go it alone. That readiness is absolutely vital to securing a genuinely beneficial deal.We know that Civil Service mandarins want Brexit to fail. They’ve set up roadblock after roadblock in the hope we’ll be forced to cave in and change our minds on the whole exercise.That cannot be allowed to happen.Jacob Rees-Mogg is spot on when he says the PM needs to show some iron, and that Brussels won’t get the money they desperately need unless they play ball with Britain.

Some is also done to shut down anything other than the argument that says “It needs more money”, while other bits are there just because TV executives have noticed it’s the NHS’s 70th birthday and think they’d better do something to look caring.Like, for instance, ITV’s A\u0026ampE Live, “from the frontline”, at Leeds General Infirmary.A self-defeating three-day experiment which, on the one hand gleefully promised us all sorts of carnage: “It’s hotting up here.” But on the other was swift to assure viewers they were operating on a time delay in case patients refused filming consent, thereby ruling out most of the drunks and any possibility of a bloke being wheeled into reception with a Hoover attachment up his fundament.I’d avoid describing LGI as the most sedate-looking A\u0026ampE unit in Britain, though, because ITV had attempted to redress the noise balance by having it hosted by human Tannoy system Davina McCall, who lost little time in telling us: “I had to get hypnotised to do this job, can you believe it?”Yeah, I can, actually.“I saw my granny sever her toes with a lawnmower,” she went on to explain, “and it made me squeamish.” If you thought for one minute, however, it sedated her, you either overestimate the powers of hypnotherapy or you haven’t been watching Davina’s career closely enough.The woman was in full Street Mates mode from the moment she clocked a young couple in the waiting room. “Are you going out?” said Davina, without so much as checking their vital signs.“We were on a date . . . our first date.”“AH-MAY-ZING! THIS IS GREAT. And it’s something to talk about when you have children . . . ”Silence. “I took it too far, didn’t I?”You did rather, Davina, though I get the squeamishness thing and actually flinched when she then told us: “A 23-year-old man, Tommy, is being brought in by ambulance after being rear-ended at high speed.”You’d hope Tommy got some of Davina’s meds as well, ’cos a weird thing happened on Wednesday and Thursday’s broadcasts.She actually calmed down a bit. To the extent I finally noticed the staff, who turned out to be naturals in front of a camera, which really shouldn’t have been a surprise given TV’s insatiable appetite for this sort of show.Among other recent TV offerings, we have: A\u0026ampE Live, A\u0026ampE, 24 Hours In A\u0026ampE, The Real A\u0026ampE, Sun Sea \u0026amp A\u0026ampE, A\u0026ampE On The Road.And that’s just the ones with A\u0026ampE in the title.There’s a whole load more with the words ambulance and emergency, which you may also have watched but entirely forgotten.Why?’Cos an actual visit to A\u0026ampE is a real, vivid, frightening, frustrating, disturbing, impressive and unforgettable experience that can leave you weeping with gratitude for the NHS.TV, by contrast, generally offers a dumb, censored, antiseptic, grovelling, uncritical, cult-like, agenda-ridden version, with this sort of dialogue.Davina (to ambulanceman Gavin): “How important is it you get there early.”“The sooner we get there the more chance the patient has of surviving.”“And that’s so important, isn’t it?”Thank you, live TV. Where would we all be without you?Good Morning Britain’s Piers Morgan: “I leave a lot of phones in my bedroom, ’cos you never know when you’re going to get THE call when your manager says, ‘Got it. Prime-time America. You’re back on’.”And it’s go go go with My 600lb Life.NOTE: In order to avoid Britain’s Got Talent Live, I’m heading south of the border, down Mexico way. Column returns in a fortnight.BBC1’s version of the Jeremy Thorpe murder plot saga, A Very English Scandal, is nuts.It’s very entertaining as well, but it is nuts, with CGI badgers running around in episode one and a couple of Yucca plants shoved in some sand dunes to try and make us think North Devon is actually “California,” on Sunday night.The main issue, however, is that A Very English Scandal can’t quite decide if it’s a comedy or not. So it’s deadly serious whenever Thorpe’s commenting on Europe, immigration or gay rights, but pure Carry On when his ex-lover Norman Scott starts having it off in a caravan with the bird out of Torchwood.It’s more than saved, though, by the incredible storyline and performances of the brilliant Alex Jennings, who totally vanishes into the part of Thorpe’s sidekick, Peter Bessell, Patricia Hodge as Ursula Thorpe, and Ben Whishaw, who’s got the most difficult role of all as the insanely irritating Scott, but does it well enough to make me wish he’d been shot on Exmoor rather than his dog.In that sort of company, of course, it was also incredibly brave to give the lead role to Hugh Grant, who never quite convinces me he’s anyone other than Hugh Grant, yet I will say this for a performance that stands out from anything he’s ever done before.He’s wearing a hat.Courtesy of ITV’s Lee Dixon on England’s World Cup goalies: “You’d be down to one goalkeeper and a nervous one.”“You’d be down to one goalkeeper and a Neville Swan.”INCIDENTALLY, who claimed the following, last week: “People always get excited about cockchafers.”EASIEST gig on the soaps?EastEnders’ Big Mo, who’s just set herself up as Walford’s resident psychic and fortune teller.A job with my name on it, frankly, as I wouldn’t need a crystal ball, money or much encouragement to tell the locals: “This old craphole will be locked in an ever more depressing cycle of baby abductions, love triangles, disrupted weddings, head transplants and escaped animals from now until kingdom come. Get the hell out, while you still can.”Walford CID might also want to put me on a profiling retainer as well, given they’re the only people who haven’t noticed that every single street crime, including – surprise, surprise – last week’s stabbings of Keanu and Shakil, has been carried out by a white, working-class male with a bad stage school Cockney accent.I guess Big Mo’s probably safe in the position for the moment, though, as she seems to have foretold the re-appearance of Shane “Alfie” Richie in The Vic, earlier this month.However, at roughly the same time, she also predicted: “Jean (Slater) will get a job with teeth.”This Morning, “Earth Angel” Sarah Rebecca Vine: “I am a spiritual life coach and healer and, I feel, a messenger to wake people up.” Zzzzz.And First Time Mum, Ferne McCann: “The hypnotherapist session definitely calmed me down and emptied my mind.” Of what?The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “On the flag of South Sudan blue represents the waters of what major river?”Bradley Walsh: “What UK Prime Minister read geography at an all- women’s Oxford college?”Jackie: “Tony Blair.”Bradley Walsh: “In a hospital, the H\u0026ampN unit refers to the head and what other part of the body?”Jackie: “Nose.”And Ben Shephard: “In Australia and New Zealand a ‘long black’ is a variety of which hot beverage?”Teri: “Beer.”The BBC’s Friday night schedule offering us two left-wing panel shows (HIGNFY and New World Order), featuring ’s Mona Chalabi, when one was far too many.The A\u0026ampE Live caption writer responsible for the spelling of “interupt”. Channel 4’s Goggleboxers and all the other people who seem to think The Handmaid’s Tale is a documentary.Car Share lacking either the brains or the balls to make a preview copy of its finale available.And Good Morning Britain without that oaf Piers Morgan, on Thursdays and Fridays. An experience which really is as pointless and empty as Tight Fit performing The Lion Sleeps Tonight, without Steve Grant on lead vocals.Brilliant performances from Alex Jennings, Patricia Hodge and Ben Whishaw, as Peter Bessell, Jeremy Thorpe’s mum and Norman Scott, on A Very English Scandal.BBC1’s Motty: The Man Behind The Sheepskin, revealing an even odder character than I was expecting. Dave’s How The Young Ones Changed Comedy (not entirely for the better).And The Chase offering up my favourite quiz show moment of the year, so far.Bradley Walsh: “Which astrologer published a colouring book called The Art Of Astrology?” John: “Galileo.” Bradley: “Russell Grant.”Gareth Bale: “I haven’t seen the goal back yet, I’ve only watched it again now.”Steve McManaman: “It’s a surprise that Bale’s not playing, but it’s not a surprise that he’s on the bench.”And Rio Ferdinand: “Win the Champions League and it’s chance to be forever mortalised.”(Compiled by Graham Wray)THIS week’s winner is Britain’s Best Home Cook’s Mary Berry and Gary Oldman as Dracula.

Ten homes have come to meet and assess him and said ‘we can’t take him on’.“They all said no. It’s quite heartbreaking and so frustrating.“Me and my mum have no trust in the system whatsoever because it’s been so turbulent throughout the whole process.“He’s lived in Trafford all his life and it seems there’s nothing anyone can do for him.“For my dad it’s really upsetting. He’s in a confused state of mind - it’s just not acceptable.“Will we end up having to wait until he declines to the point where he’s more manageable?“We don’t want to hurry on the illness. This is not a permanent solution.”After being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s eight years ago, Michael - a former semi professional footballer - has been moved from pillar to post.At times Amy said he was “heavily sedated” and “isolated” because carers would increase his medication to make him easier to deal with.She added: “When he needs personal care and showering it can take up to four staff members because he doesn’t understand what is going on.“He started to get more agitated.“They increase his medication and he was very sedated.“Me and my mum said ‘this is not right’. He was just sleeping all the time.”In October Michael was moved to Shawe Lodge where he was “happy and settled”. But now the home closure - blamed on funding cuts - has left Michael back at “square one”.Trafford Council and Trafford Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) said they have been dealing with rehoming residents affected by the closure.A spokesman said: “This has proved to be a difficult task as some of them have complex needs that cannot be accommodated in a regular nursing home.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In the US — officially the world’s fattest nation — that figure is 18.5 per cent.UK stores now stock plus-size clothes for under-tens, with H\u0026ampM becoming the latest chain to sell a “generous fit” range for kids as young as eight.Obesity is predicted to double in the next 25 years — while tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money has already been thrown at the problem.But a simple — and cheap — solution can already be found on the playgrounds and fields of around 6,000 primary schools where more than a million children take part in the Daily Mile.The exercise regime means that at some point in every school day, pupils leave their classroom, still in their uniform, to run, jog or walk for up to 15 minutes.Youngsters can set their own pace and talk to their friends while they go round.Most of the children complete a mile or more in the quarter of an hour.Teachers all over the country have reported how pupils return to the classroom invigorated and eager to learn after doing what is being called “jography”.Last week, Prime Minister Theresa May praised the Daily Mile and called on schools to take it up — but stopped short of saying it should be compulsory.Now, for all our kids’ sakes, The Sun is calling on Education Secretary Damian Hinds to make the Daily Mile mandatory in all primary schools.The idea began six years ago and has been growing steadily. But only now have scientists been able to prove it really does have an effect.Over the course of an academic year, a team of experts from Stirling University compared nearly 400 children, aged four to 11, from two primaries, with one group doing the Daily Mile and the other not.The Daily Mile kids were put through a series of tests to calculate whether they became fitter and whether they lost fat.IF you are a teacher or parent who would like to get your school doing the Daily Mile check out thedailymile or go to @_thedailymile or on Facebook. There is lots of information showing how easy it is to incorporate the Daily Mile and to support schools who want to get involved. You can also register your interest.The findings, which have just been released, show how they lost an average of four per cent body fat.They were also fitter and more active during the day, while time spent sitting around dropped by an average 18 per cent.Another investigation, conducted at an inner city school in London, found Daily Mile youngsters did much better than expected in SATS tests.Other tests have shown how children also feel less stressed and more confident.Retired head Elaine Wyllie, 62, came up with the idea of the Daily Mile almost by accident when pupils at her St Ninians school in Stirling wanted to get fitter.After just six weeks, not one of the 57 children in her first year was overweight.But to persuade the Government to introduce the Daily Mile into all Britain’s 20,000 primary schools, scientific proof was needed.After reading the latest results from Stirling University, Elaine said: “I knew this research would be the game-changer which would prove what I had believed all along — that the Daily Mile makes children fitter, happier, more active and a healthier weight.“I am delighted and relieved that we now have objective proof.”But education chiefs appear reluctant to make the Daily Mile compulsory for fear of upsetting head teachers, who might see it as an extra burden on their staff.However, Jim Cleaver, head of Westgate Community Primary in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, says: “The beauty of the Daily Mile is its simplicity.“It takes 15 minutes out of the day and for staff it is as easy as opening a door.”At Woodlands, a school for children with special needs in Leatherhead, Surrey, lead nurse Emma Packham has seen children lose weight as a result of the Daily Mile.She says: “We had five children who were clinically obese whose weight was just going up, up, up.“Since we started 18 months ago nobody in the target group has gained weight. Some have lost weight.No other factors in their lives have changed.”It is not just the children’s weight that is changing. Teachers are reporting that behaviour in classroom is improving. And many parents say their children sleep better at night.Former MP Andy Burnham, now the Mayor of Manchester, is a fan and wants his city to become the first where every primary school does the Daily Mile.Unlike some schemes, there would be no costs with introducing it into schools. All associated expenses are currently being paid by Britain’s richest man, Jim Ratcliffe, who has also used some of his £21billion fortune to advertise it during Ant \u0026amp Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway.Sports commentator Jake Humphrey, who runs the Daily Mile with youngsters at Trowse primary school in Norwich, says: “I honestly don’t think parents are aware of how unfit their children are. Why weren’t we doing this 20 years ago?”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sounds optimistic to me.But leading the band which once epitomised sex and drugs and rock ’n’ roll — and the debauched history of the Stones is etched deeply into the corrugated faces of Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood — is the man who can teach us all we need to know about staying fit.Unlike Mick, we don’t have to take up yoga, ballet and kickboxing — but like him, we do have to think about getting our blood pumping every day of our lives.And unlike Jagger, we do not have to start every day with a smoothie — but we do have to think more about what we are putting into our bodies.Few of us could ever hope to follow Jagger’s punishing fitness regime, working out for hours most days of the week under the watchful eye of personal trainer Torje Eike.We don’t have the time, money or indeed fitness levels to keep up with this great-grandfather.But by having Mick Jagger as a role model, every one of us can be healthier than we are — slimmer, fitter and ready to rock ’n’ roll.The key to Jagger’s fitness is that everything counts.If you put good food into your body or if you eat rubbish.If you make regular demands on your body or just reach for the TV remote.Jagger gets mocked for his action-packed love life (at 73, he had a son with 29-year-old ballerina Melanie Hamrick) and for his laughter lines — nothing is that funny, Mick!But if you saw Jagger bouncing about like a 19-year-old this week, then you could not help but take him seriously.And want a slice of whatever he is having.So the next time the nation has a panic attack about how fat we are becoming, we need to get Jagger on the case.For — at the risk of being impolite — when did you ever see Jamie Oliver looking even remotely slim?But Mick Jagger is still dancing like it is 1969.And you never see a fat Rolling Stone. IT was such a glorious day in Windsor last Saturday that you would think even the hardest of hearts would soften at the sight of young love framed by pomp, pageantry and that cloudless blue sky.But the moaning anti-monarchy minnies are always with us.“Proof again that GB is an infantilised, escapist nation,” sneered Ugandan-born, Oxford-educated commentator Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, 68.Meanwhile, in Wales, Oxfam apologised if a modest royal wedding display in Oxfam’s Aberystwyth shop – Meghan and Harry face masks and some Union Flag bunting – had “caused upset”.But I was on the Long Walk in Windsor with those cheering crowds last Saturday, and I have never felt such a feeling of national unity.The monarchy exists solely with the blessing of the British people.We can divest ourselves of it at any time – as so many countries have ditched their royal families over the past few centuries.But if you stood among those crowds on the Long Walk – who came from every creed, class, race and religion on the planet – then you would believe that the future of the Royal Family is assured for the next 100 years.Anyone dreaming of a republican paradise should not hold their breath.Jada will be an inspiration to anyone suffering from the condition.Because with or without her hair, Jada still looks beautiful.BUCK-TOOTHED Brazilian footballer Ronaldinho is best remembered for two great performances – lobbing David Seaman’s ponytail in the 2002 World Cup and scoring eight times in one night with dancer Lisa Collins.One of these performances earned him the nickname “Pneumatic Drill”. And it wasn’t lobbing David Seaman.You might think that at 38, Ronaldinho’s pneumatic drill was getting a bit rusty, but in August he is to “wed” both his girlfriends, Beatriz Souza and Priscilla Coelho, in a joint ceremony.More three-in-one oil, darling?We are told that Britain should rely on the “good faith” from Brussels.What good faith?When did Brussels ever show anything but contempt, disdain and disrespect towards this country after we voted to leave?The EU’s attempt to shut Britain out of the Galileo satellite project – which we helped to fund – is just the latest insult.If May wants to give Brussels £39billion without a trade deal nailed down, then she should resign today.And make way for someone who will finally stand up for this country.THE Labour Party has suspended local party representative Ian McKenzie for saying that Islamic State would behead Labour’s Emily Thornberry rather than using her as a sex slave.McKenzie, chairman of the Lewisham East constituency, does not deny his crass comments, although some suggest they are being used by his opponents on Labour’s hard Left to discredit him.It sounds like he is doing a good job of discrediting himself.HARRY KANE will be England’s youngest ever World Cup captain – younger even than Bobby Moore.Kane will do a fine job but Bobby Moore beat testicular cancer in his early twenties and then lifted the World Cup at 25.And for any England captain, that will always be a hard act to follow.HOW stark-raving mad that TV historian Dan Snow feels he has to lie to his daughters that women flew Spitfires in World War Two so they feel free to “follow their dreams”.“My daughter was walking down rows and rows and rows of these Spitfire racers and she was going, ‘Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy’,” says Snow.So to protect his six-year-old daughter from what he calls “the grim realities of pre-20th century gender relations”, Snow told her that some women also flew Spitfires in combat.And when I read of Snow’s bizarre lie, I thought of Violette Szabo, who was parachuted twice into Nazi-occupied Europe during World War Two to aid the French Resistance.On her second mission she was captured, tortured by the Gestapo and executed at Ravensbruck concentration camp in 1945.She was 23.Dan Snow has apparently never heard of Violette Szabo – because if he had, then he could surely have told his daughters about her.But many readers will know her incredible story from the film Carve Her Name With Pride.Violette was the working-class daughter of a French mother and a British father.She fell in love with a French Foreign Legion soldier of Hungarian descent called Etienne Szabo, who was killed in 1942 at El Alamein.Violette, who spoke fluent French, trained as a special-operations field agent to fight the Nazis.The torments she suffered before her death are beyond our imagination and her courage is at least the equal of any man who fought in World War Two – and I speak as the proud son of a Royal Naval Commando who won the Distinguished Service Medal.Educate yourself about Violette Szabo, Mr Snow.Then tell your daughters about her.WE all grew up as Star Wars fans but now it feels like there is always a new movie or spin-off coming out.The Last Jedi was only last year and this week sees the release of Han Solo’s back story, Solo. Talk about flogging a dead Wookiee.When Katy Perry is taking to the stage in a C-3PO mini-dress, the exploitation of the Star Wars franchise has possibly gone too far.We’re doomed, Katy.

It is perhaps facing a crisis of legitimacy - this is why we may see an escalation on the military front.Israel says the protests are being used as a \"camouflage for terror\".On Sunday it says its forces discovered an explosive device on the border fence.A Hamas position was targeted in response and three members of Islamic Jihad were killed.Israel was braced for retaliation. And it came on Tuesday morning.The fact that so many mortars were fired and that some landed in a kindergarten ramps the tension up further, which is why Israel\u0027s latest response has been so strong. The risk then for this breaking into a full conflict is great and the next few hours will be telling.However, there are strong indications that neither Israel, nor Hamas wants a full-scale confrontation.Hamas knows if there\u0027s another war, Israel will likely not stop until the organisation and all its \"terror infrastructure\" is destroyed.But for Israel to achieve such an outcome would involve having to send a land force into the Gaza Strip - and then deal with the post-Hamas humanitarian fallout and the nightmare of a restive and hostile population of more than two million."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-gaza-city-zikim_4323629.jpg?20180529154654 ","title":"locked in the devastating effects of israels gaza blockade","story":"Hamas refuses to accept an Israeli state, is regarded as a terror organisation by many countries - including the US, and for years has carried out attacks such as firing mortar shells and suicide bombings.Israel says the measures are absolutely necessary for its own protection - but the effects have virtually crippled the Gaza economy and led to it being compared to an open prison.Some 80% of its citizens need humanitarian aid to survive and the UN says its people are \"locked in, denied free access to the remainder of the territory and the outside world\". The problems have been made worse by Egypt, to Gaza\u0027s south, tightly restricting people crossing into its territory at Rafah, only opening it for short and unpredictable periods.Thousands of young people in Gaza therefore find it very difficult to leave to find work or study abroad and families are unable to see their loved ones.The Oxfam charity says 96% of water is undrinkable and 47% of people don\u0027t have enough food. There are also regular power cuts. A major power plant was destroyed in the 2014 war and Gaza is at the mercy of Israel, Egypt and the rival Palestinian Authority for its electricity.Last year, it was only available for a few hours a day.It says they are \"primarily patients, business people and staff of international organisations\".But sick people seeking treatment often have to wait a long time to get their permit, or may get turned down altogether.Restrictions on imports - such as certain chemicals and fertilisers, building materials and technology - have also stunted the economy, for example slowing the construction of new homes.Israel deems these products \"dual use\", because they could also be used by Hamas for terrorism or boosting military capabilities like making bombs or building bunkers.A six-nautical-mile restriction on Gaza\u0027s fishermen - enforced by armed Israeli patrols - makes it difficult for them to make a living, while most farmers cannot export their crops.Gaza could be unliveable by 2020 if things keep deteriorating, a UN report reiterated last year.It said life was getting \"more and more wretched\" for its citizens - especially as its population continues to quickly increase.However the blockade shows no signs of ending - especially with Hamas still in power, shells fired in its direction and violent protests at its border.The country is bolstering the physical barriers further and is even building a \"new and impenetrable\" barbed wire-topped barrier a few miles north of Gaza to \"prevent the possibility of penetrating Israel by sea\"."},{"url":null,"title":"bank holiday activities kids family","story":"AdvertorialFrom gazebos to kids’ tents – how to make the most of your outside space this bank holiday and half termHave a brilliant bank holiday with these ideas from Halfords\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByIan Morris14:23, 25 MAY 2018Updated16:39, 28 MAY 2018AdvertorialGet out and enjoy the upcoming time off\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailYou don\u0027t have to go to a campsite to have some outdoor fun this bank holiday. Your garden or local park can host just as much fun and help you keep costs down too. The trick is keeping everyone busy so the laughter flows and you all finish the weekend happy and re-energised. \u2028We’ve teamed up with Halfords to share some exciting ideas for what you can get up to – without breaking the bank. Get out into the garden  The key for any bank holiday weekend or half term is going to be fending off the inevitable boredom that can grip children – so why not put them in charge? They get to set the agenda, arrange the football tournament and decide if there\u0027s a water fight or not (there will be, so hide the garden hosepipe if you want to stay dry). To help them run the show, get them to help put up a tent to base themselves in.  The Secret Garden kids play tent and Rocket kids play tent are both ideal for getting their imaginations going. You\u0027ll also want to get the little’uns something to sit on, as they lay down the law of the garden. There’s even a Rocket folding kids chair and Secret Garden folding kids chair to match their tents.  Tents and a whole range of other camping gear are half price at Halfords for the bank holiday. Set up a grown-up place to chill  If the sun shows up for the weekend then you\u0027ll want to be able to find some cooling shade. \u2028While the kids are putting up their play tents, the adults can be busy erecting a sanctuary of their own – or kicking back in a Urban Escape King Size Moonchair, above. \u2028Take a look at the Halfords Gazebo with two side panels. Offering a UV rating of 50+ means not only will it offer shade, but it will also help keep you protected from the sun. \u2028\u2028  And if it rains? Don\u0027t worry, the gazebo is waterproof too. \u2028\u2028 A range of gazebos currently have 20% off at Halfords – check them out here.  Pack up a picnic lunch using a Halfords 40 litre coolbox – you can connect it to the mains or keep it charged in your car until you\u0027re ready, and then it will keep your food and drink nice and cool. It has wheels too, so no need to worry about getting it to your destination. And right now there’s 20 per cent off. You\u0027ll need cutlery, plates and something to drink out of too. The good news is Halfords has a four-piece set of acrylic wine glasses (it\u0027s your holiday too!) for just \u0026pound5. Rainbow plates and cutlery are also half price too, so grab the full set and make your park picnic bright and summery. Scoot to the park \u2028The kids can scoot on the Mongoose Stance Stunt Scooter, which is great for all wannabe daredevils. It\u0027s also down to just \u0026pound45 (save \u0026pound18), for the holiday weekend.

Research by the pro-Remain Best for Britain campaign group suggests that MPs who are scared of opposing Brexit because they fear a backlash from voters may be worrying unnecessarily.   The research, which was shared with the , challenges the received wisdom in Westminster is that the Labour Party has significant numbers of Leave voters it needs to pander to.  And the data suggests Leave Labour voters will stick with the party regardless of its Brexit policy. They\u0027re hoping to embolden MPs to pressure the party leadership into supporting staying in the European Economic Area which would effectively mean staying in the Single Market. Seven in 10 Labour-held constituencies voted to leave the EU.  But the research suggests there are only a handful of seats where more Labour voters backed leave than remain and that those voters were likely to back the party at the election whatever happened. Best for Britain suggested that there were members of Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s inner circle who would benefit if Labour softened its stance. These include shadow cabinet secretary Jon Trickett and chairman Ian Lavery. Trickett’s Hemsworth seat in West Yorkshire voted by 68.1% to leave the EU at the 2016 referendum. However, the YouGov data shows that of those who voted in the 2017 election, 11,037 were Labour remainers, greater than the shadow cabinet minister’s 10,174 majority.  More Labour voters in the constituency backed remain than leave.  Similarly in the Wansbeck constituency of Ian Lavery in Northumberland voters backed Brexit by 56.2% . However the Labour remain tally was 12,392, greater than the Labour party chairman’s 10,435 majority. In 2017, 51% of Labour voters in the election had backed remain at the referendum, while 32% supported leave.  An insider at Best for Britain told the : “These are both seats where the MP has the ear of Jeremy Corbyn . In each, the MP’s position is better than previously thought.

The Help To Buy initiative is designed to help cash-strapped first-time buyers. But new analysis reveals the average salary of people receiving equity loans has shot up since it was introduced. Wealthy Brits earning as much as \u0026pound100,000 are getting taxpayer-funded loans to buy a home, official figures show. Those being helped earn an average of \u0026pound55,000.  And in London the average wage of Help To Buy claimants is now \u0026pound72,000 - three times the national average salary. Critics blasted the policy as “welfare for the upper middle classes” and demanded it be changed or scrapped. Help To Buy equity loans provide cash to homebuyers enabling them to own a property with a deposit of just 5%. Over the past five years, the scheme has paid out \u0026pound8.3billion - with 160,000 people benefiting from it.  New Government figures show the average household income of claimants has now risen to \u0026pound55,000. And 10% of those who have benefited earn at least \u0026pound80,000 a year. The average household income in the UK is \u0026pound25,700, although this is after direct taxes have been deducted, whereas the Help to Buy data relates to pre-tax wages. Labour’s Shadow Housing Secretary John Healey said: “With the number of younger people who own a first home in free fall, government ministers need to be doing much more to help people on ordinary incomes buy a first home of their own. “Deep cuts to housing investment mean that the number of new low-cost homes to buy like shared ownership have halved since 2010, and badly targeted schemes like Help to Buy aren’t focused on those who most need a hand up.” "},{"url":null,"title":"britains biggest family expecting baby","story":"NewsBritain\u0027s biggest family expecting baby NUMBER 21 just months after parents said 20th child would be their lastSue and Noel Radford - who famously do NOT claim any extra state benefits aside from regular child benefit - revealed their big news with a video message and Instagram post of an ultrasound\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByLucy Clarke-BillingsChris kitching14:10, 29 MAY 2018Updated18:02, 29 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe parents of Britain\u0027s biggest family are expecting their 21st baby just months after they said their 20th child would be their last.

In their YouTube video, Sue tells the camera as she\u0027s in the car with some of her children: We\u0027re just on the way home from having a very specvial, lovely appointment. And I\u0027m just wondering if anybody can guess where we\u0027ve been. I bet you can. The clip then cuts to Sue at home as she shows off her baby bump.  She tells the camera: I hope you enjoy our gender reveal and, yes, I am pregnant. Sue and Noel, from Morecambe, Lancashire, then fire pink confetti into the air in the family\u0027s back garden to reveal they\u0027re expecting a girl. Noel says later: I can\u0027t believe it, a girl. I think we\u0027re in shock. We were not expecting it.  The parents, whose family featured in the reality programme \u002720 Kids And Counting\u0027, say they do not claim any extra state benefits aside from the regular child benefit. Sue and Noel have been having children for the better part of three decades. They are already parents to Chris, 29, Sophie, 24, Chloe, 22, Jack, 21, Daniel, 19, Luke, 17, Millie, 16, Katie, 15, James, 14, Ellie, 13, Aimee, 12, Josh, 10, Max, nine, Tillie, eight, Oscar, six, Casper, five, Hallie, two, Phoebe, 22 months, and Archie, eight months. Their son Alfie was stillborn in 2014.  After Archie was born, the couple said it was strange knowing he would be their last. When the entire family appeared on ITV\u0027s This Morning in January, Sue said: Archie is definitely going to be the last Radford baby. But eldest daughter Sophie, who has three kids herself, shook her head and claimed she can\u0027t see her mum stopping. Daughter Aimee, 11, admitted she felt stressed looking after her younger siblings.

The 19-year-old told a jury at Leeds Crown Court that she had to endure physical abuse from her parents, and was left almost suicidal. She was also told she would have to have a baby with her new husband, and her father hit her when she refused, jurors were told. The victim was told that she and her family were going on a six-week holiday, and it was only after they arrived in July 2016 that her dad told her he\u0027d found a husband for her. She only managed to escape with her sister\u0027s help, and after she contacted her boyfriend back in England. Today a jury of 11 men and one woman convicted the girl\u0027s parents - who cannot be named for legal reasons - of forced marriage.  They were also found guilty of one count of using violence, threats or coercion to force their daughter into marriage, following a three-week trial. Jurors in the Leeds case heard that the girl\u0027s parents had told her they were going on a six-week holiday to Bangladesh to visit relatives and celebrate Eid. He said \u0027I have planned this for years, the guy is really suitable, I\u0027ve given him money for university, and he\u0027s a really attractive guy for round here\u0027, the victim told the court. He was trying to get me to say yes, but at no point did I say yes. I thought it was disgusting because it was my first cousin and stood my ground. The teenager, from Leeds, was supposedly told she would live like a queen and that rejecting the proposal would bring shame on her parents. She said: As the days went by, verbal abuse turned to physical abuse and my dad hit me over the head one day. It was so bad that the whole room literally went black.

Robinson, 35, was sentenced on Friday after protesting outside Leeds Crown Court - but Robinson\u0027s case can only be reported today after a judge lifted restrictions. The right wing activist was taken into custody for breach of the peace as he streamed an hour long Facebook Live outside the building, footage which was watched 250,000 times. His comments on the film had the potential to cause the collapse of a long-running trial at a cost of hundreds of thousands of pounds to the taxpayer. Details of the trial cannot be reported for legal reasons. Robinson\u0027s broadcast breached these strict rules and impacted on the defendants\u0027 right to a fair trial. Jailing him for 13 months, Judge Geoffrey Marson QC told Robinson: “No one could possibly conclude that it would be anything other than highly prejudicial to the defendants in the trial.  “I respect everyone’s right to free speech. That’s one of the most important rights that we have. “With those rights come responsibilities. The responsibility to exercise that freedom of speech within the law. “I am not sure you appreciate the potential consequence of what you have done. The judge said Robinson\u0027s actions could have meant a re-trial, costing hundreds and hundreds and thousands of pounds, Leeds Live reported.  The judge added: “It is a serious feature that you were encouraging others to share what you were streaming live on social media.” Jailing the married father-of-three, the judge said: “People have to understand that if they breach court orders there will be very real consequences.” Details of Robinson\u0027s imprisonment were initially subject to a court order banning any press coverage, but this was lifted today after representations from the media. Robinson, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was seen being led towards the back of a police van and searched in footage posted on his Facebook page. In a rare move, he was arrested, charged and sentenced within five hours.  His arrest sparked mass protests outside Downing Street over the weekend as supporters demanded his release. Police officers were deployed to keep the crowd under control. Many could be seen holding #FreeTommy placards, one reading Free the truth teller. Free Tommy. The protest eventually made its way down to Parliament Square. The Met Police said there were no arrests. In the footage of Robinson\u0027s arrest, he asks one supporter as he is led away: Can you get me a solicitor? I\u0027m on a suspended sentence, you see. One officer in the footage says before reading Robinson his rights: You are being arrested on suspicion of causing a breach of the peace.  The video footage was played to the judge as Robinson sat in the dock. Robinson, whose criminal record dates back to 2005, has a previous conviction for contempt of court. He was the subject of a suspended prison sentence, imposed at Canterbury Crown Court, after he filmed in court. He also has convictions for disobeying a court order, possessing identity documents with intent, fraud, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, possessing drugs and threatening behaviour. He pleaded guilty to contempt of court and breach of a suspended sentence.

Anthony Small, 36, took to YouTube to tell Muslims to hijack cars and carry out terror attacks in the name of Islam, the Old Bailey was told.  Small\u0027s trial began today with the former star of BBC2 programme \u0027Muslims Like Us\u0027, who is accused of encouraging the killing of innocent people in a YouTube video he posted online. In a seven and a half minute video, he included references to multinationals like Burger King and McDonald\u0027s and said the choice was either to accept the flame grilled burger, or we are going to flame grill you from the sky.  He claimed he wished to see a day when tyrants are removed and we see a day when the Muwahideen then go to conquer the White House all the way in America and Ten Downing Street, the Old Bailey heard.  The video, posted on YouTube on 12 September was titled Eid message: too many hajjis not enough muwahideed, a jury heard.  In the video Small spoke directly to the camera and discussed the commercial and military influence of America and Israel.  On his channel Small describes himself as a former professional champion boxer who now works to take mankind out of the oppression of democracy \u0026amp liberating them with Islam/shariah. Karen Robinson, prosecuting, said: On 12 September 2016 he published on his YouTube channel a video which he spoke directly to the camera and implored Muslims to take violent action against the West.  The prosecution say that the defendant\u0027s words were chosen carefully and knew full well their meaning and their meaning in the context by which they were delivered by him. The general translation of that word - muwahideen, the plural of muwahhid - is those who practice true monotheism, the belief that there is only one God. However, the term is also used by Islamic terrorist groups (and their supporters) primarily those who stress that they are waging violent jihad to create a world ruled solely by the Sharia. He is a former professional boxer who has held both British and Commonwealth titles. The defendant makes a clear call to action against the west, he says the choice is either to accept the flame grilled burger or we are going to flame grill you from the sky. He was making a clear call to action to his fellow Muslims. The defendant references that in this holy land, Muslims will see signs of commercialisation i.e. McDonald\u0027s, Coca Cola, Starbucks and the Hilton hotel and that this is an indication of the US and Israel\u0027s control over them and Saudi Arabia. In the video, shown to the jury today, Small said: You think to yourself the one with a bit of insight the one with a bit of basira is going to say who is really controlling this place? Who is making, really making money off all these haji sahabs?  Who is making money from all the plane tickets? Who is in control? Indication that America and their puppet masters the Israelis are in control of them tyrant sell out apostate Saudi leaders, is in the McDonalds sign you see the Starbuck sign you see, the Coca Cola sign everywhere. I am not calling for you to boycott Starbucks or McDonald\u0027s instead buy Israeli-made Desert Eagles cock them back and let them go in the sons of monkeys peoples.

Ahmed Elgwahry even waited with them on the phone for an hour after he knew they had succumbed to the flames. Speaking slowly and calmly, he said he was on the phone to his younger sister, Mariem Elgwahry, 27, as she and mum Eslah Elgwahry, 64, took refuge on the top floor of the high-rise block. Mr Elgwahry described how he stood at the bottom of the tower and realised that running in to try to save them would have been an act of suicide. He told the inquiry on its sixth day of commemorative hearings: On my final call with Mariem, despite her suffering, despite her gradual deterioration, despite her gradual loss of consciousness, she persisted in letting me know that she was still there.  She started fading away from me rather rapidly, but she kept going all the way until she was no longer audible. She started to mumble, started banging the floor, and then finally no longer responsive. It was at this point I presumed I lost my mum at the same time. But then about 20 seconds later, for the first time that early morning, I heard my mum\u0027s voice. She was struggling for breath, and said her last words: \u0027I can\u0027t breathe, I can\u0027t breathe\u0027. That was the last time I heard her voice.  She was so frightened that she had not spoken prior to this. He disconnected the call more than an hour after their final moments, he said. All he could hear was the crackle of fire. Mr Elgwahry was given a standing ovation as he completed his testimony. He explained that months later, only fragments of their bodies were recovered by the coroner and her team, who attempted to piece them back together bone for bone, as if they were dinosaurs. Mr Elgwahry\u0027s father died years ago from an aggressive form of cancer, he said.

A Rolls-Royce Phantom IV took the new Duchess of Sussex and her mum Doria Ragland to St George\u0027s Chapel for the stunning ceremony.  It\u0027s the same vehicle which took Wallis Simpson to the funeral of her husband, the Duke of Windsor, in 1972. Both Meghan and Mrs Simpson are American divorcees although the 36-year-old\u0027s marriage into the royal family has not caused a crisis at the very highest levels of government.  In 1936 King Edward VIII, the Queen\u0027s uncle, made clear he intended to marry Mrs Simpson - something which parliament would not approve. And so he abdicated, reigning for just 326 days, one of the shortest in British history. His younger brother George VI took over the throne and following his death in 1952 then-Princess Elizabeth became Queen.   Prince Harry\u0027s decision to marry former actress Meghan Markle , 80 years after his great great uncle got married in exile, has been greeted with a lot less consternation.  Royal experts think the wedding could prove to be a turning point for the monarchy with the Duchess of Sussex also mixed-race and previously outspoken about her feminist views. Princess Diana\u0027s former butler Paul Burrell has warned that Meghan will cause \u0027ripples in the royal pond\u0027.  In an interview with Good Morning Britain Burrell said it was Meghan\u0027s colourful past which could cause problems for some of the royals steeped in tradition.

Lottie Mason created an initially anonymous Facebook post after she said she saw a man who appeared to have \u0027passed out from Black Mamba\u0027.  She said that she “could really have done without having to explain that to her five-year-old son” and immediately rang an ambulance when she saw him. The post read: “Thoroughly enjoy having to explain to my five-year-old-son why there is a man just laying on the floor in the street passed out from mamba. “I called an ambulance, and I hope he is ok, but I could really have done without having to explain that to my son”.  It was not clear from the Facebook post to the group \u0027Spotted Ilkeston town\u0027 where exactly the incident happened.  After the post made on Saturday afternoon was eventually made public, people jumped to criticise Lottie’s actions - suggesting that she had wasted the NHS resources, reports Derbyshire Live .  One post read: “Our NHS is struggling and you call an ambulance? For a person who chose to do this to themselves? I don’t mind a bit of fun but not a pantomime. “Someone could have a serious condition needing medical care but no, we will go and treat a mambo head. Another post read how it was a “waste of resources” - while another said how she should have “left them to die”. However, Lottie, from Ilkeston in Derbyshire, shed her anonymity and went to her own defence about her actions.  She said: “Of course I called an ambulance, someone\u0027s son/father/brother was lying on the ground in the middle of the street. “I wasn\u0027t aware what had happened to him until someone went over to help him (I didn\u0027t, as I had my son with me). “Even if I had known beforehand that he had taken drugs, I still wouldn\u0027t have hesitated to call an ambulance.

More than half of Brits barely say a word to their neighbours -- and 68 per cent describe them as “STRANGERS”. Two thirds admit days can pass without them even seeing others living on the same street, while 73 per cent don’t even know what their names are. Half of adults say they do not feel part of a “good neighbourly community” and nine in ten admit they NEVER volunteer to help out with local charities and groups.  Only one in ten would assist with a local tidy up, 12 per cent would help with a charity event and a mere FOUR per cent of folk would organise a fundraiser or attend a fun run. Worryingly, four in ten people feel no sense of pride about where they live, and 84 per cent fail to participate in any local events.   Roy Prenton, from Skipton Building Society, which carried out the study via OnePoll , said: “It’s a shock and disappointment to discover that Britain’s community spirit – for so long a national feature which bonded people together – was in decline.  “Wouldn’t it be great to try and turn this around and help rebuild our communities to bring them alive again? “That’s the aim of Skipton’s Grassroots Giving community funding scheme, which has given away \u0026pound405,000 over the past six years to help 810 community groups across the UK to achieve their dreams. “Many of these groups do not receive any external funding and all rely on volunteers.  “We know there are a large number of groups looking to make their neighbourhoods a better more friendly and inclusive place to live. So we are once again supporting them by offering another \u0026pound82,500 in donations this year.” “The study found 51 per cent of adults have no idea what the children next door are called, while 55 per cent don’t know what profession their neighbours work in. Two thirds couldn’t even hazard a guess at the ages of those living in the next house, while three quarters wouldn’t know what hobbies and interests they have or whether they have extended family. Only seven per cent of those polled would regularly socialise with their neighbours by way of dinner dates and barbecues.  And less than one in ten would consider organising and getting involved in a street party to get to know everyone better. In fact, a fifth admit the only reason they interact with the neighbours is when they want them to do a favour such as watering the plants or feeding the cat. And the same percentage claims just because they live next door to someone, does not mean they have to be friends with them. In addition to the adversity to getting to know the neighbours, only half of respondents support local businesses by shopping with them and just 18 per cent would bother attending rage days, carnivals and fetes.

Sarah Boyton, 51, wasn\u0027t surprised when she was diagnosed with skin cancer as she\u0027d spent her entire life using sunbeds and not protecting her skin in the sun.  But despite having the cancer removed – leaving behind a 5cm scar under her eye - Sarah is continuing to top up her sun tan.  Sarah claims she’s addicted to tanning her skin and it’s her laid back nature that’s to blame for her inability to stop lying in the sun.  She has made some changes since her diagnosis though as she now always ensures she wears factor 10 sun cream while sunbathing.  The cafe owner said: I love lying in the sun, the feeling of the warmth on my skin, I know I shouldn\u0027t go out in it but I can\u0027t help myself. I\u0027m addicted to being brown and I\u0027ll stop at no lengths to ensure I have a natural glow. I grew up never wearing sun cream and I even had a sunbed in my house so I could go on it whenever I fancied topping up my tan. I do now wear sun cream but at the most it\u0027ll be factor 10 and by the end of my holiday I\u0027ll swap to oil. Despite this I have warned my friends and family about the dangers of the sun after my own skin cancer diagnosis. A lot of my friends always used the sunbeds but after my ordeal and seeing my scars they\u0027ve stopped.  Sarah was first diagnosed with skin cancer during October 2016 and has continued to go on two sunny holidays each year. She added: To remove the cancer from my face I needed two operations after the first didn\u0027t get all of the cancer. I\u0027m really pleased with the scar now, the surgeon was amazing, it almost looks like I\u0027ve had a face lift. “I have been warned by doctors to stay out of the sun and to wear total sun block but I can’t help myself. Sarah - who lost her son, Jack, 17, in a car crash five years ago - has admitted she doesn\u0027t take life too seriously after losing her only son. She added: I warn others about the dangers but I don\u0027t really take my own advice as I still go in the sun.

The student, 21, was in hospital alone and needed to have an IV drip put in.  Jordyn is afraid of needles – as many are – so was feeling a little down about the procedure. Thankfully, an imaginative nurse helped her through it.   Jordyn shared the nurse\u0027s offbeat, but effective tactics on Twitter:            We thought what the nurse did was pretty great and asked Jordyn a little bit more about it.  The childcare student comes from West Virginia, US, and has suffered a few health problems lately: I was admitted in the middle of the night with a kidney infection. My parents were out of town and I couldn’t get a hold of any of my friends. his time last year I had a lot of medical issues going on, so I’m pretty used to being in the hospital by myself.

Jordyn said she knew the nurse knew what she was doing and that she could trust her, but was still really struggling with the IV. The student told the Mirror: [She] told me that it would be a really quick process and that she’s good at what she does, and I said \u0027thank you, I just need to distract myself\u0027. She instantly whipped out her phone and was like, \u0027here, I’ll help distract you\u0027... and she pulled up her Tinder and said, \u0027you’re a pretty girl, I know you have some great taste in men, go through these fools and tell me which ones I should message back\u0027.  It was funny.

Her make-believe friend is, well...     This is my imaginary mum Grateful, the toddler explains in the feature. Her yellow eyelashes mean she can see in the dark - she only comes to see me at night-time. It scares me sometimes but I always want her to come back. She has two babies in her belly.

Anonymous street artist @Athirty4 left the household appliance in beneath Littlemore Roundabout, Oxford, sparking a debate as to whether it constituted a show of creativity or simple fly-tipping. @Athirty4 – a play on the A34 road, which runs through Oxford – transformed the underpass into an exhibition space on Wednesday.  Please use this machine to cleanse your mind of all prejudices and negative preconceptions relating to contemporary art, a handy notice read. By Thursday, Oxford City Council had removed the installation. A council statement said: The washing machine is blocking the public highway.   If we leave it in place we\u0027re effectively sanctioning it, which means we could be held liable for any injuries if, for example, a cyclist crashed into it at night. If the artist wants to create lasting public artwork in Oxford, they should get in touch with us. Clearly, however, the artist appears to favour working without the shackles of corporate legality.

Claire Nelson, from Auckland, was preparing for death as she was stranded in the desert and thought \u0027nobody\u0027s going to know I\u0027m missing\u0027. The 35-year-old\u0027s tale of survival has stunned rescuers and medical staff with the hiker using her sunscreen bottle cap to collect her own urine to drink. Maggie Hickton said rescue personnel discovered her badly injured daughter hurt in a dried-out creek on Friday.  She\u0027s actually in good spirits but she\u0027s still in shock, Maggie told the Herald on Sunday. It was three nights in the desert with a broken pelvis. She\u0027s gone through all those thoughts about thinking she\u0027s going to die.  Claire was hiking in the Joshua Tree National Park in California when she slipped and fell, reports the New Zealand Herald .  She lay for three days unable to move, exposed to the sun and with only a t-shirt and shorts for cover. The hiker desperately tried to move the pieces of clothing around her for shelter from the scorching sun. The 35-year-old was due to meet with a friend on Thursday and had hoped when she didn\u0027t show rescuers would be sent to search for her.  Claire was left thinking, nobody knows where I am, nobody\u0027s going to know I\u0027m missing but she needed to hang on until Thursday and hope someone would save her, Maggie said. When no one came searching on Thursday she really felt she was going to die. She couldn\u0027t move and the sun was fierce. At night she was petrified of the rattlesnakes and other things. Nelson used the cap of her sunscreen bottle to collect her urine to drink. Maggie first started getting worried when she hadn\u0027t heard from Claire or seen her post on social media for a while.

The woman has not yet had a relationship , but doesn\u0027t worry that she\u0027s not worth liking and doesn\u0027t pity herself - despite the reactions of others.  In an article for an Australian website, she describes how someone once greeted her at a social event with the words: Oh, it\u0027s The Virgin!. On other occasions, she says she has been told she must be too picky - an infuriating comment typically made by people who don\u0027t know her.  The woman, who has remained anonymous, shared how it feels to have no sexual experience at an age when most people do on MamaMia .   I don’t feel shame because I don’t think there is something inherently ‘wrong’ with being a virgin or with me, she writes in the article. I don’t worry that I’m not worth liking, she adds. In contrast, she says there are many people with sexual experience who should feel shame - such as those who have cheated on or lied to a partner. The woman goes on to question how she came to be in such a situation. It wasn’t a conscious decision. I, like many people, definitely want to find a person to love and respect who will reciprocate that, she says. She describes how although she has been attracted to others on many occasions, she has found some of them to be already in relationships.

Moments after the boy\u0027s father, Daniel Bornaz, told him \u0027don\u0027t get scared up there\u0027, the boy climbed a ladder and edged off the top of a two-and-a-half storey high podium to begin his zipline. Footage recorded on Daniel\u0027s mobile phone shows his son, Raul, immediately dropping to the ground beside the ride\u0027s operator and screaming upon impact. MirrorOnline has edited the moment he fell in the video footage above. As his father rushes to his side yelling for someone to call an ambulance, Raul yells in pain, Oh my God, I can\u0027t stand it! God I\u0027m dying, I can\u0027t take this much longer! His panicked father asks,  What happened? to which a male\u0027s voice replies, Calm down sir, he\u0027s ok, calm down.  Daniel replies he will not calm down, after asking a second time for an ambualnce. The father later told local media the zip-line rope had been stuck together with duct tape, with his son suffering a broken leg, shoulder contusion and sprained ankle as a result of the incident. It\u0027s also been revealed the zipline activity may not have had council approval to be operating.  The incident happened at a park in the city of Craiova, in Romania\u0027s south-western Dolj County. The activity was organised by local NGO \u0027Amicus din Craiova\u0027, during an event where hundreds of children were being taught about the role of policemen in society. After a talk, the organisers had planned different activities for the children. Among those activities was a zipline set up in the park by organisers. Moments after the fall, a police officer and paramedic arrived to attend to the child, who was rushed to hospital, according to reports.  Spokesperson for Craiova County Hospital, Cristina Geormaneanu, told local press: The boy was diagnosed with a left shoulder contusion, and a left ankle sprain. He was conscious and his blood pressure was stable with stable breathing but one of the boy\u0027s legs was also broken during the accident. The child\u0027s father has blamed the accident on the organisers of the activities, saying: The (rope) was broken and held together by duct tape in the hope it could hold the weight. We just came here to have a good time and now I am going to pick him up from hospital.  Police say they are investigating the incident. Spokesperson of Dolj County Police, Cosmin Gradinaru said: The first investigations revealed that the minor had fallen as a result of the breaking of the rope connecting the safety harness and the ropeway pulley. In this case, we have opened a criminal case for negligence. Sources claim the zipline was illegally installed.

Denis O’Brien, who is described as a “ball-breaker whom you thank for breaking your balls”, has been lauded by influential figures leading the reconstruction effort in the country for his hands on, business-led, social impact investment. George Howard, the site manager for the reconstruction of Haiti’s Port-au-Prince Iron Market, said he “looked back fondly on his balls being broken” after receiving assistance from businessman O’Brien. He said his demand for a “proper return for his investment in terms of impact” was the key to overcoming challenge, leading to a sustainable reconstruction and sustainable development.  It ensured that the impact he had was not just on the communities assisted, “but also making the performance of his own company and its people better”. O’Brien’s back story provides some of the clues to what he brings to rebuilding countries. As a self-made man he made mistakes and also got lucky in his business endeavours. Back in 2004, O’Brien set up the Digicel Foundation to support projects in Jamaica, Haiti and Papua New Guinea. He realised that the best people to drive the Digicel Foundation were the Digital Group managers and employees themselves, if it was part of their business model it would be part of the Group’s DNA.  As extensive research has shown, what O’Brien understood instinctively was that it was also a way of keeping good people: effective staff want to do interesting things. Rebuilding countries and communities is about as interesting a challenge as life can throw up. The Group Board sets out key performance indicators that divisional managers must report back on, including indicators for the Foundation’s work. On this model, the Foundation’s work receives the same priority, attention and importance as that of the business. O’Brien believes that in order for the Foundation’s work to be as impactful as possible, communities should not only benefit from financial support, but also from the skills of the company’s staff. It has since invested US$122 million in community projects.  “The greed that led to the Wall Street crash of 2008 [showed] that the capitalist model was broken”, Mr O’Brien says. “If the truth be known, I admire social entrepreneurs far more than entrepreneurs – because they make the biggest impact on society. “Looking after the people who in our busy lives we can’t look after, is surely the noblest cause.” O’Brien has personally worked hard in Haiti following that country’s devastating earthquake in 2010, as part of the Clinton Global Initiative, O\u0027Brien donated $5 million to Haitian NGOs in order to provide relief to earthquake victims, supplied cargo planes and boats to undertake relief measures and distributed family-size tents to at least 100,000 Haitians.

Among the unusual never-before-seen species shown in video footage is a \u0027ratfish\u0027 which has big ears and - despite having eyes - is blind, said to use a lateral line to sense the change of current. Later in the clip, a group of bright red deep sea shrimps move together across the illuminated and baited drone area and a cutthroat eel attempts to rip the meat away. The species live in seamounts - ridges caused by underwater \u0027mountains\u0027 - as deep down as 5,000 metres below the ocean\u0027s surface in dark and cold climates.  China Ocean Mineral Resources Research and Development Association chief scientist Wang Chunsheng said the creatures were filmed using a remotely-operated drone. He said the robot technology had also enabled scientists to discover new life in previously unscoured parts of the ocean. In recent years, with the development of technology, we have generally found over 30 kinds of new species through the application of Jiaolong Submersible and underwater remotely-operated vehicle.

My first one was about Banana being very serious but Orange wanting to have a party.Banana was furious when he came home and Orange had all the fruit and vegetables over for a party.Orange had to say sorry.I also did all the drawings for my book and my Grandad Kelly said it was brilliant.My school is Newport Primary and I am very lucky to have great friends – Zerah, Eva, Darcey, Ava-Ruth and all my classmates.They love getting to hear my stories at homework sharing time every week.Just now, I am writing stories about my class. I put jokes in too.Sometimes people don’t laugh but my mum/editor says this happens all the time, even to comedians, so I shouldn’t let it bother me.My first class story was about how we were all kidnapped and there were no teachers around so the pupils saved the day.My second story was about how we lost someone and I found him and saved the day.In my third story, we were all locked in and had to be saved by the primary ones.My next story will be called “Chaotic Classroom”.

It was shaped by some of the biggest names in golf and has been the setting for remarkable matches and tournaments,” he said.“It is a special place and The 1562 Course is a direct link to the golfing past that established this great game.

We have asked the developer’s consultant to carry out an appraisal of all available access options for the site. Once this is completed, we will offer our opinion on the proposals.”With £1.2m being spent to buy the land and having identified the move as vital to a successful future, Dundee remain determined to push forward.They’ve never put a figure on the cost of the development and declined to comment.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"paul dixon keen to see kev mcdonald back in premier league","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIf Fulham get back to the Premier League by beating Aston Villa in today’s Championship play-off final at Wembley, Kevin McDonald will be back where he should have spent most of his career.That’s the verdict of the mercurial midfielder’s former Dundee team-mate Paul Dixon.As teenagers over a decade ago Dixon and McDonald were thrust into the first team as the Dark Blues continued their struggle to bounce back from administration in 2003.After three years together, the pair left Dens Park within a few weeks of each other in the summer of 2008, Dixon to city rivals Dundee United and McDonald for Burnley.Within a year of heading south, the latter was playing top-flight football with the Clarets and “Dicker” admits to thinking at the time that whether or not the Turf Moor outfit would stay at that level, his mate would.After an infamous incident that saw McDonald leave the ground after being substituted at half-time during a 6-1 home defeat at the hands of Manchester City, what had been a promising start to his career down south faded for a time.He played just one more top-tier game that season and has not performed at that level in just over eight years since. That still amazes Dixon.“Honestly, knowing Kev’s talent when he went down to Burnley and got promoted to the Premier League, I expected him to do what Virgil van Dijk and Andy Robertson have,” he said.“I was sure it would be a stepping stone to one of the top-six clubs down there because that is the kind of ability he has.“He was thrown in at the deep end at Dundee, like a few of us were, but he quickly became a very big player in the team and it wasn’t a surprise when English clubs started watching him every week.“Burnley seemed a good move for him because he was getting a game and they got promoted but something went wrong and it knocked him back for a while.“What exactly the story was I don’t know and maybe we never will, but for me the good thing is he is back in with a chance of getting up to the highest level again.“I have to say when you look at the clubs he’s played for down south and the number of games he’s had, you would never say he’s had a bad career.“It’s just that he belongs in their Premier League and I really do hope Fulham win tomorrow and he can spend the next few seasons at that level.”He notes with interest McDonald is no longer the attacking midfielder of his Dens days, but tends to be the man who sits a touch deeper.For him, that’s just a another sign of his all-round ability.“Kev was very much an attacking midfielder when we played together but the times I have seen Fulham on television this season he has had more of a holding role.“He can still get forward and chip in with a few goals and he’ll be a very important player for them at Wembley.”Such is the “small world” nature of football that McDonald is not the only reason Dixon will be rooting for the Cottagers in a game that could earn the winners £160 million, even if they were to be relegated this time next year.“Oliver Norwood plays beside Kev in their midfield and I played in the same team as him at Huddersfield, so it would be good to see them both go up.“I even know the other midfielder, Stefan Johansen because I played against him a few times when he was at Celtic and I was at United.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b0bcbdf26fb0-846x564.jpg ","title":"revealed majority of dundee fans back dens park name change","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe majority of Dundee FC fans would back a move to introduce a sponsor’s name to their Dens Park stadium.An exclusive poll for the Evening  showed that nearly 59% of supporters are keen on the idea of gaining extra income by changing the name of their historic home.We revealed last week that Kilmac could be incorporated into the Dens Park name from next season.More than 300 people took part in our survey, with 186 voting yes to the question: “Would you welcome sponsorship of Dens Park to secure more income for Dundee FC?”Responding to the poll, Steve Barham from Stobswell wrote: “Any income to the club would be fantastic.“Regardless of any name change, it would still be Dens to many fans.“Other clubs have their stadiums sponsored nowadays. I would imagine that should the move to ‘Nou Campy’ (the club’s proposed new stadium) happen, that will also follow suit with a stadium sponsor.”Fellow fan Garry Joiner, of Dunfermline, wrote: “Football is no longer a sport, it is a business and needs to operate as one.“A name change will have no fundamental impact on Dens Park to those who have always known it as Dens Park.”Richard Gennies, who’s based in Jakarta, backed sponsorship but insisted the stadium would “always be known as Dens Park no matter what the sign says”.Another fan who also backs the move wrote: “If the name change brings in ongoing cash investment it must be a good thing for the club.“It would be good to retain Dens in the name.”One supporter suggested the name “Kilmac Dens Park” and others said they would support the move if “Dens” was incorporated.However, others hit out at the sponsorship idea.One fan wrote: “What good would changing the name do? All it would do is annoy the loyal fans who go to Dens week in, week out.”Jasen Niblo, from Birkhill, said he didn’t like the fact the move was “all about money” and urged the club to keep the name.Another fan cautioned the club against inviting any food-related sponsors, saying: “As long as it doesn’t sound as bad as the Tony Macaroni Arena (in Livingston) we might live with it.”Graham Pert, from Whitfield, added: “I’m all up for things that will be great for the club but at this stage I think it would be sad to see the name changed from Dens

cross-funding arrangement was introduced six years ago and has ultimately left Highland Council baffled, according to its leader Margaret Davidson.In discussions about a review of the \"partnership arrangements\" for providing integrated health and social care, she told colleagues: \"We need to have better governance around the finance. I find NHS finance statements to be completely opaque.\"We need something much clearer based upon what we need to know each month.\"The council is to write to the health board about the issue.A report to councillors by Bill Alexander, the council\u0027 director care and learning, pointed to poor links between \"financial challenges and service planning processes, particularly regarding adult social care\".He said one of the key motivations behind integrating services had been \"the recognition that the resources of both organisations would become increasingly constrained,\" and that \"major change\" was now required to the way services are planned and delivered.Speaking after the debate, Councillor Davidson said: \"It can improve a lot. I\u0026rsquom still fixated on the most important thing of all, which is to shift the balance of care out of hospitals and into the community.\"The financial challenges (for both organisations) have just got worse.

I think it will help support people\u0027 fond relationship with the river.\"While the final detail has still to be completed, a group of fishermen from Inverness Angling Club seemed relaxed as they studied the computer generated images.Club president Graham MacKenzie said: \"Around the hut is already a gathering place.

Inverness economist Tony Mackay has suggested that a trick was missed in the 2018/19 budget.In the wake of a plea from council leader Margaret Davidson for the public to lobby MPs and MSPs for an increased annual grant, Mr Mackay believes much more could already have been done.\"It needs to do more to balance income and expenditure,\" he said.\"I have friends in the council\u0027 finance department who tell me it should be possible to cut spending by a further 10 per cent to 15 per cent without a significant impact on services.\"Regarding expenditure, the two main categories are care and learning (\u0026pound430 million) and community services (\u0026pound117 million).

He pinpointed Neale and insisted he was an “outstanding” player who could walk into any top team in Europe.Still a teenager, Neale proved that in Munich.Willie said: “I have so many happy football memories of Neale, but also so many other great memories because he was such a great guy.”Neale made his Aberdeen first team debut on October 11 1980 in a 2-0 defeat of Kilmarnock at Pittodrie.He partnered Willie at centre-back in that game because Alex McLeish was out injured at the time.Willie said: “Neale broke through very early in his career and was just a wee lad.“He always had that talent and I think he had the eye on the sweeper’s position but I had to persuade him to move into midfield.“Neale and Neil Simpson were an absolutely magnificent combination.“Neale was an Aberdeen boy brought through and developed by the club and given the big chance to shine.“And he certainly did that.”Following that debut, Neale would go on to win two league titles, four Scottish Cups and the League Cup domestically.“Tattie” would add the European Cup Winners’ Cup and Super Cup in 1983 as an integral part of the only Scottish team to win two European trophies.His first trophy success came in 1982 with a 4-1 Scottish Cup win over Rangers after extra-time.With the Reds 3-1 up at Hampden, Neale, just 18, scored an iconic goal.He smashed a shot into an open net in front of the Rangers end, before punching the air \u0026#8230 and then doing a forward roll.Neale made 220 appearances for Aberdeen, scoring 10 goals, before transferring to top flight Aston Villa in 1986.He would go on to play for Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline Athletic and Ross County.In a successful managerial career, Neale guided Ross County through two successive promotions.As manager of Hartlepool he took the side to the play-offs for the second tier.Neale would also go on to manage Gillingham and Peterhead before returning to Hartlepool in the 2011-12 season.His final trophy success with Aberdeen was the Scottish Cup in 1986 – a 3-0 win over Hearts at Hampden.Fellow midfielder Jim Bett played alongside Neale in that cup final win.Jim, speaking from his home in Iceland, said: “Neale was a great guy to have in the dressing room as he was always upbeat and telling jokes.“He was a great footballer and also a great guy.“We played together in the Aberdeen team that won the Scottish Cup in 1986.“Alex Ferguson left the following season and that was the start of the team beginning to break up.“The boys who had played under Sir Alex had won everything and perhaps needed a new challenge.“Neale went down to Aston Villa and one or two others went elsewhere.“He played for a few other clubs but his heart was always in Aberdeen.”Neale signed schoolboy forms with Aberdeen under Billy McNeill in the 1977-78 season.He was such an exciting talent Neale made his debut for the Aberdeen reserves at the age of just 14.On turning 16, Neale was secured on a full-time contract at Pittodrie by Sir Alex Ferguson.He would go on to conquer Europe before he was out of his teens.Jim said: “It was some achievement for a player to come through the youth ranks at Aberdeen and then win European trophies.“Neale won everything domestically with Aberdeen and was a key part of that side that won two European trophies.“Alex Ferguson was a manager who gave young players a chance and at that time there were a few of them coming through at Pittodrie.“That was very fortunate for Aberdeen.“Neale went on to reach the heights with Aberdeen and lift European trophies.“It was fantastic to see a young player from the city go on to have so much success.“Neale achieved so much during his career.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2017/10/59e5aebf3e38d-848x564.jpg ","title":"colourful mural to reflect history of popular park","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA mural is set to deliver a splash of colour – and a dose of history – to a popular Aberdeen park.A new community group has been created to paint the artwork on the Gardener’s Bothy in Seaton Park and work has now started.It is being carried out in collaboration with Friends of Seaton Park and the Seaton Community Centre Art History Group.The project became a reality after the community centre received participatory budget funding from Aberdeen City Council.It is hoped the finished mural will capture scenes from the popular park, including the family favourite train attraction Mr Therm.The group meets every Monday from 1.30pm, weather permitting, to work on the bothy.Sheila Gordon, chairwoman of Friends of Seaton Park, said: “It was a suggestion that was made a long time ago, I’ve been trying to get it done for years.“There’s an artist in residence at the community centre, so he’ll be taking the classes.

There are no rules or limits to the imagination – they may want to be a wizard or superhero.If a child does not know what they want to be they can decorate their hat with something they are passionate about such as a sport, graffiti art, dancing shoes, or musical instrument.The idea behind the fun is to raise money for the UK’s leading children\u0026#8217s charity to help give thousands of disadvantaged children a better future. When they go into school, nursery or playgroup on May 18, parents and carers can make a voluntary donation of £1 to £2 to Barnardo\u0026#8217s Scotland.Children are full of surprises, and this is a fun way of allowing their imaginations to run wild in a way that will be inspiring, educational and raise money to help transform the lives of children who desperately need our support.It is easy to sign up on our website where you\u0026#8217ll find lots of resources and ideas to ensure your fundraising Hat Day will be a huge success and help support the children and young people we support in your local community.To register, visit www.barnardos.org.uk/hatday.

It was padlocked with a security lock.What a disappointment and what a waste of something worth sharing.I thought of how blessed we are in Argyll to be able to leave doors unlocked.Most of our churches are open day and night to extend a welcome to visitors.Jesus once said that he was \u0026#8216the door\u0026#8217 \u0026#8211 the door to life.The way to Jesus is never locked or barricaded.In his company, when we are stressed or worried, we can find that oasis of calm to refresh and renew our flagging souls.There is no key to this door, for it is always open, always welcoming.It\u0026#8217s a door that leads to a journey – the journey of a lifetime.It was a journey begun long, long ago and continues now and into the future.There will be companions on the way and it will never be dull.Different people will bring different talents and sing different songs, but we will all have the same destination.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 24","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 17/05/18, 11:31 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.We heartily agree with the decision of the Lord Lieutenant to nominate Betty Rhodick to attend the royal wedding.As far as we are aware, no one works harder for Lochgilphead  \u0026#8211 and once Betty puts her mind to something\u0026#8230Betty and Geordie have been the figureheads for the Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day commemorations since they started, but she deserves this recognition not just for this one annual event, but for all she does on our behalf.Enjoy yourself, Betty and Kelly.The renovated Kilmartin Museum is now almost within reach.This is sure to be of great economic benefit to the region when it opens in two years and it is an exciting prospect that will enable the unique heritage of Mid Argyll to be properly showcased.Just what was last weekend\u0026#8217s Scapa festival at Ardkinglas?The answer is probably unique to every individual who attended.

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding. And it can take place anywhere – at home, at work, at school.Just pop the kettle on, slice up a cake or two, homemade or bought (you have to have cake at a wedding) and invite friends, relatives and colleagues to enjoy a cuppa or perhaps even a glass of champagne.The serious point is that you’ll be helping to fight meningitis and move us one step closer to our vision of a future where no one in the UK dies from meningitis \u0026#8211 and everyone affected gets the support they need to rebuild their life.Sadly, despite developments in vaccines, meningitis and septicaemia continue to affect thousands every year and kill more under-fives than any other infectious disease. Help us fight back on all fronts by funding research to eradicate the disease, raising awareness and supporting survivors.That would be the perfect wedding present.Find out more at www.MeningitisNow.org and search for Time 4 Tea.Elaine Close, community fundraiser, Meningitis NowSir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street be kind enough to contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29, and his movements in the immediate aftermath.We are both keen to know that this young person is alright as she appeared to be terribly frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs as he headed straight for her.Knowing she was now fine would put our minds at rest.

Moore took the free-kick, but his curling effort from 27 yards lacked power.Moore, however, was not to be denied his hat-trick and 60 seconds later  steered a good low finish past Scott Urquhart\u0026#8217s left hand.The early first-half jitters returned to the League defence just after the hour mark when hesitation in the box allowed Nikki MacDougall, of host club Tarbert, to nip in and force the ball past Urquhart from nine yards to add a fifth goal for Argyll.A flurry of changes from both sides with 16 minutes remaining saw Scott Soudan and Lewis MacNaughton replace MacDougall and McCallum for Argyll.The league adjusted quicker to the changes and Kyle Reid and Robbie Martin combined well for Martin to pull a goal back in the 77th minute.With five minutes remaining, Soudan\u0026#8217s tenacity in the box robbed Daniel Smith on the six yard line and left him one-on-one with Urquhart.Soudan\u0026#8217s stabbed effort was stopped by Urquhart\u0026#8217s outstretched right foot but, typical of his luck on the day, the rebound fell kindly for the Campbeltown Pupils\u0026#8217 striker who rounded the prostrate Urquhart and walked the ball into the empty net.The full-time whistle ended an entertaining encounter with the players and officials retiring to the Islay Frigate Hotel for the presentation ceremony.The Duncan MacDougall man of the match award was given to Red Star\u0026#8217s Kieran Moore.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sun brings out the best in lochgilphead golfers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 17/05/18, 2:24 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOn a lovely sunny Sunday the gents competed to gain a place to play in this year\u0026#8217s match and knockout competition.Jim Hunter was excited to return a nett score of 58, six strokes below par.

It was a gamble \u0026#8211 but one that paid off, with the business now turning over millions each year.He left the business \u0026#8216at least 10 years ago\u0026#8217, but was a very interested visitor at last week\u0026#8217s \u0026#8216Fyne at 40\u0026#8217 celebrations \u0026#8211 more on pages 16 and 17 \u0026#8211 to mark the company\u0026#8217s four decades in business.\u0026#8216Looking back, I feel quite astonished really,\u0026#8217 he told the Advertiser.\u0026#8216I mean, away back we had a wooden hut, but before that there was a fish box and an umbrella. We were growing shellfish, cooking prawns and smoking a bit of fish.\u0026#8216The restaurant as we see it today was an old farm steading \u0026#8211 well, it was a midden, really. But we slowly evolved within it.\u0026#8216It was open to the slates and the wind used to go straight up the length of the oyster bar. We had a hessian sack to keep down the draught, and it used to stand out at about 45 degrees a lot of the time. It was very primitive for many years, because we were skint.\u0026#8216People sat in their overcoats, but they liked the style. All of a sudden they could get local shellfish, and it just developed from there.\u0026#8217He continued: \u0026#8216Since my time the whole place has had a re-make and it is really, really nice.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s been driven by the volume of people wanting to dine here. I mean, you couldn\u0026#8217t keep up that slightly rustic look. It\u0026#8217s a cracking place now. Just superb.\u0026#8217Johnny Noble sadly died in 2002, aged just 66.\u0026#8216He was an inspiring, lovely man, said Mr Lane. \u0026#8216No matter what disaster befell us no matter what cock-up happened, he was ever-optimistic and just kept us going.\u0026#8216We would have our business meetings in the billiard room at [Johnny\u0026#8217s home] Ardkinglas House, and there would be a bottle of something. That just keeps the morale going.\u0026#8216He was a great man, and wonderful entertainment.\u0026#8217The stories of Johnny Noble are legion, and most are true.Andy Lane recalled: \u0026#8216In the days of the Oyster Bar in our old draughty building, everyone had to muck in. Johnny would go round being the wine waiter for a while. Until, that is, someone would choose an inappropriate wine. At that point he\u0026#8217d start a sort of genial argument with them. In the end he\u0026#8217d sit down with them and you\u0026#8217d never see him again for the rest of the evening.\u0026#8216I don\u0026#8217t think we realised just how important he was for the business until he was gone.\u0026#8217Now living a quieter life in Cornwall with his Dexters, Mr Lane concluded: \u0026#8216My wife and I changed tack in life, really, and it keeps us busy.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

Council chiefs shut a popular seafront tower amid safety fears in March. Now they have warned that the unit, enjoyed annually by thousands, will lie dormant until “later this year”. The multi-play tower is awaiting a \u0026pound260,000 overhaul after “a number of health and safety risks” were uncovered. Other equipment is still in use, but the giant climbing frame which anchors the park remains roped off. The lack of progress on a replacement has led to discontent among parents and political figures. Ayr west councillor, Martin Dowey, said: “As a tourist town, getting this replaced should have been high priority.  “Thousands of families will come to our beach over the summer and be left disappointed. “It is sadly indicative of a lack of progress from the council on many issues at the seafront.” Councillors signed off \u0026pound260,000 in their March budget to fund a replacement for the old play tower, which lasted 23 years. A council spokesman said: “The seafront play park remains open with funds agreed for a new play tower following the budget decision in March. “We are set to dismantle the old equipment in the next few weeks. “The new tower will be made to order and we expect it to be delivered later this year, it will then take a few weeks to install.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayr roundabout named among uks","story":"NewsAyr roundabout named among UK\u0027s worstWhitletts has landed an unenviable spot in the country’s top 10 road tests to avoid.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson16:14, 28 MAY 2018NewsWhitletts roundabout is one of the most dangerous in the UK (Image: IAIN BROWN)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA roundabout branded ‘Witless’ for striking fear into drivers has been named among the UK’s worst. Whitletts has landed an unenviable spot in the country’s top 10 road tests to avoid. The list, published by recovery firm 24/7 Vehicle Rescue, claims the “nerve-jangling lottery” has put Ayr on the map for all the wrong reasons. It follows a \u0026pound3.5m scheme to increase lanes and install traffic lights on the roundabout in 2006, which has sparked trouble for many trying to negotiate its contours ever since. Transport Scotland held a safety review in 2015 after stats showed Whitletts was more dangerous than the giant M8 roundabout at Hermiston Gait near Edinburgh.  Ranjen Gohri, spokesman for 24/7 Vehicle Rescue, said: “Britain is famed for its roundabouts, and being able to safely negotiate them is a major part of driving in this country. “Unfortunately, many motorists are terrified of them. “This is not helped by some of the cases we’ve gathered that have a fearsome reputation and seem to almost unnerve drivers before they even get to them. “With the volume of traffic and unavoidable problems such as breakdowns, driving in the UK is difficult enough without having to attempt some of these roundabouts from hell.” Also making the top ten is Sheriffhall, which sits on Edinburgh’s city bypass, and Haudagain in Aberdeen, which is due for a \u0026pound30m redesign later this year.

Ambassador Bowling Club president Anne Gibson said South Ayrshire Council’s new money spinner will stop some elderly members from getting out of the house. Ms Gibson said the Prestwick club is a social lifeline for older people including widowed folk. And during the cold, dark winter months it is somewhere safe to go to keep elderly people active. Finance bosses at the council want drivers to pay at Bellevue Road car park near the club and swimming pool. It is believed the move, which will roll out in other towns, will coin in \u0026pound120,000.  Anne said: “Our club is a social hub for elderly members. Eighty per cent of our members are aged over 73. They already pay because it is a private club. “We worry the car parking charge on top of that wil mean they can no longer afford it. There is a real threat the club may close or the parking charges will drive down membership numbers.” It is estimated the new fees will add \u0026pound3 to every game played. Anne continued: “South Ayrshire Council are supposed to encourage sport and leisure. This car park is used for the bowling club and the swimming pool. This should be a special case.” Describing individual member experiences, Anne said: “One of the men said he is recently widowed. He was depressed in the winter and said the bowling club was a Godsend to combat loneliness.  “His story is echoed by lots of people. Members have said if the club closed they don’t know what they would do. One lady had a fall and the doctor advised exercise like bowling, which is essential for health. They don’t like going out walking on their own. We offer a warm and friendly environment.” Coaching and rink space for blind bowlers is also provided. And young junior members are being coached to an international standard. She added: “Parking at a distance could prove hazardous for older members in icy or slippy conditions but that may be their only option if charges are introduced.” The club are collecting signatures for a petition.

South Ayrshire officials are to spend the summer soul searching in a bid to find a plan B for their Riverside project. And it could be the end of the year before the scheme is dragged back on track. It comes as new figures showed \u0026pound527,000 has already been blown – without a brick being laid. A “workstream to explore the options” was this week set to be approved, following rejection of a new \u0026pound11million office block. But a report on where to go next will not come before councillors until August at the earliest – after they return from their summer holiday.  Critics labelled the timetable “an insult” as the project threatens to plunge into crisis. Norman McLean, chair of Fort, Seafield and Wallacetown Community Council, said: “This is totally unacceptable. “What we need now is to fast track ideas and utilise the talents of those who can help. “Some ideas are simple and some are more complex, but we need urgent progress.” A “limited competition” open to a handful of “innovative design companies” is among the options favoured by Mr McLean. He added: “At this rate, we will be in December stuck in exactly the same position.” Conservative opposition leader, Councillor Martin Dowey, said: “We are sleepwalking our way into a disaster and nobody at the top seems willing to accept reality.  “Any suggestion that this can be kicked into the long grass is an insult. “It seems a case of crossing our fingers and hoping for a magic cure. “The sooner the council wakes up to what’s happening here, the better.” The Ayrshire Post contacted South Ayrshire Council last week for a statement on the \u0026pound527,000 spent thus far on the Riverside project. A council spokesman said: The expenditure is in line with expected costs for a project of this size and includes design team, project management and advisor fees, surveys and statutory consent.

Ayr’s historic Tam O’Shanter Inn will invest up to \u0026pound80,000 in the al fresco patio to the rear of its property. The boozer, run by David and Mareena Cowan, had gained council planning permission last month. But environmental health bosses this week said a “high chance of noise issues” was causing concern. “It would be remiss of us not to make an objection on these grounds,” they added. Pub boss David, addressing South Ayrshire’s licensing board, said: “We totally understand the concerns.  “But there will be no music played and this is purely and simply about serving teas, coffees and beer until the 10pm curfew.” David said the beer garden would, in the short term, be self-contained at the back of the Inn, which first opened in 1749. A longer term plan to gain access from the rear of the bar/restaurant would then be put in place. He added: “We see this as a good chance to generate extra employment for around five or six people. “The investment will run to between \u0026pound70,000 and \u0026pound80,000 – and not many people are investing in Ayr town centre at the moment.” David confirmed that six CCTV cameras would be installed to monitor the beer garden for security.  He said: “We envisage it being a safer environment than at present, as there can be quite a few issues there. “Perhaps this will encourage any undesirables to go elsewhere.” A limited range of draft beers, wines and spirits will be available at the bar, said David with all other alcohol served inside the traditional pub. Licensing board member, council leader Douglas Campbell, said: “It is welcome investment for the town centre and I’m sure it will be properly supervised.” The decision to approve the license was approved unanimously.

A shiny, newly constructed bus terminal would be half a mile across town to Burns Statue Square. And the historic train station would be prised apart from the Station Hotel and rebuilt as a modern standalone hub. The dramatic vision, which is only one of the options being considered, would also see a chunk of the hotel knocked down and the remainder converted to homes. The multi-million pound makeover of the town’s transport infrastructure depends on businesses such as Stagecoach and ScotRail buying into the idea. Parkhouse Street, which is home to a number of high-profile estate agents, would be pedestrianised in one option.  And the dual carriageway A70 leading from the Market Inn roundabout into the town could become single lane in either direction. Folk had the chance to see the ideas from Ayr Renaissance at a public exhibition in the Town Hall last week. Ayr Renaissance chair James Knox said: “We want to give everyone the chance to have their say on the masterplan for Burns Statue Square. “Nothing is written in stone. We have just begun the consultation process.” A council spokesman said: “We’re at the start of a process looking at options to regenerate Burns Statue Square and the Affleck’s block site, one of Ayr’s hidden gems behind the town hall. Some initial options were pulled together for the consultation last week, however we’re keen to hear more ideas from the public, so we’re looking at additional exhibitions in the near future.”  Depute council leader Brian McGinley said: “This is a good opportunity to get on and regenerate Ayr town centre, which is badly needed. There are multiple issues that need to be addressed and we need all stakeholders to put the interests of Ayr first and foremost. “These are ideas that we can work with and shape to make Ayr better. But these improvements will only happen if we all pull together.” Consultants Ironside Farrar have been working on designs. Concerns have been mounting over the future of Ayr’s railway presence as the state of the Station Hotel continues to deteriorate.  The hotel owners have been told to carry out essential maintenance by the council and were slapped with a dangerous building notice. There are still question marks over the future of the Odeon amid speculation it could move to another location in the town. Office building Burns House has been labelled as not fit for purpose and is due to be demolished. But the new replacement building plans for the bottom of the town have been knocked back – throwing the office relocation timescale off. The timeline and budget for the Burns Statue Square makeover has not been released. Stagecoach and Network Rail did not reply to Ayrshire Post requests for comment before our deadline.

The prolific striker turned down Premiership riches and clubs in England to agree a one-year contract at Somerset Park on Tuesday. Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness. The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision. It is a big, big signing which shows our intent and now we need the fans to respond with an upsurge in season ticket sales.

South Ayrshire Depute Provost William Grant and MP Bill Grant popped along to a showcase of Maybole’s Over Fifties group’s various activities and were pleased with the ongoing contribution to the community. Chairman of the club Peter Mason said: “I am very proud that we now have over 100 members. “In the two years since the group started many things have happened, many new friendships have been formed and many new skills learned. “These groups are going from strength to strength, and I would like to thank the group leaders for all the hard work they put into their groups week on week and also to the members who come along to support each group.” The group meet on a weekly, bi-weekly or monthly basis, mostly at The Speakers, 8-10 Whitehall, on Maybole High Street.  From health and fitness classes like yoga and keep fit, sewing and a Knit and Natter class and even the opportunity to learn a new language with Spanish and German classes – there’s lots to do and new skills to achieve. Chairman Peter hopes more clubs can be formed to cater for even more members. He added: “For the future I hope to see some more new groups starting especially for male members as I am conscious that we do not have a lot to offer to them. “If we can retain our successes for another year, we will go from strength to strength and I hope each and every one of you will join me on that journey.” ● For more information of what activities are on offer, visit the website at www.mayboleover50s.org or contact club secretary Anne Walker on 07846 180753.

Neighbours have slammed fast motorists in the Heathfield area and also in Whitletts Road. One resident claims an existing speed camera on Whitletts Road currently isn’t in operation and insist vehicles are zooming past her home at speeds of up to 50mph. She is calling for a speed camera further along the road to curb fast drivers. The concerned woman has called for the camera between Whitletts Road and Mainholm Road. Speaking at this month’s North Ayr Community Council, she said: “I am convinced the speed camera in Whitletts Road is not switched on. “I can hear cars at 6am or 7am travelling at more than 30mph coming into the town and the same going out.  “We need a speed camera.” Councillor Ian David said: “I am waiting for a response from the Partnership Panel as speeding in Whitletts Road was mentioned and it will be taken up with the police.” Speeding was also a hot topic discussed at last month’s Newton and Heathfield Community Council held in Newton Pavilion. Community councillors highlighted problems with speeding cars in Alderston Avenue and Northfield Avenue, and the problem of these streets being used by drivers as rat run to avoid the traffic lights in Prestwick Road. One woman said: “(There is) speeding in Alderston Avenue and there are a few children who stay in that street at the corner and the cars are turning right on to Northfield Avenue.” Police attending the meeting said they would do their best to monitor the situation. A council spokesman said Police Scotland/Safety Cameras Scotland administer speed cameras: “Safety cameras in Scotland are operated under the rules and guidelines of the Scottish Safety Camera Programme.”  A Police Scotland spokesman said: “The speed detection cameras are rotated around camera housing sites and have the ability to be used at any time. “You can find more information on the Scottish Safety Camera Programme and the location of camera sites by visiting www.safetycameras.gov.scot” In March, the Post reported that more than 13,000 speed offences have been captured on Ayrshire’s roads over the past three years Fast drivers were caught 13,103 times racing through the streets at breakneck speeds across the county from 2015 to 2017. And the highest clocked by a speed camera during that period was in 2016 at 140mph. Over last three years, a total of 715 speeding offences were detected in Ayr, 227 in Troon, 116 Prestwick, 32 in Maybole, 105 in Girvan and 88 in Cumnock.

Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12611218.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/PCP_SDR_SCOTRAIL018JPG.jpg","title":"troon beach revellers face travel","story":"NewsTroon beach revellers face travel chaos as ScotRail services to Glasgow Central hit by signalling faultScotRail has announced that a signalling fault is causing cancellations and delays to its services between Ayr and Glasgow.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson14:48, 28 MAY 2018Updated16:23, 28 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThousands of boozed-up teens face being stranded in Troon this afternoon after train services to Glasgow went down.
