With a turnout of 53 per cent which amounted to 1.2 million people, nearly 67 per cent voted Yes and over 33 per cent voted No.          Ireland held a referendum on the Eighth Amendment of the country’s constitution on May 25It read: ‘The state acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.’ This gave equal rights to the mother and the unborn, but did not ban abortion.However, in 1992 in what is referred to as Case X, a 14-year-old girl who fell pregnant after being raped claimed to be suicidal and therefore, a risk to her life and the unborn. She was stopped from travelling to Britain for an abortion and the case sparked debate across Ireland.Three separate referendums were held in November of the same year: the 12th Amendment attempted to remove suicide as grounds for abortion, but this was defeated.However, the 13th and 14th Amendments, which meant that women could travel abroad to have terminations and be given information about this, were both passed and added to the constitution.Another referendum was held in 2002, which tried to remove suicide as grounds for abortion, but it was ultimately rejected with over 50 per cent voting No.However, in 2010, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Ireland was violating the European Convention of Human Rights because the rules surrounding what is and isn’t a legal abortion were blurred.          A woman lays flowers next to a mural of Savita Halappanavar in Dublin, as Ireland votes In addition to this, the case of Savita Halappanavar also sparked debate around Ireland and the world watched as the Galway dentist died following complications from a septic miscarriage, after she was denied an abortion.In 2013, the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act was passed which clearly defined what a legal abortion meant. These three scenarios were risk of loss of life from physical illness, risk of loss of life from physical illness in emergency and risk of loss of life from suicide.What is Repeal the 8th?On May 25 2018, Ireland has the opportunity to repeal the country’s abortion law and the Eighth Amendment, to allow the government to legislate terminations.A Yes vote would mean that the text added to the constitution back in 1983 and 1992 would be changed to: ‘Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.’Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Sinn Fein and the Labour Party all support #Repealthe8th.

There might also be a dash of glamour from the younger generation, such as the Duke of Kent’s granddaughter, Lady Amelia WindsorBut what about the newlyweds, Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex, who are starting married life in modest Nottingham Cottage, just across from the Michaels’ apartment? Might they attend?And WHAT of Princess Eugenie and her wine merchant fiancé Jack Brooksbank, who have quietly moved into nearby Ivy Cottage, five months ahead of their wedding?What is clear is that the anniversaries, weddings, parties and comings and goings have shone an intriguing spotlight on the palace dubbed the poshest public housing project in Britain, which accommodates an extended family ranging in age from Prince Louis at just 33 days old to the Duke of Kent who is 83 in October.It is ironic that not long after Princess Michael was receiving the key to Diana’s secret garden, the very future of Kensington Palace was in doubt.The Princess’s death, and then that of Princess Margaret in 2002, led to courtiers drawing up a plan to convert the palace into a permanent home for the treasures and artworks of the Royal Collection.The only stumbling block was that it was still a home for those hard-working but minor members of the Royal Family, and where would they go? One possibility was that they could retire to their country homes.The Queen, however, did not welcome the idea of pensioning off loyal family members who do much of the less glamorous royal work without a murmur of complaint. And, besides, none has a country home to retire to any more.The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester gave up Barnwell Manor, in Northamptonshire, because the income from its farm was not enough to meet the upkeep and it was leased to an international antiques company.

Last month, Aatish Taseer, ex-boyfriend of the couple’s daughter, Lady Gabriella Windsor, penned a lurid article about their relationship in which he called Kensington Palace ‘wildly depressing’.He added: ‘All the famous inhabitants — Princess Margaret, Princess Diana — were dead, and those who remained, minor royals and palace secretaries, lived in their long, cold shadow. (In perpetual fear, I should add, of being turfed out.)’But instead of being closed down, the palace has flourished. The arrival of Prince William and Kate, who with their three children, now occupy Apartment 1a, the 22-room former home of Princess Margaret following a £4.5 million refurbishment — including two kitchens — mostly at taxpayers’ expense, changed everything.As Taseer wrote: ‘Will and Kate arrived to liven up the place.’ Harry followed, with Meghan moving in with him after their engagement.          In royal circles it is widely expected the couple will trade up and move into the Gloucesters’ 21-room pile Apartment 1, right next door to William and Kate. The two properties have adjoining front doorsHow long they will stay in Nottingham Cottage remains to be seen. A modest, two-bedroom dwelling, it was traditionally occupied by royal retainers — home to Princess Margaret’s long-time private secretary Lord Napier, and later Sir Miles Hunt-Davis, Prince Philip’s private secretary.‘Before Meghan arrived, it was like a student or soldier’s digs’, a friend of Prince Harry who visited him there says, simply furnished but with pictures on the walls from the Royal Collection.The young Duchess has changed all that with throws, scatter cushions and scented candles.In royal circles it is widely expected the couple will trade up and move into the Gloucesters’ 21-room pile Apartment 1, right next door to William and Kate. The two properties have adjoining front doors.The Gloucesters, said to have made the offer themselves, might in exchange receive the home lived in by Lord (Christopher) Geidt, the Queen’s former private secretary. The father of two, who quit last October, was permitted to remain in his apartment until the end of the school year.          If Harry and Meghan move next door to William and Kate, it will certainly be exciting and inevitably bring back memories of the years when they were boys living with their mother in apartments 8 and 9If Harry and Meghan move next door to William and Kate, it will certainly be exciting and inevitably bring back memories of the years when they were boys living with their mother in apartments 8 and 9.It is also likely to become the focus of a new royal social salon. A glamorous crowd will be making its way to Kensington Palace.Even so, neither Harry nor William are likely to make it on to Princess Michael’s party guest list.One friend of the Princess says: ‘I asked her how much she saw of Harry and she said she never saw him. That’s the thing about KP, they are cheek by jowl but their lives are separate.‘This explains why the children of the Gloucesters, the Kents and the Michaels, were not invited to Harry and Meghan’s wedding. Even though they all grew up together in the same place, they had totally unconnected lives, different schools, different friends.’There is also the matter of the great stray cats controversy. After two of her treasured pedigree Burmese were injured, Princess Michael called in a pest control firm to trap the strays routinely found in the palace grounds.In one of the traps Diana placed a battery-operated toy cat which miaowed just like the real thing. William and Harry, meanwhile, were taught to shout ‘cat killers!’ at the pest control workmen.The cats weren’t killed, but found homes through the RSPCA. But cats had been a point of conflict between the two women for years.Diana liked to sleep with an open window in summer and Princess Michael’s cats would sometimes climb in and disturb her.On one occasion when Diana phoned to complain, Princess Michael is said to have told an aide: ‘Tell her my cats were here before she was.’In public, the two women were superficially friendly but in private Princess Michael would complain about ‘the stupid girl next door’. For her part, in view of her family’s Nazi past, Diana referred to her as the ‘U-boat commander’.It is also unlikely that Princess Eugenie will be on the party guest list. Princess Michael is no fan of her mother, the Duchess of York.Eugenie, 28, who is an associate director at art gallery Hauser \u0026amp Wirth, and her future husband are privately renting three-bedroom Ivy Cottage, next door to the Duke and Duchess of Kent.A comparable three-bedroom mews house near Hyde Park would cost £3,500 a week. Officials would not say how much the couple have been asked to pay, but it is thought the rent is being met by her father, Prince Andrew.Eugenie had previously been living in a taxpayer-funded four-bedroom apartment in St James’s Palace with her sister Princess Beatrice, 29.Brooksbank, 31, and Eugenie will marry at Windsor Castle in October. The couple have been together for eight years after being introduced by friends in the Swiss ski resort of Verbier, where her parents have a £13 million property.Ivy Cottage was formerly the family home of the deputy director of the palace’s property section. It has been earmarked for Eugenie — though her plans to move in were marred by an alleged row over who should pay the thousands needed to repair a damp problem. It remains unknown whether public money was spent refurbishing the cottage.A source close to Eugenie says she is thrilled to be living next door to Harry and Meghan. ‘Harry and Eugenie are great mates,’ the insider says. ‘She was one of the first of the royals to meet Meghan.’For all the HRHs, the palace residents also include courtiers (who have around 16 per cent of their salary deducted for the privilege) domestic staff and senior military figures. Even members of the public pay the market rent for accommodation, including a cosmetics boss and a City high-flyer. In return, they get armed police security, their own telephone switchboard and a team of craftsmen and gardeners.Among residents are the Queen’s page Barry Mitford, Buckingham Palace foreman and furniture conservator Richard Thompson and senior surveyor Louis Randall. They are all said to get on with their lords and masters.But when your home depends on job security, it can be unsettling.For example, when the late Sir John Riddell was removed as Charles’s private secretary he complained not about his sacking but that his wife had just spent a large sum on made-to-measure curtains they could never use.For the older royals, the new arrivals will mean little change to the rhythms of life at Kensington Palace. But for Princess Michael, it might just be her last summer as the party queen. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/16/4C9F5FA300000578-0-image-m-68_1527260898804.jpg","title":"Actress Maureen Lipman faints stage West End performance","story":"    Actress Maureen Lipman has fainted on stage during a West End performanceJames Norton dons spectacles and a retro woollen suit as he...Share this articleAn employee at the theatre said: \u0027She did faint, but everything seems to be fine, she did not go to hospital or anything, she just went home for the evening.\u0027Quizzed on how Lipman was, they said: \u0027I did not see anything wrong, she was alert and talked normally - I don\u0027t know why she fainted but as far as I could tell she seemed fine.\u0027It is understood the show stopped for around 10 minutes after she became unwell, restarting with someone else playing her character. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/26/16/4CA5493E00000578-5774789-image-m-31_1527348431493.jpg","title":"Back reality Meghan Markles mother Doria takes dog walk L A","story":"    Doria Ragland was pictured on Friday in Los Angeles as she took her dog for a walk       EXCLUSIVE: Coldstream Guard \u0027raped young mother\u0027 in a park...Prince Charles steps out in a trendy pair of shades as he...Share this articleMs Ragland was also the only one of the actress\u0027s relatives who was seen at the wedding last week. She accompanied her in a car to the chapel at Windsor Castle then watched on, blinking away tears, as Meghan and Harry said their vows.    Ms Ragland returned to California this week after accompanying her daughter throughout the weekend in Windsor           Ms Ragland is one of the few members of the Duchess of Sussex\u0027s family who has not embarrassed her since she became engaged to Prince Harry  Afterwards, in a touching gesture of hospitality after their children tied the knot, Prince Charles accompanied her out of the church and then took her arm on the steps of the chapel to pose for photographs with his own wife, The Duchess of Cornwall. Ms Ragland\u0027s dignified silence about the royal romance is in stark contrast to the headline-grabbing insults thrown around by Meghan\u0027s half-siblings. It also coincides with her father\u0027s staging of paparazzi photographs in Mexico. After the wedding last Saturday, Ms Ragland joined her daughter and hundreds of other guests at a lunch in Windsor Castle.

So, we\u0027ll see what happens.A White House team will leave as scheduled for Singapore this weekend to prepare for the possible summit, a White House spokeswoman said on Saturday.Moon, who returned to Seoul on Thursday morning after meeting Trump in Washington in an effort to keep the U.S.-North Korea summit on track, said he delivered a message of Trump\u0027s firm resolve to end the hostile relationship with North Korea and pursue bilateral economic cooperation.Trump said in a letter to Kim on Thursday he was cancelling the planned Singapore summit, citing North Korea\u0027s open hostility.The Trump administration has demanded that North Korea completely and irreversibly shut its nuclear weapons program. Kim and Trump\u0027s initial decision to meet followed months of war threats and insults between the leaders over the program.American officials are skeptical that Kim will ever fully abandon his nuclear arsenal, and Moon said North Korea is not yet convinced it can trust security guarantees from the United States.(Reporting by Hyonhee Shin in Seoul and Doina Chiacu in Washington Additional

on Hawaii\u0027s Big Island on Saturday           Hundreds of earthquakes shook the island in just 24 hours on Saturday The extent of the destruction can be seen from space, with incredible satellite imagery showing glowing streams of lava flow from the volcano into residential areas nearby.One image, taken during the daytime by the European Space Agency\u0027s Earth Observation satellite, shows the bright orange and red lines streaming from Kilauea towards the ocean.A similar picture taken at night by NASA shows the streams as purple, still contrasting brightly against the otherwise calm backdrop.In comparison with all of Hawaii\u0027s Big Island, the lava streams appear small, but they\u0027re creating devastating scenes for people who call the volcano and its surrounds home. Roads have been cut off, an estimated 2,000 residents have been evacuated by road and by air, and as the lava continues to spill, some of it hitting the ocean, the air is becoming more toxic to breathe. As the area heads into the fourth week of eruptions,another 2,000 people living in coastal communities may be forced to flee as lava flows threaten to cut off their escape routes.

Fissures 21 and 7, burst open with fresh lava again yesterday putting the plant in the line of danger.Officials have already shut down the power plant and moved 50,000 gallons of flammable chemical pentane, as well as deactivating wells that tap into steam and gas deep in the Earth\u0027s core.            Earlier this week rare blue flames were photographed coming out of cracks in the pavement created by the earthquakesKilauea\u0027s ongoing eruptions have been captured in hundreds of dramatic photographs, including some of rare blue flames coming out of cracks in the pavement earlier this week. The blue flames are created when underground methane gas, produced by the volcano, escapes through cracks created by volcanic quakes and ignites from burning lava and vegetation.US Geological Survey scientist Jim Kauahikaua said this is only the second time that he\u0027s seen the blue flames during an eruption.\u0027It\u0027s very dramatic. It\u0027s very eerie,\u0027 he told reporters. The volcano-related earthquakes have caused cracks to open up across the Big Island\u0027s southeastern region.In one case, a heartbroken family who evacuated during the early eruptions returned home to find their property perched dangerously on top of a massive 10-foot wide crack. Noah Friend, his fiance Shantel Pacarro and their two children Naiah, 12, and Nainoa, 11, found the huge crack, which runs 500-feet through the backyard and directly under the home, threatening to swallow the property whole on Monday.\u0027It\u0027s just heartbreaking.

It is not clear whether Abedi bought his materials directly from Amazon or through one of many third-party sellers on the site.But Government sources last night said they want the web giant to alert the security agencies when customers are ‘filling up their baskets’ with bomb-making materials.Abedi’s Amazon history and that of people close to him have formed part of an police and security service investigation lasting months.Female ex-police chief at heart of £870k sexist payout for...How thieves are stealing valuables as you go through airport...Share this articleOne line of inquiry is that he bought one item on the website as far back as January last year – five months before the attack – using the name of a family member.The explosive device has been described as being a relatively sophisticated construct made with nails, nuts and bolts. It was revealed last year that he used hydrogen peroxide to make the explosive TATP – dubbed the Mother of Satan for its instability – and the same as that used in the 77 attacks on London. The Parsons Green attacker, Ahmed Hassan, 18, also used Amazon to make the bomb he left on a crowded London Tube train in September.His trial earlier this year heard how he detonated a device made from TATP, after packing it with metal items bought from Aldi and Asda and had hydrogen peroxide delivered to a friend’s address to avoid suspicion.          Emergency services respond to the attack at the Manchester Arena last year after Abedi had bought chemicals online and detonated the device at an Ariana Grande concertAnother ingredient was bought from Amazon. TATP is typically used by terror groups because it can be made using commonly available chemicals. Along with hydrogen peroxide, which is used in hair dyes, it includes other chemicals which the Mail will not name.Three of the ingredients used to make up TATP were purchased by the Mail on Thursday within minutes without warnings or security checks that may have halted the transaction. Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, former head of Nato’s Rapid Reaction Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Battalion, said Amazon needed to step up security checks. He said: ‘For Abedi to be able to buy this stuff on Amazon seems crazy to me. There needs to be more regulation to stop this happening.‘Amazon should really have a role to play in making sure these items are not sold to people who could then fashion a bomb.’Admiral Lord West, a former security minister, said: ‘Surely there are some things where if someone wants to buy them it should flag up a warning. Amazon needs to look at this and monitor what is being bought on its site.’ Former security minister John Hayes said: ‘It is time these companies such as Amazon step up to the mark and put the national interest ahead of any commercial interest.‘They should be encouraged to do and if this doesn’t work they should be made to do so.’Last December David Anderson QC, the former independent reviewer of terror legislation, published a report on the four terrorist attacks in Britain between March to June 2017. He said there needed to be increased cooperation between MI5 and the police and the private sector ‘to improve the detectability and even the preventability of purchases of potential explosives precursors by would-be terrorists, as undertaken before the Manchester and Parson’s Green attacks’.          Abedi’s Amazon history and that of people close to him have formed part of an police and security service investigation lasting monthsAlthough he did not specifically mention Amazon, it is understood the Government is now working with the web giant to help stop attacks using items bought online. As well as using Amazon, Abedi downloaded material from other websites about the chemical compound used in the bomb.And he also watched a bomb-making tutorial on YouTube before the attack. The bomb-making video ‘cookbook’ showed a masked extremist in a kitchen explaining how to build explosives with easy to obtain ingredients.The products Abedi purchased were both legal and widely available. An Amazon spokesman: ‘We share suspicious transaction reports with the Home Office counter terrorism team, but we cannot comment on the specific security measures that we have in place.’Earlier this month it emerged Amazon was selling terrorist recruitment material and bomb-making manuals on its site, including books by Osama Bin Laden. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/26/10/4CA3A9A800000578-0-image-m-16_1527328695639.jpg","title":"Hippy squatters Boris Beckers abandoned Majorcan mansion","story":"    Former Wimbledon champion Boris Becker\u0027s Majorcan mansion has been taken oven by a naked hippie squatter after the tennis star abandoned it following his bankruptcy last yearHippie Berres, thought to be a 44-year-old former carpenter, has moved into the plush home  along with a with a number of helper friends and has wasted no time sharing videos of himself wandering through the palatial grounds and sunbathing.Filming himself walking through the now unkempt grounds, Berres says: \u0027It\u0027s like nobody loved this place.Fresh turf marks spot where poisoned Russian spy and his...My evil ex tortured and killed her au pair because of me:...Share this article\u0027How can it come to this, I ask, that something like this is a habitat for wasps, geckos and spiders.

So, we\u0027ll see what happens.A White House team will leave as scheduled for Singapore this weekend to prepare for the possible summit, a White House spokeswoman said on Saturday.Moon, who returned to Seoul on Thursday morning after meeting Trump in Washington in an effort to keep the U.S.-North Korea summit on track, said he delivered a message of Trump\u0027s firm resolve to end the hostile relationship with North Korea and pursue bilateral economic cooperation.Trump said in a letter to Kim on Thursday he was cancelling the planned Singapore summit, citing North Korea\u0027s open hostility.The Trump administration has demanded that North Korea completely and irreversibly shut its nuclear weapons program. Kim and Trump\u0027s initial decision to meet followed months of war threats and insults between the leaders over the program.American officials are skeptical that Kim will ever fully abandon his

on Hawaii\u0027s Big Island on Saturday           Hundreds of earthquakes shook the island in just 24 hours on Saturday The extent of the destruction can be seen from space, with incredible satellite

the bright orange and red lines streaming from Kilauea towards the ocean.A similar picture taken at night by NASA shows the streams as purple, still contrasting brightly against the otherwise calm backdrop.In comparison with all of Hawaii\u0027s Big Island, the lava streams appear small, but they\u0027re creating devastating scenes for people who call the volcano and its surrounds home. Roads have been cut off, an estimated 2,000 residents have been evacuated by road and by air, and as the lava continues to spill, some of it hitting the ocean, the air is becoming more toxic to breathe. As the area heads into the fourth week of eruptions,another 2,000 people living in coastal communities may be forced to flee as lava flows threaten to cut off their escape routes.

Fissures 21 and 7, burst open with fresh lava again yesterday putting the plant in the line of danger.Officials have already shut down the power plant and moved 50,000 gallons of flammable chemical pentane, as well as deactivating wells that tap into steam and gas deep in the Earth\u0027s core.            Earlier this week rare blue flames were photographed coming out of cracks in the pavement created by the earthquakesKilauea\u0027s ongoing eruptions have been captured in hundreds of dramatic photographs, including some of rare blue flames coming out of cracks in the pavement earlier this week. The blue flames are created when underground methane gas, produced by the volcano, escapes through cracks created by volcanic quakes and ignites from burning lava and vegetation.US Geological Survey scientist Jim Kauahikaua said this is only the second time that he\u0027s seen the blue flames during an eruption.\u0027It\u0027s very dramatic. It\u0027s very eerie,\u0027 he told reporters. The volcano-related earthquakes have caused cracks to open up across the Big Island\u0027s southeastern region.In one case, a heartbroken family who evacuated during the early eruptions returned home to find their property perched dangerously on top of a massive 10-foot wide crack. Noah Friend, his fiance Shantel Pacarro and their two children Naiah, 12, and Nainoa, 11, found the huge crack, which runs 500-feet through the backyard and directly under the home, threatening to swallow the property whole on Monday.\u0027It\u0027s just heartbreaking.

It is not clear whether Abedi bought his materials directly from Amazon or through one of many third-party sellers on the site.But Government sources last night said they want the web giant to alert the security agencies when customers are ‘filling up their baskets’ with bomb-making materials.Abedi’s Amazon history and that of people close to him have formed part of an police and security service investigation lasting months.Female ex-police chief at heart of £870k sexist payout for...How thieves are stealing valuables as you go through airport...Share this articleOne line of inquiry is that he bought one item on the website as far back as January last year – five months before the attack – using the name of a family member.The explosive device has been described as being a relatively sophisticated construct made with nails, nuts and bolts. It was revealed last year that he used hydrogen peroxide to make the explosive TATP – dubbed the Mother of Satan for its instability – and the same as that used in the 77 attacks on London. The Parsons Green attacker, Ahmed Hassan, 18, also used Amazon to make the bomb he left on a crowded London Tube train in September.His trial earlier this year heard how he detonated a device made from TATP, after packing it with metal items bought from Aldi and Asda and had hydrogen peroxide delivered to a friend’s address to avoid suspicion.          Emergency services respond to the attack at the Manchester Arena last year after Abedi had bought chemicals online and detonated the device at an Ariana Grande concertAnother ingredient was bought from Amazon. TATP is typically used by terror groups because it can be made using commonly available chemicals. Along with hydrogen peroxide, which is used in hair dyes, it includes other chemicals which the Mail will not name.Three of the ingredients used to make up TATP were purchased by the Mail on Thursday within minutes without warnings or security checks that may have halted the transaction. Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, former head of Nato’s Rapid Reaction Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Battalion, said Amazon needed to step up security checks. He said: ‘For Abedi to be able to buy this stuff on Amazon seems crazy to me. There needs to be more regulation to stop this happening.‘Amazon should really have a role to play in making sure these items are not sold to people who could then fashion a bomb.’Admiral Lord West, a former security minister, said: ‘Surely there are some things where if someone wants to buy them it should flag up a warning. Amazon needs to look at this and monitor what is being bought on its site.’ Former security minister John Hayes said: ‘It is time these companies such as Amazon step up to the mark and put the national interest ahead of any commercial interest.‘They should be encouraged to do and if this doesn’t work they should be made to do so.’Last December David Anderson QC, the former independent reviewer of terror legislation, published a report on the four terrorist attacks in Britain between March to June 2017. He said there needed to be increased cooperation between MI5 and the police and the private sector ‘to improve the detectability and even the preventability of purchases of potential explosives precursors by would-be terrorists, as undertaken before the Manchester and Parson’s Green attacks’.          Abedi’s Amazon history and that of people close to him have formed part of an police and security service investigation lasting monthsAlthough he did not specifically mention Amazon, it is understood the Government is now working with the web giant to help stop attacks using items bought online.

Berres says he plans to give the empty £13 million villa near the rural town of Arta in north-east Majorca a new lease of life - and claims to have already cut weeds and picked up rubbish around the property along with his hippie commune friends          The 50-year-old former Wimbledon champion is said to have earned in the region of £100million throughout his career, but was declared bankrupt in June last year over a £3.3million debt - forcing him to abandon the plush Spanish propertyMeanwhile Berres has told newspapers from his home country who visited him that he would leave if the police turned up to tell him to go, although as of today no complaint from the owner of the house is thought to have been received by Civil Guard officers.The retired tennis star purchased his Majorcan villa in 1995 and briefly put it on the market in 2007 for a figure reported to be close 15 million euros - or about £13m - before withdrawing it shortly afterwards.Locals in Arta said last year around the time he was declared bankrupt they hadn\u0027t seen three-times-married Becker for years.

She returned two years later to train her camera on the streets on which she had grown up. Murtha, who her daughter, Ella, recalls as “spiky haired, and in baseball boots”, took this photograph in 1980 on the council estate of Elswick in Newcastle, while she was on a job training scheme for the unemployed.No bomb had recently fallen on Kenilworth Road in Elswick, but it might as well have done. In just over a year of Margaret Thatcher’s government, a million manufacturing jobs had been lost the west end of Newcastle was among the places worst hit.

It will be auctioned on 4 July. In 1814 the theme of peace seemed appropriate as a gift to Canova’s friend John Campbell, aka Lord Cawdor, with Napoleon safely in exile and Europe hoping for tranquility after years of war. The dream was short-lived: in 1815 Napoleon escaped from Elba and launched an attempt to restore his empire.The white marble representation of peace as a beautiful young woman was one of Canova’s Ideal Heads, which were often made as gifts to his friends and patrons. Campbell was both – he introduced Canova to one of his most valuable customers, the sixth duke of Bedford, who commissioned the monumental Three Graces for his mansion at Woburn. In 1994 the Three Graces was acquired jointly by the V\u0026ampA in London and the National Galleries of Scotland after an epic fundraising campaign, aided by a £1m donation from John Paul Getty Jr to keep the sculpture from going to the museum in California founded with his father’s money.Peace had a tranquil life at the Cawdor family mansion, Stackpole Court in Pembrokeshire. Campbell died in 1821, and over the next century, as the house expanded to 150 rooms holding a vast collection, the Canova was forgotten. In a sale in 1962 before the decaying house was demolished after failed attempts to persuade the local authority or the National Trust to take it on, the head was just described as “a white marble bust of a lady wearing a diadem”.The present private owner has spent years researching it, including tracing original surviving correspondence between Canova and Campbell. “It is a very personal piece,” said Christopher Mason, an expert on the period at Sotheby’s. “This is Canova working for himself, without the constraints of having to satisfy the taste of a patron. This is his own vision of the essence of human beauty.”Mason said the sale was exceptionally rare – the last Canova on the market, a rediscovered bust of Joachim Murat, king of Naples from 1807 to 1815, sold last November for €4.3m (£3.8m). “The Bust of Peace has matchless provenance dating back all the way to its conception in 1814, and so we expect a great deal of excitement,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9cd689dc797d42f2f6af05a386896b24e691436/89_995_2160_1296/master/2160.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61714b1775cfe2111459f9598aae61ee","title":"my best summer photograph","story":"The inflatable turtle of Guantánamo, the bed-infested fields of China, the strung-out octopus of the Med … Martin Parr, Joni Sternbach and other top photographers pick their hottest shotby  Dale Berning Sawa,  Imogen Tilden,  Edward Siddons,  Saeed Kamali Dehghan and Tom GrahamKiddie Pool (Gitmo at home, Gitmo at play), 2015, by Debi Cornwall For my first project following a career as a civil rights lawyer, I decided to look at Guantánamo Bay. There are still 40 people detained there. More than 16 years on, many of us have stopped looking. I wanted to make us look again. It took me nine months to secure permission to photograph in the detention centres and across the naval base. Shortly after I arrived, on the first of three trips, my military escort said: “Gitmo is the best posting a soldier could have. There’s so much fun here.” It was such a striking statement. So I decided to juxtapose the so-called fun of the guards’ spaces with the facilities available to prisoners. When I saw this wide-eyed smirking turtle, I knew it was perfect: the water shot I’d been looking for, an inflatable toy in a wading pool. Until I saw it, I hadn’t realised that there are children growing up on the base, their parents being either in the military or civilians working there. What must it be like to grow up there? To use the leisure facilities of a place seen as a “war-on-terror” prison site, where men are held without charge or trial, largely beyond the reach of the US courts, for years at a time? There are two very different things happening at Guantánamo and this captured that perfectly.I understand why people say it’s a scary image. There’s that expression on the turtle’s face, in this run-down enclosure, and there’s the sliver of sky, the palm trees in the distance, the lush green – but you’re not out in that tropical paradise. You’re penned off from it. What gives the shot extra power is the fact that it’s the only face in my entire series. Military regulations forbid any photographs of faces. This forced me to be more creative, to find other ways to convey the denial of personhood of Guantánamo Bay. My shots capture all the places people use – but they’re empty. DBSSt Michael’s Mount, 2017, by Martin ParrMagnumI shot this at St Michael’s Mount, just near Penzance, last August. It was a hot day, though not blazing sunshine. St Michael’s Mount is a big honey pot, absolutely mobbed every single day, and part of the manifestation of that mobbing is this wonderful queue. The British, of course, are supreme masters of queuing. And I thought it was good to get summer, beach, queuing and the island in the background, all in one photo.I watched the queue for a good period. I love how it winds round, constantly shifting. It was actually very difficult to capture it without lots of other people getting in the way. Here, I managed to get just a few scattered people “off queue”, with the rest compliantly queueing up to get the boat over to the island.I never actually got there myself, because I was too fascinated by people trying to get there. Despite global austerity, tourism is growing at a phenomenal rate. We all know the stories about places like Venice and Barcelona being almost out of control. DBSAncient tree (After Night series), 2010, by Lisa RossThe first time I ever saw a bed just sitting out in the landscape was while I was travelling through Xinjiang, an autonomous region in the far northwest of China, in a taxi. I screamed at the driver to stop so I could take a photo. I was transfixed. It was only when I returned a few days later that I realised they were everywhere. I just hadn’t noticed.Xinjiang gets extremely hot in summer so everyone sleeps outside. There are beds all over the fields, on rooftops and in front of houses. In towns, there are whole streets have beds out front. Each bed becomes a hub for the family. They eat around them and kids play on them with their friends.The bedding is rolled up during the day to keep the sand out, but when you see it unfurled it’s extraordinary. Bedding is a big wedding gift in the region, so it’s often made from the most colourful fabrics available. People couldn’t understand why I was so interested. When I asked if I could photograph their beds, they laughed. It’s just such an ordinary thing to do there.It’s the total opposite of how we treat the bed in the west. For us, the bedroom is a private space, intimate and enclosed. It’s usually the last room you’d show a guest. Here, though, it becomes a part of public life. People talk and play and see each other around their beds.This local custom has lasted longer than anyone can remember, but I don’t know if it will survive. Xinjiang is home to Uighurs, a Muslim minority who are under increasing surveillance from the Chinese government. When I first started working here, I encountered relatively few difficulties. But today, nobody knows what might be considered unacceptable. That’s why I try to keep people’s faces out of the pictures. It might cause them problems further down the line.I showed these photos to a Tibetan friend and he was amazed. He felt like it was the last uncontrolled area of China. There will probably come a time when this custom is banned. In a really important way, the beds are an expression of their autonomy, and it’s the heat of summer that brings everyone out into the open. ESI love the way New York used to look, but the city has become so corporate and homogenised. Coney Island, though, still has a cool edge. You find everyone there: tourists, locals, immigrants from Mexico, Africa, Russia. Everyone loves the magic of being on the beach in New York City! For my series Island, which I shot over the summer of 2016, I avoided any kind of landmark, though. I didn’t even include the Island’s famous Wonder Wheel. I just wanted to concentrate on the people. I saw this guy playing with his son, chasing him, throwing him in the air – and the boy, who was two or three, was loving it. The interaction between them was special. The boy’s mum was there too – it was a family day out.I asked if I could shoot them and suggested this position. Having seen they way they were together, I knew they’d be comfortable with it. The kid was laughing and giggling the whole time. It made me think about childhood, how early experiences and memories imprint themselves on us for life. I only took a few shots. It was the end of the day, when the light is soft and the blues and the yellows are strong.The father had had a tough life. That tattoo was one of several. I loved this image but he took a while to come round to it. I had to persuade him to let me publish and exhibit it because he was protective of his son. There was a really strong reaction to it. African Americans particularly like this positive image of a black father – something that we don’t see enough of. I love how the father’s face looks a certain way, but the overall image shows him as a gentle and loving father.I always talk to the people I photograph. I want to connect with them. In my work, I try to show that compassion and inclusivity are what’s important. ITThe Roof of Tehran, 2016, by Tahmineh MonzaviI took this at Bam-e-Tehran, which means “the roof of Tehran”. It is in the foothills of the Alborz mountains, close to the cable cars that take you up to Tochal ski resort. It’s essentially a plateau, enclosed by a wall made of bluish-green stone. It’s just 50cm high on the inside, but on the other side is a sheer drop. You can walk up there, along a pedestrianised road that leads to shops and restaurants. Young people gather there all year round, to sit on the wall and look out over the city. You can see all of Tehran from up there. I live close by, but had never paid it much attention until this one evening in 2016. I was working on images of Tehran for Elle magazine. It was about 7pm and the sun was setting. It wasn’t rainy but it was overcast. Tehran has four seasons and spring is the best. The weather is great and the city is magnificent. If you’re not from Iran, you might mistake this for somewhere in Egypt or Beirut. But people who live in Tehran would easily recognise the architecture, the tall and short buildings.In my work, I focus a lot on Iranians, women in particular. I try to document their lives. Gathered on the wall, I could see people of all social backgrounds: those from the lower-class neighbourhoods of south Tehran more middle-class people from the centre affluent ones from the north. Despite the chaos and the pollution, Tehranis have a huge passion for their city – and they all come together at Bam-e-Tehran. SKDFourth of July, High School Students, New Orleans, 2017, by An-my LêI moved to the US as a child and have always been struck by Independence Day: the barbecues, the lawn chairs, the flags, the parades, the people out in the street. In 2017 I was in the south, photographing confederate monuments that had recently been taken down. With Fourth of July celebrations in full swing, I thought I would find some interesting parades.We had started in Memphis, then drove further south but couldn’t find any good parades in Mississippi. So we headed to New Orleans. A lot of people had gathered in St John, a bayou within the city, to boat down the waterway or picnic on its banks. Walking around at the end of the day, as the sun was setting, I came across these incredible young women.What I noticed first was the redhead’s hair, that extraordinary colour, and then the African American girl sitting next to her, so regal. I thought of Manet’s Déjeuner sur l’herbe – this was an interesting alternate version. The image feels staged and deliberate, partly because I used a large-format camera. The longer exposure means I had to ask them to hold still. But there is also something about the way they were presenting themselves. I didn’t direct them much. The redhead was just standing that way.While I made this photograph before the shootings, it is a sort of a response to what happened at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, this year. At first glance, these three girls couldn’t seem more different, yet they are together, in that Fourth of July chaos. I wanted to capture the intimacy I sensed between them. DBSUntitled 3 (Estudio elemental del levante), 2017, by Ricardo CasesI shot this outside a restaurant in Dénia, on the Mediterranean coast of Spain. I was struck by the composition: the tentacles hanging down, the line of the sea going across. The locals hang octopus in the sun to dry, before serving it with a little olive oil and lemon. It’s a simple, traditional dish, not unique to the region, but ancient.On the Costa Blanca, beyond the paella and the parasols, there are so many symbols, things that carry the spirit of the place. This drying octopus is one, but so are the oranges, the palm trees, the village brass bands. And together, they form the basis of a series I’ve made about degradation in the area.On the beaches and coves of Costa Blanca not long ago, there were fishing villages, steeped in tradition. Now the old way of life has been engulfed by resorts. And with those resorts have come real problems. You can see scorched and withered palm trees everywhere. Many were imported from Egypt to decorate tourist developments during the real estate boom. But they carried the red palm weevil, the larvae of which have since devoured thousands of trees. They were eaten from within.This image of the octopus is another note in a requiem for a way of life that had its moment of delirious crazy glory, but is now sickly and decaying. It marks the end of a stage in Spain’s recent history, a moment lived with intensity and ingenuity, but one that couldn’t last. TGRicardo Cases’s solo show, Estudio elemental del levante, is at Espace JB, Geneva, until 22 June.Timeout II: LAX, USA, 2016, by Marcus LyonThis is a montage of over 1,000 images brought together in my studio. I shot them by hanging out of a chopper 1,000 metres above Los Angeles international airport early one summer morning. The work is part of a series that explores the five big preoccupations people have once safety, shelter and sustenance have taken a secondary role. These are sport, mass entertainment, cars, food consumption and mass air travel.I tried to visualise it first, sketching an airport with gates and runways that looked like a living organism with a spine and ribs. I then spent hours searching for the best airport and a pilot happy to seek permission from the control tower – and take the doors off his helicopter. One of the advantages of shooting over airports is that the air space above them is just about the most uncrowded on the planet – because all the planes are on the ground.We were in the air shooting for about two hours. I knew exactly what shots I needed. Seen from up high, the world dissolves into minutiae, patterns and rhythms. I have spent a lot of my time hanging out of helicopters so I’m much too focused on what I’m doing to stop and think about it enough to be terrified.Back in my studio, I worked for three months creating the final image, one car, one airplane at a time. It was a painstaking process. And there’s a little image of me in there – I put myself in every shot I create. It feels honest, plus it means that kids love to engage with the work. Hopefully, it will help them ask the right questions about their roles in our increasingly globalised world. ITSurfers in a barrel, 2017, by Joni SternbachWhen a big wave hits shallow water, its tip can curve right over and form a tunnel through the water. In the surfing world, this is known as a barrel. So when I saw this huge wooden structure, I thought putting a few surfers in it was probably the best pun I’d ever come up with. We were all beside ourselves laughing.At first, I had no idea how the barrel got there. The shot was taken right next to a parking lot on the California coast and there was junk strewn everywhere. Someone told me after the shoot that it was a prop in the film Sideways. I don’t know if that’s true – but it’s what I like to tell people.I’ve been shooting surfers on the California coast for over a decade now. I’m fascinated by the human connection to water. The ocean is one of the few places that doesn’t have boundaries these days. Even the ranchers who live on the surrounding hills have been enclosed and hemmed in. The sea is still free.But I can’t shoot surfers in action. I work with tintypes, a process that creates an image directly on to a thin tin plate using lacquers and emulsion that react to the light. The plate needs a long exposure, so I can’t catch people riding the waves.Using such an old process gives my shots their timeless quality, an air of nostalgia. But it also forces you to work in a really communal way. I have to set up a darkroom. People have to stay in position for a little while – and I develop the photos in front of them. They see the result there and then, telling me what they think. It can be quite nerve-racking, but it’s much more participatory.Only two of the people in this photograph knew each other. But the surf – and posing for this image – brought them together. I think that’s what summer by the sea means to me: people coming together and new communities forming, even if only for a day. ESJoni Sternbach’s solo show, Ocean Side, is at Galerie Catherine et André Hug, Paris, until 9 June.Ice lolly in the Tenderloin, 2015, by Pieter HugoI was living in San Francisco in the summer of 2015 when one day my wife called as she was dropping our daughter off at school. She told me I had to go downtown and take a look at the Tenderloin district. It’s an island of anarchy in the midst of the city’s tech boom. Most of the buildings are owned by non-profits who have no interest in selling their space to the tech giants.It’s a crazy place: if you wander through its streets, you’ll see people openly shooting up in the middle of the day. Having spent most of my life in Cape Town, South Africa, I’m used to homelessness. But what I saw in the Tenderloin was something else.In many ways, its residents are testament to the failings of American society, whether that’s people suffering under a failed healthcare policy or veterans traumatised by wars overseas. It can be pretty rough – especially at night – but there’s an extremely strong sense of community. This was the very first shot I took. When I asked if I could take her portrait, the woman immediately struck this pose, as if she was modelling. I met her a lot over the course of the summer. Every time, it was like a fashion shoot. She would ask for cash and I would usually give it to her, but we never really talked about her life story. What I love about the photograph is its oomph. She owns it.

It has slashed staff numbers, which leads to poor standards and service”.The company has recently been criticised for accidentally pricing toothpaste at £7.99 in one of its hospital outlets and been accused of feeding Britain’s obesity problems by offering bargain chocolate at the till. It also had to change its policy to provide VAT refunds for shoppers travelling outside the EU from British airports after criticism for failing to pass on savings.Bryan Roberts, the insights director for TCC Global, said WH Smith’s tactic of incentivising staff to sell shoppers extra chocolate bars, take coupons for McDonald’s or encourage them to use automated tills is not shopper-friendly.“If you are an investor then WH Smith is one of the best retailers in the country its share price performance and profitability are a huge success,” he said. “But a lot of its practices don’t sit well with customer service.”A WH Smith spokesperson said: “Only 184 people commented on WH Smith as part of this survey. We serve 12 million customers each week and despite a challenging retail environment we continue to open new shops, and to maintain our presence on the UK high street.” In recent years the company has spent millions of pounds on refurbishing its stores, including about half the high street estate. Even WHS_Carpet has acknowledged that it is getting harder to find examples of grimy or damaged flooring, although they say more staff are needed to help care for stores and customers.“There’s still a lot of affection for the brand – it just needs to live up to it,” they added.This year, the organic beauty specialist Lush, the cut-price health and beauty chain Savers and the toy chain Smyths shared equal billing as the nation’s best retailer. They knocked last year’s top two, Toolstation and Richer Sounds, down to fourth and sixth place respectively.John Lewis, which finished joint third in 2017, falls to 10th place – its worst ranking since the annual survey launched in 2010. Ben Clissitt, the Which? magazine editor, said: “It is clear that our traditional high street is changing and while this is bad news for some retailers who have struggled to adapt, others have seized the opportunity to make their mark.“Our findings show that if retailers can strike the right balance between good value, quality products and first-class customer service, shoppers will keep coming back to their stores.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2880d797812961558179ecaac989de2ccd2d4de/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=804e24c061ce627c8940686b2cdba45b","title":"stapler guardian redesign tabloid pages","story":"Like the pages of a tabloid-sized newspaper, the issues that readers raise about the smaller  keep coming loose. This week more readers made contact, responding to my three recent columns that summarised your feedback since January.A prominent theme throughout has been difficulties in keeping the pages together. The paper has “migratory tendencies”, said one reader, which it seems had not been experienced with broadsheet- and Berliner-sized s of the past. However, the problem had been noticed when occasionally reading a different paper also tabloid-sized.’s production experts tell me that only one section can be stapled, and G2 is it. Journal can be pulled out whole from the middle of the paper.Readers said they appreciate having sport as a separate section on Saturdays. One couple told me that their sport is watching the reactions of the small boys in the street and the delivery-van drivers at the traffic lights when the couple randomly hand them the sports\u0026nbspsection from the Saturday  soon after the couple emerge from the shop where they purchase\u0026nbspit.Deadlines and production processes prevent the whole paper from being stapled, and in any event that would prevent the disassembly that aids simultaneous reading in households in the mornings.John Hall, of Saltash, Cornwall, provided a potential answer for those who do like a stapled product. He wrote: “I was one such reader who found great difficulty in reading the main section because the pages kept slipping about.“I don’t understand the physics that lead to this problem as opposed to reading the old size of paper. However I could understand the riposte about production times and, maybe, costs.“Exasperated by the problem that interfered with my enjoyment of the paper I looked for a solution. I\u0026nbspfound it for the cost of a few pounds at Messrs Staples where I purchased a ‘long-arm stapler’. With this useful\u0026nbsptool I can slide the paper, open at the centrefold, into the stapler so that a staple or two can be inserted\u0026nbspinto the centre of the paper in no more than a few seconds.“The reading experience is transformed! I do not use the word lightly. From a tussle with recalcitrant pages I have an easy-to-handle newspaper such as the New Review section in the Observer, which is a model of production.“You might care to make this solution known. I write as a reader for well over 60 years and laud the  as the finest newspaper in the land.”In chatting by phone with Mr Hall, I learned that the long-arm stapler is about 38 cm (15in) and “quite\u0026nbsptransformative”.• Paul Chadwick is the ’s readers’ editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b09d3b2708b66aed2f813ccff6df8e4af53884f/0_204_2265_1359/master/2265.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b8360d699918d8fd9c5c2108e0f0d1f","title":"the guardian view on the irish referendum now for the north","story":"The implications of the Irish referendum vote will be felt around the world. The most immediate effect must be in Northern Ireland: five Conservative women who have all been ministers for women and equality are urging Theresa May to override the DUP and significantly relax abortion laws there. They are right to do so, although she is resisting. The province’s absurdly strict law means rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormalities are not seen as valid reasons for termination. However, Ireland will now be looking to make an abortion law that reflects the 21st century – and so should the United Kingdom as a whole.Labour MP Stella Creasy has proposed amendments to a forthcoming domestic violence bill which would provide a mechanism to do so. Abortion in the UK is framed by a 1967 statute which did not decriminalise termination but introduced a narrow exemption from the criminal law. Deeper reforms are needed and these must be extended across the UK. At the very least, women in England and Wales, like those in Scotland, ought to be allowed to take the abortion pill in their own homes. It is a fraught debate but on a free vote this will surely be carried. The\u0026nbsphome secretary, Sajid Javid, must provide MPs with\u0026nbspa bill that would allow Ms Creasy’s amendments to\u0026nbsprelax abortion laws across the UK.Friday’s vote was a ringing victory for humanity, for honesty, and for women’s rights but what matters just as much is that it followed years of profound and thoughtful debate which led to voters reflecting and then\u0026nbspchanging their minds. That is the way that democracies are meant to deliberate. Politicians spoke clearly some of them were brave enough to change their minds in public, but polling suggests that when it comes to questions of personal morality, people in both the UK and Ireland may pay less attention to politicians than to their own judgment and conscience. What changed minds, it seems, was often the long years of experience of what the absolute ban on abortion had meant in women’s lives. The personal\u0026nbspreally did become political reality.A woman’s right to choose is not just a right over her own body. It is also, and at least as important, a woman’s right to choose what to believe and what to put her faith in. The right to choose what you believe is of course fundamental in any democracy. It is also what lies behind the collapse in the authority of the Catholic church in Ireland, which had dictated or attempted to dictate the relations between the sexes ever since the foundations of the state. Successive referendums on orce, on equal marriage, and now on abortion, have shown how public opinion, and indeed the public sense of what is just and right, have shifted away from Catholic teaching. The power that the church had once exerted through its links with the state came to corrupt and then to destroy its moral authority when the abuses of that power came to light in the treatment of abused children and\u0026nbspunmarried mothers.The result should give heart to all those women (and men) in the US who resist the sometimes murderous campaign of the religious right against safe and legal abortion. It should be a beacon of hope to the women of Poland, where an authoritarian Catholic government which draws its strength from the countryside forces tens of thousands of women to travel abroad for abortions every year. But in Ireland, there was a majority for repeal in all but one rural constituency. The ultimate, profoundly liberating lesson of this vote is that when women, and men, have the right to choose, they will vote as their conscience tells them, not as authority directs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f453131725440655be16253eaf87cd0009540b5b/446_359_2854_1713/master/2854.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2b5b5765ee9f70456fe559078ce723b","title":"laura linney interview my name is lucy barton london stage debut","story":"id-morning in Brooklyn, New York and grey clouds are scudding across the sky above St Ann’s Warehouse – a state-of-the-art performance and rehearsal space that was once a tobacco warehouse. Inside, a fabulous model of an angel is suspended from the ceiling, and beyond its windows the East River is getting on with its day. Laura Linney is said to be running late and when she arrives she walks in briskly without any a-esque hauteur. She is all apologies, smiles, grace. She sits down on a circular leather banquette in the foyer and tucks her knees beneath her. She is casually dressed but with a black-and-white scarf for extra flourish. She looks comfortable in her own skin. At 54, there is a much younger woman visible in her face and not because of cosmetic interference but because she is spirit itself –you see that at once.She is in New York, but the next opportunity to catch Linney will be in London, at the Bridge theatre. She is about to star in an adaptation of the American novelist Elizabeth Strout’s My Name Is Lucy Barton, long-listed for the Booker in 2016, adapted by Rona Munro and directed by Richard Eyre. It is a first-person narrative of Quakerish composure, slightly reminiscent of Marilynne Robinson’s work, about a woman who is a born writer, who carries the burden of the unspeakable: her childhood. It is about writing and what cannot be written. It centres, movingly, on an encounter over Lucy Barton’s New York hospital bed (she is recovering from an operation) with her mother – this offers a chance to revisit her childhood and, possibly, to redeem it. The play is not, as you might predict, a two-hander, but more dauntingly, a monologue, a 37-page marathon – Linney will be carrying more than the burden of her character’s childhood, she will be carrying the show.Sometimes, in life, things are meant to be: Laura Linney and Lucy Barton seem to have been intended for one another. This was, however, far from clear at the outset: “I received a call from my agent, who said Elizabeth Strout wanted to meet with me about the possibility of playing Lucy Barton. We met in a cafe on the Upper East Side. We had a wonderful lunch but there were these weird, awkward pauses during which we were staring at each other across the table.”At one point, Strout broached it: “So you want to play Lucy Barton?” Linney responded: “I’d love to.” But no further discussion developed. Linney discovered only later that there had been “some confusion” – each woman had expected the other to be doing the pitching. “I fell in love with Liz at that lunch, she was amazing. But I thought: oh well, this was not meant to be.”It was months after that first meeting with Strout, while Linney was in Atlanta shooting Ozark (the Netflix crime series in which she plays the unfaithful wife of Jason Bateman’s drug money launderer), that she got a call from Nicholas Hytner, director (and co-founder of London’s Bridge theatre), saying he had optioned the novel and wanted her to do it.“I asked: ‘Have you spoken to Liz?’ He said: ‘No.’ I said: ‘You’re kidding me.’” She could not believe that Lucy Barton had come back to claim her from a new direction. The show would be with Eyre directing, whom she “adores”, and Bob Crowley designing (ditto) and an overseeing Nicholas Hytner, whom she reveres, and in this “brand new theatre”. She cocks her head to one side, bird-like, and smiles.You can understand why more than one person thought her ideal casting for Lucy Barton. Receptive, damaged, contemplative, the character is perfectly suited to Linney’s talent for nuance – for splintered emotion. It was the television series of Armistead Maupin’s Tales of the City that made her name in 1993 – Linney was the ingenue that 1970s San Francisco took under its seductive wing. In 2003, she excelled as the amorously diffident Sarah in Love Actually, and her role as Abigail Adams, wife of the second US president, in the HBO mini-series John Adams (2008) won her an Emmy. Yet in most – if not quite all – of her films, Laura Linney is caught up in dysfunctional families.In You Can Count on Me (2000) – for which she was nominated for an Oscar – she played sister to a delinquent brother. Her expressive face is brilliant at conveying ambivalence, with her piercingly warm smile an unexpectedly powerful accessory. By 2005, in The Squid and the Whale, she was a wan, tormented neurotic. And in Savages (2007) she evolved – or devolved – still further (“That character was a hot mess,” says Linney). A pathological liar, she kept her brother (Philip\u0026nbspSeymour\u0026nbspHoffman) company visiting their demented father – two siblings at sea.At one point in Strout’s novel, Lucy Barton considers life in contrast to fiction: “When you write a novel, you get to rewrite it, but when you live with someone for 20 years that is the novel.” To what extent does Linney see her own life as a story? “It depends on the age you are when you look back – your perspective changes.” Her eyes shine: “I guess we can all tell our lives as stories – but it is whether or not you want to.” She laughs – a peel of a laugh. And do you? “No!” she exclaims. Life, she suggests, is not docile enough to coax into a shape: “Life is mysterious and unpredictable and exhilarating and\u0026nbsppainful.”Would she agree that what Strout is suggesting is that it is impossible ever to know anyone? “Yes – the novel asks questions I’ve been asking myself filming Ozark recently, particularly given the political climate of my country right now. Who am I? Who are you? Who are we? What do I believe in? What – who – do I love? And why? How do I choose to spend my time? What helps me evolve? What do I need?” Hearing her restlessly interview herself in this manner, one thing is obvious: Linney will never be accused of complacency.What’s more, in a recent interview in W magazine, she says that what she particularly loves about Ozark is how, within the family, none of them know each other – or themselves. How well does she know herself? “I know parts of myself. The joy about getting older is that you learn a bit about yourself. But I believe that being too knowing can be a problem. If you’re too knowing, you limit yourself from the get-go. There is a Chinese expression: I only know enough.” She maintains there are “people who have known me for a long time who know my behaviour better than I do, who have watched me change and stay the same. For there is a core in all of us that does not change – not at all.” Linney speaks with pinpoint precision – as if in italics.She sees My Name Is Lucy Barton as “truth unadorned”. And if Strout offers us a further moral insight, it is that it is wrong to judge others. Lucy Barton observes that people “find ways to feel superior to another person, another group of people. It happens everywhere, and all the time. Whatever we call it, I think it is the lowest part of who we are, this need to find someone else to put down.” Linney says: “Hmph...” – a favourite response, almost Mary Poppins-ish, it makes me laugh – “One thing I know is that no one is one thing. That I know. Judgment has become entertainment – easy and unhelpful. Judgment is about selling, it is not meant to change anything.”There is one judgment I am keen to hear from her – of Richard Eyre as a director. Linney always claims in interviews that, in spite of her film and television success, she is instinctively a theatre person. She was directed by Eyre in a 2002 production of The Crucible, for which she received a Tony nomination. (More recently she was nominated for another Tony for her performance in Little Foxes on Broadway in 2017 with Cynthia Nixon). “Richard is a man of the arts,” she says. “He is beautifully balanced as a director – his attention to narrative, design and acting.” And then she comes up with a surprising word: she describes him as an “unbelievable host”. Does that extend to how he makes her feel when directed? “Yes,” she says. And she reveals that Elizabeth Strout and Rona Munro are welcomed into rehearsals too.It is Linney’s upbringing that has perhaps given her the greatest insight into family and its challenges. She is the only child of a single mother, Miriam Anderson “Ann” Perse, who worked as a nurse at Memorial Sloan Kettering, a cancer hospital in East Manhattan. Linney grew up in a one-bedroom apartment: “My mother was balancing so much, she was remarkable – she did not have an easy time. She was working 12-hour shifts at the hospital. And she was so young, she had me at 24. I often think of what it must have been like for her. She is still alive – very much so – and loves being a grandmother. I think she had given up on it ever happening. Bennett is a great gift to us all.”Her father was a playwright, Romulus Linney – winner of two national critics awards. She has described him in interviews as a wonderful but “difficult” man. When I ask whether her love of acting began with him, she replies: “I’d love to tell you it had nothing to do him, that it just came from me but that would be completely ridiculous. It had a tremendous amount to do with him.” She then adds that it might also have been in the genes: “His being a man of the theatre came from his mother – an amateur actress. My great-great-grandfather was a senator and congressman for North Carolina and known as an orator.”Linney was privately educated (relatives helped with fees) and studied theatre arts at Brown University before getting into the Juilliard School in New York. “I’m very lucky because I always knew what I wanted to do and have been able to continue to work.” But to be an actor you must have the “right disposition – it is hard work and does not always feel good. The lesson I have learned, over and over, is that you have to sit in discomfort – physically and psychologically. You have to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. In a world that does not value time or the patience required for something to develop, things do not always go well. Sometimes work has to be terrible before it gets better.”I think of Linney playing opposite Jim Carrey in The Truman Show. She is an artificially perfect wife, shiny as her kitchen appliances, a new-improved cipher with a just-add-sugar smile. That must have been a task and a half. And now she confesses that she predicts it will only be at the end of the Lucy Barton run that she will feel “ready to do it”.You can’t watch Laura Linney without thinking about her technique – that incredible ability to cry at will in front of cameras: “It is about doing all your work before you get there and then throwing it out the window, knowing it will bleed through. I do a lot of prep – then surrender.” She adds, with italicised precision: “You just have to get out of your own way.” She sees becoming Lucy Barton as getting out of the character’s way. “I see myself as a medium,” she adds.What keeps coming up in our conversation is Linney’s willingness not to be an expert on herself – and this hugely influences her acting. “It is important not to be too knowing and not to be afraid of the characters you are playing.” As Strout’s Lucy Barton reflects: “I learned that work gets done if you simply do it.” She has never played anyone for whom she had no sympathy.Linney’s first marriage was to the actor David Adkins and lasted five years. Her second husband, Marc Schauer, is a real estate agent – they met at the Telluride film festival in 2004 where he was a VIP host. I wonder how much real estate – her surroundings – matter to her? “Very much so but I must be careful about telling you where I live because of crazy stalker people who show up.” It is only subsequently, from a story in the New York Times, that I discover she is not being fanciful. Linney was stalked for several years, bombarded with unwanted bouquets at every turn. The situation became\u0026nbspso extreme she had to involve the police to put a stop to it.But now she is conjuring the necessary props of her life: “Books – too many. I have a book problem. Art. A really good bathtub. I like to soak in hot water. I like light when it is there. I don’t want to live in darkness. I like texture. But the things I love do not always go together.” She laughs. “And then you have a child and everything is turned upside down and you are stepping on Lego. My husband keeps saying: ‘A dog is coming.’ And I keep saying: ‘Not yet, please!’”It would be easy to get away with a sense of Laura Linney as all sweetness and light – but she is, I think, complicatedly earthed. When I ask what her greatest fault is, she says: “I’m very self-critical. I’m better with other people than I am with myself.” She adds: “I always feel my work could be better.” A show that particularly exposes the mix of light and dark is The Big C, the TV series in which she stars as a woman living in suburban Minneapolis with terminal cancer, putting a pretty face on calamity and deciding against treatment in favour of living (she even offers us a cartwheel or two). The Big C stood for comedy as well as for cancer and won Linney an Emmy in 2013.“My father died of cancer while we were making The Big C. For me, it confirmed that absurd things happen where the only thing you can do is laugh. My father had to go from one test to another and came out of one procedure not at all lucid. He was speaking in this Appalachian accent and pretending to box somebody. We had to travel miles with him through the hospital, through elevators and down hallways – and it was just insane. And there was a Christmas party going on with Santa Claus saying ‘Ho! Ho! Ho!’” Comedy, she now asserts, is “a survival technique. It comes to you when life is chaotic and has a way of going right to the truth. There is such relief in the recognition of the truth that you laugh.”She is one of the least self-pitying people I have ever met, most of all on the subject of age: “Ageing is a tremendous privilege. I lose my patience with people who complain about getting old… it’s a slap in the face to everyone who has not had the privilege of ageing. I find it incredibly disrespectful. I get really upset.” I ask if she is thinking of people like Natasha Richardson with whom she was friends. “Yes – and of anyone who died of Aids early, anyone who has been in a tragic accident, anyone whose life was cut short.”Yet she is not saying that getting older is a breeze: “We’re human. Ageing is not easy. There are times when I don’t know why my body isn’t working and don’t like what I see. All of a sudden, you don’t recognise yourself in the mirror or it is hard to get out of a chair.” I say it is difficult to believe that it is ever hard for her to get out of a chair. “It can be! And all of a sudden, you don’t remember with the clarity and alacrity you used to… but what matters is that this is where you are.”What would she say her inner age was? She hesitates: “I have twins.” I tell her that sounds like cheating. She persists: “I have an older and younger person dancing together in me.” Does she fear becoming older still? “No, I find it a relief. And there is something about the responsibility of getting older, there are people coming behind us who need us to get out of the way. And honestly – I’ve had my time, thank you.”Only she hasn’t, as My Name Is Lucy Barton is sure to prove.

He said the case to return them was particularly compelling.“I think it’s a very, very clear case of appropriation and theft,” he said. “They were taken in 1897 during the raid on the Palace of Benin. The palace was destroyed they were taken and then sold to pay for the cost of the military adventure. Everyone was open about this – steal this stuff, send it to pay for the cost of the bullets. It’s just such a stark case of theft.”He said there were around 4,000 objects taken from the Nigerian palace that were national treasures. “The idea that your national treasure would be in the museum of another country is something that as British people we would find absolutely impossible to get our heads around,” he said, “but that’s what Nigerians have to think about.“The things that we regard as the greatest cultural artefacts, the greatest things we ever produced, our greatest works of art are in the museums of other countries, and we know the date they were taken and the circumstances they were taken.”If museums only sent what was back in storage, “you would have the biggest collection in Nigeria”.One of the most high-profile and perennially contentious cases involves the Parthenon marbles in the British Museum, taken from Greece by Lord Elgin in the early 19th century.Olusoga believes they should go back, as should objects taken from the summer palace in Beijing in 1860 by Elgin’s son. Olusoga said he was brought up in Britain by his mother who was determined that her mixed race children would remain connected to their father’s culture. He was taken to the British Museum and made, “I should stress the word ‘made’”, to read books about African history and Benin. The Benin bronzes are particularly powerful. “You can’t look at them and not remember where you are when you’re looking at them. Their situation, their geography is part of the story. They are wonderful works of art but they are mainly spread across Europe and America, and therein lies the story.” There is a moral case for repatriating objects but also a self-interest one in terms of making friends, Olusoga said. Museums argue that, by law, they are not currently permitted to deaccession the objects.Many have agreed to repatriate human remains, however, and the V\u0026ampA recently raised the prospect of sending back treasures taken from Ethiopia – after the capture of the mountain city of Maqdala – on long-term loan.Many museums have such loans in place but some believe they should go much further. The debate was given impetus in November when Emmanuel Macron, the French president, said in a speech: “African heritage can’t just be in European private collections and museums.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/733cea149f8b9016a6615858a8757b8fa6e50838/0_0_6200_3721/master/6200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d545afc0c2a2cb7830de9d772321fcb","title":"revealed developers cashing in privatisation uk student housing","story":"More than 20,000 UK students are paying for rooms owned by companies based offshoreTens of thousands of undergraduates are paying for accommodation at universities where developers are cashing in on the privatisation of student housing using offshore companies, a  investigation has found.More than 20,000 students are paying for rooms owned by companies based in places such as Jersey, Guernsey, the British Virgin Islands and Luxembourg but that figure is likely to be an underestimate given the surge in building in university towns in recent years.The holding structure means that overseas investors are able to sell on the rooms without paying tax on their gains and it allows buildings to change hands without any stamp duty bill. Complex company arrangements also give companies the opportunity to minimise the tax they pay while charging students up to £14,000 a year in fees for high-end housing.One company collected £2.2m in rental income in 2016 but contributed just £10,000 in income tax after it paid £2.1m in charges, mostly to a Luxembourg based holding company.For residential property the only real advantage is anonymity - rules introduced in recent years mean that you will pay more tax to put a home into an offshore company, and face an annual fee to if the property is worth more than £500,000. But for commercial properties there are still benefits - overseas investors can sell properties held in offshore companies without triggering a UK capital gains tax (CGT) bill. And purpose-built student accommodation qualifies as commercial property.Buying a building directly will trigger a stamp duty land tax bill, but if you buy the shares in a company that owns a commercial property, you will escape the tax. If the company is in a country with no tax on share purchases, even better. On a building costing £25m the potential saving is £1m.They are. The 2017 budget included a consultation on bringing offshore companies into CGT, and the plan is to do that in April 2019. The consultation issued in November suggested that gains made prior to that date will not count - calculations will be based on the value of properties on 1 April 2019 and it will only be future gains that are taxed.Possibly not - the main advantages will have disappeared, and owning property via a UK company is pretty straightforward. However, if they are holding properties in a number of different countries they may still see a practical value to not using a UK company.The structures are perfectly legal, but MPs and students criticised their use.John Mann, a Labour MP and member of the Treasury select committee, said: “Students are squeezed enough without paying high rents to offshore companies. It is a disgrace that offshore companies are maximising their gain from UK students whilst minimising their tax liability here.“That this is perfectly legal demonstrates exactly why parliament needs to thoroughly examine issues of tax avoidance, evasion and offshoring.”The student accommodation industry has been transformed in recent years as universities have turned to private developers to provide accommodation.One study estimated the market to be worth £45bn and billions of pounds worth of deals were done in 2017 alone. Investors from all over the world have snapped up student properties in England and Wales including big pension funds, foreign states and wealthy iniduals.Those that bought companies holding buildings, rather than buying properties directly, will not have had to pay any stamp duty land tax.Analysis of Land Registry data and company accounts show many developments are owned by investors through companies or funds set up abroad. found developments all over England and Wales – including London, Exeter, Newcastle, Chester and Bristol.Holding a property offshore currently allows overseas investors to sell on properties without a UK tax bill on their profits. This is due to change in April 2019, although any gains made before then are expected to be ignored and not subject to tax.Complex structures involving large loans and charges also allow investors to minimise the profits they pay tax on and make gains on sales without facing any bill from HMRC.Investors may own whole blocks or, in some cases, snap up inidual rooms with the promise of high returns. For instance, among the owners of one student block in Newcastle are companies based in jurisdictions including United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Guernsey and the Isle of Man.Investors paid about £100,000 for each room, with students charged upwards of £135 a week to live there.Accounts for the UK manager of the Courtrooms, a Student Housing Company block in Bristol where students pay £161 a week for an en-suite single room, show that in 2016 it collected a rental income of £2.2m and paid £10,000 in income tax. The bill was reduced by charges of almost £2.1m, the bulk of which were payments to Unicity XV Bristol Sarl, a Luxembourg company registered as the owner of the property.A spokesperson said: “We are a responsible business whose revenue and operations are taken into account when calculating profits on which we pay tax.”Analysis by the  found more than 100 student apartment blocks around England and Wales owned by different offshore companies, with the actual number likely to be higher as there is no clear way to identify student properties in the records.Land Registry listings cover only England and Wales, and some blocks are described as “land”, or another type of building, because that is what the developer purchased before converting into student rooms.Owners are liable for UK tax on the rents they collect from students, but can receive the money before tax and reduce the amount they have to pay by offsetting expenses and debt repayments.One big investor is GSA, which in partnership with Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund owns 13 buildings around the country managed by the Student Housing Company. The buildings are owned by separate Luxembourg companies.Millions of pounds in rent is collected by UK companies that then pass on payments to Luxembourg. The Luxembourg companies charge high costs for managing the buildings, allowing the firm to reduce the tax it pays.The National Union of Students vice-president for welfare, Izzy Lenga, said UK students were seen as a cash cow by overseas investors, and often had no choice but to take rooms in “overpriced glass towers”.Lenga said: “Overseas investors make billions of pounds building luxury apartments and charging sky-high rents for students. There is a cost of living crisis and finding good-quality affordable accommodation is a huge barrier for low- and middle-income students attending our world-leading institutions.”Additional reporting by Sunniva Kolostyak"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/233f1ec684e15247b26a82bcf183d0443069fa60/0_0_5508_3305/master/5508.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=188d236bbeb75e48c918d5a2562747a1","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"Wild horses, an Ethiopian wolf and a dolphin attacking a porpoise are among this week’s pick of images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34337a111a41b26bb28c95fc9a9d1ccfff7ba773/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac8058951a2d43746ec92969a9ca8349","title":"10 hottest films summer 2018 jurassic world mamma mia apostasy the meg cameron post","story":"From the Jurassic World and Mamma Mia! sequels to indie horror, a proper romcom – and a massive shark – Observer writers pick the must-see releases of the seasonThe first Mamma Mia! was a head-spinning experience that redefined my understanding of the words “good” and “bad” rarely has something so wrong felt so right. So it is with a giddy sense of expectation that I await the arrival of this sequelprequel hybrid. “Last time we gave you the happy ending,” burbles the trailer: ‘This summer we’ll take you back to the beginning.’ Thus, we find Lily James as the young Meryl Streep in sunny ’79, trying on her new dungarees, and trying out three handsome suitors (Hugh Skinner, Josh Dylan and Jeremy Irvine), who will grow up to become Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgård, and Pierce “Pick-a-note-any-note” Brosnan. Meanwhile, Amanda Seyfried calls upon her mum’s old chums for guidance through her own pregnancy in an idyllic island rerun of former events – “only this time we know who the father is!” It’s hard to imagine director Ol Parker improving on the bizarre brilliance of Phyllida Lloyd’s record-breaking original, but the prospect of Andy Garcia playing a character named (guess what?) Fernando has already got me in a tizzy. A few weeks ago, I walked past Benny and Björn in the foyer of a London screening room and was so starstruck that I had to sit down and gather myself. Their songbook has so far proved to be indestructible let’s see what this sequel throws at it. MKAmerican writer-director Ari Aster’s astonishing debut film premiered in the January snows of Sundance, but releasing it to audiences in June was probably an act of mercy: once you emerge from this nerve-destroying horror, you might just need a bit of balmy summer warmth (or at least some tepid English drizzle) to thaw your bones. Comparisons to The Exorcist, often thrown around too carelessly by critics, are earned this time. The story of a suburban family thrown into a nightmarish, haunted grief spiral after granny kicks the bucket, it reassembles familiar elements from possession thrillers and haunted-house hack jobs into something that feels genuinely, demonically inventive – the less you know going in, the better. The scares here are extreme, but not cheap: Aster riddles the story with psychic pain and complex family dynamics, and it’s galvanised by Toni Collette’s stunningly primal performance as the raddled mother at the centre of the chaos. It may just be the greatest work of the Australian actor’s career that it comes wrapped in the most artful and frankly terrifying horror film in aeons is one of the summer’s happiest surprises.GLDirector Brad Bird always maintained that he would only make a sequel to The Incredibles if he could come up with a story that was as good as or better than that of the original. And, after a 14-year gap, we are about to discover what tempted him back to family life with Mr Incredible, Elastigirl and the kids. This much is known: the sequel sees Bob, AKA Mr Incredible, adjust to one of biggest challenges of his super-career – that of stay-at-home dad to Violet, Dash and the uniquely gifted super-baby Jack-Jack. Fans of the original will be hoping for more nefarious villainy, a planet in peril and a reprise of the gorgeous retro-futurist aesthetic that made The Incredibles the best looking of all the Pixar movies.WIThe second feature from Desiree Akhavan, the director of 2014’s bisexual indie drama Appropriate Behaviour is as witty and sexy as its predecessor, but goes to a darker and more introspective place. Chloë Grace Moretz plays the titular Cameron, a lesbian teenager who has been sent to a Christian gay conversion camp (much like in Jamie Babbit’s But I’m a Cheerleader) where young people are psychoanalysed and brainwashed into being straight. SSA (“same sex attraction”) is treated as a disease, making it a potent examination of internalised homophobia and more general teenage self-hatred, though the film is buoyed by joyously good-bad early 90s fashion and music, and American Honey’s Sasha Lane as “Jane Fonda”, a teen marijuana farmer with a prosthetic leg.SHSeeing charismatic non-professionals on screen has long been a part of cinema’s daily bread – at least since Luchino Visconti gave centre stage to a Sicilian fishing community in 1948’s La Terra Trema. But every now and then, this working method gets a fresh boost – as it does in Jonas Carpignano’s A Ciambra, in which Italian neo-realism lives again, with an executive-producer helping hand from Martin Scorsese. Carpignano previously paid a visit to the port community of Gioia Tauro in south-western Italy in his 2015 refugee crisis drama Mediterranea. Here he returns to some of the same characters – members of the real-life Roma family the Amatos, notably 14-year-old Pio, in a coming-of-age story about breaking away from the dominion of the reigning local hoods to start a criminal career of his own. This Calabrian-dialect drama crackles with unruly energy and sense of place, and Pio Amato is one of those screen naturals that come along only every few now and thens.JR“A rescue op to save the dinosaurs from an island that’s about to explode – what could go wrong?” In 2015, Jurassic World served up an eye-poppingly empty spectacle in which the digitally rendered 3D beasties seemed altogether more lifelike than their two-dimensional human counterparts. So why get excited about this fifth Jurassic instalment? Largely because it’s directed by Spanish maestro JA Bayona, whose CV ranges from the spine-tingling chills of The Orphanage to the sublime fantasia of A Monster Calls via the real-life tragedies of The Impossible. How much of his personal stamp Bayona will be able to imprint on this corporate behemoth remains to be seen the trailer looks very smashy-crashy. But Jeff Goldblum is back (hooray!) pontificating about natural order, and the supporting cast includes an ever so slightly sinister-looking Toby Jones (hooray again!) banging a gavel. Fingers crossed. MKSimple but sharp, and emotionally intense, this British debut by Daniel Kokotajlo offers rare insight into an enclosed and little understood community – the Jehovah’s Witnesses. Set in Manchester, it’s a story of a mother (Siobhan Finneran) and her two daughters, Alex and Luisa (Molly Wright, Sasha Parkinson), raised according to the faith’s rigorous code. But Luisa, discovering other possibilities in life, finds herself “disfellowshipped” – barred from the community and contact with her family. The brilliance of Apostasy is testimony to the fact that storytelling sometimes works best when film-makers are prepared to follow the unexpected path, at the risk of throwing their audience. Kokotajlo’s own background as a Witness brings a meticulously observed authenticity, and superb performances open up deep personal dimensions in this trenchant inquiry into the cost of fundamentalist fervour. JRWorking-class and slightly goofy-looking, Lee Alexander McQueen was, on paper, unlikely to even break into the hallowed world of high fashion, let alone become one of its brightest stars. But as this thrilling, troubling documentary demonstrates, McQueen had the kind of white-hot talent that is impossible to ignore. However, the problem with anything white hot is that it tends to burn out quickly, leaving plenty of wounded people in its wake. The (savage) beauty of this documentary by Ian Bonhôte and Peter Ettedgui is that it goes beyond the admittedly fascinating life story of British fashion’s enfant terrible. The film attempts to capture the grand guignol theatricality of McQueen’s designs and – in particular – the often controversial shows.Bonhôte and Ettedgui embellish the narrative with skulls and shadows, imagery from a baroque nightmare or a glimpse into the psyche of the designer himself. It goes without saying that this will be on the must-see list for anyone remotely interested in fashion. But McQueen was more than just a frock designer: he was both a cultural icon and an iconoclast an avant garde artist and an East End geezer who camped up his cockney accent. The appeal of this vivid portrait will be similarly far-reaching. WIIt has been so long since Hollywood released a proper studio romantic comedy. Not failed feminist thinkpieces like I Feel Pretty watered-down imitations of the genre à la Home Again or chemistry vacuums like the Fifty Shades franchise but a fun, glossy, big-budget movie with a capital M. Which is why I’m so excited about Warner Brothers’ Crazy Rich Asians, Jon M Chu’s adaptation of Kevin Kwan’s 2013 bestselling novel.The plot is a classic culture clash: born and bred New Yorker Rachel Chu (Fresh Off the Boat’s Constance Wu) attends an ornate wedding in Singapore with boyfriend Nick Young (Henry Golding), only to discover that his relatives are crazy rich (and judging by the trailer, pretty bonkers also). Petty drama, a disapproving mother-in-law, a bawdy best friend, sex, romance and a sweeping pop soundtrack? Yes please. Even better, it’s a majority Asian cast (you’d hope so, considering the title, but with Asian characters recently rewritten for Scarlett Johansson and Tilda Swinton in Ghost in the Shell and Doctor Strange respectively, it’s not a given), and the first contemporary film of its kind from a Hollywood studio since 1993’s The Joy Luck Club. SHEver since I was a child, I have been a sucker for a shark movie. Whether it’s a classy, fine-whittled tension exercise like Jaws or The Shallows or an all-out trash attack like the Sharknado series, any combination of watery peril, bad movie science and big gnashing chompers is delirious comfort viewing to me.So this thrillingly stupid-looking thriller – locking the redoubtable Jason Statham in combat with a 75-foot megalodon surging from the depths of extinction – has been an easy choice for my most anticipated title of the summer ever since the gaudy, perfectly absurd trailer hit the internet a few months back. Hopes are high that this could prove the new century’s Deep Blue Sea, and if you understand why that’s an exciting prospect, then you are one of my people.

I don’t know how it’s going to work out.”Everett visited Hay to talk about his film The Happy Prince, in which he plays Oscar Wilde. Written, directed, produced by and even starring him, it has taken Everett 10 years to get the financial backing to finally get it made.He admitted his career had been characterised by dramatic highs and lows but he would not have it any other way. “Everything good that has happened to me has happened because of failure in a way.”Everett said he had four years of fame and success in Hollywood starring in films including My Best Friend’s Wedding in 1997. But being an openly gay actor meant it was tough and there was never an option of hiding his sexuality because he enjoyed being out on the gay scene too much.“It was impossible to do anything else but play the gay best friend... and after a couple of gay best friends what can you do? People get bored with it. We have in Hollywood a world where straight people can play gay parts but a gay person does not have the same access to play straight parts.“Once I tried to move on from playing those parts, I was thwarted every time, sometimes quite dramatically. It was like hitting a brick wall.”He said things were changing but not fast enough. “In Germany, a fairly liberal country, there is not a single gay actor who is out. Not much in Italy, not much in France so I think it is still an issue.”Moving in his with his mother, a redoubtable figure in her 80s, is his next project. The house in Wiltshire has been split between them. “It is in the countryside, I’m going to be able to work and write and do some other projects.”Everett, who’s turning 59 on Tuesday, predicted: “There are going to be quite a few ‘star wars’ between us.”His Oscar Wilde film has been screened at film festivals and garnered good reviews with the ’s Peter Bradshaw writing: “It is a part he was born to play, and he does it with exactly the right kind of poignantly ruined magnificence.”He has speaking in Hay with the BBC’s Alan Yentob, who spent five years making an Imagine documentary on the 10 years it took Everett to make his passion project film.Everett said it could not have been made without financial backers knowing that Colin Firth would be in it.He first met Firth as a young man seeing him on stage and having a complete crush. They appeared together in the 1984 film Another Country where Everett went off him.“I found him incredibly dreary, I thought I can’t believe I fell in love with this bore!” They fell out but, fortunately, became friends 10 years later on the set of Shakespeare in Love."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff1196e764d77882536988871c5030ed48703554/0_317_3174_1904/master/3174.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43c192fa7719a84fed2563baeb9df9c4","title":"mohamed salah confident fit world cup","story":"Jürgen Klopp will make a renewed attempt to prise the goalkeeper Alisson from Roma this summer as he looks to upgrade Liverpool’s squad following defeat in the Champions League final.While Liverpool players refused to blame the “infinitely sorry” Loris Karius for defeat against Real Madrid in Kiev, with Dejan Lovren appealing for criticism of the 24-year-old to be restrained, their manager has already made plans to sign a new first-choice goalkeeper for next season.Alisson, Liverpool’s opponent in the Champions League semi-final, remains Klopp’s favoured choice with the Brazilian scouted extensively throughout the season.Roma, however, have been resistant to dialogue with Liverpool this year and it will require a considerable offer to test the Italian club’s resolve. Alisson’s employers have also been scarred by internal criticism for selling Mohamed Salah to Liverpool last summer for £36.9m. There were fears that the Egypt international could miss the World Cup with the shoulder injury that changed the complexion of the final although he tweeted on Sunday night that he is “confident” he will be available.Jan Oblak of Atlético Madrid has also been linked with Anfield but Klopp was prepared to persist with Karius after his £4.7m signing from Mainz responded well to being confirmed Liverpool’s No\u0026nbsp1 ahead of Simon Mignolet. But that was the position prior to the aberrations that contributed to the 3-1 defeat in Ukraine. The Liverpool manager insisted he and his club “will be with” Karius as he comes to terms with the errors that enabled Real Madrid to record a third consecutive Champions League triumph. He may have to broaden his search for a new first choice keeper should Roma maintain their stance on Alisson.Klopp’s plans for midfield improvement are in place with Naby Keïta secured for £52.75m from Red Bull Leipzig and Lyon captain Nabil Fekir targeted for a transfer costing a minimum of £60m. Klopp will be armed with a sizeable transfer budget having made around £70m for reaching the Champions League final and banked £142m from the January sale of Philippe Coutinho to Barcelona.Karius was inconsolable after the final on Saturday and apologised to Liverpool fans and team-mates for his two mistakes. On Sunday he extended his apology on social media. “I know I messed it up with the two mistakes and let you all down,” the goalkeeper wrote. “Haven’t really slept until now. The scenes are still running through my head again and again. I’m infinitely sorry to my team-mates, for you fans, and for all the staff. I’d just like to turn back the time but that’s not possible.”Liverpool players were criticised for not consoling the young German keeper immediately after the final whistle but there was only support for Karius afterwards.Lovren said: “When we win, we win together. When we lose, we lose together. Don’t blame him. It’s easy to blame someone but we are in the same ship together and everyone gave him the best words that they can. He will come back strong. You cannot find the words. He had a difficult start last season, so I believe in him. Don’t make massive stories about that. Of course it’s big because it’s a final, but everyone makes mistakes.”Andy Robertson had a similar message for the Liverpool keeper. “We win as a team, we lose as a team and we fell short,” the Scottish full-back said. “Of course he made mistakes but we are not blaming him. He has been incredible since he got the number one jersey. He is young and he will learn from it. He will be a top, top keeper. We have fallen short and there are no words that we can say to Loz that will make it better for him.”Robertson was one of many Liverpool players in Kiev who insisted that Salah’s cruel exit after 30 minutes, and not Karius’s mistakes, was the true turning point of the final. He also suggested, diplomatically as possible, that there was an element of intent behind Sergio Ramos’s prolonged hold on Liverpool’s leading goalscorer.“I think it is just how Mo has landed but Ramos is quite clever, isn’t he?” said Robertson, rhetorically. “It is just the way he has landed on it. It disrupted our rhythm a wee bit. Everyone looks because it is Mo Salah. He has done unbelievable this season and for it to end that way for him was devastating.”Lovren concurred: “We are devastated, it’s heartbreaking. Mo is one of the most important players for us and it’s not the same when you don’t have him on the pitch. The mindset is totally different when you have him on the pitch. It was difficult to accept that we, again, had such an unlucky moment with so many injuries. I cannot believe we had so many injuries this season.”The Liverpool captain, Jordan Henderson, described his second defeat in a European final for the club as “the worst feeling I have had in football”. But he was adamant the consistent progress Liverpool have made under Klopp would not be disrupted by the latest setback and silverware under the German coach will materialise.“I believe we will be in another Champions League final,” Henderson said. “I believe we will be challenging in all competitions domestically. The Premier League is important to us and we are qualified for the Champions League next year so we need to do it sooner rather than later. I believe in this team, I believe in this manager and I believe we are going in the right direction. It is so difficult to stand here now and say that but that is the truth. It is how I feel. We have to make it happen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6cadadb95f4ada298269fb4109dac11ac7d3774/0_49_2729_1638/master/2729.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bcb2c9944decc287c4125ee1293d072","title":"mourinho manchester city united gareth bale guardiola","story":"• Manchester United closely monitored Bale last summer• Striker’s injury record not a concern for MourinhoManchester City have cleared the way for Manchester United to revive their interest in Gareth Bale as the Premier League champions are not interested in signing the Welshman.Bale could depart Real Madrid this summer after he signalled his unhappiness at being dropped by Zinedine Zidane, the head coach, for the 3-1 Champions League final victory against Liverpool in Kiev.Bale scored Real’s winning goals after coming on as a substitute with the match at 1-1. It is understood the 28-year-old is not a potential target of the City head coach, Pep Guardiola. United, though, closely monitored Bale last summer before José Mourinho conceded he would stay at Real on the eve of United’s Uefa Super Cup defeat by the Spanish club in August.Bale’s injury record at Real has been a factor in his losing his regular starting berth under Zidane but this is not of concern to Mourinho or United’s medical department.The player’s representatives will have talks with the Real president, Florentino Pérez, as he remains unsure if his Champions League-winning display has convinced Zidane of his worth.After entering as a 61st-minute replacement against Liverpool the first of Bale’s strikes was an overhead volley. Bale had scored five times in his five appearances before the final and ended the season with 21 strikes in 39 matches.Pérez wields considerable power at Real yet whether Bale remains at the club may depend on Zidane changing the stance that he is no longer an integral part of his plans.If Real had lost to Liverpool the 45-year-old might have lost his job and Bale’s long-term prospects at the club would have appeared brighter. Given Zidane became the first coach to secure a hat-trick of European Cups he seems unlikely now to leave."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/577619abec3d220cdad2bfcdd2936514c6ac18ae/0_0_2963_1778/master/2963.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e4f91cf7799b594dba00f6e9b74a062","title":"jane fonda interview film book club im 80 i cant believe it racism cosmetic surgery","story":"Jane Fonda is as outspoken, mischievous and political as ever. She talks to Sophie Heawood about racism, cosmetic surgery and the joys of working again with Robert RedfordJane Fonda has ruined me. I never want to interview anyone under the age of 80 again. Specifically, I never want to interview anyone who isn’t 80, and who doesn’t phone me for a catch-up call from a limo in Cannes, in which they are being driven to the airport, having gone to a deeply glamorous film festival party the night before and now finding themselves, as Fonda puts it delicately, “slightly hungover”. Fonda isn’t even hugely interested in Cannes these days, not like back in the day “when people wore their own clothes and went there to talk about movies”.No, she’s hungover in the limo, but wants to talk about the Black Lives Matter movement about what she has recently learned of the mass incarceration of African-Americans in her country and how it isn’t enough for white women like her to be empathetic. They have to stand up and make this stop, because America is a country built on slavery and it isn’t over yet.It’s a continuation of the conversation that began a few days previously, when I met her backstage at the Ellen DeGeneres chat show in Los Angeles. Fonda was preparing to promote her new film, Book Club, in which she plays one of four women who have reached a certain age, read Fifty Shades of Grey in their book club, and decided to do something about their passions. The link between spicing up your sex life and committing to ending gross inequality might not be an obvious one, but she explains that Book Club is about female solidarity and women having each other’s backs, and so is much of her “feminist activism”. Even though, when she first got interested in politics, she had just starred in the 1968 erotic sci-fi film Barbarella “and I took a lot of heat on it from feminists. The new women’s movement was in its early stages and there was a lot of…” she adopts a comically stern voice: “‘How do you feel making a movie that exploits women, like Barbarella?’ You’d kind of want to say: ‘Well, honey, nobody forced me.’ But,” she concedes, “it wasn’t much fun to make it.”Fonda’s small, white, fluffy dog Tulear is perched beside her. She actually wanted to name the dog Barbarella, but her daughter Vanessa, whose father, Roger Vadim, directed the film, wasn’t keen.If Book Club is a sort of geriatric Sex and the City, then Fonda plays the Samantha character, a leopardskin-clad businesswoman who schedules sex and won’t commit. “Vivian is sassy, she doesn’t want any emotional entanglements, and that was kind of fun.” Fonda explains that back in the early 20th century, “before there were the Nielsen ratings or whatever, the censor, there were actresses such as Myrna Loy, Barbara Stanwyck and Mae West playing dangerous women – the parts they played were like guys. Then puritanism crept in. But I think there are going to be more women-centric movies, like Book Club, now. A lot of these movies are doing well, and I don’t think this is a phase – I think this is it.”Jane Fonda was born in 1937, the daughter of the actor Henry Fonda, and while her life was socially privileged, her home life was agony, and her mother, Frances Ford Seymour, killed herself in a psychiatric hospital. (Fonda was 12 and only found out that her mother’s death was suicide from a movie magazine – nobody ever spoke to her about it.) Jane herself was also sexually abused and in her memoirs she writes movingly about the concept of disembodiment – how it took her until the age of 62 to fully inhabit her own body.Her marriage to Ted Turner had just ended, “and I was single again and I realised… I’m not scared,” she says of it now. “I was alone in the house, looking out through my own eyes and I could live inside my own skin. It was a revelation. It was something else.”How painful is it that it took so long to get herself back?“I feel very sad that so many girls are abused all over the world and that men don’t understand what it does to them. It’s not something that happens lightly, it can alter a person. And then you have to be very intentional about getting back into your own skin, but it can be done. It wasn’t so much that I felt sad about all the wasted time, because I wasn’t fully authentic, but on the other hand, why not instead just be proud of yourself that you got there and you didn’t stop trying?”She also links plastic surgery to sexual abuse and has said that when she sees the face “of a woman who has made herself into a mask, I always think to myself… I wonder, I wonder.” She had her own breast implants taken out and has also had several facelifts of which she says she is not proud.As for #MeToo, is it also painful to not have had such a movement 50 years ago? Fonda once again takes my negative and turns it into a positive.“I am very grateful to be alive through this,” she says softly. “I did not think I would live to see it. Yes. And I think that it’s going to continue, it’s not just a moment. I love the Time’s Up aspect of it. We’re working with women from all different places. I’m going to DC to lobby with domestic workers. The farm workers up in Bakersfield. It’s all of us together, having each other’s backs.”This is why she made the film 9 to 5 in 1980, which became one of Hollywood’s highest grossing comedies ever, despite its subject matter of the awful way men treated women in the workplace. Fonda wants to produce a new version of the film, with younger actors, who now find their work life even more precarious on zero-hours contracts. We discuss the state of the labour unions in the United States. “So all this is not so new for me. But it is for a lot of other actors, and that’s why it’s a very valuable thing to hear what other women in other industries have to put up with, women who are much more vulnerable than we are.”I have to say it: Jane Fonda looks stunning, immaculately coiffed and made up, and with the poise and elegance that has always been hers. It’s thanks to a lifetime of fitness regimes for which everyone remembers her videos, and also to the facelifts. But they, she says, were more about survival in her industry than about vanity. “They bought me an extra 10 years.” Like it or not, it does seem to be true. How many other 80-year-old women currently have a hit comedy series on Netflix (Grace and Frankie), as well as movies coming out, a documentary on their life about to hit HBO, and no signs of stopping any time soon?Of course this is all down to much more than surgery: it is the third act of a career that began more than half a century ago and has involved two Oscars for Best Actress (and a further five nominations) along the way. Curiously, it is the fitness videos that people in the UK remember her for the most. In the States, there are still people who boycott Jane Fonda’s films because of how deeply involved she got in protesting against the Vietnam war. Not that any of that stopped her.In Grace and Frankie, which is now approaching its fifth season, she and Lily Tomlin’s character become accidental, grumpy housemates after their husbands fall in love with each other. When I tell people I’m going to interview Jane Fonda, a surprisingly wide range of people tell me how much they love that show. “I know,” she says, her voice dropping to an absolute whisper. “We’re stunned. We did not expect that. We’re trying to figure it out!” she hisses.She loves working with her old friend Tomlin “because she’s a working-class gal who grew up in a fascinating family. People visit the set who were with her in elementary school. She is just so funny – and I’ve tried to learn that from her. But it just comes naturally to her.” Surely you’re funny, too, I say. “Oh no,” replies Fonda, “I don’t have a natural funny bone. I come from a long line of depressed people.” She laughs.Having been married several times and lived with various partners, and recently split up with her last boyfriend, the music producer Richard Perry (she describes him as “a younger man” – she also wrote a blog about him having Parkinson’s), Fonda now lives in a gated retirement enclave with her own house, but a shared community centre with a pool and tennis courts “where I always see one or two other residents who seem infinitely older than I am, but they probably aren’t. I never thought I would ever live there, but it’s great.”She does yoga and Pilates and has even made a whole new series of workout videos, “and their label is Prime Time, as they’re for older people. I can’t do the original workouts any more, because I’ll hurt myself,” she gestures to her hips, “as I have joint replacements.” In fact, she says her main form of exercise these days involves jumping into things “before I really know what I’m doing. It’s called a leap of faith and it’s my main form of exercise. It’s what keeps me young, too. That’s my new workout. When you take a leap of faith you don’t always land in the right place, but you sure do learn things. It’s good for the heart.”At the weekends, she leaves Los Angeles to go knocking on the door of Trump voters. “When you’re talking to them you can’t criticise Trump. You can’t criticise Fox News. All you can do is listen to what they care about and what they’re afraid of, and then maybe tell them something that they don’t know. Because we’re all in our bubbles, including me.” Do people recognise her? “I was in Bakersfield last Saturday and knocked on 30 doors. Only one person saw me coming and said: ‘Grace and Frankie!’ It was a kick! Nobody else knew who I was. I just say: ‘I’m Jane.’ They don’t need to know.”She has also been acting with Robert Redford again. I tell her that I recently watched Barefoot in the Park, the 1967 film where she and Redford are giddy newlyweds in New York, and then went to Netflix and watched Our Souls at Night, in which she and Redford reunited in 2017 to play widowed grandparents who get together to end their loneliness.I tell her it was a really beautiful night of cinema, to see these two actors come back together with their war wounds, their egos bruised, their hearts more honest in later life. To my surprise, Fonda’s eyes start to water. “Ohh,” she says softly. “It moves me that you say that.”She has said that she was always in love with him when they worked together, but they were always married to other people. He said recently that he had no idea she loved him. Do they keep in touch? Send texts? “Oh no. He doesn’t text, number one two, he’s a loner. So that’s that.” She says she won’t ever fall in love again. “I love men, I’m not done with men, but I’m done with marriage and dating.”Fonda is unimpressed by the romance in many modern films. “I’m not a big mouth opener on camera. Every time I see a love scene with young ones – they come at each other like this…” she mimes a big wide-open slobbering jaw, “…and I’m thinking, well where does the fun come in? Because the fun is the sensuality of lips. And then slowly moving beyond that. But not trying to swallow each other.” She giggles. “I would not want to go right into a tongue kiss, quite frankly.”And then Woody Harrelson walks past the dressing room. Fonda sends somebody to get him back. “I want to hug you!” she says, standing up to greet him. “I saw Three Billboards again last night because I had a house guest who hadn’t seen it. You’re so good Woody, God!” she says. “You’re so good, Jane!” says a glowing, goofy Harrelson. It’s like watching a peacock hug a panda.And then they both have to go off and be on the telly, and I am left with the sense of having just been visited by grace and greatness.Book Club is in cinemas from 1 June"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/195ed48d96182bb2bc70adeab76e3be33c7106d9/0_149_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a3187dedfd562f861920528ffcf04c7","title":"david lammy a london united by celebration had become a city united by grief","story":"David Lammy recalls the 24 hours in July 2005 when he celebrated the city’s successful Olympic bid – then learned that a friend had died in the terror attacksI’ll never forget when it was announced that London would host the Olympics. A grey afternoon in Trafalgar Square had done little to assuage our fears that a flawless bid would hand Paris, the frontrunner, the world’s biggest sporting event. As culture minister, I was leading London’s celebrations and as the announcements came in, I watched the square erupt in colour and celebration with the news. London, the city that had raised me, had achieved the victory it deserved.The buoyancy of the day before carried me through to the next morning. But it subsided as I was sitting in a car on the way to parliament and heard that there had been a power surge on the tube. Like many other Londoners that day, I couldn’t figure out what that actually meant, or why I had no signal on my phone.As the rumours dissipated, it became clear that there had been a major terrorist attack. Parliament was eerily quiet as images of the July bombings started flooding on to the TVs: a red bus splayed on to the street with its insides hanging out, Russell Square, home to my old university, crowded with ambulances for the injured.Less than 24 hours had turned London’s joy and hope into despair. Immediately, along with the rest of the city, I rang loved ones and colleagues to check that they were all right. An intern in our office had been on one of the lines that was affected, but we had managed to get hold of her after a few tries.As London’s shock turned slowly into grief, I began to feel a deep unease that sat with me through the night. I woke up the next day to hear that my friend James Adams had been a passenger on a train from King’s Cross, and was one of the 56 people missing. I knew at once that the feeling had been for him.James had been my closest friend during my early years at a state cathedral boarding school in Peterborough. It was a natural alliance: I was the only black boy in school and he had a crippling stammer. We had sung together in the choir, and shared a bunkbed. We had stayed friends after secondary school, as I traced my way from Tottenham to Westminster, and he from Peterborough to London.As an MP, there have been few moments when my personal and political life have been indistinguishable. James’s passing meant that what had been grief for all Londoners as a representative in parliament, suddenly became a personal reality. I think of James often, and miss him greatly. With his passing, a moody fog descended that didn’t lift for several years.A London united by celebration had become a city united by grief. The scenes of jubilation I had witnessed in Trafalgar Square couldn’t have been more different from the despair that hit Tavistock Square the following morning. Yet throughout it all, the spirit of London endured. In these two days of summer, days of loss and hope, I saw the best of my city – its unity, its tolerance of difference and its resilience in the face of terrible adversity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/986f4973a996125aec27ddf08bd8e90ec9f2b250/0_1095_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=250f2a33e51e76f080db36348ef5c025","title":"gerald scarfe ive always tried to make my drawings more extreme","story":"The cartoonist and satirist, 80, on his tough childhood, deadlines and getting angry with himselfI’m jolly surprised to make it to 80, because I was a very sickly child – I had chronic asthma.

Some will come directly, arriving on your phone at 4am in the masked form of links to feminist websites. Some will appear in your lap at the hairdressers, or hidden in an interview with a director whose film you keep meaning to see, or ripped carefully against a ruler and included in a birthday card from your mum. Some you will search out yourself, as if you are a woman creeping through a lonely house with a knife having heard glass break downstairs – better you catch this intruder, than it catches you.Depending on the decade in which you come of age, these stories will be focused on the importance of having children young, or old, or of freezing your eggs so you can think about it later, or of how to find the perfect mate, or of the liberating glee that comes with doing it alone. There will be an equal number, too, explaining the benefits of remaining childless, your fellow women in snazzy heels and shiny skin leaning in to tell you about the fulfilling life it is possible to lead without the weight of a kid round your neck and, indeed, the compelling political reasons why you should never procreate.But despite being different stories, they all have the same ending. They all suggest that having a child or not having a child is simply a matter of a woman’s decision. They force you to think about babies, even if your hormones aren’t interested. These stories poke at your intellect, your curiosity about life and its side-effects. And they all make you feel extremely weary. And anxious. And lonely, sometimes, and also, on bad nights, already 75 and regretful about the other life you could have led.Having waded through that swamp of commentary, and having emerged virtually unscathed, with (though I don’t like to boast) the best three-year-old in Britain, I was unprepared for the second chapter. While the pressure to have children is so well-documented, there are no warnings about the pressure to have a second. It sneaks in, like ants come summer. There are few glossy magazine articles about this – in fact, so ingrained is the importance of siblings in the swarming consciousness of our culture that, unlike the seemingly genuine questions about whether to procreate in the first place, the adjacent debate about having more than one focuses purely on whether the existing child will be ruined by their onlyness. The parents are no longer part of the conversation. And it’s a conversation that is much stickier, seeing as it is now seen to be less about what the family wants but about what the child needs.A mother’s decision not to do it again, for reasons ranging from the practical (they’d have to move house, they can’t afford maternity leave) to the emotional (she had postnatal depression, she found the weight of love painful, like a two-year hangover), is irrelevant when faced with the idea that it will screw up her kid. If you have a child, then you must have another. To choose to stop there, it seems, from the combination of frozen smiles and earthy anecdotes about the psychopathic only child they knew growing up, or the future sadness of this two-year-old having to organise your funeral without a sister, is to be not just selfish, but perverse. Mothers are ided, again, into good and bad.I remember quite confidently predicting that one of the great benefits of growing up later than our parents would be the inevitable camaraderie of my friends either having one child or none at all, yet living close enough to each other that it would feel like we were a big sprawling family, but without the daily fights about hairdryers. It didn’t happen. Instead, we either mirrored the journeys of our parents, slotting new families into the holes left behind, or blazed off into radical new futures far far away. The middle way, with one child and no marriage, seemed so much more sensible to 20-odd-year-old me – so much more portable, and affordable. So neat. And then I had a baby.Does it screw a kid up, to be an only child? The evidence is sparse and weighted oddly. For every thin study saying yes, there’s a companion one saying no. And if it does, then what? The answer can’t simply be to have more children. Even if the idea of choice was real and solid – rather than a melting Solero in our hand – to me the whole exercise stinks slightly. We bring ourselves up to believe that we are perfectible. That simply by eradicating sugar from our diet, or by altering the questions we ask of our partners, or upon cutting in a choppy bob, all fear and anxiety will float away. Similarly, we’re encouraged to follow marked paths in order to create this version of symmetrical perfection, in the sunken belief that there is one correct way for a family to look. I’m not worried that being an only child will screw our daughter up. I have every confidence we’ll manage that anyway, whatever shape our family takes.In a speech last week, Sophie Walker (the leader of the Women’s Equality party) pointed out a problem with many businesses half-hearted movements towards equal representation. ‘Women don’t need mentors to get ahead. Get mentors for the men who don’t think there is a problem.’I’m writing under the threat of rain and it occurs to me the perfect name for the next spate of severe weather.

Translated literally as “dancing”, it’s not only the name of Gente de Zona’s most popular song (and their opener for the show), it also perfectly encapsulates the night’s mood. Before the show has begun, the crowd is already buzzing, waving Cuban flags in the air, clapping their hands and moving their waists in time with the warm-up DJ.If you’ve never heard of the Cuban duo Gente de Zona, they are by any definition a big deal: combining reggaeton with the traditional sounds of mambo and son cubano, the duo are hugely popular in Latin America, their tracks breaking a billion views on YouTube. Judging by their charming stage personas and infectious music, it’s not hard to understand why. At their backs, the soft lilt of the live guitar brilliantly complements the scraping sound of the merengue güiro, and the trumpeters and trombonists deliver a bold, metallic sound that penetrates each melody. During a particularly dynamic performance of Traidora, the guitar’s bass is turned up and the room feels more like a tiny Havana bar than a west London concert venue.The atmosphere is reminiscent of a carnival, complete with the rhythmic sound of bongos and bass that leaves you winded. The only thing missing is the extravagant costumes – the two men wear plain, dark outfits, their musicians in all white – but the revelry remains. They sing in Spanish with playful smiles on their faces, shake their hips at a crowd who shriek excitedly, and lead singer Alexander Delgado stops singing for a brief moment to kiss his co-star Randy Malcom Martinez on the cheek, throwing a wink at the audience.Just as hips begin to tire, the blast of the brass immediately revives them. In the last song, Delgado drapes a giant Cuban flag over his shoulders and repeats the word “Cuba!” – the scream that follows infuses the room with renewed vigour."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8105793f699792d14bc2e1a85990b2a99753a061/0_0_4626_3088/master/4626.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=129286122b49ce003d09242c0f205cf0 1440w","title":"priti patel calls investigation remain campaign spending brexit","story":"Tory MP wants watchdog to examine Britain Stronger in Europe’s referendum spendingThe former cabinet minister Priti Patel has called for the election watchdog to investigate spending by the remain campaign in the EU referendum.The Brexit-backing Tory MP questioned the impartiality of the Electoral Commission and said it should either investigate Britain Stronger in Europe or end its inquiry into the Vote Leave campaign.Her complaint follows claims relating to a video featuring the actor Keira Knightley urging people to vote. The video was published on the Britain Stronger in Europe website and Facebook page in the final days before the vote in 2016, the Sunday  reported.Britain Stronger in Europe said Patel’s complaint showed a “complete lack of understanding of electoral law” and noted that a previous complaint of Patel’s had been dismissed.The clip featuring Knightley was produced by an advertising agency, along with a series also featuring the designer Dame Vivienne Westwood and the model Lily Cole, at a total cost of more than £76,000.The Don’t F*** My Future videos were reported to have been commissioned by other campaign groups but Patel said she had “deep concerns” about collusion between remain-supporting organisations that may have allowed the official Britain Stronger in Europe campaign to breach the strict £7m spending limit.This month the Electoral Commission fined the campaign body Leave.EU £70,000 and referred its chief executive, Liz Bilney, to the police after it found it had breached multiple counts of electoral law during the referendum. The commission also found that Leave.EU inaccurately reported three loans it had received from companies controlled by its co-founder Arron Banks, who described the fine as “a politically motivated attack on Brexit”.In a letter to the Electoral Commission, Patel said: “I am sure you share my deep concerns that Britain Stronger in Europe seems to have been provided with services by other remain campaigns without declaring the expenditure in the appropriate way.“There is evidence that many campaigns appear to have acted as a mere continuity of the official remain campaign as it approached its spending limit, the most egregious example of this being the regrettably named ‘Don’t F*** My Future’ campaign, which many different remain organisations appear to have involved themselves in.”A previous call for an investigation by Patel was rejected by the Electoral Commission, but the leading Vote Leave figure said that “serious questions about the impartiality” of the watchdog had been raised.She said the newly reported material coupled with the evidence made public this year “suggests that the commission has decided to hold leave campaigns to one standard, and remain campaigners to another, much lower standard”.In her letter to the watchdog’s head of regulation, Louise Edwards, Patel said: “I believe that the Electoral Commission has an important role to play in our democracy, but that role comes with an important responsibility: to be politically neutral at all times.“If you want to restore confidence in the commission, you should either start a formal investigation into Britain Stronger in Europe, or show equity and end the investigation in Vote Leave.”A spokesman for Britain Stronger in Europe said: “Following hot on the heels of the dismissal of her previous complaint in December 2017, this demonstrates Priti Patel’s complete lack of understanding of electoral law. It is common practice for campaigns to post third party content on social media.”The campaign said it was confident the complaint “would be dismissed as quickly and comprehensively as her other politically motivated and unsubstantiated claims have been”.“Britain Stronger in Europe always took our legal responsibilities seriously and have always followed the rules around working together, which has been backed up by the Electoral Commission,” the spokesman said.An Electoral Commission spokeswoman said: “We have not received the allegation formally yet but when we do we will consider it in line with our enforcement policy.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8be1037bda248b2896fd14bd78d73416f047b66/222_183_3096_1858/master/3096.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5cbd8310ac9fb66877974e4eecc9a189","title":"cameron norrie roland garros french open debut","story":"British Davis Cup sensation is playing in only this third major but has a method on red clay that may keep him in Paris awhileIt is an inescapable fact that the native‑born content of British tennis at the highest level has been diluted over the years – the sort of anomaly to\u0026nbspagitate Brexiters, perhaps, but happily irrelevant across the modern sporting landscape.Cameron Norrie – born in Johannesburg 22 years ago of Scottish parents, raised in New Zealand and adopted by the UK, where he has a home in London – nailed his colours to the Great Britain Davis Cup mast with an awesome debut in February, and he might inspire more pride and headlines in his third slam appearance here on Monday. “No one really knew who I was before that,” Norrie said on Sunday. “I hadn’t done anything on clay. Profile‑wise, it was great for me to get out there.”Coming off an excellent win against the world No\u0026nbsp10 John Isner in Lyon last week to reach his first ATP semi‑final he plays the experienced and improving German Peter Gojowczyk, providing company, at least, for the British No\u0026nbsp1, Kyle Edmund, who plays on Tuesday against Alex de Minaur. Alongside Johanna Konta and Heather Watson in the women’s draw, this constitutes one of the tiniest British contingents to invade France since the Scarlet Pimpernel and friends went underground to rescue aristocratic halfwits from the guillotine. If Norrie makes the cut in the first round, he will not be as surprised as some who are yet to catch up on his story he gives every indication of becoming a valuable and interesting addition to the narrative, quietly confident and scared of no\u0026nbspone.The most striking aspect of his imminent rise to 85 in the world has been his near-effortless embrace of clay: he had not played a Tour‑level match on the stuff until February, when he came from two sets down to stun the seasoned clay-courter Roberto Bautista Agut on the first day of the Davis Cup tie in Spain. The former captain John Lloyd called it “one of the most impressive debuts of all time”.Stamina more than likely is in his genes. During his second slam appearance at the US Open last year – where he beat the tough Russian Dmitry Tursunov and gave the world No\u0026nbsp19 Pablo Carreño Busta something to think about in three sets – his father, David, was cycling the route of the Tour de France. His mother, Helen, has run a 3hr 03min marathon, and her father was also a decent runner.Gojowczyk, who reached the final in Geneva on Saturday and has won more than he’s lost this year, could be in for a tough time on Monday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/432828305c9789448f7d3f0df8111c7e710c6c95/0_135_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e09a5e651a7518a7f79406194b663c9","title":"chris froome wins giro ditalia rome first briton british winner cycling","story":"Finally, 109 years after the Gazzetta dello Sport decided to hold a bike race across Italy to boost sales, Britain has its first Giro d’Italia winner. And while this was Chris Froome’s sixth grand tour title, following four victories at the Tour de France and another at the Vuelta a España, this was surely the\u0026nbspsweetest.Not everyone felt Froome should be racing given his ongoing legal battle to clear his name after twice the permitted levels of salbutamol were found in his system at the Vuelta. He also crashed before the first stage and struggled for much of the opening fortnight. And even as late as Friday morning he was in fourth place, 3min\u0026nbsp22sec behind. Yet somehow he found a way. Again.In claiming the maglia rosa, Froome also became the first cyclist in 35 years to hold all three grand tour titles – the Tour de France, Vuelta and Giro – at the same time, joining Bernard Hinault and Eddy Merckx, the Badger and the Cannibal, in a super-exclusive club.“It hasn’t quite sunk in yet,” Froome said. “I am sure it will over the next few days when I have time to reflect. It is a dream to have all three leaders’ jerseys in the space of 10 months. I am still pinching myself. I can’t believe I am here.”After a wild and thrillingly unpredictable three weeks of racing, the race on Sunday was more of a procession, the grunt and the grind having been applied in the Italian Alps. Having stretched his lead over his nearest rival, Tom Dumoulin, to 46sec on Saturday, Froome’s task was simple: to navigate Rome’s roads without incurring a serious injury. That was not quite as straightforward as he would have hoped given the cobbles and treacherous potholes along the 11.5km circuit. But after a pow-wow with Froome, Dumoulin and the race organisers it was agreed the stage was neutralised after three laps.That meant that all general classification positions would remain the same, regardless of what happened thereafter, providing a rider finished the stage. Froome, understandably, was content to coast home as the Irishman Sam Bennett took the win in a thrilling bunch sprint ahead of Elia Viviani. Eventually Froome trundled over the line, 17 minutes back, having joyously wended his way past the monuments of ancient Rome. As he crossed the line he joined hands with his six team-mates, before being led to the podium to be dressed in pink.“It was great to be able to soak up the atmosphere in Rome and all the monuments and crowds,” he said. “I have always been a little bit afraid of coming here and really targeting it because of the demands of the Giro. It is just so different to any other race. So to be in this position, and to have won, I can’t quite believe it.”Even Froome did not think he had a chance going into the 19th stage on Friday. Only deep into an 80km breakaway, when he had established a three-minute lead to become virtual race leader, had his thoughts turned to the maglia rosa. “I felt it was game on,” he said. “It spurred me on.”It was, depending on your view, either one of the greatest solo rides in history or something less edifying. For some observers the sensation was not unlike being on a rollercoaster: thrilling and queasy at the same time.Froome, though, remains emphatic that he has done nothing wrong and when comparisons with Floyd Landis’s breakaway to Morzine in the 2006 Tour de France were brought up, he responded. “I can understand the parallels of comparisons being drawn by some people. But my conscience is clear. I have every confidence it will stand.”Team Sky, for their part, regarded the stage win on Friday as somewhat akin to the perfect heist. A combination of Froome risking everything, especially on the descents, as well as benefiting from a ramshackle chase and staff being positioned along the route to give him small pots of nutrition. They also expected Froome to come on strong in the final week, given his crash on the opening stage and the fact he had saddle sores for much of the race. Froome also came into the Giro a little heavier than usual, at 70kg rather than the 67kg he is normally at the Tour de France – although by the time he rode up the Finestre his weight had dropped to 68.2kg.Of course Froome still faces the cloud of his adverse analytical finding at the Vuelta – as well as a potential ban – although he denies any wrongdoing and insists he will clear his name.However, on the road he remains untouchable – and while at 33 he is surely in the autumn of his career, he may not be finished yet. As the Team Sky directeur sportif, Nico Portal, put it afterwards: “He is on top of his game. If he wins the Tour it will be four grand tours in a row. And after that what next? Maybe he will go for the Vuelta. That is what exceptional champions can do. He is just phenomenal.”Meanwhile Froome remains convinced, despite the reluctance of the race director, Christian Prudhomme, that his next big test will come at the Tour de France in July. And after this staggering victory would anyone dare bet against him winning his fifth yellow jersey?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/475e08a6610685093226859522aeece05624312c/0_99_3788_2273/master/3788.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc9e8cbdaca7dd1e9056181bae4c5c45","title":"daniel ricciardo keeps composure win monaco grand prix","story":"As tales of sporting redemption go, few will have been harder to earn than Daniel Ricciardo’s very personal journey to the top spot of the Monaco Grand Prix on Sunday. By the time the Australian had successfully persuaded the Prince and Princess of the principality to join him in swigging from a champagne bottle on the podium, his sheer joy was clearly infectious.A mixture of disbelief, relief and exhaustion were etched across his face, if indeed alongside the usual beaming grin that had been so notably absent when a win here had been so cruelly wrenched from his grasp two years ago.Even before the weekend began Ricciardo had been confident enough in the form of his Red Bull to talk of possible redemption for the incident in 2016 when a team pit stop error cost him victory. By race day he had done everything he needed to put it within his grasp. Quickest throughout practice and then untouchable in qualifying, Ricciardo had entered the race as clear favourite.He duly finished it on top, in front of Sebastian Vettel’s Ferrari in second and Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes in third, the order in which they had begun on the grid. The race was, as is often the case, something of a procession on the narrow streets of Monaco but was far from straightforward for Ricciardo.He had led from the off and looked to be fairly comfortable in front until he suffered a power problem on lap\u0026nbsp28 in the MGU-K. He was unable to use seventh and eighth gears, had to adjust his brake balance forward and needed to ensure he looked after his tyres as it became clear the race would have to be run with only one stop.His team were unable to resolve the problem and he had to drive the remaining 50 laps with absolute perfection and on a tight line to ensure Vettel had no way through, despite his power advantage.Passing is of course notoriously difficult in Monaco but Ricciardo still had to ensure he did not put a wheel wrong to claim the win. He did so and after 78 flawless laps under intense pressure from behind there is no doubt he and Red Bull had a real reason to celebrate on the occasion of their 250th grand prix.He had, as was the case in 2016, once again endured a rollercoaster of emotions in the cockpit to do so. “I expected my race to be over,” he said of the moment he lost power. “I was stressing out a little. Then I was thinking, ‘What do we have to do to win around here?’ That was not a good feeling and I couldn’t enjoy much of the race after that. I still don’t know how we got there.”Yet he did and his jubilant team principal, Christian Horner, compared it to Michael Schumacher’s remarkable second-place at Barcelona in 1994 when the German completed most of the race stuck in fifth gear. While it had still to sink in fully with the Australian he accepted the praise. “I think it was definitely my best weekend and the most satisfying,” he said. “There’s still a lot to process but as a whole this is probably the best weekend of my career.”He admitted it had been a race of control and that it was a case of managing his car and his performance rather than the flat-out charge that characterised his win in China. But for all that, when he does look back on Monaco he can consider that, while it very nearly left him broken-hearted again, this time he emerged triumphant and stronger than ever.Hamilton, whose lead over Vettel in the world championship has now been narrowed to 14 points, was less enamoured with the afternoon, concerned that having to manage tyres, the inability even to attempt passes and consequently slow lap times made for an uneventful race which he had not enjoyed.“I really am happy with the weekend. To come away with third, with a difficult weekend car-wise, I am happy. I am happy for Daniel as he is a great dude,” he said. “But Monaco has got the biggest build-up and is the most special race of the year and this is now a race gone for me.“Formula One needs to apply a different schedule here. It should not be a one-stop race, for example. From a racing driver’s point of view we were never pushing. It was insane how little I was pushing. I was 10\u0026nbspseconds behind but I am still conflicted because in my heart I want to win this race but the team just wanted me to bring the car\u0026nbsphome.”Kimi Raikkonen finished in fourth, with Valtteri Bottas in fifth, he Force India of Esteban Ocon completed in sixth and the Toro Rosso of Pierre Gasly was seventh. The Renaults of Nico Hülkenberg and Carlos Sainz Jr were eighth and tenth respectively, while Max Verstappen recovered well from starting at the back of the grid to finish in ninth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c6dee365d252493741661f769e4d31b1a9124ef/0_0_3606_2165/master/3606.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7c3203a1b4fb973bf2214dbbd476418","title":"england pakistan first test corruption allegations","story":"The first Test finished just after noon on Sunday when the sun was at its zenith. There seemed to be shadows on the pitch all the same. Earlier in the morning al-Jazeera released a documentary on corruption in cricket. It included allegations that three English players had committed spot-fixing during the fifth Test against India in Chennai in December 2016 by agreeing to score a certain number of runs during a particular 10-over stretch of the game.The England response was robust. Their captain, Joe Root, called the allegations “ridiculous”, their coach Trevor Bayliss said they were “outrageous” and the ECB’s chief executive, Tom Harrison, said: “There is nothing we have seen that would make us doubt any of our players in any way whatsoever.”The film, Cricket’s Match-Fixers, included three strands. The most serious and substantial seems to be the allegations that members of the groundstaff at Galle in Sri Lanka were being paid by bookmakers to doctor pitches before Tests. The International Cricket Council has already launched an investigation into this. The second concerns a proposal for a new franchise tournament in Dubai, which would allegedly be set up with the sole purpose of enabling fixing, but the tournament never actually got off the ground. The third, least substantiated, are the allegations about spot-fixing during the Test in Chennai and another, between India and Australia, in Ranchi in 2017.There was an echo in all this of the Lord’s Test between England and Pakistan in 2010 when the News of the World broke the story that three Pakistani players – Mohammad Asif, Mohammad Amir and Salman Butt – were guilty of spot-fixing. England had dominated that match, just as Pakistan have dominated this one, and the final few overs of it played out on the Sunday morning after the News of the World ran its story.The key difference between then and now, other than who won and lost, is that the News of the World’s allegations were substantiated and ultimately led to criminal convictions. al-Jazeera’s allegations appear to be based on the word of a single, seemingly untrustworthy, source, and presented in a sensationalised documentary.But still, it added to the sense that this match was somehow upside down, that the positions of the two teams had been switched around. Pakistan have looked slick and efficient this week, their batsmen patient, their bowlers holding line and length. They have adapted brilliantly to typically English conditions. England are in a muddle, so uncomfortable that Bayliss said Lord’s felt like foreign ground. They have enough mess even without these allegations.“When we were told about it the thought was ‘rubbish’,” Bayliss said of the allegations. “But there’s nothing we can do about it if they want to put something out there. Let’s concentrate on getting out there and trying to play some good\u0026nbspcricket.”Pakistan have been quite brilliant these last few days, but for that one session on Saturday evening when they seemed to slacken off, thinking, perhaps, the match was already as good as won since England were six down at tea and still 69 runs behind. By Sunday they regrouped and refocused. Their captain, Sarfraz Ahmed, pulled them into a tight little huddle after each and every one of the wickets they took, to push them on to the finish. The joy with which they celebrated each of those last tail-end wickets spoke plenty about how driven and committed they were feeling. In the end they won by nine wickets, at a canter.Pakistan were under just as much scrutiny as England before this series started, their fans were just as sceptical about the team’s chances. In the two years since\u0026nbspthey were last here the only teams they have beaten are West Indies, home and away, and Ireland in that one-off Test at Malahide. They had lost every other game they\u0026nbspplayed which is why they have slipped to seventh in the world.The head coach, Mickey Arthur, had made some brave calls before the tour such as dropping Wahab Riaz because he was not working hard enough in training. “He hasn’t won us a game in two years,” was Arthur’s blunt assessment.There was a measure of despair, too, that the Pakistani selectors had overlooked Fawad Alam, who has scored more than 10,000 runs at 55 in first-class cricket. None of this went down well with the old Pakistani leg-spinner Abdul Qadir, who tore Arthur to pieces on live TV. “Who is Mickey Arthur? He is someone who was kicked out by South Africa and Australia. Mickey Arthur is the one who ruined Shane Watson’s cricket. Ruined the cricket of Ahmed Shehzad, Umar Akmal. Now he is after Wahab Riaz.” Qadir said the PCB had “handed over the reins to an incompetent white man who has not played Test cricket himself”.Arthur’s approach has backfired on him before, of course, when he was coaching Australia between 2011 and 2013. Arthur tried to force through sweeping changes to the culture of the team. He has been doing a similar thing in Pakistan, by pushing them to become more professional in their cricket, more committed to their fitness. He organised a four‑week training camp before this tour. You wondered then whether it was all going to blow up again. But judging by the way they have played these past four days, Arthur’s work is paying off.For once it is Pakistan who have their house in order. England, on the other hand …"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bea400102c3b6641f52e3f14d9a569f2dc0268f/0_94_2712_1627/master/2712.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0079f65cd4cfbd68c68258059e29a00a","title":"cleveland cavaliers boston celtics nba eastern conference finals game 7 live score","story":"What did I say about the Celtics losing leads in the second?

Okay you can tell he starting to feel it because he only makes one of two. (I think this is a joke. A Tatum shot juuuust rims out and that feels like a bit of a momentum kiler.

Marc Morris makes a layup AND forces a timeout. Celtics with the timeout.Jeff Green podium game? The Celtics win the jump ball but can’t convert, Green runs to the other end and gets the layup and the foul on Aron Baynes. He ties it at the free throw line- Oh never mind, Tatum unties it with a jumper.Jaylen Brown makes a layoff and, oh hey, Marc Morris gets called for a foul. Shocker that. James makes both.

Celtics can’t answer on the other end and James hits another jumper.And Tatum with a three!And that’s a quick start. The Celtics get the first three baskets of the game. Jayson Tatum, Terry Rozier and Al Hoford all score.It’s officially game time! But I keep forgetting that these playoff games, we have to wait an additional ten minutes or so for the actual tipoff. We’re in the intros nowsMy prediction as far as a potential Celtics MVP? Well if this postseason has taught us that if this guy takes over the game? They’ve probably got this. (And some people think he’s not an All-Star.)How do the Cavaliers pull it off? Well, I’m going along with the experts and say that they need some contributions from people who aren’t LeBron. LeBron is going to get his, you might want to even go for the over as far as predictions on his final point total. Somebody else is going to have to have a big game. Will Jeff Green have one of his random monster games? Will J.R. Smith actually shoot them into a game rather than out of one? Will George Hill have a second straight game where he finds himself on top of Twitter trends for all the right reasons?Let me be real: I have no idea. I guess the loss of Kevin Love and the fact that the game is at home should make Boston favorites but, man, it’s a minor miracle the Celtics have made it this far. I’m going to say that the Cavaliers win by double digits, but the game remains close for the first three quarters. Look for Boston to take an early lead and then let it slip away in the second quarter because, listen, I’ve watched this team all season long. This is what they do.Or I could be completely and utterly wrong and Boston cruises to an early victory and denies LeBron his first Finals appearance since 2010 (that was them who did that then, too, it should be noted).Hey it’s the first time since 1979 that both conference finals have gone seven games. It looked like the Houston Rockets had a chance to finish the upset against the Golden State Warriors in yesterday’s Game 6, but the Warriors pulled off one of the patented blowout third innings and ended up embarrassing the Rockets to send the Western Conference Finals back to Houston. We’ll have coverage of Game 7 tomorrow, where we’ll find out who tonight’s winners will face in the NBA Finals (note: replace “face” with “probably get crushed by,” but I’ve been wrong about so many things). It may come down to whether Chris Paul is available. Which isn’t looking good:Okay we didn’t imagine THIS series to go seven games. We especially didn’t see the Boston Celtics as the ones to push the Cleveland Cavaliers to the brink of elimination in Game 6. What we did expect, and what we got, was for LeBron James to fight back on his home court and have a crazy game (46 points, 11 rebounds, 9 assists) to keep his team alive.Now, the problem for the Cavaliers is that they’re not playing at home. They’re here in TD Garden where Boston have won every game so far this series. Could the Celtics pull off the upset, advancing the NBA Finals despite missing both Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward, who were considered their two best players before they suffered season ending injuries?To be fair, Boston aren’t alone on the injury front. It doesn’t doesn’t help that Cleveland will be without Kevin Love, who is going through the concussion protocol after suffering a head injury in Game 6. In his stead will be former Celtic Jeff Green. (Note: Boston fans will be quick to tell you that this is a downgrade.)As always we want to hear from you throughout today’s game. You can send your thoughts via email (to Hunter.Felt.Freelance@the) or via Twitter (to @HunterFelt). It’s Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals at TD Garden.

In the meantime, here’s the latest from the Western Conference finals:Klay Thompson hit nine three-pointers and scored 35 points, the Warriors held James Harden down in the second half, and Golden State rallied from an early 17-point deficit to stave off elimination with a 115-86 victory over the Houston Rockets on Saturday night to force a deciding Game 7 in the Western Conference finals.Stephen Curry added 29 points and five threes on a night Harden dazzled for long stretches with 32 points, nine assists and seven rebounds while backcourt mate Chris Paul sat out sidelined by a strained right hamstring.You can read the full report below:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dfc2ba42461772e4fa8e13602b9248320b2dc1b/0_59_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a70ba7f11fd1d855341dd3c967a1a09c","title":"rupaul drag race live review werq the world tour","story":"Beyoncé, Tina Turner and The Exorcist are all paid glorious homage to as the talent show’s Werq the World Tour hits BritainRuPaul’s Drag Race has been one of the great successes of the last decade, in television and well beyond. The series, which sees a dozen or so drag queens battle it out each season to be crowned “America’s next drag superstar”, isn’t the first to bring drag into the mainstream, but it has certainly shoved it centre-stage. Nowhere is this more the case than in the Werq the World Tour, where a bevy of former contestants, a compere and four underdressed, overenthused dancers show their gifts to the world. It’s a bit like the Strictly tour, but everyone is more open about using Botox. Tonight at the Troxy, the audience could be any pop crowd. The show is loved by people of all shapes and sizes, and the clientele is noticeably mixed, with nearly as many women as men. In fact it’s the women who seem to have got into the spirit more, wearing wigs, hats and glitter, while the men tend to play it more, well, straight. Perhaps dressing up as a woman is a job best left to the professionals. Because they are professionals. One of the reasons Drag Race is such a hit is because it relies on real craft, each contestant producing their own looks and routines. If the opener, Kennedy Davenport, gives us something quite classic – Beyoncé high-kicks to a Rio carnival-style megamix – it’s not long before we meet Sharon Needles, winner of season four. Coming on like the lost child of Cher and Elizabeth Báthory, mouthing quotes from The Exorcist, Needles soon treats us to a performance of her single, Black Licorice, while a video shows a dead rabbit decomposing. The show ploughs on, aided by more star turns: Violet Chachki makes a stunning old-school showgirl in nocturnal blue, contorting herself circus-style on an aerial hoop Detox gives us lurid sex-club Madonna with more aplomb these days than the real thing. But they all succeed, really, because they have charisma to spare. Even if Kim Chi can’t lip-sync so well, even if Latrice Royale’s rap is a little messy, the goodwill outweighs the clunkiness 10 to one. And the compere, Lady Bunny, does fine. Her shtick is based on old variety comedy gals, all beehives and dirty jokes. She’s presumably referencing the likes of Carol Burnett, although she had me thinking of Carol Thatcher on LSD. The star of the show, though, was a queen of a whole other order. Halfway through, four audience members were summoned onstage to lip-sync a pop classic of their own. The clear winner was a woman who did Proud Mary with such enthusiasm and ease that she had surely been waiting for this moment all her life. She gave a nice acceptance speech too. “Next stop, Britain’s Got Talent!” said Lady Bunny when she got the microphone back. Compliment or shade? In Drag Race’s world, the two go gloriously together."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e6b99273b8e4cf3af78ccc2163cfe023bd6c7be/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a938d8b514c4408f588e2f284be8f0f","title":"jonathan meades jargon review","story":"Meades delivers his latest polemic, on how ‘the language of the trained liar’ has infected all aspects of life, in inimitable deadpan styleJonathan Meades has taken a swig from an Alice “drink-me” bottle. He’s tiny, sitting on a\u0026nbspused syringe, on a cigarette butt, among the\u0026nbsptrash. Because he’s not in Wonderland, he’s in the gutter: a place where slang is the lingua franca.Jonathan Meades On Jargon (BBC Four) begins with a splendid and heartening defence of slang. Slang is centripetal, it gets to the core of what we actually think rather than what we are bullied into thinking (and not thinking). It is creative: “Slang is about showing off, about increasing one’s idiolect, about finding a better expression for blowjob than blowjob. It’s about flexing one’s lingo-muscle,” he says, flexing his also possibly – cunningly – finding a better expression for blowjob than blowjob. Fancy a lingo flex? No, maybe not better.Meades is immensely proud of adding to the already brimming store of words for drunk with “Badered” (ie legless, like the air ace), and to the sexual lexicon with “rubbing offal” for intercourse.Jargon, to Meade, means the “prissy net curtains of language”. The language of the trained liar, it is everything slang is not: “Centrifugal, evasive, drably euphemistic, unthreatening, conformist.” While slang belongs to the gutter, “jargon belongs to the executive estate,” he says. “It is the clumsy, graceless, inelegant, aesthetically bereft expression of houses with three garages … It is delusional, it inflates pomposity, officiousness and self-importance, rather than punctures them.”Ooh, that’s good isn’t it? Sometime you need to hit the pause button to properly appreciate a Meades missile, for it to sink in. Rewind and repeat. I also like “the more one sees of this end of humankind, the more one’s milk of human kindness turns sour”, and so much more.His tirade demonstrates how jargon has infected everything: politics and business – of course – law, journalism, television, football, football punditry, art, especially art ... It’s a pandemic. And, because you can’t separate jargon from its users, it’s a deliciously personal attack, too. Plenty to think about for: Boris Johnson, Theresa May, Philip May, George Osborne, Tony Blair, the Trump lout, the Trump lout’s counselor Kellyanne Conway, footballers Alan Shearer and Joey Barton, former Tate director Nicholas Serota (especially Serota, Meades really doesn’t like him), and so, so many more. You possibly, me certainly, it’s easy to allow it in, lazily. I’ll be running this through the jargon-check, and if any remains, it’ll be there knowingly and ironically, OK?It’s not just about what we say, it’s the way we say it. Regional accents come in for a surprise and unfashionable attack, they are “apartheid disguised as vibrant ersity”. Received pronunciation, RP, on the other hand is an instrument of social … hmmm … that needs a pause, to ponder.It’s meant to provoke, and does. It’s also blisteringly brutal, clever and hilarious. Meades is a rare thing on television: properly different. Sporadically he pops up to deliver a polemic in his inimitable style: deadpan, still, no walking towards you or waving his arms about, no TV cliches. The sunglasses have gone, sadly, perhaps the subject of jargon is so serious it requires eye contact.It still manages to be visually interesting on what looks\u0026nbsplike a budget of about forty quid. Little plastic figures mow and rub offal on the bonnet of a toy gold Range Rover. A rotting fish head is covered in flies, because jargon, too, begins at the top and putrefies downward. Careful, Serota might find the fish head relevant, buy it for a billion pounds and put it in a gallery, where\u0026nbspa cult of\u0026nbsppeople can come and spout incomprehensible guff about it. “We shall go on mocking,” says Meades, reassuringly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7cd4d40bda1399bb7da96ff53030db3cad2d53c/66_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac7385fed759b2ecc3f8cbe4b5f26132","title":"sun sea and the open road an american fly drive for beach fans","story":"Want an ocean drive? Visit some of the best beaches in the world with a trip to Miami, San Diego and Los AngelesStop 1: Miami, FloridaIf your idea of holiday heaven is the sand between your toes and sea breeze in your hair, then this trip to the US is a shore thing. Start by flying into the ultimate beach city of Miami. From the pastel buildings and teeny-weeny bikinis of South Venice to the rugged scenery and bike trails of Key Biscayne, Miami gives famously good – and varied – beach action.Mid Beach, MiamiIf the thongs and flash cars of South Beach get a bit too much, then Mid Beach – just a few miles north – is where Miami’s stylish scenesters hang out. For the full Club Tropicana experience, The Miami Beach Edition hotel has indoor and outdoor pools, a bowling alley, an ice-skating rink and cocktails served in bronze pineapples. Although sadly the song lied – the drinks aren’t free. What does come gratis is scoping out all the nearby art deco architecture which lines Collins Avenue and Ocean Drive.Bill Baggs Cape Florida state park, Key BiscayneKey Biscayne (known as “the key” to locals) feels like you’re escaping the city to an island oasis, even though it’s just a short drive over the bridge (hire a car from Avis for the ride). Bill Baggs is the beach for secluded sunbathing, cycling, kayaking, windsurfing and views of the Miami skyline. Pop into the mid-19th-century Cape Florida Lighthouse (ancient by US standards) and catch a glimpse of Stiltsville, a collection of historic homes that appear to float above the bay. Lighthouse Cafe, right on the shore, is the spot for a cold beer and a fish supper. Surfside, Miami BeachThis sleepy little beach town was where the Hollywood elite hung out in the 1930s, and it now hosts community picnics on the sand and street food trucks on the third Thursday of every month. The restaurants in town represent Miami’s melting pot of cultures, from the duck fat matzo ball soup at Josh’s Deli to the spaghetti at Cafe Ragazzi. The Grand Beach Hotel Surfside has a rooftop pool with sunset views, and suites where the coast is so close you could reach out and build a sandcastle.Stop 2: San Diego, California With its year-round sunshine and more than 70 miles of beaches, the southernmost tip of California is just a five-hour flight from Miami with American Airlines. Swim, surf, sunbathe or just soak up some southern-Californian vibes.La Jolla CoveTucked between sandstone cliffs, this white sand gem gives way to a deep aquamarine bay, where snorkellers and scuba ers can explore sea caves, underwater canyons and more marine life than a Nemo movie – the area is protected by the San Diego La Jolla underwater park ecological reserve. Just north of the cove is La Jolla proper, a mile-long stretch of sand known for its gentle breaks, making it an ideal beach for learning how to surf or stand-up paddleboard (also known as Sup). CoronadoThis dreamy stretch of sand at the tip of the peninsula is regularly featured on the best beaches in the US lists. The Hotel del Coronado (“The Del”) is the ultimate wooden beach house – with fairytale turrets, and was the setting for Some Like It Hot, filmed there in 1958. If some like it cooler, you can always take a break from the glorious sunshine by strolling down to the boutique shops, galleries and museum on Orange Avenue.Pacific BeachWhether at a beachside bonfire or in one of the many bars and clubs, “PB” is where San Diego’s surfer dudes and students hang out. The boardwalk is full of rollerbladers and skateboarders, and there are more restaurants and bars here than you can shake your surf wax at. Kono’s Cafe is a brunch institution, and SandBar claims to have the best fish tacos in San Diego (and recently won second place for the best fish tacos in the whole of California) – which is saying something.Stop 3: Los Angeles, CaliforniaRenting a car from Avis and driving two hours up the coast on the legendary Pacific Coast Highway to Los Angeles rewards roadtrippers with beautiful beach stop-offs along the way. Explore the upscale areas of Laguna and Newport Beach (all your fantasies of The OC brought to life) and don’t miss Crystal Cove, where Beaches was filmed in 1988, to get you in the mood for La La Land.Venice BeachFrom the Arnie-alikes pumping iron at Muscle Beach and the acrobatical break dancers, to the influencers posing for selfies in front of street art – there’s never a dull moment in Venice Beach. And despite tech companies such as Snapchat moving to town, the area’s bohemian, eclectic vibe remains as distinctive and enthralling as the smell of incense on the boardwalk. Stay in nearby Santa Monica at the stylish Shutters on the Beach, which has a copy of Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea in every room.Manhattan BeachLess than five miles south of LAX airport, Manhattan Beach has two miles of beaches with sand so fine that developers exported it to Waikiki Beach in the 1920s. Perfect your spike at the volleyball nets, or stroll down the wooden pier to check out the free aquarium. Grab lunch at the seafood shack Fishing With Dynamite – it’s delicious.MalibuThis area is known for A-list homes and some of the finest beaches in LA. Head to Zuma Beach for a surf lesson from Malibu Makos Surf Club or go outdoor rock climbing on the bluffs with Rock N Rope Adventures. Make a reservation to tour the Eames House, Charles and Ray’s home, or just sit and watch the seals and dolphins from Point Dume.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6ccb0223a80e7ec1baf93ac35a222e693ae87f1/0_0_5600_3362/master/5600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95b13522b048658e5e37328576103cce","title":"deep south sounds the ultimate music geeks playlist","story":"Take an aural trip through the southern states of the US – arguably the birthplace of country, rock‘n’roll, jazz and blues – and you’ll be hankering to visit the south for realA musical journey through the deep south is a melodious thing, and I should know – I did a trip there myself with a newly acquired husband, seven years ago, for our amazing honeymoon. How lucky we were. The music of Louisiana, Tennessee and Georgia provides an incredible trip through the rich history of the US, exploring the way Americans express themselves through jazz, soul, country, pop and blues. Even though I’m now an old married soul, these tunes still resound loudly in my life, and I want to jump on a plane every time I hear them.We start with a blast in New Orleans, and the life-affirming noise of the brilliant Rebirth Brass Band. They’ve been mixing jazz, hip-hop and funk with the city’s centuries-old second line tradition (of brass band music at funeral parades) since 1983. Catch them at their regular haunt, the Maple Leaf, as I did, and you won’t be disappointed. Then we head to Nashville, to meet country’s first huge star, Kitty Wells with It Wasn’t God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels – the genre’s first No 1 single, in 1952. She laid the groundwork for later Nashville-made stars such as Dolly Parton, Carrie Underwood and Taylor Swift, and her lyrics are impressively forthright to boot: “Too many times married men think they’re still single,” she burrs.The first ever rock‘n’roll song was also made in Tennessee, down the Interstate 40 in Memphis. Rocket 88 was credited to Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats, but the band were actually Ike Turner’s (who the world would know more of later). Their song jangles and shudders like the promise of a new dawn. The first song about rock‘n’roll fame came from the south too – enter Louisiana boy Johnny B Goode. He lives “among the evergreens”, Chuck Berry tells us, and plays his guitar down by the railroad track his mum says someday he’ll be the leader of “a big old band”, and the song’s still so thrilling, you believe her. A few years later, a white boy from Tupelo came to Memphis too soon after, Elvis Presley was a worldwide sensation. Memphis, Tennessee is about a longing for home that has a sad twist in its tale, but the tune has a wiggle in its hips, as do Presley’s vocals. Staying in Memphis with Stax Records – one of America’s most supreme soul labels – it’s Sam and Dave, and what is arguably the greatest song they ever released, Soul Man.A quick dash across states follows, with Ray Charles and Georgia On My Mind. His 1960 single is even more moving when you realise he’s talking about his home (although the 1930 original was written by Hoagy Carmichael and Stuart Gorrell about Carmichael’s sister, Georgia). The south can be intriguingly rural too. Georgia boys R.E.M. made Automatic for the People in New Orleans, and their gorgeous instrumental named after the city is full of Louisiana’s heady strangeness. Then we zip back to their old friends, the B-52s, “heading down the Atlanta highway” to find their Love Shack. A party spirit thrives on open roads of the south, and it’s here in spades – and in squeals.Next, we venture into downtown Atlanta, where so many rappers made their names. Elevators (Me \u0026amp You) tells the story of how Outkast made it in the city, years before international fame hit with Hey Ya! Another tale of how the south leaves you wanting more, Tennessee Song, comes from contemporary country star Margo Price, who’s signed to Jack White’s Third Eye Records in Nashville. We finish our journey with one of today’s greatest pop stars, Atlanta’s Janelle Monae, who reminds us how America’s rock‘n’roll spirit lives on in our time. Play all these songs loud. You’ll probably fall in love too.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54c1773a736fe85e70414c223b51dbb0ddda64fa/0_154_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d957f7cd179dcb836045d3bd71861792","title":"thousands from far right and berlins techno scene face off in rival rallies","story":"German police deployed to keep anti-immigration AfD group and counter-protesters apart and avoid clashesThousands of demonstrators for and against the far right have faced off in mass rival rallies in Berlin, where calls of “we are the people” were met with chants of “go away, Nazis” and techno music.Police officers were deployed on Sunday to keep groups apart and prevent clashes, as leftwing militants vowed to “sabotage” the march by the anti-immigrant, anti-Islam Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.On Twitter, Berlin police said they had to use pepper spray to stop demonstrators from trying to break down barriers separating the rallies at Berlin’s Leipziger square. They also announced bridge closures to avoid AfD demonstrators running into their opponents.The counter-demonstrations, organised under the banner “stop the hatred, stop the AfD”, were triggered by a call from the far-right party for its supporters to march in the capital “for the future of Germany”.According to the police, several thousand AfD supporters answered the call, assembling at Berlin’s main railway station shortly after midday, before making their way to the iconic Brandenburg Gate.Many of them were waving Germany’s black, red and gold flag and carrying blue balloons, the colour of the AfD.Their chants of “Merkel must go” and “we are the people” were occasionally drowned out by whistles, jeers and outstretched middle fingers from counter-demonstrators in side streets cordoned off by rows of police. The AfD march marks the first public show of strength by the far-right group since it became the largest opposition party.Leading AfD figures Jörg Meuthen and Alexander Gauland, who regularly rail against chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision to let in large numbers of mainly Muslim refugees at the height of Europe’s migrant crisis, were expected to address the crowds.After initially predicting 10,000 AfD supporters would show up, organisers later said they would be happy with a turnout of 5,000.But thousands also joined the main counter-protest, staged by an alliance of political parties, unions, student bodies, migrant advocates and civil society organisations.Walking under a hot Berlin sun, supporters waved rainbow flags and carried banners with messages such as “no to racism” and “go away, Nazis”, while chanting “the whole of Berlin is against the AfD”.One of the loudest counter-demonstrations was organised by some 100 clubs from Berlin’s legendary techno scene, who were using boats and floats on the River Spree and a convoy of DJ-carrying trucks to “bass away” the AfD.“The Berlin club culture is everything that Nazis are not,” the group said in a statement. “We are progressive, queer, feminist, anti-racist, inclusive, colourful and we have unicorns.”Although the vast majority of counter-demonstrations were expected to be peaceful, members of the far-left ntifa movement had on their website called for “chaos”, urging sympathisers “to sabotage the AfD rally using all necessary means”.Berlin police have deployed 2,000 officers, drafted in from across Germany, to keep the peace.Founded in 2013 as an anti-euro party, the AfD rose to prominence by capitalising on widespread anger over the arrival of over one million asylum seekers in Germany since 2015.It now holds more than 90 seats in the Bundestag where its presence has changed the tone of debate.This month, AfD co-leader Alice Weidel earned herself a formal rebuke from the parliamentary speaker for describing immigrants as “headscarf girls, welfare-claiming, knife-wielding men and other good-for-nothings”.Merkel’s left-right coalition government has responded to the AfD’s rise by tightening asylum policies, but the party continues to climb in opinion polls."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/976c2bbc132a348fba2cdc30b647ce8a86aab07e/0_3_2491_1495/master/2491.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e05e9b0831cf258f018487bc995f58a7","title":"colombia presidential elections ivan duque gustavo petro runoff","story":"Iván Duque, a fierce critic of the peace accord, will face-off against former mayor of Bogotá Gustavo Petro in second roundColombians have failed to elect a president outright, setting the stage for a bitter runoff between two frontrunners from opposite ends of the political spectrum, while a peace process with leftist rebels hangs in the balance.While voters were united in their distrust of establishment politicians, the campaign highlighted increasing polarisation, with Duque campaigning on a platform of market-friendly economics and Petro criticising the multinational mining companies that operate in the country.Some voters were also worried that with a leftist at the helm could mean their country follows neighbouring Venezuela toward economic ruin – a crisis that has caused more than a million Venezuelans to flee to Colombia. Petro was once a vocal supporter of Hugo Chávez, the late Venezuelan president whom many blame for that country’s woes.Sunday’s vote took on extra significance, marking the first presidential elections since a peace deal was reached between the government and leftist rebel group the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (or Farc). That deal formally ended five decades of war that left 220,000 dead and 7 million displaced but failed to win over voters who in late 2016 rejected the deal in a referendum. The peace process was the initiative of outgoing president, Juan Manuel Santos, who won the Nobel peace prize for his achievement.Though the deal was amended and ratified in congress, promises of softer sentencing for rebels and guaranteed seats in congress proved a step too far for many Colombians who saw Sunday’s vote as a second referendum.Duque – now the clear favourite to take the presidency in June – is opposed to the peace deal. His mentor and ally, former president Álvaro Uribe, remains a powerful figure in Colombian politics, having long been fiercely critical of the peace process.Petro once belonged to the long-defunct M-19 guerrilla group and supports the deal. But unless he can convince more moderates to swell his movement, his chances of winning next month are remote.Election day began in a leaden mood beneath a leaden sky, with Santos casting his vote in the courtyard of Bogotá’s magnificent neoclassical Congress building, and addressing reporters. “These are the best-attended elections ever,” he said, “in a country closer to peace than it has ever been.”He was followed, according to tradition, by his predecessor Uribe – whom Santos once served as defence minister but who has become his nemesis. Uribe placed his ballot paper and said: “I have voted for Iván Duque, because of his preparation for office, and his programme for security and respect for the law.” Soon afterwards, in the Asunción district on the edge of his electoral fortress in desperately poor barrios in the south of the city, Gustavo Petro arrived, pressing through crowds of supporters, to vote at the San Lucas school, converted to accommodate polling booths. “Uribe, can you hear us? Petro for president!” they chanted, and: “Gustavo, friend, the people are with you!” The candidate moved through his throng to the booth, accompanied by his daughter Antonella who was wearing the yellow colours of Colombia’s football team. “The future of all our sons and daughters depends on who wins this,” he said. “The more people vote, the more free citizens we will have. I promise a humane Colombia We will improve health and education, challenge corruption and pursue peace.” Duque had earlier voted at the National Institute of Pedagogy, as though to demonstrate the bitter polarisation in this country, proceeding to hear midday Mass at Our Lady of Lourdes church in the historic Chapinero district, where his well-heeled supporters packed the aisles. Duque was whisked in via a rear entrance by his armoured convoy, taking a front pew with his wife, Beatriz. A benediction was sung – bizarrely – to the tune of The Beatles Hey Jude and while the audience sat, upright, Duque lowered his head in prayer, before falling – while others stood – to his knees.The peace accord has had a rocky ride in the run-up to this decisive moment. Clause one commits a government to “integrated rural reform”, while clause four demands the voluntary and enforced eradication, and substitution of coca. Both have met with ferocious opposition: 160 indigenous and land rights leaders have been assassinated, and war rages over coca production between government forces and a mesh of mafia interests and Farc dissidents and other criminal syndicates connected to big landowners. The worst violence is in the Tumaco region on the Pacific coast, the most intensive – and contested – coca-growing region in the world. Duque has consistently refused to uphold both clauses, while Petro and Fajardo are committed to continuing the peace process.A final televised debate on Friday night focused almost entirely on the accord. Duque said it had “bamboozled the Colombians”, while Petro insisted: “The peace is not a problem of negotiation with the guerrillas, but an agreement with society to live without violence.” In a debate the previous evening, Fajardo said, aiming at Duque: “That would be a bad thing: a president who does not want peace.” Out in the countryside, the tension has been palpable. Carlos Castilla is one of those working on the front line of the accord’s implementation, for a ision of the agriculture ministry, helping coca growers substitute their crop with licit alternatives. “Peace”, he said, in the tropical wilderness around Tumaco, “is not something you just sign, it is something you build.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3510325.1527434014!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"parents to be surveyed on demand for non catholic schools","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Minister for Education Richard Bruton: this new process has ‘the potential to change the course of education in Ireland by providing a system which reflects the changing needs of families’. Photograph: Dara Mac Donaill  The Parents are to be polled over the coming weeks on whether they want multi-denominational patrons to take over the running of Catholic schools.The move forms part of a plan by Minister for Education Richard Bruton aimed at boosting choice for parents on where they send their children to school.At present, about 90 per cent of the State’s 3,300 primary schools remain under the patronage of the Catholic Church. However, demand for non-denominational schools – such as those run by Educate Together – has been growing strongly in recent years.Mr Bruton will announce on Monday that parents of pre-school children in 16 areas across the country will be surveyed on their school preferences.Census data has been used to identify areas where there is most likely to be a demand for multi-denominational or non-denominational schools.Efforts to est schools of Catholic patronage and provide greater choice for parents have proven slow and isive to date.For example, only 10 schools were ested from Catholic patronage under an ambitious plan launched six years ago aimed at expanding choice for parents.A revised plan drawn up by Mr Bruton last year differs by providing for the State to lease buildings from the church and to provide for “live transfers” of schools. It remains to be seen whether this will prove any more successful.The areas to be surveyed include: part of Dublin 1 Skerries, Co Dublin Bray, Co Wicklow Athlone, Co Westmeath Tullow, Co Carlow Kinsale, Co Cork LaytownBettystownMorningtonDonacarney, Co Meath Athenry, Co Galway KenmareSneem, Co Kerry Claremorris, Co Mayo BallybofeyStranorlar, Co Donegal Ennis, Co Clare Roscrea, Co Tipperary Waterford city Carrickmacross, Co Monaghan and Edenderry, Co Offaly.A second round of town selections and surveys of pre-school parents will be organised when the outcomes of the initial round of pilot surveys have been assessed.The surveys will be conducted by city and county childcare committees on behalf of the relevant Education and Training Board.Parents will have two weeks in which to complete the surveys, and all surveys are due to be completed by mid-June 2018.The survey results will form the basis of discussions with the patron body or landowner in the area – the Catholic Bishop in most cases – concerning the transfer of patronage of an existing school to meet that demand. The response by the landowner or patron to demand for greater ersity will be included in the report prepared by the Education and Training Board.Mr Bruton said he believed this new process had “the potential to change the course of education in Ireland by providing a system which reflects the changing needs of families”.He added: “I urge all parties to engage in this process constructively, with a view to reaching solutions that achieve the wishes of all involved.”Following the publication of the first round of reports, there will be consultation with local school communities over the transfer of patronage of an existing school to a new multi- or non-denominational patron.Mr Bruton said identification of a new patron must reflect the wishes of parents and of the school community. “In each case, I believe that the best way to achieve this will be to hold a public meeting where each prospective patron can make their case to the school community, followed by a vote of all parents within that school community .Mr Bruton acknowledged that many denominational schools welcomed children of all beliefs and none. However, he said more ersity was needed to meet the changing needs of our population.“The new process will draw on the lessons from the previous model, such as the importance of live transfers and the downsides of having to await closures or amalgamations,” he said.He also announced that an “early movers” provision would enable school communities which had already decided to seek a transfer of patronage – independent of the survey process – to request their existing patron to apply to the Minister for a direct transfer of patronage.It is understood that a number of schools are considering transfers of patronage under this “early movers” provision of the schools’ reconfiguration process."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3510539.1527445504!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin city centre to get 800 solar powered bins","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOne of the Big Belly bins in Dalkey, Co Dublin. Photograph: Cyril Byrne  THE IRISH TIMES Dublin city centre is to get 800 solar-powered “compactor” bins, which could reduce the number of on-street rubbish bins by 20 per cent, according to Dublin City Council. Irish firm Kyron Street was awarded the contract to provide the smart bins, which have real-time information to tell waste collectors when the bin is full, and cut down on unnecessary collection runs. The contract is worth €2 million, excluding VAT, according to a tender award notice recently published by the local authority. The bins have compactor technology to crush rubbish, which means they can hold significantly more waste than ordinary litter bins. Currently there are more than 3,500 bins across the Dublin City Council area, with about 1,200 bins in the city centre. The local authority estimates by installing the solar-powered bins in place of regular litter bins, the number of on-street bins needed can be reduced by about 20 per cent. Kyron is an Irish supplier of Big Belly bins, a United States firm which developed the solar-powered compactor bins. Don Coughlan set up the company in 2010, to market the waste bins in the Irish market. Previously, Kyron supplied Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council with 400 of the solar-powered bins in 2014, at a cost of €2.3 million. Trinity College Dublin is another client that has installed the solar-powered bins. The smart technology in the bins runs on a rechargeable battery, that is powered entirely by solar panels. The contract is part of a push to bring in smarter technology across the four Dublin local authorities, under the “Smart Dublin” project. The contract requirements stated the solar-powered bins should have scope to fit into other “innovation trials and joint research and development projects” the local authority runs. It outlined that these could include trials to collect footfall, air quality, noise and traffic management data. Dublin city Green Party councillor Ciarán Cuffe said the move was a “step in the right direction” by the local authority. “These bins alert staff when nearly full, which is great as we do have a problem with overflowing bins,” he said. Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council had to retrofit the bins with special brackets to reduce the size of their opening. The bins, which have a wider pull-down opening than regular litter bins, had been used by people illegally dumping their household rubbish."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Cheers and tears greeted the verdict \u0026ndash a just reward for decades fighting the good fightOne woman was told by garda he would be too embarrassed to take her statementThe 2012 tragedy unified Irish women and feminist groups behind change on abortionMethod shown to be highly effective and safe when used up to 22 weeks of pregnancyUK must produce way of making backstop work that reflects December\u0026rsquos promisesEmails show department queried screening service\u0026rsquos view of Limerick woman\u0026rsquos actionLawyers highlight potential for \u0026lsquocyber staging\u0026rsquo evidence and social media problemsThe compactor technology means the smart bins can hold more than ordinary litter binsThe abortion issue has convulsed the country repeatedly since the 1983 referendumGeneral reason given for post-result support is they accept democratic will of the peopleFamilies sympathised \u0026lsquowith each other on tragic circumstances\u0026rsquo which led to two deathsLegislation unlikely to come before Oireachtas until the autumnProperty in Ballybofey sealed off as inquiry launched into death of James Devlin (35)Galway Buskers\u0026rsquo Community opposes law to prohibit amplification in city before 6pmPeople who took part in the Citizens\u0026rsquo Assembly describe how they feel after the repeal of the Eighth AmendmentAttack outside Waterford venue leaves man in critical condition with head injuries"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3510346.1527435312!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may told sidestepping backstop formula a non runner","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May: she  has been suggesting  that the customs provisions suggested in the backstop should be extended on a UK-wide basis to obviate the need for any separate treatment of Northern Ireland goods. Photograph: PA Wire Theresa May has strung herself and her government up on a DUP hook from which there is apparently no escaping. Short, that is, of telling the unionists she has no choice but to make a commitment to the possibility of customs controls on the Irish Sea to secure the greater objective of a frictionless border between North and South.Last week she was told by the EU in Brexit talks in no uncertain terms that her complex formula for sidestepping the “backstop” commitment she made in December – or, rather, reinterpreting it - is a complete non-runner. She must now go back to the drawing board and produce a new way of operationalising the backstop that reflects the uncomfortable promises made in December. This backstop ensures no ergence in customs and trade rules between the Republic and Northern Ireland in the event there is no agreed solutions on how to avoid a hard border. And she must do so fast as a June summit is looming. How she ever thought it would be a runner is not clear, as one senior EU official close to the talks admitted. “You are not the only one to be confused here,” he told this correspondent at a post-talks briefing. Mrs May has struggled with the reality that in December, in order to demonstrate “sufficient progress” and see talks move on to their next stage, the backstop commitment was conceded as a guaranteed fallback to the EU for the Withdrawal Agreement in case longer-term talks failed to produce a borderless EU-UK trade deal. It is now enshrined in draft, unagreed form in a special protocol to the Withdrawal Agreement.Under pressure from unionists opposed to controls on the Irish Sea – inevitable if Northern Ireland is treated as a separate case – Mrs May has delayed and fudged in the Northern Ireland strand of talks in the hope that the guarantee might not be necessary. But the EU wants a firm legal commitment by June. And there is no sign of an alternative long-term solution yet.And May has been suggesting in recent weeks that the customs provisions suggested in the backstop should be extended on a UK-wide basis to obviate the need for any separate treatment of Northern Ireland goods. This would be on a strictly time-limited basis, she insisted, so that the UK’s ambitions to sign separate trade deals would not be unduly inhibited. Two problems: the time limit undoes the guarantee element of the backstop and the UK was only committing to the customs element of the backstop, not its full regulatory alignment. Absent the latter there can be no frictionless Border.The UK had refused to discuss the backstop issue in the Ireland talks strand last week, but, to the surprise of EU negotiators, sought to raise it in the “future relationship” discussions in another room. “We have not addressed these issues in the context in which they need to be addressed,” the EU official complained.“They did, however, in the beginning of the meeting on the future partnership,” he said, “refer to the fact that Mrs May remains determined to address the Irish Border issue through the overall EU-UK relationship.“They said that they are currently discussing only the customs dimension of the backstop and that they are looking at making that EU-UK-wide. At the same time they said that they recognise that the Article 50 agreement (Withdrawal Agreement) protocol could not set out the permanent long-term EU-UK customs relationship.” So was the official, he confessed. Progress can’t be made to the June “sufficient progress” talks yardstick unless, he insisted, “we have a recognition that the backstop has to be Northern Ireland-specific. And we do away with the fantasy that there is an all-UK solution to that.“And we need to have the recognition that regulatory alignment for Northern Ireland is the key to avoiding a border. “Progress at this stage seems elusive – substantive progress even more so.” The EU now awaits, within two weeks at most, an explanation in writing of how the agreed backstop will be operationalised and the legal language for it for the Withdrawal Agreement. Arlene Foster can expect an uncomfortable call from Downing Street.As for the longer term future relationship discussions on trade and customs, we are still awaiting a British position. These too require agreed text for October, a broad political outline to accompany the Withdrawal Treaty. On this time is also running out, and the UK will have to come off the fence soon.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day. The day when the intelligent, compassionate citizens of Ireland turned to the Catholic Church and the retreating fundamentalists and firmly said: “Thanks, but no thanks.

Faced with a free afternoon, I contacted my mother in Ireland – isn’t San Antonio where Aunty Trish lives?Trish Freeman was the last surviving sibling of nine brothers and sisters from Cullohill in Co Laois. She emigrated to the United States in the 1930s, joining a convent like many women of her generation.After a few phone calls I found myself at the University of the Incarnate Word on the outskirts of the city. This modern university campus also houses a retirement home, church and living quarters for older nuns and lay people who come to spend their final years.Walking in the door I was transported back to the convent schools of Ireland – the spotlessness, the hushed atmosphere of quiet industriousness, the faint rays of warm sunlight fanned out on the polished floor.Inside the dining hall, waiting patiently, was Aunty Trish, wearing an eye-catching colourful shirt, her hair neatly-coiffed. Now 98, she hadn’t changed much since I had seen her on her last visit to Ireland 17 years ago. \u0026nbspDespite being one of only two of my grandfather’s siblings to join a religious order, she had always somehow managed to be the most modern. She emailed us from Texas when the internet was in its early days, somehow insinuating to us that America – even for nuns – was a hipper place than Ireland in those pre-Celtic Tiger days.On her visits to Ireland she would swiftly do the rounds of the extended family, directly asking her nieces and nephews how their work and studies were going, displaying a unique mix of American directness and social snobbery that characterises a certain class of Irish nun.Now, in this quiet hall in San Antonio, we sat and talked. Though still able to move around on her zimmer frame, she had had a fall in recent months.But she still had her old spark.I explained to her that I was now living in Washington and writing about Donald Trump. “You’d want to watch him,” she shot back with a smile.Our talk turned to the past, to Ireland, to her life in the United States.Born in 1919, she left Ireland for America in 1936 at the age of 17. “We had such fun on that boat trip over,” she recalled in her distinctive Irish-American drawl, “but you know, we got into trouble for running around the boat. I mean, c’mon, it was crazy, we were only having some fun!” She told me that she was separated by the convent from her sister Bride when she arrived in America. “The thinking was that it wasn’t good to have two sisters together as we’d distract each other,” she says, raising her eyebrows with a sigh.But her life in America and in the convent was immensely fulfilling, she said. \u0026nbspShe began her career teaching first grade in St Louis, Missouri, then went on to Illinois, before moving to Texas where she rejoined Bride. Many of her students were Mexican immigrants, and she was passionate about the power of education. “Praise a child and they’ll give you the world,” she once said to my mother, who was training to be a teacher.I asked her had she any regrets about leaving Ireland. “Not at all,” she said definitively. “America gave me a wonderful life.”As we joined the other nuns for tea, the talk – like everywhere in the US – turned to Donald Trump. “He is simply dreadful,” said one sister, originally from Co Galway, as she poured the tea. Another nun, Dublin-born, spoke about Barack Obama. “He was such a kind, kind man. A man of compassion,” she said to sighs of agreement from her friends.As the sun began to set, we walked outside to a small cemetery. There, under the cool shade of a huge oak tree, lay the grave of Trish’s sister, Bride, my grandaunt who died in the 1960s. Stretching in neat, simple rows were the graves of dozens of Irish women, from Galway, Dublin, Kerry, Wexford. Looking out at the quiet, peaceful scene, I thought of those women lying so far from where they started out in life, departing an Ireland that now seems unrecognisable to a woman of my generation.Last week we got the call to say that Sr Trish had passed away, surrounded by her fellow sisters who had kept vigil through the night. She had not quite reached her 100th year, but like many Irish emigrants, she had made her own mark on America. She will be buried on Tuesday, her final resting place near the grave of her sister and friends, in the grounds of a San Antonio convent."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3510290.1527430966!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"maureen dowd united states of con artists is our modern reality","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS president Donald Trump: After winning by warning voters they were being suckered, he’s made them all suckers. Photograph: Chris Kleponis Con artists have always been slithering around. Huckleberry Finn tangled with flimflam men on Mississippi riverboats. There was a flirty snake-oil salesman in Oklahoma!  And Marian the Librarian fell in love with a charming charlatan, professor Harold Hill, in The Music Man.It was all part of an amusing American tradition of rapscallions doing their little side hustles. But now narcissistic con artists are dominating the main stage, soaring to great heights and spectacularly exploding. We have one running amok in the Oval. And we have one who finally turned himself in at a Tribeca police station Friday. Shakespeare in Love was good. But Harvey in handcuffs was great. Harvey Weinstein spent many years prosecuting his nefarious schemes against women before women ensured his prosecution.Elizabeth Holmes shot to fame as the youngest female self-made billionaire after she dropped out of Stanford at 19 and then founded the company that became Theranos. She claimed to have created an easier, cheaper way to do blood tests, just by pricking a finger, but then it turned out she was a literal bloodsucker, defrauding investors of $700 million on a nonexistent technology. As Maria Konnikova wrote in her book, The Confidence Game, “The whirlwind advance of technology heralds a new golden age of the grift. Cons thrive in times of transition and fast change” when we are losing the old ways and open to the unexpected.We are easy marks for faux Nigerian princes now, when chaos rules, the American identity wobbles, and technology is transforming our lives in awe-inspiring and awful ways. Trump voters allowed themselves to believe they had a successful billionaire who knew the art of the deal when he only knew the art of the con. They bought his seductive campaign narrative, that the system was rigged and corrupt and only he could fix it. After winning by warning voters they were being suckered, he’s made them all suckers.Those who ignored whispers about Weinstein’s grotesque behaviour burned to believe that Hollywood was more than juvenile comic-book movies, that it could still make classy, sophisticated films with great roles for mature actresses like Meryl Streep and Judi Dench. And despite tales of misogyny and sickening transgressions, they wanted to buy Harvey’s grand narrative, that he was a liberal feminist who could raise enough money to help elect the first woman president. With Holmes, people were longing for a young woman to break into the club of boy geniuses conjuring unicorns.She played to that, imitating Steve Jobs by wearing a black turtleneck and driving a car with no licence plate. She pitched a Jobs-like mythic story about her company, that it was not merely about making money, it was designed to be “the most important thing humanity has ever built.” High-minded elites like to scornfully say that Trump voters fell for his scam because they were ignorant and racist. But the high-minded elites fell for Holmes’s scam, even the fake deep authoritative voice she put on. Her board had George Shultz, Henry Kissinger, Jim Mattis and David Boies Rupert Murdoch and Robert Kraft were investors.“It’s a controversial thing to say now, but Holmes wowed all these older men and wrapped them around her finger with her charm and youth and good looks and cool vision,” says John Carreyrou, the Wall Street Journal reporter who broke the scam story and who wrote a book, Bad Blood, about it. Carreyrou says Silicon Valley has always had “a flimflam element” and a “fake it ‘til you make it” ethos, from the early 1980s, when it was selling vaporware (hardware or software that was more of a concept or work in progress than a workable reality).“We’ve been lionising and revering these young tech entrepreneurs, treating them not just like princes and princesses but like heroes and icons,” Carreyrou says. “Now that there’s a backlash to Silicon Valley, it will be interesting to see if we reconsider this view that just because you made a lot of money doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re a role model for boys and girls.”Jaron Lanier, the scientist and musician known as the father of virtual reality, has a new book out, Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now. He says the business plans of Facebook and Google have served to “elevate the role of the con artist to be central in society”.“Anytime people want to contact each other or have an awareness of each other, it can only be when it’s financed by a third party who wants to manipulate us, to change us in some way or affect how we vote or what we buy,” he says. “In the old days, to be in that unusual situation, you had to be in a cult or a volunteer in an experiment in a psychology building or be in an abusive relationship or at a bogus real estate seminar.“But now you just need to sign on to Facebook to find yourself in a behaviour modification loop, which is the con. And this may destroy our civilisation and even our species.”Lanier worries, now that tech has lost its halo, that there is nothing optimistic to replace it. “We don’t believe in government,” he says. “A lot of people are pissed at media. They don’t like education. People who used to think the FBI was good now think it’s terrible. With all of these institutions the subject of ridicule, there’s nothing – except Skinner boxes and con artists.”Read more about how and why Donald Trump\u0027s administration is sending shockwaves

resistant to climate change, pests and disease but also fortified with vital vitamins and minerals.The initiative could save the lives of hundreds of thousands of children who die each year from poor nutrition in developing countries as well as supplementing diets in the west.The Department for International Development (Dfid) has quietly invested more than £100m into breeding the new generation of super-crops which now stand poised to create what experts are calling a “second green revolution”.The crops include iron-rich beans that can withstand a 4 degree Celsius jump in temperature,

If we can reach our target of 1bn, then potentially it is the next biggest thingHowarth Bouis, a US economistImportantly, they have been created through traditional breeding techniques rather than being genetically modified which means they can be planted without waiting for regulatory approval.“The first green revolution reached at least one billion people and was a huge success. If we can reach our target of one billion, then potentially it is the next biggest thing,” said Howarth Bouis, a US economist whose organisation HarvestPlus has received £87.4m from Dfid to breed and distribute crop varieties fortified with Vitamin A, Iron and Zinc.About 30 million people – around six million households – have so far benefited from the new crops, primarily in Africa, but the aim is to reach one billion by 2030. A further six million farmers in Asia are using scuba rice but the aim is 18 million by 2028.Scientists believe that if they achieve the one billion target they will effectively halve the world’s estimated two billion suffering from what is known as “hidden hunger” or micronutrient malnutrition.The first green revolution, which occurred in the early to mid 1900s, won its instigator Norman Borlaug a Nobel Peace Prize and spawned disease-resistant, high-yielding wheat strains which are credited with saving 250 million lives worldwide.Agricultural breakthroughs trump medical innovations such as antibiotics and vaccinations for lives saved historically because food is so central to life.It is estimated one million children a year die from micronutrient malnutrition which leaves them prone to stunted growth, poor vision and illnesses and diseases that have the potential to become worldwide epidemics.Agronomist Norman Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 in recognition of his contributions to world peace through increasing food supplyThe new super-crops not only replicate the traits of the first green revolution in having higher yields but also have been – or are being – cross-bred further to incorporate genes that protect from disease, pests, floods, drought and heat.“Our centres are developing climate adaptive crops. Farmers like them not only because they are climate tolerant but also high yielding. We just need to get them into mainstream markets and piggy back on them with our vitamin strains,” said Bouis.For the “heat-beater” beans, a staple in Rwanda where the fortified varieties provide up to half a person’s recommended daily intake of iron, scientists in Colombia trawled a gene bank of 36,000 samples to find a Mexican strain capable of withstanding temperature rises expected over the next century due to climate change.Biofortification | Super-crops heralding the next green revolutionIt will not only safeguard the 50 per cent of land that would have been lost to farmers due to higher temperatures but could also open up new markets in tropical areas for the beans.“Even if they can only handle a three-degree rise, that would still limit the land lost to climate change to about 5 per cent,” said Steve Beebe, head of bean breeding for the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture.Scuba rice was created after scientists tracked down an Indian rice variety with a gene, SUB1A, which was activated when the plant was submerged. It was crossed with India’s top-selling, high-yielding Swarni rice to counter the annual loss of 4m tonnes of rice to flooding in India and Bangladesh, enough to feed 30m people.Dr Uma Shankar Singh, a director of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), said: “Sustaining productivity is the most important factor and we now have six million farmers cultivating 3 million hectares. At minimum it is adding 3 million tonnes of rice. We have also developed SUB1 varieties with salt, drought and stagnant flooding tolerance.”Biofortified beans in RwandaDfid is now the biggest funder of HarvestPlus, whose work into fortified crops was started in 2003. Nottingham University professor Martin Broadley, a research fellow with Dfid, said the genesis of the programme came from research showing how expensive and inefficient it was to deliver supplements or fortified processed foods like bread to rural areas.“Upfront investment in breeding iron, vitamin A and zinc dense crops is the most cost-effective way to improve nutrition compared with other approaches,” he said.According to the World Health Organization, every $10-$15 invested in, for example, the vitamin A rich orange sweet potato produces one extra year of good quality life per inidual..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}Upfront investment in breeding iron, vitamin A and zinc dense crops is the most cost-effective way to improve nutrition compared with other approachesProfessor Martin Broadley, Nottingham UniversityHarvestPlus deliberately spurned genetic modification in favour of natural methods. “If we’d invested our money in GM, they could have been left sitting on the shelf. Conventional breeding is not as powerful a science but at least we can do a lot of good with it without the blockages you have with transgenics,” said Bouis.Government agriculture centres and NGOs are supporting the distribution of the seeds. As it seeks to reach 1 billion, Dfid has put in an extra £4 million to get private seed producers to take up the “super-crops” and achieve the necessary increase in uptake.The roll-out of the seeds has been supported by promotions including a radio soap opera, My Children, in Uganda to advance the orange sweet potato, a rap song by Rwandan musicians to encourage use of iron-rich beans and Yellow Cassava, a Nollywood (Nigerian Hollywood) film highlighting the nutritional benefits of the vitamin A rich crop.Women clear wet mud alongside the bank of the river in Satkhira, Bangladesh. Bangladesh is one of the continental countries most vulnerable to climate change.At least 14 studies are being carried out to establish whether eating the fortified crops improve the health of the communities consuming them. The early results are encouraging.In Uganda, the orange sweet potato, taken up by 60 per cent of farms in the area studied, saw a significant increase in vitamin A uptake among families, a 9 per cent fall in those with low vitamin A and a drop of up to 19 per cent in diarrhoea among children.Children eating orange maize in Zambia saw improvements in their sight through increased vitamin A. Women given fortified beans in Rwanda reversed their iron deficiency, reducing anaemia. College students in Rwanda aged 17 to 25 who ate the beans scored significantly better in cognitive tests of memory and speed after just 18 weeks.Studies into whether eating fortified crops improves the health of the communities have yielded promising resultsA Dfid spokesman said: “Biofortification is highly cost-effective as it provides a single intervention which benefits both this generation and future generations to come. By providing farmers with seeds and planting material, they and their households can grow, sell and consume foods that are already vitamin-rich, with no need for additional supplements.“The crops remain high yielding and vitamin rich for future harvests. This compares with supplements which need to be repeated, or fortification which needs to be continuously added to food products.”More controversially, Dfid is backing one of a potential new generation of GM crops now closing in on market readiness. It is funding work on modifying plants’ photosynthetic efficiency so their water use is cut by 25 per cent by changing the expression of a single gene.A potential breakthrough has also emerged in Mozambique’s field trials of more water-efficient GM maize (WEMA). Early results suggest it is not only resistant to drought but also the devastating stem borer and fall army worm pests.Ohio State University scientists are working to create a GM “golden potato”, which would provide 42 per cent of a child’s daily vitamin A.By providing farmers with seeds and planting material, they and their households can grow, sell and consume foods that are vitamin-richUganda is trialling a “golden banana” high in vitamin A created by Australia’s Queensland University of Technology by inserting a gene from a Papua New Guinea banana into the commercially-successful Cavendish banana.It is named after William Cavendish, the sixth Duke of Devonshire, a passionate horticulturalist who developed it on his Derbyshire estate in the 19th century.Public and political scepticism, however, remains a major hurdle for GM. The salutary lesson on this is “golden rice”, a GM strain engineered to boost vitamin A. More than a decade after it was hailed as a potential game-changer, its progress to farmers’ fields has stalled in a blizzard of regulation and public opposition.If the next green revolution is to come, harnessing nature rather than genetically modifying it may prove to be quickest and most efficient route.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security \u0026#39Pay-as-you-go\u0026#39 bin scheme \u0026#39could leave households £50 a year worse off\u0026#39 Butchers \u0026#39living in fear\u0026#39 as vegan attacks on the rise, says Countryside AllianceFlash floods close roads in Birmingham Lords’ Speaker adds support to call for John Bercow bullying investigationItaly\u0026#39s populist parties vent their fury as attempt to form a government collapses over choice of staunchly anti-euro economistPatrick Melrose, episode 3 review: a frothy game of existential CluedoA Very English Scandal, episode two, review: Ben Whishaw is a delight in this raucous adapation of the Thorpe affairNHS needs extra funds for a \u0026#39technological revolution\u0026#39 in order to survive, Jeremy Hunt saysAmbitious trade deals won\u0026#39t be possible if UK stays in version of customs union, Boris Johnson warnsYoung girl rescued after she drifted out to sea on an inflatable unicornKnives are too sharp and filing them down is solution to soaring violent crime, judge saysDog-owner is both victim and defendant in her own trial as she is fined for being injured by her own petCountryfile Royal Special was something of an eye-opener about the Queen and what she does for the country, reviewHunters wage war on Burmese pythons in Florida EvergladesIn Mosul, the library that Isil torched rises slowly from the ashesTheresa May under pressure to change abortion law in Northern Ireland after Irish yes voteDentist forced to pay £17,000 after failing to spot decay in grandmother\u0026#39s teethIsrael starts building fortified maritime barrier on coastal border with GazaSocial media killed the stag do: Men \u0026#39no longer enjoy debauchery for fear of damaging career or relationship\u0026#39Sainsbury\u0026#39s customers \u0026#39privacy compromised\u0026#39 as CCTV footage of PIN entries is broadcast in storesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"giant panda cub makes first appearance","story":"A giant panda cub has made her first public debut aged five-months-old.

team denies claims match fixing test against","story":"Aneel Munawar in undercover recordings The England cricket team has been forced to deny outrageous match-fixing claims after a documentary alleged that a Test match against India was rigged. In an unprecedented statement, the English Cricket Board (ECB) said that there is nothing we have seen that would make us doubt any of our players in any way whatsoever in the face of claims of spot fixing during the 2016 match in Chennai. Tom Harrison, Chief Executive Officer of the ECB, said that they had discussed the documentary claims with all of the players, adding: They emphatically deny the allegations, have stated categorically that the claims are false and they have our full support.“Neither ECB nor the International Cricket Council (ICC) is aware any credible evidence connecting any England players to any form of corruption.An undercover journalist, posing as a businessman looking to place bets on the match, filmed a match fixer claiming that he had three England players with whom he arranged spot fixes during the Test in 2016.Aneel Munawar, who is accused of working for organised crime syndicate D Company, was recorded boasting that he has been fixing matches for six or seven years and can fix up to 60 to 70 per-cent of matches with players in every team. I\u0027m telling you, each script I give you will happen, happen and happen, he said. Joe Root, England\u0026#39s Test Captain, described the allegations as \u0026#39ridiculous\u0026#39Just before the 2016 match began he called a middle-man working for the reporters to tell him how players would perform at certain points in the game. Though his predictions have not been revealed, Al Jazeera\u0027s documentary Cricket’s Match Fixers claimed that they were accurate. The England  players alleged to have been involved, who have not been named, told the documentary makers that they categorically deny allegations made by a source who is a known criminal.The fixers were also caught discussing  plans to rig the outcome of England’s first Test in Sri Lanka, scheduled to begin on November 6, by doctoring the pitch to make it impossible for the contest to end in a draw.Tharange Indika, a groundsman at Galle International Stadium, was suspended by the Executive Committee of Sri Lanka Cricket whilst investigations take place. He denies all allegations against him.\u0027Spot fixing\u0027, which hit the headlines eight years ago when three Pakistan players were jailed over the practice in one of the sport\u0027s biggest scams, has become increasingly common in recent years as it is much harder to detect than throwing an entire match and provides more opportunity for bets. One former international cricketer previously accused of match fixing, whose identity was concealed, told Al Jazeera: They give them expensive gifts, like  Rolex watches. They give them houses, flats, cars.They send beautiful girls to the players, like models, so they get involved with them.He claimed that cheating players could earn up to £200,000 a game and were trapped into fixing matches. Joe Root, England\u0027s Test Captain, described the allegations against his team as ridiculous. I am aware that there is a documentary and it is outrageous that our players have been accused. All the players have the full backing of the ECB, he told a press conference. He said that they are concentrating on the cricket ahead of the second Test against Pakistan after losing Sunday\u0027s first Test, adding: “All the players have been briefed by the ECB, and been told there\u0027s absolutely nothing to worry about.Similar claims have been made against two Australian players in relation to their match against India at Ranchi in March 2017. Cricket bosses there have issued an equally vociferous denials. The ICC has launched an investigation into the claims made by the documentary, saying that it takes them very seriously.Repeated requests for disclosure of full evidence from the 18 month investigation have not yet been complied with, the governing body said. Munawar has declined to comment since undercover reporters revealed their identity. \u0026#39Pay-as-you-go\u0026#39 bin scheme \u0026#39could leave households £50 a year worse off\u0026#39 Butchers \u0026#39living in fear\u0026#39 as vegan attacks on the rise, says Countryside AllianceFlash floods close roads in Birmingham Lords’ Speaker adds support to call for John Bercow bullying investigationItaly\u0026#39s populist parties vent their fury as attempt to form a government collapses over choice of staunchly anti-euro economistA Very English Scandal, episode two, review: Ben Whishaw is a delight in this raucous adapation of the Thorpe affairPatrick Melrose, episode 3 review: a frothy game of existential CluedoNHS needs extra funds for a \u0026#39technological revolution\u0026#39 in order to survive, Jeremy Hunt saysAmbitious trade deals won\u0026#39t be possible if UK stays in version of customs union, Boris Johnson warnsYoung girl rescued after she drifted out to sea on an inflatable unicornKnives are too sharp and filing them down is solution to soaring violent crime, judge saysDog-owner is both victim and defendant in her own trial as she is fined for being injured by her own petCountryfile Royal Special was something of an eye-opener about the Queen and what she does for the country, reviewHunters wage war on Burmese pythons in Florida EvergladesIn Mosul, the library that Isil torched rises slowly from the ashesTheresa May under pressure to change abortion law in Northern Ireland after Irish yes voteDentist forced to pay £17,000 after failing to spot decay in grandmother\u0026#39s teethIsrael starts building fortified maritime barrier on coastal border with GazaSocial media killed the stag do: Men \u0026#39no longer enjoy debauchery for fear of damaging career or relationship\u0026#39Sainsbury\u0026#39s customers \u0026#39privacy compromised\u0026#39 as CCTV footage of PIN entries is broadcast in storesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/27/TELEMMGLPICT000164689909_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"hailstones size pigeon eggs devastate bordeaux vineyards","story":"A violent storm left vines damaged and without leaves in this vineyard in Macau, near Bordeaux Hailstorms have devastated thousands of acres of prime Bordeaux vineyards, prompting the French government to promise support for winegrowers, some of whom have lost their entire crop.Cyril Giresse, a winegrower, said hailstones “the size of pigeons’ eggs” destroyed grape buds and left vines bare on Saturday.“The storm lasted only about 15 minutes, but in some places, there’s nothing left at all,” said Mr Giresse, who runs the Château Gravettes Samonac in Bordeaux’s Côtes de Bourg appellation. “No leaves, no grapes, just the vines stripped as if the grapes had all been picked.”Jean-Dominique Château, another claret producer, said: “I’ve got nothing left. I’ve been growing grapes for 33 years and this is the worst storm I’ve ever seen. Last year we lost 40 per cent of our crop to hail but this year it’s going to be an even worse disaster.”A series of storms in the Bordeaux region has ruined dozens of vineyardsStéphane Travert, the agriculture minister, said the government was assessing the extent of losses and would aid wine producers. “We’ll take the necessary measures and we’re ready to meet Bordeaux winemakers,” he said.Franck Jullion, the head of the producers’ association in the “Blaye Côtes de Bordeaux” appellation, said: “It’s a desolate vista, as if the vines had gone back to winter. Estates hit by frost last year will not recover.

President Emmanuel Macron has backed them, saying he drinks wine at lunch and dinner. He has infuriated doctors by minimising public health concerns over wine and arguing that spirits and beer pose more of a problem because they are favoured by binge-drinkers.Please review our commenting policy\u0026#39Pay-as-you-go\u0026#39 bin scheme \u0026#39could leave households £50 a year worse off\u0026#39 Butchers \u0026#39living in fear\u0026#39 as vegan attacks on the rise, says Countryside AllianceFlash floods close roads in Birmingham Lords’ Speaker adds support to call for John Bercow bullying investigationItaly\u0026#39s populist parties vent their fury as attempt to form a government collapses over choice of staunchly anti-euro economistA Very English Scandal, episode two, review: Ben Whishaw is a delight in this raucous adapation of the Thorpe affairPatrick Melrose, episode 3 review: a frothy game of existential CluedoNHS needs extra funds for a \u0026#39technological revolution\u0026#39 in order to survive, Jeremy Hunt saysAmbitious trade deals won\u0026#39t be possible if UK stays in version of customs union, Boris Johnson warnsYoung girl rescued after she drifted out to sea on an inflatable unicornKnives are too sharp and filing them down is solution to soaring violent crime, judge saysDog-owner is both victim and defendant in her own trial as she is fined for being injured by her own petCountryfile Royal Special was something of an eye-opener about the Queen and what she does for the country, reviewHunters wage war on Burmese pythons in Florida EvergladesIn Mosul, the library that Isil torched rises slowly from the ashesTheresa May under pressure to change abortion law in Northern Ireland after Irish yes voteDentist forced to pay £17,000 after failing to spot decay in grandmother\u0026#39s teethIsrael starts building fortified maritime barrier on coastal border with GazaSocial media killed the stag do: Men \u0026#39no longer enjoy debauchery for fear of damaging career or relationship\u0026#39Sainsbury\u0026#39s customers \u0026#39privacy compromised\u0026#39 as CCTV footage of PIN entries is broadcast in storesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/27/TELEMMGLPICT000161998163_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"mosul library isil torched rises slowly ashes","story":" A partially burned book lies on the floor in the Central Library at Mosul University, Iraq,Thumbing the pages of the stack of new textbooks on his desk, Mosul University’s director of libraries felt grateful for what they had but could not help but lament what was lost. The university’s Central Library once housed one of the most extensive collections of literature in the Middle East, and for 18 years Mohammed Jassim al-Hamdany had been its caretaker. But after the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) seized control of the Iraqi city in the summer of 2014, Moslawis found themselves without a library and Mr Hamdany without a job.Staff and students fled, fearing what was to come.

None made last year’s top 10. Customers praised the smells of Lush stores, the prices at discount cosmetics store Savers, and the staff at Smyths Toys, Which? said.The survey also asked shoppers what they liked about shopping in-store and found customers value being able to touch, feel and try on items before purchasing (82 per cent) and being able to ask staff questions (39 per cent).But customers said they were put off by crowds (49 per cent), queueing (49 per cent) and the behaviour of other shoppers (38 per cent).Ben Clissitt, Which? magazine editor, said: “It is clear that our traditional high street is changing and while this is bad news for some retailers who have struggled to adapt, others have seized the opportunity to make their mark.“Our findings show that if retailers can strike the right balance between good value, quality products and first-class customer service, shoppers will keep coming back to their stores.”WHSmith has been contacted for comment.The top and bottom rated stores for 2018, according to the Which? survey of 10,356 shoppers is as follows.

Is the adoption of other people\u0027s customs and cultures fair game or has political correctness gone mad?\u0026nbspDavid Barnett treads warily\u0026nbspLet’s get this out of the way: I am a straight, white, middle-aged man, so what follows you may take with a pinch of salt or disregard completely. But we’re going to talk, you and I, about the thorny issue of cultural appropriation.It was only a year ago that Oxford Dictionaries put the phrase into their official lexicons, with the definition, “the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society.”Cultural appropriation is sometimes so blatant it smacks us in the face. The Black and White Minstrel Show ran on British television for – what seems now to us, looking back at it – and astonishing 20 years, from 1958.Even halfway through its run the show, in which white entertainers “blacked up” to sing songs in a Deep South of America style, was the subject of petitions calling for it to be taken off the air because of its in-your-face racism. It can hardly be seen now without an overwhelming feeling of embarrassment. How did we ever think that was acceptable?The show was harking back to the minstrel shows in 19th-century America, and blackface was a popular form of entertainment until the enlightenment of the 1960s, coupled with rising racial tensions across the US, finally put paid to it. Even Al Jolson, dubbed “the world’s greatest entertainer”, was renowned for performing in blackface. Jolson was Jewish, and while there can never be any excuses made today for blacking up, it’s interesting that in their 2008 book the Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, authors Stephen Harlan Norwood and Eunice G Pollack talk of Jolson’s 1927 movie The Jazz Singer in terms which suggest some kind of what we would today call intersectionality. For example: “Is there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not…The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world\u0027s history.”Can a Jewish man really pretend to be a black man without racism? Is this cultural appropriation of the very worst kind or solidarity that only two historically subjugated peoples can appreciate? And what, then, of a Jewish woman who dresses up as a Japanese woman for entertainment?The cries of “cultural appropriation” were resounding around social media even before Netta Barzilai had finished her (ultimately competition-winning) performance of Toys, the Israeli entry in this month’s Eurovision song contest held in Lisbon.Netta wore a stylised kimono and was surrounded by dozens of maneki neko waving lucky cat statues. Twitter in particular was rather exercised by the thought of the cultural appropriation taking place before its very eyes. Or, I should say, mainly white Western Twitter. It seems the only people not too fussed were the Japanese themselves.According to the website soranews24, which repackages and discusses Japanese news stories for an English speaking audience, the overwhelming response on the ground seems to be a mildly nonplussed reaction.The site quoted from Japanese social media accounts which included the responses, “Culture is meant to be stolen. If it’s not worth stealing, then it isn’t culture”, “If people keep claiming ‘cultural appropriation’ then people will not touch our culture. Then, people will not understand our culture and it will be easier to become our enemy”, and, perhaps crucially, “Westerners care too much about silly things”.Is that the problem? Are we, Westerners, liberal Westerners, too over-sensitive of the feelings of others brought on by white guilt? Or are we right to call out what we think is wrong when we see it? Should we wait before speaking, to see what the actual people affected think? Or is it our duty to step in first?Perhaps it’s now we should go back to the Oxford Dictionaries definition of cultural appropriation, particularly the bit that talks about the “more dominant people or society”. Is Israel a more dominant culture than Japan? Or vice-versa? What do we think? What do they think?A couple of weeks before Eurovision, Eastern dress was setting Twitter alight again, this time when a Utah teenager posted online pictures of her wearing her prom dress which was actually a qipao, traditional Chinese dress. The 18-year-old was accused of cultural appropriation and casual racism. People of Chinese heritage chimed in with arguments on both sides of the debate, with some pointing out that the outfit was originally worn by women carrying out domestic duties, and thus not something to be really celebrated, and another writing, “I’m Asian and Chinese, you looked beautiful in that dress, I’m sorry you got bashed for it.”Cyprus\u0027 singer Eleni Foureira performs the song FuegoIsrael\u0027s singer Netta performs the song Toy Belgium\u0027s singer Sennek performs the song A Matter Of Time Estonia\u0027s singer Elina Nechayeva performs the song La ForzaCroatia\u0027s singer Franka performs the song Crazy Albania\u0027s singer Eugent Bushpepa performs the song MallCzech Republic\u0027s singer Mikolas Josef performs the song Lie To MeIreland\u0027s singer Ryan O\u0027Shaughnessy performs the song TogetherSwiss duo ZIBBZ\u0027s singer Corinne Gfeller performs the song StonesBulgarian group Equinox\u0027 singer Zhana Bergendorff (R) performs the song BonesLithuania\u0027s singer Ieva Zasimauskaite performs the song When We\u0027re OldFinland\u0027s singer Saara Aalto performs the song MonstersGreece\u0027s singer Yianna Terzi performs the song Oniro MouAustria\u0027s singer Cesar Sampson performs the song Nobody But YouAzerbaijan\u0027s singer Aisel performs the song X My HeartIceland\u0027s singer Ari Olafsson performs the song Our ChoiceArmenia\u0027s singer Sevak Khanagyan performs the song QamiMacedonian duo Eye Cue\u0027s lead vocalist Marija Ivanovska (R) and guitarist Bojan Trajkovski perform the song Lost And FoundBelarus\u0027 singer Alekseev performs the song ForeverNorway\u0027s singer Alexander Rybak performs the song That\u0027s How You Write A SongRomanian band The Humans perform the song GoodbyeSerbia\u0027s band Sanja Ilic \u0026amp Balkanika perform the song Nova DecaSan Marino\u0027s Jessika featuring Jenifer Brening perform the song Who We AreDenmark\u0027s singer Rasmussen performs the song Higher GroundPoland\u0027s singer Gromee feat.

The fashion shows routinely feature collections riffing off a range of global cultures. For the coming autumn, Gucci recently unveiled a series of headwear inspired by Sikh turbans. Vogue ran a photoshoot in its “Diversity Issue” last year with a model in full Japanese geisha outfit. Not unusual, and perhaps nothing wrong with it… save for in both cases (and in the Victoria’s Secret show last year in which a model flaunted a Native American-style headdress) all the models were white.Here’s where cultural appropriation smacks up against representation. Maybe if Victoria’s Secret had employed a Native American model, if Vogue had used a Japanese model, if Gucci had – as the Sikh Coalition suggested in the aftermath – used Sikh models who would have properly observed the correct way to wear what is, after all, a sacred clothing item, then the later dissemination of these items on to the high street might not be quite so problematic.There’s a difference, too, between fashion and performance. When I was very young, on a holiday at a Pontin’s camp on the North-West coast, I was wrapped in a blanket, had two stripes of lipstick put across my face, and a feather from a passing seagull taped to my head. I was entered into the fancy dress contest (I didn’t win). I was of course, a Red Indian, as Native Americans were called in those less-enlightened times.As bad as the Black and White Minstrels? Possibly. But “Red Indians” back then were almost a fictional, fairytale group of people, the image drawn from Monday matinee westerns not renowned for historical accuracy, from Peter Pan, from Hiawatha and Little Plum. Would I have dressed my children like that when they were the same age? Undoubtedly not. Times change. Sensitivities alter.Utah teenager, Keziah Daum, sparked a huge debate on Twitter about cultural appropriation after posting photos of her traditional Chinese prom dressAnd I look down at what I’m wearing right now as I type this. A T-shirt, which has its origins as an undergarment in 19th-century America. A pair of jeans, which were originally developed in Italy (Genoa, which gave rise to “jeans”) and France (the fabric of Nimes, or de Nimes, from which is derived “denim”). A pair of flip-flops (don’t judge me), evolved from the Japanese zōri which servicemen took back to America post-Second World War (though early flip-flops have been discovered in ancient Egyptian burial sites).I am a melange of styles borrowed, begged and stolen from around the world. Is this cultural appropriation, several generations down the line? Should I be wearing what my grandfathers wore? Polyester slacks and an Oxford shirt, a cardigan, brogues? Where is the line, and on which side of it are we?Music is another cultural appropriation battleground. Every time Katy Perry or Taylor Swift goes “ghetto” for another video, or Lana Del Ray puts on a Native American headdress, it’s there to see. White folks stole rock’n’roll from African rhythms filtered through the American South, we stole electronic dance music from the predominantly-black post-disco clubs of Chicago and Detroit, and Italy. Take away the cultural appropriation, and what’s left? A couple of rousing choruses of Knees Up, Mother Brown or The Lambeth Walk, perhaps.Should we talk about food? Those great British traditions such as pizza, or chow mein, or curry? A few miles from me, Bradford is awash with curry houses. The clientele is largely white. Is that cultural appropriation? Well, no, because most of the restaurants are owned and worked in by people of South Asian heritage. But what was deemed cultural appropriation was when, earlier this year, a restaurant called Fanny’s announced it was opening a venue for the purveying of “posh kebabs” in London’s Stoke Newington.The move was lambasted on Twitter because, for one, Stoke Newington is a hub for Turkish restaurants and takeaways… the people who, you know, invented the kebab. For another, because the people behind Fanny’s weren’t Turkish (one of the founders is called Claude Compton, for your information), and the tag-line “posh kebabs” intimated that these “lads from Fulham” were basically going to beat the Turks at their own game (as a side note, Fanny’s subsequently dropped the “posh” bit from their marketing and logo).Fanny\u0027s Kebabs finally dropped the \u0027posh\u0027 bit from their marketing (fannyskebabsInstagram)If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering where I’m heading with all this. And the honest answer is, I just don’t know. Cultural appropriation seems, on the face of it, like it should be something that all of us should fight against, but the flip-side of that is knowing exactly just what it is and when we should call it out.As I said at the top of this piece, take what I say with a pinch of salt, given that I am a middle-aged white man. But where does that leave me, if we remove years of embedded cultural appropriation? Dressed in my grandad’s clothes, listening to a 78 of George Formby classics, and clutching a chip butty? And on that score, should I be calling cultural appropriation on the New York magazine The Insider’s awestruck piece last month on a Turkish restaurant that was selling this remarkable new thing, a sandwich stuffed with fries?The answer’s no, of course, because cultural appropriation will never affect me in the way it does other, marginalised people. I have working-class roots but I’m still pretty close to the top of the privilege chain all I can realistically get away with is some faux outrage at posh kids slumming it at Wetherspoons and Greggs for Instagram likes.But maybe those who identify as white, liberal allies should hit the pause button before calling out cultural appropriation, and just take a moment to think. The obvious stuff, the outright horror of the Black and White Minstrels and the more subtle but by no means any less problematic racism, yes, by all means, dig in. Dog-piling on teenagers for wearing a prom dress, maybe hold off a bit.Cultural appropriation is a big desert, and one on which we might have to draw our own personal lines in the sand as to what we know in our guts is wrong, and what we think might be, possibly, a little bit off.And with that, I bid you sayonara.Black and White minstralsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In other cases vulnerable asylum seekers have been released onto the streets with no accommodation. One immigration law firm saying they were dealing with the problem on a daily basis.Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said the it was “cruel and callous” for the Home Office to hold asylum seekers with a right to live in the community in “prison style” removal centres, while Labour MP David Lammy said it was wrong to treat “innocent people like criminals”. It comes amid mounting criticism of the UK’s immigration detention system, which currently holds around 26,500 people each year and around 2,500 at any given time. Recent figures obtained by The Independent revealed at least one person a day needs medical treatment for self-harming in detention, while the prisons watchdog described conditions in the centres as “prison-like”.The government is already under intense scrutiny following the Windrush scandal, which revealed that Caribbean nationals who had lived in the UK for decades were wrongly detained in removal centres. As many as 5,000 Commonwealth citizens in Britain have since been identified as potentially having been deprived of their immigration rights.In January, the government repealed a law that had enabled homeless detainees to apply for accommodation from within detention if they had nowhere to reside when released. This meant around 2,000 detainees who previously applied for this support each year are no longer able to, according to charities.A separate accommodation provision is available for asylum seekers and failed asylum seekers if they would be destitute without it. But lawyers and groups working with detainees said this was difficult to obtain from within detention because they would fail the “destitution test”.One male asylum seeker was granted bail in March after spending 10 months in detention, but his application for asylum accommodation was rejected by the Home Office on the grounds that he was “not destitute by the fact that he is being housed and his dietary needs are catered to”.The refusal letter stated: “Detention is based around shared facilities (bedrooms, shower rooms and dining rooms) which is not dissimilar to emergency accommodation with lack of liberty being the main difference.”At least one person a day is self-harming in UK detention centresThe man’s grant of bail lapsed and he remained in detention.In another case, a man who came to the UK in 2003 after fleeing torture in his home country was granted bail in March on the condition that an address for accommodation would be provided by the Home Office.But the next day he was released with no address, and has since been relying on charities, asylum seekers and several iniduals of good will for support with housing and food.Toufique Hossain, director of public law at Duncan Lewis Solicitors, told The Independent his team was seeing the issue on a daily basis.“What we’re finding is that that Home Office is failing to provide accommodation in time. There are massive delays in them providing the accommodation, we’re talking months,” he said.“Immigration judges decide all the conditions are right for the person to be released and they direct the Home Office to provide accommodation. But then we’re seeing nothing.”Mr Hossain said that because the Home Office can’t be held in contempt of breaching a bail order, the department was often failing to act on providing accommodation unless the detainee issued unlawful detention proceedings.“If they’re fortunate enough to get a decent lawyer who will issue unlawful detention proceedings, they can get an order from the high court saying the Home Office must provide accommodation within a set period of time, and it does miraculously find accommodation,” he added.“They’re not prioritising it is because they’re immigrants, and it obviously costs money to provide accommodation.  In the meantime, people languish in detention at the cost to the taxpayer. The harm caused to people who have a legitimate right to be released is inexplicable.”Claire Sullivan, research and policy coordinator and charity Bail for Immigration Detainees (BID), said the vast majority of detainees the charity supports was no longer able to apply for accommodation support from the Home Office.Home Office keeping torture victims in detention, finds watchdog“As a consequence, many detainees are being indefinitely detained for no other reason than their lack of suitable accommodation. Others have been released by the Home Office to the streets, potentially into destitution,” she added.“As well as no application process, there is no appeal right for refusals to provide bail accommodation. Further, the Home Office does not provide reasons for refusals.”Jerome Phelps, director of charity Detention Action, accused the Home Officeof creating a “bureaucratic black hole” for people in detention.“People we work with are finding themselves detained in prison-like conditions indefinitely, with judges powerless to free them. Decisions by judges to order release become meaningless if the Home Office fails to provide the necessary address,” he said.“The lack of a time limit on detention makes it urgent that the department return to respecting the release decisions of the independent judiciary.”Responding to the findings, Ms Abbott said: “We have a legal and moral duty to treat refugees with fairness and humanity, but day after day we see just how cruel and callous the Tories’ hostile environment policy has become.“Detention centres with their prison-style security are not appropriate accommodation for asylum seekers that have been given the right to remain. This practice must end.”Mr Lammy echoed her view, saying: “It is totally wrong that the Home Office are holding asylum seekers in detention centres and treating innocent people like criminals.“The principle of habeas corpus is the founding principle of our legal system, and yet in 2018 the Home Office is unlawfully depriving people of their liberty. It is time for a review of the hostile environment policy that underpins this cruelty.”A Home Office spokesperson said it was aware of some cases of detainees waiting for accommodation to be allocated and that they were working closely with the accommodation providers, police and HM Prison and Probation Service to source suitable accommodation.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesChris Ashton of the Barbarians scores against England at Twickenham.

We want to make sure they are not only conserved, but enhanced for the next generation.” The review is to be led by Julian Glover, the former  journalist and chief speechwriter to the previous prime minister David Cameron. “Our protected landscapes are England’s finest gems and we owe a huge debt to past generations who had the wisdom to preserve them,” said Mr Glover.“The system they created has been a strength, but it faces challenges too. It is an honour to be asked to find ways to secure them for the future. I can’t wait to get started and learn from everyone who shares an interest in making England’s landscapes beautiful, erse and successful.” Defra said the review will not consider weakening or undermining the current scope of the National Parks or their existing protections.“Undertaking a review is one of the key commitments of the government’s 25 Year Environment Plan, which outlines our vision for improving the environment over a generation by connecting people with nature and helping wildlife to thrive,” it said.The review was welcomed by both National Parks England and the National Association of AONBs.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesChris Ashton of the Barbarians scores against England at Twickenham.

Brussels’ decision to kick the UK out of the scheme was angrily denounced by ministers, with Philip Hammond, the chancellor, vowing to launch a separate satellite initiative if the EU refuses to back down.Tensions were already running high following days of strained negotiations in Brussels, during which one senior EU source described the UK’s demands as “fantasy”. Mr Hammond dismissed that remark as “not helpful”.Speaking at a legal conference in Lisbon, Mr Barnier noted the importance of agreeing how the relationship between the UK and the EU will be governed once Britain leaves the bloc.He said: “We have probably made a lot of progress on the substance of the withdrawal agreement, but without effective governance, these gains will be of limited value.“Because without agreement on governance, and without an agreement on Ireland and Northern Ireland, there will be no withdrawal agreement, and therefore no transition period.“The United Kingdom is well aware that our citizens and businesses, on both sides of the Channel, need legal certainty.”Brexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUBrexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUA key point in the negotiations remains Britain\u0027s access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union. Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does?\u0026#13Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026#13Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit.\u0026#13The Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear.\u0026#13Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU.\u0026#13The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London.\u0026#13Banks in the UK will be hit hard regardless of the Brexit outcome. The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.\u0026#13Hinting at continued frustration in Brussels over a perceived lack of detail in the UK’s negotiating demands, Mr Barnier urged ministers to be more “realistic” and warned them against playing a ‘blame game” with the EU.He said: “We also want an ambitious partnership with the United Kingdom in the long term. But to achieve this, we need realistic proposals from the UK – proposals that respect the institutional architecture and the integrity of the European Union.“I can see the temptation of the blame game to bring the negative consequences of Brexit on the European Union. But we will not be impressed. I will not be impressed.”He added: “For the economy, for foreign policy, the best way to influence the decisions of the European Union is to be in the European Union. The United Kingdom wants to leave. It’s its decision. Not ours. And that has consequences.“The United Kingdom must look at the reality of the European Union in the face. It must also face the reality of Brexit.”Michel Barnier says a solution must be found to avoid a hard border in Northern IrelandThe EU and the UK are at loggerheads over how disputes will be settled after Brexit. Britain wants to establish a joint committee, with members appointed by political leaders, to resolve any issues that arise, but European leaders have insisted the ECJ must be given the final say.Ms May has previously insisted: “The jurisdiction of the ECJ in the UK must end.”In a sign of the continued distance between the two negotiating teams, Mr Barnier said: “We cannot accept that a jurisdiction other that the Court of Justice of the European Union determines the law and imposes its interpretation on the institutions of the Union.”The former French minister said the EU was open to the UK changing its stance, but that time was running out.He said: “If the United Kingdom would like to change its own red lines, it must tell us. The sooner the better.“We are asking for clarity. A negotiation cannot be a game of hide and seek.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Looking to allay investor concerns, Mr Mattarella vetoed on Sunday the parties’ choice of 81-year-old economist Paolo Savona as economic chief because he has been a vocal critic of Italy remaining in the euro.League party leader Matteo Salvini in recent days had virtually given an ultimatum over the economy minister pick to Mr Mattarella, whose duties as head of state include sanctioning a new cabinet. Mr Salvini told right-wing supporters he had refused to submit to a presidential veto of Mr Savona. Five-Star Movement leader Luigi Di Maio, whose party won the most seats at an inconclusive 4 March vote, demanded that parliament impeach Mr Mattarella and raised the spectre of political turmoil in the euro zone’s third biggest economy as a result. Barriers installed in Venice, Italy ahead of day of segregation of tourists and residentsThe 4 March election had failed to produce a party with enough support to govern single-handedly. Mr Salvini and fellow eurosceptic Mr Di Maio agreed this month to join their rival forces in a coalition to break the political impasse.With neither of them willing to back the other as prime minister, however, they ended up tapping political novice Mr Conte. The law professor at the University of Florence is a 5-Star Movement supporter. A presidential palace official, Ugo Zampetti, told reporters on Sunday night that Mr Conte ”has given back the mandate” Mr Mattarella had given him four days earlier to try to form a government.The economy ministry “always constitutes an immediate message of trust or alarm” for financial markets, Mr Mattarella said, adding that he had asked for someone who was not “supporting a position expressed more than once that could probably, or in fact inevitably, provoke Italy‘s exit from the euro”.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesMigrants wait to disembark from the ship Aquarius in the Sicilian harbour of Catania, ItalyIreland awaits the official result of a referendum that could end the country’s ban on abortion.

I don\u0027t know who she is.Labour did not reply to a request for comment.Ms Bryan\u0027s peerage has already caused controversy after it was revealed she had demanded the abolition of the Lords as well as calling for the monarchy and MI5 to be scrapped.In the run-up to the 2015 Election Ms Bryan wrote that she wanted a federal republic of Britain, abolish the Monarchy and the House of Lords.She backed demands in the Left-wing manifesto of The Socialist Campaign for a Labour Victory which also said: Disband MI5 and special police squads, disarm the police.Tory MP Andrew Percy said that Ms Bryan ditching her hard-Left principles in return for a peerage is just bare-faced hypocrisy.A Labour source dismissed the hypocrisy charge, saying she was committed to replacing the Lords with a democratic second chamber.An online biography describes Ms Bryan as having been a member of the Independent Labour party and the Labour Party and previously worked for the Fabian Society.She jointly edited Class, Nation And Socialism: The Red Paper On Scotland 2014 and edited The Citizen magazine for the Scottish Labour Campaign for Socialism for eight years.She is described on Labour List as a convener of the Red Paper Collective which aims to provide a labour movement alternative to Scotland\u0027s nationalist vs unionist debate.Ms Bryan was one of three new Labour members of the Lords named nine days ago.Mr Corbyn also faced protests over giving a peerage to race equality campaigner Martha Osamor, mother of Labour MP Kate Osamor.Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn takes part in a community meeting at the Guru Har Rai Gurdwara Sahib temple                    Reuters1 of 36Britain\u0027s opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn speaks at an anti-racism rally in LondonJewish groups branded the move a two-fingered salute to their community after she backed activists suspended from the party over alleged anti-Semitism.Ms Bryan\u0027s 2015 book on Labour Party founder Hardie has received one five star review on Amazon from a Paul Barker who said: Read this brothers and sisters and be stirred into action before the torys destroy our country (sic).Ms Bryan is believed to be close friends with fellow Scot Karie Murphy, described as Corbyn\u0027s gatekeeper.Once described as the partner of Unite boss Len McCluskey, Ms Murphy was appointed manager of the Labour leader\u0027s office in 2016 and is widely regarded as one of his closest aides.Ms Bryan was secretary of the constituency Labour Party in Glasgow Central, where Glasgow-born Ms Murphy was secretary of the Glasgow Community Health Branch as well as being a former chair of Scottish Labour.A Comprehensive Future newsletter shows Ms Bryan was serving on the Scottish constituency Labour party while Ms Murphy was on the regional branch of the Scottish Labour party in 2004 - meaning they would have worked closely together."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/590x/Harry-Meghan-wedding-965828.jpg","title":"royal wedding 2018 meghan markle prince harry wedding organisers kensington palace","story":"The beauty of Harry and Meghan\u0027s big day wouldn\u0027t have been the same without the hidden organisersAs the world\u0027s media gathered outside the couple\u0027s west London home to report the momentous news, Lieutenant Colonel Sir Andrew Ford was experiencing an uncanny case of deja vu.The long-standing Comptroller of the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s office and retired British Army Officer had been in exactly the same position when Prince William announced his engagement to Kate Middleton almost eight years to the day earlier.The time frames were similarly tight, with little over five months between the engagement announcement and the big day in which to plan the second biggest royal wedding of the 21st century.Having orchestrated all the ceremonial aspects of those Westminster Abbey nuptials, along with the Queen\u0027s Diamond Jubilee and 90th birthday celebrations, the former Welsh Guardsman knew exactly what needed to be done. But there was one significant difference.Unlike almost all the previous state occasions he had overseen, Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding was to take place at Windsor Castle - a week after the Royal Windsor Horse Show had rolled through town and with the prospect of a royal baby thrown into the mix. It was time to start making a lengthy to-do list.                Royal wedding reception: Menu, speeches, \u0026lsquofilthy\u0027 jokes and dancing                When Harry first really met Meghan - ADAM HELLIKEROver at Kensington Palace, the royal wedding preparations had already started in earnest. Although the couple\u0027s decision to exchange vows at St George\u0027s Chapel was announced the very next day, aides had already started scoping out the 15th-century venue for ceremony, and exploring the idea of not one but two receptions, to be held on the grounds of the Queen\u0027s favourite royal residence.It immediately became apparent that like any bride planning her fairytale wedding, Meghan would need a right-hand woman and Amy Pickerill, 32, a smiley senior communications officer, was plucked from the palace\u0027s PR machine to become the former Suits star\u0027s Girl Friday, helping to plan the wedding alongside Harry\u0027s private secretary Ed Lane Fox.With the help of Kensington Palace\u0027s Communications Secretary Jason Knauf, like Meghan, an American, and Miguel Head, longstanding private secretary to the Duke of Cambridge, the pair had their work cut out, not only helping to plan a royal wedding but also overseeing Meghan\u0027s rapid introduction to royal life.As the royal couple made clear in their engagement interview with the BBC\u0027s Mishal Husain, Meghan planned to hit the ground running, and visits to every corner of the UK were quickly arranged with Meghan even becoming the first royal fianc\u0026eacutee to spend Christmas with the Royals at Sandringham.One of the first VIPs to be informed of the couple\u0027s plans was the Archbishop of Canterbury. Although the Most Reverend Justin Welby did not take it for granted that he would have some involvement in the royal nuptials, despite having officiated William and Kate\u0027s vows in 2011, the former parish priest predicted that he may well be called upon to once again lead wedding declarations that would be watched by an audience of billions around the world.Thankfully, he had had some recent practice, having married his press secretary Ailsa Anderson only three months earlier. The only problem was that that ceremony had not gone without a hitch. Despite being the most senior clergyman in the Church of England, the Cambridge-educated father-of-six caused a moment of panic by temporarily mislaying one of the wedding rings, which had rolled under a chair.I\u0027d better hold on tightly to the rings this time, he joked to Lambeth Palace aides charged not only with preparing him for the royal wedding but also another significant milestone in Meghan\u0027s conversion from American actress to royal bride: her baptism and confirmation into the church headed by her husband-to-be\u0027s grandmother.News that Windsor would be the royal wedding venue was greeted with a mix of excitement and trepidation by staff at the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead.Having hosted the Queen\u0027s Golden Jubilee celebrations in 2002 and Prince Charles\u0027s marriage to Camilla Parker Bowles three years later at the town\u0027s Guildhall, the historic royal tourist trap was no stranger to major royal events but with some of the expected 5,000 members of the international media already descending on local hotels and businesses to buy up the best vantage points - a multi-agency task force was quickly assembled with Deputy Council leader Phillip Bicknell immediately identifying a major problem.Following a winter of heavy snowfall the pot-holed pavements and roads would not be able to withstand the 110,000 expected visitors let alone the 2.5-mile planned carriage procession along the High Street.Amy Pickerill helped Meghan to plan the wedding A plan was quickly put into action which saw 1,000 tonnes of material used to resurface the town centre roads, covering the equivalent area of two football pitches. In addition, Goswell Hill, a key venue for the day\u0027s celebrations would have to be pigeon-proofed.It\u0027s important that Windsor looks at its very best, insisted Councillor Bicknell, as councillors voted to push forward \u0026pound2.6million worth of improvement works which had been scheduled to be carried out in 201819.The 145-strong team of Crown Estate staff based at Windsor Great Park also knew they would have their work cut out.With the Long Walk due to be a focal point for the celebrations, not to mention play host to broadcasters from around the world, as well as the main BBC and ITV royal wedding studios, Keeper of the Gardens John Anderson immediately summoned the entire workforce, including clerical staff based in the Estate\u0027s London HQ, to descend on the 5,000-acre park to participate in a mass tidy up.We knew the Long Walk would be the focus of global attention so it was important that it looked its best. I immediately called an estate day of litter picking and tidying, he said. The 10-day mowing cycle was switched to weekly and Mr Anderson insisted that string was used to give the Long Walk a sharper edge down the sides.Harry\u0027s private secretary Ed Lane Fox worked with Amy Pickerill to organise the royal weddingJohn Anderson, Keeper of the GardensWe decided to take the grass in by a couple of inches either side to make sure it looked perfectly straight and as sharp as possible. Sometimes the grass creeps out a bit. People walk on it. It ends up looking a little weathered.With the couple keen for florist Philippa Craddock to incorporate Windsor foliage into the chapel flower displays, Mr Anderson also began to identify the best trees from which to take clippings.Normally we would have cut down some of the seedling trees but we left them so the foliage on offer was as green as possible.Later, in the days leading up to the wedding, Mr Anderson would find himself stress-testing sprigs of birch to see if they could withstand the unseasonably warm May weather and commandeering chiller vans to keep the wedding flowers and foliage looking as fresh as possible as temperatures topped 25 degrees celsius.It was not until January that Clare Waight Keller took the most important call of her career.PAClare Waight Keller was sworn to secrecy when designing and making Meghan\u0027s dressAs Givenchy\u0027s recently appointed artistic director, she had built up a career designing for Ralph Lauren, Gucci and Chloe - but nothing could have prepared her for landing the fashion commission of a lifetime as designer of Meghan\u0027s wedding dress.The married mother of three was banned from telling anyone about the top secret project - even her husband, US architect Philip Keller, who only found out with the rest of the world on the morning of the wedding.Throughout eight or nine meetings with the bride-to-be and despite spending a staggering 3,600 hours working on the dress and intricate hand-embroidered 16ft veil, she managed to keep it under wraps.It certainly helped that the bookmakers and media were all chasing a red herring, with the British-based Australian design duo Ralph \u0026amp Russo wrongly reported to be behind the wedding gown after designing the \u0026pound56,000 dress Meghan wore for her engagement photographs at Frogmore House.Frogmore, however, was to play an even more important role in the wedding celebrations after the couple picked the 300-year-old royal retreat for their second, more intimate evening reception.NCMaster of the Royal Household Vice Admiral Tony Johnstone-Burt was key in preparationsMuch like the FA Cup final on the same day - it was decided the wedding would also be a game of two halves - with William\u0027s participation at the crucial football tie still hanging in the balance.As master of the Royal Household, Vice Admiral Tony Johnstone-Burt was already knee-deep in preparations for both receptions by the time Kensington Palace announced the finer details in February.Liaising with the Comptroller Sir Anthony and the household\u0027s head chef Mark Flanagan, it was decided that the Queen would host the lunchtime reception for 600 guests at St George\u0027s Hall, while Prince Charles would put on the more intimate evening sit-down dinner for just 200 of the couple\u0027s nearest and dearest.As with any bride and groom, Harry and Meghan took a leading role in choosing the food, insisting on a modern day twist on traditional fare by serving bowl food for lunch.Some 30 kitchen staff were recruited for the big day and by the Thursday night before the wedding, they had already washed and peeled the vegetables, and got other produce ready.The day Lady Diana Spencer became Diana, Princess of Wales was the wedding of the century. Here is their wedding days compared in pictures.                     Getty Images1 of 14Meghan Markle on her wedding day to Prince Harry, May 19, 2018It\u0027s the minimum amount of cooking and maximum amount of presentation time, said Mr Flanagan, who has been cooking for the Queen, her family and guests since 2002.Harry and Meghan even visited Windsor Castle to sample the menu, which included a selection of canapes followed by a choice of fricassee of free range chicken with morel mushrooms and young leeks, pea and mint risotto with pea shoots, truffle oil and parmesan crisps or 10-hour slow roasted Windsor pork belly with apple compote and crackling.While all this was going on, royal cake maker Claire Ptak was gathering the ingredients for her elderflower and lemon sponge.The former market stall holder-turned-Hackney-based artisan baker, who was specially chosen by fellow Californian foodie Meghan to create the buttercream iced masterpiece, had to source 200 Amalfi lemons, 5,000 eggs and 10 bottles of elderflower cordial from the Queen\u0027s Sandringham estate in Norfolk before even embarking on the five-day mission to create the \u0026pound50,000 cake, with the help of no fewer than six assistant bakers.Then came the task of sourcing three types of Meghan\u0027s favourite peonies - Madame Claude, Bowl of Cream, and the aptly titled Duchess - in shades of white and cream to decorate the cakes, along with four different white and cream roses - Patience, Purity, Jeanne Moreau and Princess Miyuki. Claire previously admitted she hadn\u0027t made a back-up cake in case of a disaster, saying: It\u0027s cake. It can\u0027t go that wrong.PAClaire Ptak created the \u0026pound50,000 lemon and elderflower wedding cakeThe latest major press briefing came just two weeks before the wedding as media outlets from around the world were putting the finishing touches on specially-made royal wedding studios both in Windsor town centre and along the Long Walk - where thousands of royal watchers were due to descend to watch the noon ceremony on 13 big screens.With more than 100,000 revellers expected to picnic on the site during the day, 68 catering units were set up alongside 746 extra toilets.By now 250 members of the Armed Forces had been specially selected to take part in the 25-minute carriage procession and were being put through their paces by Major General Ben Bathurst, general officer in command of the Household Division, who planned the entire military effort sitting at the Duke of Wellington\u0027s old desk at his office at Horse Guards.The broadcasters were also trying to pre-plan their coverage with military precision. One network insisted on removing the windows from the Harte and Garter pub to guarantee an unrestricted camera view of the proceedings.The US broadcaster NBC went a step further, building a huge riser on the top of the Macdonald hotel, having secured the prime position looking down on the steps of St George\u0027s chapel following a bidding war with rivals CNN.Hundreds and thousands of pounds were spent reinforcing the roof to ensure the timber-framed hotel could withstand not one but three makeshift TV studios belonging to the NBC\u0027s family of outlets including sets for Access Hollywood and the Canadian broadcaster CTV.Having given Harry and Meghan three or four marriage guidance sessions in the run up to the day - not to mention helping them plan the order of service - the Archbishop of Canterbury was on more than friendly terms with the couple by the time it came to their wedding rehearsal on the Tuesday before the wedding. An insider described the bridesmaids and page boys as a little over excited as they practised their slow walk down the aisle.Across the pond as Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland was preparing to fly to London from Los Angeles, American preacher the Most Reverend Michael Curry was at his Chicago home adding the finishing touches to the six and a half minute sermon he had written on his iPad after being asked by his friend, the Archbishop to give the address.As the first black bishop to be appointed to the US Episcopalian church, the father-of-two and equal marriage campaigner was no stranger to making history - but nothing could have prepared him for the reaction to his power of love speech - which he ended up completely ad libbing after being carried away by the emotion of the day.Having undertaken a second rehearsal without the couple on Friday, James Vivian, the director of music at St George\u0027s Chapel, was feeling quietly confident about the by now well-practised works of Sir Hubert Parry, Sir Edward Elgar, Vaughan Williams, Gustav Holst and Johann Sebastian Bach that Prince Charles had helped the couple select for the hour-long ceremony.Royal wedding highlights: The best photos of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s wedding day.                    Getty Images1 of 45Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s wedding in picturesTeenage cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason was also feeling positive - having been given carte blanche to choose two of the three pieces he performed for the royals: Maria Theresia von Paradis\u0027s Sicilienne and Gabriel Faure\u0027s Apres un reve along with the couple\u0027s favourite Franz Schubert\u0027s Ave Maria.The military also appeared in fine fettle having successfully executed a dress rehearsal of the formal pomp and pageantry the day before.As the crowds began building in Windsor on Friday night in anticipation of a walkabout by William and Harry, it was finally time for the 140 Royal Borough Ambassadors volunteers to swing into action, as the finishing touches were put on 4km of bunting adorning hastily re-painted shop fronts and businesses and the last of the 2,000 crowd barriers were put in place.After 173 days of intense planning the wedding day went off without a hitch and was lauded around the world for being one of the most progressive royal events in recent memory - not to mention one of the most romantic. Dress designer Clare Waight Keller knew she had done a good job when Harry came up to her after the ceremony and said: Oh my God, thank you, she looks absolutely stunning.Having spent just 45 minutes arranging Meghan\u0027s hair into a messy bun with a pack of \u0026pound1 pins, hairdresser Serge Normant was left reminiscing on a day you can only dream of.PAThe wedding day was praised as being one of the most progressive royal events in recent memoryBy the time Meghan was posing for her official wedding photographs, make-up artist Daniel Martin, who had worked with her for 10 years, was in tears. I was almost like she looks at me and said, \u0027What did you think? How\u0027d it go?\u0027 And I lost it.The couple had barely said I do before the clean-up operation began in earnest, with 13 tonnes of waste collected by an 80-strong council cleaning team beginning as soon as the crowds started to disperse as the couple\u0027s horse drawn Ascot Landau disappeared through the castle gates.Similarly, the TV sets that had taken weeks to construct were dismantled within hours of the final live broadcasts, with some American anchors flying back home on the night of the wedding, as Harry and Meghan were making their way to their evening reception in a zero-emissions electric E-Type Jaguar.It was around midnight when the skies above the castle were lit up with fireworks, signalling the end of an extraordinary team effort which saw Windsor host one of the most successful events of an illustrious royal history dating back more than 1,000 years."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/590x/charlie-van-straubenzee-prince-harry-royal-wedding-965850.jpg","title":"charlie van Straubenzee prince harry meghan markle royal wedding reception ludgrove school","story":"Mr Van Straubenzee recounted that he arrived at the school to find the prince was their dorm monitorCharlie van Straubenzee raised a glass to 33-year-old and his stunning 36-year-old wife in a hilarious roast where he not only poked fun of the prince\u0026rsquos flame-coloured hair but also gave guests an insight into their time together at Ludgrove School in Berkshire.Mr Van Straubenzee recounted that he arrived at the school aged eight to find the prince was their dormitory monitor, and a strict one at that.Mr Van Straubenzee said: \u0026ldquoAll I wanted was a cuddle form my mummy.\u0026ldquoInstead, Harry nicked my teddy bear and chucked it out onto the roof.He added: \u0026ldquoLadies and gentlemen, I ask you, how can you put someone in charge of a dorm when that someone is worse behaved than the whole dorm combined?Mr Van Straubenzee, 30, referred to Harry as \u0026ldquoour strawberry blonde prince during the hilarious speech.He said: \u0026ldquoLet\u0026rsquos face it - Harry\u0026rsquos a ginger.\u0026ldquoHe was in denial for years when he was young and used to hate other gingers.Charlie van Straubenzee raised a glass to 33-year-old and his stunning 36-year-old wifeOn a more serious note, van Straubenzee spoke of seeing his friend experience the loss of his mother, Princess Diana, in 1997.One guest said: \u0026ldquoHe described how awful it had been for Harry to go through everything and how he has come through it.

Surgeons inserted a small electrical device similar to a pacemaker, called a vagus nerve stimulator, in her chest and wired it to a second device in her brain.When triggered by a magnet she wears on her wrist, it sends electrical impulses to her brain.An electric shock at the early sign of a seizure either stops or cuts the impact of a seizure. April said: The only downside is it hurts but it\u0027s a small price to pay to have my life back.April was diagnosed with epilepsy at 12. She said: It affected my confidence so much. I couldn\u0027t talk to people as I feared having a fit. When I got older I couldn\u0027t be left alone so I couldn\u0027t even date.I needed 24-hour care which was tough on my family and me. I was told I would never be able to drive or swim in case I had a fit.April competed in Miss Teen Great Britain in a bid to boost her confidence. She said: It also helped me to raise awareness of epilepsy.After reading about vagus nerve simulation she begged her doctor to refer her for the operation only available in extreme cases.She said: I was frightened the first time I shocked myself but I was astonished when it worked and prevented a seizure.

But in a sad indictment of the plight of British high streets, he said: I have reached a point where if I could walk away I would.I used to wake up and look forward to going to work, but now it is to pay the bills, nothing more.The Sunday Express revealed last month how nearly 1,500 independent retailers had been forced to shut their doors for good in the past 12 months due to soaring business rates, rising costs and a fall in trade.The tax burden on bricks and mortar stores has seen big names like Toys R Us and Maplin go into administration, with House of Fraser and New Look also struggling. Last week Marks \u0026amp Spencer announced it was closing 100 high street stores and the DIY chain Homebase was sold for just \u0026pound1 by Australian owner Wesfarmers, which cut its losses to \u0026pound1billion.                Marks and Spencer store closures: UK high street favourite to CLOSE                 M\u0026ampS closures and the crisis on the British high streetBut independent traders have been hardest hit by huge rises in business rates and competition from online traders like Amazon.Richard\u0027s father Reuben and his brother Cyril opened their first store in Blackpool in 1946, selling carpets, and within a decade had expanded to have five stores across the seaside resort stocking furniture for homes.In the 1990s the business was streamlined into two superstores, in General Street and Walker Street, stocking Blackpool\u0027s biggest range of quality furniture, attracting custom from as far afield as London and the south east.Richard, 52, who employs 14 staff, said: We have always been proactive. We don\u0027t wait for the store to need a new coat of paint, we do it in advance so it always looks good.When customers come in they are still spending money, but the drop in footfall into the town centre has hit us hard.The father-of-one is also baffled by business rates for one of his stores remaining about the same for the last four years, while the property tax for the second has gone up by 40 per cent.He said: The problems for independent traders on the high street started with Tony Blair giving carte blanche to out-of-town retail parks, but even they are now struggling in the face of online competition. The harsher trading climate has not been helped for us by Blackpool town centre looking run-down and having roadworks weeks before our summer sales start, making it difficult for our customers to reach us.A lot of the roadworks have been caused by a \u0026pound22million project funded by the Government for a tram to run from the train station to the promenade, which is just a six-minute walk. This money would have been better spent on a parkand-ride scheme to allow people easily to get into the town.MATTHEW POVERThe lack of footfall on the high street has hit Lefton\u0027s Furniture Group hardBlackpool council deputy leader Gillian Campbell said: We have well-documented plans for improving the town centre, evidenced by the number of development projects already completed or that will come to fruition over the next two years.These include the development of a new conference centre, new town centre hotels, a cinema alongside additional retail and restaurant facilities at Houndshill, an integrated transport interchange at North Station and the improvement of key streets.All of this is much-needed investment that will improve the visual appeal of the town centre and give businesses and shoppers more compelling reasons to come to the town centre.If you are a shopkeeper or shopper with concerns about the future of your high street, write to Jon Coates, Sunday Express, Northern \u0026amp Shell Building, 10 Lower Thames Street, London EC3R 6EN or email jon.coates@express"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/Trolley-965755.jpg","title":"May Bank holiday 2018 opening times supermarkets open","story":"GettyIt\u0026rsquos best to double check your local branch details onlineAs always, it\u0026rsquos best to double check your local branch details online in case they\u0026rsquore running things a little differently.

The two had been lovers after meeting in 1960 when being gay was banned.Scott, who worked as a model, was said to have had a full blown affair with the politician and even had liaisons in Thorpe’s Commons room.But after they parted, Thorpe was said to have viewed Scott as a dangerous blackmailer intent on revenge - something that could have wrecked his political ambitions.For while homosexuality was legalised in 1967 it was still taboo for people in the public eye.Scott had been lured on to Exmoor by a hitman, who was allegedly a part-time pilot called Andrew Newton who had been hired as part of the plot.He shot the model’s dog before turning the gun on Scott – but it jammed. Effing and jeffing, he sped off.After managing to hail down an approaching car, Scott blurted “Jeremy Thorpe” to the driver.A police investigation lead to a trial in the Old Bailey with the Liberal leader accused of conspiracy to murder along with three other men. But the jury did not feel convinced that Thorpe, a man of hitherto unblemished reputation and a national figure with a very distinguished public record could be capable of the crime. And he was acquitted along with the others.But Scott maintains Thorpe wanted him dead and said he only felt safe when the politician died in 2014.His younger self has been played by actor Ben Wishaw in the new BBC drama starring Hugh Grant called Very English Scandal."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000408650365.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"apply here for our first summer internship scheme to work for the the number one paper","story":"The internships, for 18 to 25-year-olds, are available in roles including reporting, news-gathering, design and production, across print and online.Placements will last up to 12 weeks and be based mainly in London.

We are Europe’s main security power. They have much to lose.Theresa May is demanding back the £1billion we put into this system.But that is chicken feed next to our £39billion divorce bill.She must insist not a penny is paid until we are reinstated in Galileo and a trade deal is signed.We were naive to imagine Brussels would be a friendly partner after Brexit.Its powerful bureaucrats are now nakedly and dangerously hostile.WOULD you pay £2,000 extra tax a year to keep the NHS afloat? How about more when, inevitably, that isn’t enough?The sums needed are astronomical.The Government is set to put in £350million extra a week.But that merely keeps it going as demand soars.Any improvement will need far more — and the NHS is already asking for it.Experts say the annual budget must soar by £56BILLION within 15 years, or 9p on income tax.No sensible Government will raise that, nor should it.On its 70th birthday, Theresa May should announce a Royal Commission, and let the brightest health experts and politicians agree on a new NHS model we can afford.WE back day-release prisoners getting jobs . . . under strict conditions.Here’s why.

And it looks like there might be turbulent times ahead off-screen too.Actress Eleanor Tomlinson, who plays feisty Demelza, believes she should be paid the same as Aidan Turner, the star turn as Captain Ross.Eleanor isn’t sure how much Aidan takes home.But it has been confirmed this week that he tucks a heck of a lot more cash into his tight britches than her.Bosses at the company which makes the hugely successful Poldark series — back on TV next month — say it’s because he has significantly more screen time than any other character.I think they are quite right, and not just because of those half-naked scything scenes. As Ross Poldark, Aidan is ably supported by a splendid cast. But he carries the show and his character’s name is in the title.On the other hand, it was ludicrous that the luminous Claire Foy, who portrayed the Queen in The Crown, was paid less than Matt Smith, who played Prince Philip.Claire was the true shining star of this production and had more lines to learn, more scenes and many more long hours in front of the cameras than anyone else.Bosses were shamed into giving her £200,000 in back payments.I hope she enjoyed every well-earned penny, but she should actually have been paid a lot more than Matt.You also wouldn’t expect any actress playing Miss Marple to be paid the same as her male co-stars.She obviously deserves a bigger share of the pie, and likewise you wouldn’t for a minute acceptBrenda Blethyn being given equal pay with her young whipper-snapper sidekicks in Vera. She merits a far bigger salary.Brenda is the reason we tune in, and as the lead, she has more pressure to shoulder. Just like Poldark, if Vera had been a flop, then Brenda and Aidan would have taken all of the flak and their careers would have suffered.If actors and actresses are doing exactly the same work they should be paid exactly the same amount of money.That should apply across the board to every job in the land.It’s unfair for a female professor to earn less than her male counterpart, or someone working on the factory floor or in a shop to take home less just because she’s a woman.That’s why I was taken aback when new Strictly head judge Shirley Ballas defended the BBC for paying her less than her predecessor Len Goodman.Shirley graciously said it was because she was “on trial”. But I’m delighted that for her upcoming second series, bosses have apparently had a rethink.Whether this is because they feel Shirley has “proved herself” or is due to the outcry over equal pay, it is, at least, a baby step in the right direction.I would love to see the same applied in teaching, medicine, finance — every other job where men and women are putting in the same hard graft.When it comes to acting, equal pay is more complex.Marlon Brando was paid £2.6million in 1978 to appear as Superman’s dad. He worked for 12 days, refused to learn his lines and was on screen for less than ten minutes.It was thought his presence would put bums on seats, but it must have been hard to justify to the rest of the cast.Then there was Elizabeth Taylor, who cashed a cheque for a million dollars to appear as Cleopatra in 1963. Co-star Richard Burton was paid buttons in comparison.Stars are worth as much money as their agents can grab and it depends on their box-office appeal. It’s the same when it comes to certain West End shows or pantos.Talented singers and dancers have to watch half-witted reality stars being parachuted into lead roles and paid fortunes to shift tickets.So while I understand why Eleanor is a bit miffed, I don’t think she had a leg to stand on.But at least it has got people talking about equal pay and highlighting injustices.And if she is the undisputed star in her next role and getting most of the screen time, then she absolutely should get a bigger pay packet.MEGHAN MARKLE went from elegant, alluring, ultra-modern bride to a frumpy wife in less than 72 hours.Her gown was perfect, but this outfit she wore to a party for Prince Charles after her big day looked like one of Princess Anne’s recycled horrors.I’m not sure if it was because Meghan is now a duchess she felt she had to conform to a safe and stuffy look, but it really didn’t work.There’s obviously a lot more to the newest royal than being a fashion plate. She’s bright as well as beautiful and has always had impeccable style.It’s easy to dismiss fashion as being trivial and shallow, but what you wear makes a statement, especially if you are globally renowned.Meghan’s outfit for her father-in-law’s birthday bash at Buckingham Palace screamed that she had been assimilated into the royal “Firm” and was going to be a good girl.We just expected more from the feisty 36-year-old. I hope it was just an unfortunate blip.WOODY ALLEN’S life reads like one of those particularly dark and warped indie movies.He married one adopted daughter and still stands accused of sexually abusing another.He has been disowned by his biological son, the campaigning journalist Ronan Farrow, who helped expose the Harvey Weinstein scandal, over the alleged abuse of Ronan’s sister, Dylan, when she was just seven.Allen, who is now 82, remains lauded by Hollywood luvvies and besotted film buffs who think of him as a cinematic genius, although those who believe Dylan would describe him as a “dirty old man”.He was in a relation- ship with actress Mia Farrow, but their unconventional family fractured after Mia discovered he had been having a sexual relationship with her adopted daughter Soon-Yi, who he went on to marry.JEFF GOLDBLUM is one of the coolest guys on the planet.He’s quirky, eccentric and paddles his own canoe.There aren’t enough endearing characters like him on the planet, and he’s one of the best things about Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, the newest movie in lucrative franchise. Jeff reprises his role as Dr Ian Malcolm, who first appeared in the original movie 25 years ago. Dr Malcolm doesn’t think human beings should mess around with nature and is consistently proven right.Jeff shares many of those views and behind that arm-waving, kooky exterior is a man of fierce intelligence and laser-sharp insight.If we were ever to be stupid enough to clone dinosaurs, he’s the man you would want in charge of sorting the whole mess out.Maybe Trump could get him to fix North Korea before Jeff starts on peace in the Middle East.Now the story has hit the headlines again with another of Mia’s brood of adopted children breaking their silence to support Allen.Moses Farrow, 40, wrote a blog this week about the man he calls Dad stating that Allen is completely innocent of any charges of abuse, which inevitably means he thinks his sister Dylan is a liar.No charges have ever been brought against Allen, but the family is broken and poor Dylan has been badly damaged by the alleged abuse claims that have haunted her for 25 years.There are no winners in this sad situation, apart from Allen himself.Actors still queue up for parts in his films and he continues to live his life as a privileged New Yorker.The breath of scandal has barely touched him, but his son is a tenacious investigative journalist and if there ever is a case to answer, it will one day be father against son, brother against sister and mother against father – and will inevitably be turned into a movie.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And for good.The free-trading “global Britain” Mrs May has repeatedly made central to her vision of our future will be dead.Her entire Department for International Trade will be redundant.Incredibly, we would be inviting Brussels to run the trade policy of the world’s fifth biggest economy forever — even after we have supposedly “left” the EU.And we would have NO say in it.This is not the minor detail Remainers want you to believe. It is a giant, decisive leap towards the destruction of Brexit and 17million referendum votes.It would be a mortal blow to the Prime Minister. How could she survive it?Tory rebels must realise this. But even wrecking their PM, Government and party, jeopardising national stability and potentially handing power to Corbyn’s Marxist lunatics fails to deter them.Mrs May must leave them in no doubt about the monstrous risk they are taking.Then, for the first time, she must turn that aggression on Brussels.The Sun is heartily sick of the EU’s destructive belligerence and playground bullying, sick of it “teaching Britain a lesson”, sick of our timid, cowed Government cravenly turning the other cheek.We’ve had two years of it.

Like it denies poisoning the Skripals, backing Assad’s chemical weapons massacres and meddling in other countries’ ­elections. But the world must act.Many countries have sent Putin’s spies home. It’s a start. But it’s not enough.Russia, as Boris Johnson rightly says, has a “disregard for innocent life” and “believes it can act with impunity”.And no wonder, when the cream of world football is about to help it showcase its hospitality for a month.It is shameful Russia was never stripped of the World Cup.

The knife is not the crime. Children seldom randomly pick up knives and decide to stab people. In my experience it often starts when the child is young.This spate of killings will pass but for now it affords the attention and opportunity to reflect.Currently, the debate is cyclical and futile. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan says it’s not his fault, he needs more police. The police say we need more of them. The Government says you’ve had more police but it didn’t make a difference. Meanwhile, children are dying on the streets.The search for solutions must stretch beyond the police. Aside from outrage, there needs to be a focus on the causes, as well as the symptoms, of these crimes.This shouldn’t detract from taking knives away from those carrying them, but we can’t ignore the fact that replacing a blade is as simple as going to the kitchen drawer.Those of us who are more able to look at the world through the eyes of young people who carry knives for protection and status get closer to how they think.What we are witnessing is a sophisticated type of group mind. Some of our boys are so mentally zoned into a culture of violence. All of my youths know, directly, someone murdered, or at least seriously injured, on our streets. Some have been involved.How did we get to this place? Slowly. As the influence of parents, pastors and school principals has waned, all our young people speak of a distinct feeling of powerlessness.The tried and traditional levers and sanctions affecting the development of children are not functioning effectively. For too many, the family bond is damaged and so ruptured we overlook its devastating effects. My young people need something to fight, something to believe in. Like everyone else, they want to be someone, and sometimes that means fighting each other.It is a sad day when, for some, employment prospects are more plentiful with local dealers selling weed and crack than the only other job on offer at the local barber’s.Some of the young people I work with speak about the role of their family’s socio-economic status in their life choices. If they’re lucky, they see their parents locked into dead-end, minimum-wage jobs with no security or satisfaction. Knives, they conclude, are a type of urban qualification. As one put it: “Everyone wants to be someone, this is my way.”Digging deeper, I learned that 85 per cent of my students had never patronised a black-owned business in the past five years, aside from a barber shop. Too many of them carry the assumption that blacks are inferior. “This is how it is,” Adamu told me. “Our business is on the road, we are designed for the hustle.”I began this work with an agenda to keep black boys from being arrested in their droves.Sadly, a lot of our kids have ended up in prison, but they started the three-lap race of life two laps behind. For some, it is almost impossible to work through all the scars.For many of our children, entrance to crime and urban violence is connected to a sense of wanting to be accepted and acceptable — violence is currency.Their hope is that they survive long enough to one day grow out of it. The desire to belong is so real that any community, including gangs, will do.The more law enforcement is used, the more of a challenge it becomes. It almost acts as encouragement because it is something else to beat.Drugs are also a way of life. For some it’s about using, for others it’s selling. It’s simply a way to earn money. A visit to our social housing estates will reveal high levels of organisation. Like any business, you have distribution points, a clear marketing strategy and, most of all, plans to deal with the opposition.I also see the age of involvement getting younger and they don’t care if they live or die. In that sense they are like suicide bombers.Recently I was involved in the rehabilitation of two nine-year-old boys. One was tasked with moving weapons from location to location and the other given addresses for drug drops. He would deliver the packages during school lunch breaks in exchange for McDonald’s, KFC and clothes.Children like these do not grow up seeing themselves as having a future in business or leadership. They are crying out for genuine role models. When our young men find more employment opportunities from businessmen than “road men”, real change will begin.Until that time, we need to love these children back to sanity. They are simply not able to make the rational choices our education and social systems demand.We experience a ruling class committed to maintaining the status quo. Talk about social mobility is just air.

She is in despair - there was no warning and the fence just appeared.It is two feet from our front window and front door - its like having the Berlin Wall in front of our home.Now exasperated Thomas and his wife, who married in July, say they would not have even considered the property if they had known the trouble in store for them.Thomas said: Were not even sure we want to live here now.Even if the fence gets taken down there is no guarantee it wont come back later or even be extended around the back - we are in fear of that.The couple, who had moved from rented accommodation, have considered employing their own solicitor.Thomas added: At first I was tearful but now Im angry.We specifically bought this house, beating off a lot of competition, for its beautiful views and now theyve gone.We now keep the curtains closed in the front room and spend most of our time upstairs - Rebekah is too upset to be in the living room.We just want it sorted out quickly and permanently so we can enjoy our new home in peace.A spokesman for Persimmon Homes said: We are confident none of our development encroaches on land not legitimately within our ownership.We understand planning enforcement action is being taken against the neighbouring landowner to address the fence, which has been erected illegally and in breach of planning regulations."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000409153648.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"bee manchester tree hope symbol bombing anniversary","story":"The city planted a trail of 28 Japanese maple trees to mark the first anniversary of the atrocity that shook the city to its core.In a poignant symbol, a swarm of honey bees has now descended on one of the trees close to the National Football Museum.The worker bee became a symbol of unity and defiance in the wake of the May 22 2017 attack and has come to represent Manchester’s indomitable spirit.Speaking to Manchester Evening News, a passer-by who witnessed the swarm descend on the tree said: “It’s brilliantly poignant.“The whole tree was just infested with bees and it had to be sealed off.“I don’t know whether a nest has been set up within the tree, or it’s a swarm following a queen and could leave, but it’s a lovely symbol.”To safeguard the bees, and protect the public, council workers have set up a cordon around the tree with a sign placed nearby saying: “Caution bees. Do not enter.”Dozens of moving notes of remembrance written by the public were attached to the branches last week as part of a memorial service to the 22 victims.Photographs suggest the hive has been set up on a branch near a message reading: “We will never forget. X.”The Trees of Hope line a route from Manchester Victoria railway station to St Ann’s Square, and were installed for members of the public to share messages of tribute, solidarity and love.Some of the trees have been nurtured with compost made from the floral tributes left by the public at the site of the attack last year.The trail will come to an end today.After this, each message tag will be preserved and kept, alongside tributes left last year, in an archive of the city’s response to the attack.The trees will continue to stand in the city centre.The worker bee has been the symbol of Manchester since the Industrial Revolution at the turn of the 19th century.In the 1800s Manchester was awash with textile mills that were commonly described as ‘hives of activity’ and the workers inside them compared to bees.‘Busy bee’ is still a term associated with industriousness and hard work.Traditionally, they represent the city’s energy and sense of community.Worker bees are featured in Manchester’s coat of arms, which was given to the city in 1842, and can be seen on many public buildings throughout the city.Following the Manchester Arena bombing, the worker bee became a symbol of unity and defiance, and came to represent Manchester’s indomitable spirit."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000409143306.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"terrifying moment 345mph royal navy jet flies so close to paragliders they could feel the heat from the engine","story":"The Royal Navy Hawk strayed into their fly zone while on a practice bombing run on an adjacent military range.One shocked paraglider pilot said the training jet passed so close he could feel the heat from its engine.Dramatic footage of the near miss was filmed by fellow paraglider Martin Harris on his helmet camera.He can be heard talking on the video, saying: Jet fighter giving it big licks around me.

He was badly shaken and went to land immediately.“He would have seen the jet heading directly towards him from half a mile away.

The Government has no credible policy and the whole world knows it.“Whitehall’s real preparations are for the continuation of EU law and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.“The State has made no preparations to leave and plans to make no preparations to leave — even after leaving.”Barring a last-minute change of tune, Mrs May is walking into an ambush which will sour relations with Brussels and condemn Britain to a generation of rancorous civil discord.A botched deal will be dressed up in Brussels newspeak as a triumph for all sides.In fact it will almost certainly betray 17.4million British people who explicitly voted OUT in the biggest democratic mandate ever seen in this country.Voters who hoped for clear and unequivocal freedom from EU laws and regulations are unlikely to stay silent for long.They expected Brexit ministers to carve out a prosperous and independent future.Instead, they have watched defeated Remainers mount a ruthless and successful counter-attack.From a position of strength as a major trading nation, Britain has surrendered on all fronts, caved in to Brussels bullies — and handed over a £39BILLION ransom for the privilege.We are likely to remain bound by a version of the EU customs union, the single market and the European Court of Justice for years to come. Meanwhile, mass immigration runs out of control.Perhaps to his own amazement, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has succeeded in his aim to make Britain worse off outside.We will not be allowed to flourish as a free-trading sovereign state.Nobody can be more vividly aware of this than Mrs May as she prepares for her looming summit.Yet she has only herself to blame, starting with the catastrophic snap election which destroyed her Commons majority.She needlessly coughed up that £39billion with nothing in return from Brussels and allowed herself to be derailed by phantom threats of IRA violence if the UK establishes any sort of border with Ireland.The sad truth is that Mrs May is not up to the job as Prime Minister at a momentous point in our history.In an age when words really count, we are lumbered with an ultra-cautious leader who cannot think on her feet or speak without notes.At a time when we should all be doing our best to make Brexit work, we have a Prime Minister who would much prefer to Remain.For the moment, Leavers such as Iain Duncan Smith and Jacob Rees-Mogg are pledging their loyalty.But a bad deal would provoke die-hard Tories into the only honourable action they feel they can take — and put her premiership on the line.They already have the votes needed to trigger a leadership contest.They will not support key Commons votes to dilute Brexit, risking Government defeat by an unholy alliance of Labour opportunists, Lib Dem and SNP wreckers and Tory Remainers.A disastrous combination of weak leadership, cack-handed communication and dismal diplomacy has plunged Britain into a needless constitutional crisis.It says something about Mrs May’s position as leader that her strongest card is the prospect of yet another general election — the third in three years.And the nightmare of political throwback Jeremy Corbyn storming the barricades and leading his Marxist extremists to power.[boxout featured-image=6392734]AS PM, Tony Blair insisted 50 per cent of school leavers must go to university.The result was grade inflation across the board and “Ology” graduates struggling to find a decent job.Now his sensible son Euan, 34, is arguing for tailor-made apprenticeships, giving kids a chance to earn while they learn.His views coincide with new Tory policy – T-levels, technical and trade qualifications which fit pupils to the work they want.They can range from plumbers and computer wizards to City bankers.Many will be driving their own car and buying a home by the time pals leave university with mountains of debt.It is the way forward in skill-hungry Britain.[/boxout] Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sounds optimistic to me.But leading the band which once epitomised sex and drugs and rock ’n’ roll — and the debauched history of the Stones is etched deeply into the corrugated faces of Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood — is the man who can teach us all we need to know about staying fit.Unlike Mick, we don’t have to take up yoga, ballet and kickboxing — but like him, we do have to think about getting our blood pumping every day of our lives.And unlike Jagger, we do not have to start every day with a smoothie — but we do have to think more about what we are putting into our bodies.Few of us could ever hope to follow Jagger’s punishing fitness regime, working out for hours most days of the week under the watchful eye of personal trainer Torje Eike.We don’t have the time, money or indeed fitness levels to keep up with this great-grandfather.But by having Mick Jagger as a role model, every one of us can be healthier than we are — slimmer, fitter and ready to rock ’n’ roll.The key to Jagger’s fitness is that everything counts.If you put good food into your body or if you eat rubbish.If you make regular demands on your body or just reach for the TV remote.Jagger gets mocked for his action-packed love life (at 73, he had a son with 29-year-old ballerina Melanie Hamrick) and for his laughter lines — nothing is that funny, Mick!But if you saw Jagger bouncing about like a 19-year-old this week, then you could not help but take him seriously.And want a slice of whatever he is having.So the next time the nation has a panic attack about how fat we are becoming, we need to get Jagger on the case.For — at the risk of being impolite — when did you ever see Jamie Oliver looking even remotely slim?But Mick Jagger is still dancing like it is 1969.And you never see a fat Rolling Stone. IT was such a glorious day in Windsor last Saturday that you would think even the hardest of hearts would soften at the sight of young love framed by pomp, pageantry and that cloudless blue sky.But the moaning anti-monarchy minnies are always with us.“Proof again that GB is an infantilised, escapist nation,” sneered Ugandan-born, Oxford-educated commentator Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, 68.Meanwhile, in Wales, Oxfam apologised if a modest royal wedding display in Oxfam’s Aberystwyth shop – Meghan and Harry face masks and some Union Flag bunting – had “caused upset”.But I was on the Long Walk in Windsor with those cheering crowds last Saturday, and I have never felt such a feeling of national unity.The monarchy exists solely with the blessing of the British people.We can divest ourselves of it at any time – as so many countries have ditched their royal families over the past few centuries.But if you stood among those crowds on the Long Walk – who came from every creed, class, race and religion on the planet – then you would believe that the future of the Royal Family is assured for the next 100 years.Anyone dreaming of a republican paradise should not hold their breath.Jada will be an inspiration to anyone suffering from the condition.Because with or without her hair, Jada still looks beautiful.BUCK-TOOTHED Brazilian footballer Ronaldinho is best remembered for two great performances – lobbing David Seaman’s ponytail in the 2002 World Cup and scoring eight times in one night with dancer Lisa Collins.One of these performances earned him the nickname “Pneumatic Drill”. And it wasn’t lobbing David Seaman.You might think that at 38, Ronaldinho’s pneumatic drill was getting a bit rusty, but in August he is to “wed” both his girlfriends, Beatriz Souza and Priscilla Coelho, in a joint ceremony.More three-in-one oil, darling?We are told that Britain should rely on the “good faith” from Brussels.What good faith?When did Brussels ever show anything but contempt, disdain and disrespect towards this country after we voted to leave?The EU’s attempt to shut Britain out of the Galileo satellite project – which we helped to fund – is just the latest insult.If May wants to give Brussels £39billion without a trade deal nailed down, then she should resign today.And make way for someone who will finally stand up for this country.THE Labour Party has suspended local party representative Ian McKenzie for saying that Islamic State would behead Labour’s Emily Thornberry rather than using her as a sex slave.McKenzie, chairman of the Lewisham East constituency, does not deny his crass comments, although some suggest they are being used by his opponents on Labour’s hard Left to discredit him.It sounds like he is doing a good job of discrediting himself.HARRY KANE will be England’s youngest ever World Cup captain – younger even than Bobby Moore.Kane will do a fine job but Bobby Moore beat testicular cancer in his early twenties and then lifted the World Cup at 25.And for any England captain, that will always be a hard act to follow.HOW stark-raving mad that TV historian Dan Snow feels he has to lie to his daughters that women flew Spitfires in World War Two so they feel free to “follow their dreams”.“My daughter was walking down rows and rows and rows of these Spitfire racers and she was going, ‘Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy’,” says Snow.So to protect his six-year-old daughter from what he calls “the grim realities of pre-20th century gender relations”, Snow told her that some women also flew Spitfires in combat.And when I read of Snow’s bizarre lie, I thought of Violette Szabo, who was parachuted twice into Nazi-occupied Europe during World War Two to aid the French Resistance.On her second mission she was captured, tortured by the Gestapo and executed at Ravensbruck concentration camp in 1945.She was 23.Dan Snow has apparently never heard of Violette Szabo – because if he had, then he could surely have told his daughters about her.But many readers will know her incredible story from the film Carve Her Name With Pride.Violette was the working-class daughter of a French mother and a British father.She fell in love with a French Foreign Legion soldier of Hungarian descent called Etienne Szabo, who was killed in 1942 at El Alamein.Violette, who spoke fluent French, trained as a special-operations field agent to fight the Nazis.The torments she suffered before her death are beyond our imagination and her courage is at least the equal of any man who fought in World War Two – and I speak as the proud son of a Royal Naval Commando who won the Distinguished Service Medal.Educate yourself about Violette Szabo, Mr Snow.Then tell your daughters about her.WE all grew up as Star Wars fans but now it feels like there is always a new movie or spin-off coming out.The Last Jedi was only last year and this week sees the release of Han Solo’s back story, Solo. Talk about flogging a dead Wookiee.When Katy Perry is taking to the stage in a C-3PO mini-dress, the exploitation of the Star Wars franchise has possibly gone too far.We’re doomed, Katy.

We’ve teamed up with the cycling experts at Halfords to select four great suggestions of cycle routes to visit. And we’ve listed some all-important things you may want to consider to ensure you’re completely prepared. \u2028Remember, a bike ride can be five minutes or five hours – the main thing is getting out in the fresh air with your loved ones. How to check your bikes are ready  If you’re heading off on a family trip then it’s important to make sure that everyone’s bike is in good condition. A few simple checks before you set out could save you a lot of worry later on. Make sure your bike’s tyres are inflated to the correct pressure (there’s a helpful guide here ), and remember that on mountain bikes there are different tyre pressures for on-road and off-road. If you have questions, then it\u0027s also worth checking Halfords’ massive selection of cycling help and advice online. Ideally, you’ll check the tyres around a week before you go, and re-check before you leave to see if they have lost any pressure during that time. If they do, you may have a puncture that you can repair. Alternatively, Halfords will do any bike maintenance you need in-store and has service and repair plans that offer yearly checks.  You should also make sure that your chain is rust-free, as well as checking that all your gears work and the levers operate them smoothly. Often a simple adjustment is all that’s needed, but if you don’t feel confident then Halfords has a FREE bike check to make sure you’re in good shape, and offers a range of services to ensure that your bike is in tip-top condition. Halfords experts will conduct checks on your gears, brakes, tyres and frame to make sure you’re good to go. Not only will you be taking advantage of their expert knowledge, you’ll also be freeing up more time to spend enjoying yourself. Get the right rack  If you\u0027re planning to drive somewhere with your family\u0027s bikes then you need to choose a rack for your car that suits your needs. The Thule 591 Bike Carrier allows you to mount one bike on the roof of your car, keeping it nice and safe en route to your cycling break. You can actually fit up to four to your car – so it’s a good thing that right now when you buy one, you can get another half price, with free fitting. Alternatively, consider a rear-mounted rack, like the Thule 9403 Bike Carrier , which holds up to three cycles. Right now there’s 20 per cent off a range of bike racks at Halfords, and its experts will fit them for you, meaning you can focus on your next trip. So, where to cycle?\u2028\u2028 Richmond Park, London  The Tamsin Trail in Richmond Park has quiet and car-free tracks that offer a cycle of a little more than seven miles. You can get there by train – although check the bike capacity with the relevant operator – or by car. Because the trails don\u0027t feature a lot of motor traffic it\u0027s ideal if you\u0027re just starting out or have kids.  It\u0027s only just outside London – you can see St Paul\u0027s through a gap in the trees at King Henry\u0027s Mound – but it feels like the proper countryside. Some with smaller children might be feeling a bit left out here, but don’t worry because Halfords has the Hamax Kiss Rear Child Bike Seat at half price in time for the bank holiday weekend.  Little kids adore being taken around on the back of your bike, and it will give you beefier leg muscles too! If you\u0027ve got a couple of smaller children then you might also want to consider the Halfords Double Buggy trailer, which is a two-seater trailer for your little ones (older than 12 months) that allows you to get out and about, and give them a load of fun at the same time. Ae Valley, Scotland  Located near Dumfries, the Ae Valley Route is classified as Green by the Scottish Forestry Commission, which makes it suitable for families (there are more challenging routes nearby too). It\u0027s about 5.6 miles with stunning views and exciting, single track forest roads. As it\u0027s well-suited to families, consider one of Halfords’ amazing kids bikes. The Apollo Gridlok is ideal for 8-11 year-olds and is currently has 20 per cent off. So too is the Carrera Star bike, aimed at smaller children aged 4-6. (Discount applies to 14” Carrera Star only.)  Remember, you can always pop in to store with you little ones to have them try out bikes, and Halfords experts are on-hand to help you pick the right model. They’ll check the bike is the right size and even build it for you, free of charge. Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire  A 14 mile marked circuit means that this won\u0027t suit very young cyclists, but may well appeal to families with a bit more experience. Of course you don\u0027t have to ride the whole route and circuit isn\u0027t too challenging even for families. The route is signposted too, just start at the Cannop Cycle Centre.  An ideal route for families who have developed a love of cycling together, perhaps with older kids. Consider the Carrera Kraken mountain bike for this trip, especially if your existing bike is looking a little sorry for itself. If you pop in store now you\u0027ll also find this brilliant bike is now only \u0026pound360, (down from \u0026pound450, thanks to Halfords’ 20 per cent offer on a range of bikes). Stanhope \u0026amp Tyne Railway Railway path, Sunderland  This route is easy to break into much smaller sections, and is made up of paths that follow the old railway route closed in 1985. There is no traffic to worry about, the surfaces are largely good quality gravel or tarmac and of course it\u0027s easy to access from Sunderland\u0027s public transport. This route is ideally suited for those who want to break up a cycling tour over a few days. The flat, mostly smooth paths mean that if you\u0027re not a mountain biker then you\u0027ll be fine.  And for those looking for a new bike, the Pendleton Somerby hybrid bike offers both style and practicality in spades.

Former Energy Minister Greg Barker, now a peer, is raking in tens of thousands as chairman of En+ Group. MPs last night called our revelation “deeply troubling” and urged the Tories to act. The Foreign Affairs Select Committee last week raised concerns about energy giant En+, which is “controlled by billionaire and Kremlin associate Oleg Deripaska”. Their report on Russian “dirty money” in the UK came just weeks after Donald Trump slapped sanctions on En+ and Mr Deripaska – a close ally of President Putin. The Mirror can disclose that Lord Barker, who quit as MP for Bexhill and Battle in 2015, agreed to become chairman of En+ in October.  MPs said its flotation on the London Stock Exchange a month later was an example of “contradictions inherent in UK government policy towards Russia”. The Mirror revealed last week that former Tory leader William Hague is a paid advisor to a law firm which “facilitated” En+’s controversial flotation. The FASC last week warned the UK is turning a “blind eye” to Russia’s “dirty money” and putting national security at risk. MPs also said London was being used to hide the “corrupt assets” of President Putin and his cronies.

The Tory MP owns almost a fifth of Somerset Capital Management, which he founded and which now manages almost \u0026pound7.5billion for wealthy investors. On behalf of its clients, SCM has bought shares in two Russian firms blacklisted by the US which are controlled by powerful oligarchs in Vladimir Putin\u0027s inner circle. Its Russian assets are worth \u0026pound217million, according to the latest valuation by City data sources. The revelation came after he slammed Moscow in the wake of the Salisbury nerve agent attack and urged Theresa May to impose a freeze on Russian assets in Britain. Quizzed about the hypocrisy with regard to his firm\u0027s Russian links on BBC1\u0027s The Andrew Marr Show today, Mr Rees-Mogg said SCM would be open to legal action if it based its business on his “political opinions”.  He said: “Somerset Management is an emerging markets investment management company. We manage clients’ money - it\u0027s not our own money, it\u0027s clients’ money.” The Brexiteer MP added: You\u0027re assuming I make money from these investments. I don\u0027t. These aren\u0027t my investments. “Our job is to invest in emerging markets for our clients using their money. We have to do that as well as we can under the law. “We would be opening ourselves up to legal actions if we decided that my political opinions should influence the investments. That would be quite improper. There is no suggestion Somerset Capital Management or Mr Rees-Mogg have done anything illegal.  Mr Rees-Mogg denied directly making cash from the investments in Russian firms but admitted he could benefit by second degree as a part-owner of SCM. He added: We can’t run our investments on my political opinions. I think we should be much tougher on Russia. I think we should impose the level of sanctions that America has imposed on Russia. Meanwhile, he also heaped pressure on Theresa May over Brexit. He urged the Prime Minister to take a tougher line with Brussels after making errors in her Brexit negotiation strategy. The chairman of the influential European Research Group, tipped as a potential future Tory leader, insisted there was no menace in me at all over his actions. But he claimed the Government had proposed over-complicated solutions to the customs problem and must be prepared to tell Brussels it will walk away without paying the almost \u0026pound40 billion Brexit divorce bill.

Logan Johns-Evans was rushed to hospital after his mum Jade Johns found him unresponsive when she went to wake him up for school. She said the youngster had smoked a rolled-up cigarette but he had no idea the synthetic drug Spice was put in it as a joke.  Ms Johns told Wales Online that her son reacted as though a “monster had taken over his body” - and she\u0027s shared shocking photos showing him unconscious in his hospital bed.   The mum, from Wildmill, South Wales, said the drug could not be tested for in her son\u0027s urine or blood, but doctors checked his symptoms and made a clinical decision that he was suffering from the effects of Spice. The drug can cause fast heart rate, vomiting, confusion and violent behaviour, although many users are often pictured slumped over in town or city centres looking like zombies. Ms Johns said she and her family were beside themselves with worry as her son lay unresponsive in a bed at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend.  Ms Johns said: “He woke up at 3am and I thought he was sleepwalking because he was trying to make his way out the door and he was making no sense. “I put him back to bed and at 6.40am I went to wake him up for school and he couldn’t speak or stand so we whisked him to hospital. “He was in resus on high dependency. He was like a zombie. A monster had taken over his body and he had so much strength it was unreal.  “It was scary because he couldn’t speak and there was nothing in him. There was no response to his eyes or the light in his pupils, the only way you could describe it was like a zombie because nothing was making sense. “In hospital he became angry and he had so much strength but the doctors said he didn’t know what was going on. It wasn’t an 11-year-old child inside that body. “My daughter told me he had been smoking and someone came forward to say someone had put Spice in his rolly as a joke.” Around 33 hours after arriving at hospital, Logan came around and became his normal self but he had no memory of what had happened and believed he had only just arrived at hospital.

Joshua Connolly-Teale, 16, passed away on a camping trip near Dewhirst Road in Syke, Rochdale, yesterday morning, the Manchester Evening News reports.   Emergency crews descended on a field in the area after police received reports of concerns for the welfare of a teenager shortly before 11.15am.  They sadly discovered that Joshua had died. Three other teenagers were hospitalised for treatment and have since been discharged, police say. Officers are now investigating the circumstances surrounding Joshua\u0027s death - as his heartbroken mum has paid tribute to her wonderful and loving son. “He was lovely,” said grieving mother Joanne Teale.  “We are really, really proud of him and we’re really going to miss him so much.” Cheeky Joshua was in the middle of his GCSE exams and was taking a break from revision when he left his home in Rochdale on Friday night. He had been working hard and cramming for the tests, and had sat an exam on Friday morning before taking the break from his revision schedule. The teen told his mum he would spend the night camping with three friends and two adults in fields in the Syke area to the north of the town. But yesterday morning, emergency services were scrambled to the field and discovered that the schoolboy had tragically passed away. According to Joanne, Joshua was on track to get some good results and had been looking forward to studying game development at Hopwood Hall College. The St Cuthbert’s RC High School pupil loved art and IT.  He was also a keen video gamer, and enjoyed playing football with his sisters, trampolining and fishing with his dad, Geoff. He had recently celebrated the birth of his sister Becca’s little girl, Madison. Joanne said her son was delighted to be an uncle and doted on baby Madison. She said: “Josh really loved her. He was really good with her and was looking forward to spending time with her. He was so pleased and proud to be an uncle. “He was close to his brother and all his sisters, especially Lauren because they were about the same age. She said her boy was excited to push little Madison around in her pushchair. “He had a lot of mates and he was really funny, she added. We used to call him Victor Meldrew if he was being grumpy. And he would tickle me to make me jump - he was funny.

As boy soldiers in 1958, thousands of this country’s fittest young men were ordered to a tropical paradise to take part in the biggest military operation since D-Day. Today they have been honoured by the impoverished islanders who still live in the testing grounds – while in the UK successive governments continue to obstruct calls for official recognition. Ron Watson, 79, organised the trip to remind the British they are still fighting. He said: “A medal doesn’t take away the problems people had when they came home. But it relieves the psychological pressure we have been under for 60 years. “An official medal recognises that we made a sacrifice for our country. When you go to war in Afghanistan you know the risks – but in the nuclear tests we had no idea. Nobody did. We were the guinea pigs.”   To show your support for an official medal for the nuclear veterans by signing the petition - CLICK HERE .    Former Royal Engineer Ron was just 19 when he was part of Operation Grapple, the crucial campaign to build a hydrogen bomb. It was held on a coral island 2,000 miles south of Hawaii, where a total of 22,000 servicemen were ordered to build the infrastructure for, and bear witness to, dozens of nuclear tests. Ron, like all the others, wore little but shorts and boots as they were ordered to muster with their backs to the beach, squat down and cover their eyes. “There was a flash so strong you could see the bones in your fingers like an X-ray,” said Ron, from Warboys, Cambs. “Then a terrific heatwave like an electric heater being waved across your bare back, a crack and a rumble. Fellers who stood up too soon were knocked to the ground by it all. When we were told to stand and look, there was a great ball of fire in the sky. Afterwards we just got on with the day job.” Ron lost all his teeth within two years of returning home. He and his daughter have both had tumours removed their thyroids – the organ where radiation is known to accumulate. And his wife suffered two later-term miscarriages, which led to divorce.  Research has shown a third of the test vets were dead before 1999, many in their 50s from radiogenic cancers. A 2007 study found their wives report three times the normal number of miscarriages. They have an estimated 155,000 descendants, who suffer 10 times the usual amount of birth defects.    Now four of the Cold War heroes have made a pilgrimage to the testing grounds at Christmas Island – since renamed Kirimati - to mark the 60th anniversary. Along with Ron were former RAF technician Leslie Hawkins, 81, from Horley, Surrey, and another two ex-Royal Engineers Robert McCann, 79, from Romsey, Hants, and Ray Carbery, 80, from the Isle of Man. Ray, who has constant bowel problems and a severely autistic son, said: “What people don’t realise is they didn’t send the weedy guys. They gave us all medicals first, we were the healthiest they had. “The surprise isn’t that some of us aren’t so bad, it’s that so many healthy men aren’t here any more. Whatever happened on Christmas Island killed the fittest lads in the armed forces. Out of the 12 in my unit, half died of blood cancer.” The veterans took with them toys and books for the schoolchildren, as well as blood pressure monitors, surgical gloves and stethoscopes for the hospital, all paid for from their own pensions. They were feted by the island’s political leaders, shown demonstrations of local dancing, and taken on a tour to the south of the island to find the wreckage left behind by the British: rusting metal huts, overgrown bunkers, and concrete plinths to which bomb balloons were tethered.  And at a special commemoration service, they were invited to dedicate a new memorial built by the islanders. Speeches were exchanged and the four old soldiers bore the standard of the British Nuclear Test Veterans’ Association Ron said: “It’s ironic that that the o.nly people prepared to recognise what we did are on the other side of the world. Our own government doesn’t have the decency to do the same.” In the UK no nuclear test veteran has ever been invited to meet a Prime Minister. Around 90% of those who seek war pensions are refused, and despite the MoD’s scant records are required to provide proof of their radiation dose. And more than \u0026pound17m has been spent fighting successive court claims and war pension appeals. Leslie has made three return trips to Christmas Island but says this will be his last. He said: “We’re probably the last ones who’ll ever make that journey, so it was important to go. “It would be nice to have a medal rather than have it swept under the carpet. There’s not many of us left so it wouldn’t cost much.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kevin maguire tories defenceless military","story":"NewsopinionKevin Maguire: Tories defenceless on military pay cutWeakening trade unions and stripping employment protection under the cover of cutting red tape when the gig economy’s falsely ­self-employed cabbies and couriers suffer as much or more as the employed, is what drives these Tories as it did the old\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByKevin MaguireAssociate editor22:06, 27 MAY 2018NewsopinionZero hours contracts have become an increasing curse (Image: Getty)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOffhand Tory Caroline Dinenage’s contemptuous dismissal of desperately low-paid local women being cheated of \u0026pound500 a year tells a bigger national scandal. The brazen Gosport MP and junior Health Minister is proving an enemy rather than an ally as cooks and cleaners at military bases on \u0026shyPortsmouth Harbour fight a contractor’s dirty tricks. This column last October revealed the plucky Fort Blockhouse group’s brave if unequal fight against ESS, part of Compass Group with a Fat Cat \u0026pound5.8m boss, after the corporate bloodsuckers unilaterally decided to stop paying them for two weeks of the year. I regret to report deadbeat Dinenage fobbed off the women when they asked for help, doing the bare minimum as far as I can see in writing to junior Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood then forwarding his worthless reply to a union official without the courtesy of a covering letter. Acknowledging “strength of feeling”, Ellwood added offence to \u0026pound500 injury – two weeks’ pay – by hiding behind MoD contracts, deals granting bad employers green lights to short-change loyal staff. Unite regional officer Bob Middleton’s judgement that the Tory pair “washed their hands” of indefensible abuse is bang on the money.  Gosport is a small piece of a large jigsaw as exploitation at work spreads rapidly and proliferating zero hours contracts become an increasing curse. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady says she’s met Germany’s powerhouse Angela Merkel more often in the last two years than she has Theresa May. A Tory PM who sees CBI business chiefs monthly, but grants a sole audience to the champion of six million workers, betrays the anti-grafter mentality of Conservativism. May, Dinenage, Ellwood and too many of their Tory colleagues instinctively identify with the boss not the bossed, the exploiter not the exploited. Weakening trade unions and stripping employment protection under the cover of cutting red tape when the gig economy’s falsely \u0026shyself-employed cabbies and couriers suffer as much or more as the employed, is what drives these Tories as it did the old.

Thomas and Rebekah Entwistle feel like “hostages” after the structure was put up just 2ft from their front window, blocking the stunning view from their rural home. Music teacher Thomas, 27, and Rebekah, 24 believe the barrier was erected by a farmer who is understood to be involved in a dispute with their estate’s developer over land borders. The pair, who wed in July, moved into the \u0026pound220,000 four-bed property on a Persimmon Homes estate in Blackburn, Lancs, just before Christmas. The fence was in place when they got back from the Dominican Republic last month.  Thomas said: “This was our dream home – now it’s turned into a nightmare. It feels like we are imprisoned in our own house. “The fence is 2ft from our front window – it’s like having the Berlin Wall in front of our home.” “We are being held hostage in a land dispute which is nothing to do with us.  We bought [the house] because of the view, which has now been replaced by a huge wooden fence. Rebekah is always in tears. She is in despair.” He continued: “We’re not even sure we want to live here now. “We keep the curtains closed in the front room, and spend most of our time upstairs.

Police are investigating after Georgia Jones, 18, and 20-year-old Tommy Cowan - aka Tommy Bakeer - were both rushed to hospital after falling ill just 20 minutes apart at Mutiny Festival but sadly died. There are claims tonight that people were taken ill at the festival after taking so-called \u0027Green Heineken\u0027 MDMA tablets. A total of 15 people at the dance music festival were taken to hospital, with one still in critical condition and organisers cancelled the festival today over safety concerns. Just hours after Georgia’s death, her heartbroken mother posted a tribute to her daughter who was “full of life” and urged other drug users to learn from her death. She said her daughter suffered a 45-minute long fit after taking ‘two pills’ at the event in Portsmouth, Hants, where headliners included Dizzee Rascal on Saturday night, and Craig David due to headline on Sunday.  Hampshire Constabulary said the two deaths, which are not being treated as suspicious, were separate incidents before organisers cancelled the rest of the festival this morning. Eyewitness Sam, 20, revealed that people were taking ecstasy tablets nicknamed “Green Heinekens” at the festival and that is what is believed to have caused the emergency. He said: “I saw the girl on the ground being treated by paramedics, it was a horrendous sight, she was in a very bad way. “People said she may have had two pills and if they were the Green Heinekens I can see why as my friend only had one and he was in a right state afterwards. “We had not heard anything about any drug warning, but as soon as people started getting ill it was blamed on the Green Heinekens.”  Mutiny Festival, held at Portsmouth’s King George V playing fields, was expected to attract 30,000 revellers over the course of the two-day event. On Thursday, just two days before the pair died, police said they would be clamping down on drugs at the event. Tributes have since been flooding in to the two young adults. Janine Milburn, Georgia’s mother, said “my little girl was 18 and full of life” and “I just hope this stops at least some of you ending up the same”. Her heartbreaking post read: “As I have now spoken to family members I can now say Georgia died yesterday due to complications after taking two pills at Mutiny. “If nothing else I hope what has happened to her will deter you from taking anything ever.” She continued: “The pills had caused her temperature to rise so high it made her fit for 45 mins. “This then caused her muscle to break down and turn her blood acidic. Her heart was irregular and stopped numerous times and then her lungs filled with blood and fluid and I made the decision to turn everything off. “My little girl was 18 and full of life, I just hope this stops at least some of you from ending up the same.” Georgia’s family did not wish to make a comment when a reporter visited their home in Havant, Hants. The family of Tommy, who goes by Tommy Bakeer and Cowan and is also from Havant, also did not wish to speak.

Though heavy downpours could continue for some of the day, temperatures could potentially surpass the 2018 record of 29.1C on April 19 in St James\u0027 Park, central London. The UK was battered by rain, hail and thunderstorms, with flash flooding leaving a major route into Birmingham impassable because of water up to 5ft deep.  The Met Office said a site at Winterbourne, in Edgbaston, recorded 58mm of rainfall in just one hour on Sunday afternoon, and 81mm in a 12-hour period. The monthly average for the West Midlands region in May is 55mm, meteorologist Craig Snell said.  But he said the torrential rain had been very localised, pointing out that another site 10 miles away at Coleshill recorded just 3mm of rain in 12 hours. Mr Snell said: We won\u0027t see the scenes we saw last night.  There could be a few very short-lived thunderstorms but overall it will be a much quieter night. Southern England was struck by lightning between 15,000 and 20,000 times on Saturday night into Sunday morning. The Environment Agency has more than 20 flood warnings and more than 40 flood alerts in place covering much of Central England.  A yellow weather warning for rain is also in place from the afternoon for large swathes of East Anglia, the South East including London, the South West and Wales. But Mr Snell said temperatures could hit highs of 28C or 29C in the South East, potentially surpassing the 2018 record of 29.1C on April 19 in St James\u0027 Park, central London.

The report, published by Las Vegas news station KLAS, reveals new details of the November 2004 encounter including first hand reports from shocked US Navy personnel.  A video of the strange object, shaped like a Tic Tac mint, emerged last December.  And the report reveals further details of how the UFO was repeatedly spotted during training exercises over a six-day period off the coast of southern California and Mexico.  It was initially seen on radar by the crew of the USS Princeton on November 10, who referred to it in the report as an Anomalous Aerial Vehicle (AAV).  The missile cruiser\u0027s chief fire controlman said it started at an altitude of around 60,000ft - the furthest the ship\u0027s radar could detect - before very rapidly dropping to 50ft. The object then darted away at such speed it was assumed to be a ballistic missile.  It was seen again on November 14, and several F/A-18 Hornet jets returning to the USS Nimitz were sent to try and trace the object. But they were unable to detect the UFO itself, with one of the pilots instead reporting a circular disturbance in the water between 50 and 100 metres in diameter. A Hawkeye surveillance aircraft was also unable to get a lock on to the UFO.  According to the report, it was possible the disturbance was being caused by an AAV but the AAV was \u0027cloaked\u0027 or invisible to the human eye. Another theory was the object had a highly advanced capability to operate undersea completely undetectable by our most advanced sensors. The object was later described by witnesses as an elongated or a \u0027Tic Tac\u0027 shape and said it was around 46ft long, solid white, smooth, with no edges.  It was uniformly coloured with no nacelles, pylons or wings, the report claimed.  F/A-18 pilot David Fravor later revealed the object appeared to notice the US aircraft before zooming away.  He said: It takes off like nothing I\u0027ve ever seen. One minute it\u0027s here, and off, it\u0027s gone.

The man, likened to web-slinging superhero Spiderman after the incident, sprang into action after the four-year-old boy was seen desperately clinging to a balcony in Paris on Saturday afternoon. Fire crews had already been called to the building at Rue Marx-Dormoy in the French capital\u0027s 18th arrondissement with a terrified neighbour on the neighbouring balcony struggling to help the boy back up.  And one brave man started climbing before emergency services arrived, with jaw-dropping social media footage showing him risking his life.  The man is seen clambering up the building, floor by floor, using only his bare hands to get a grip.

Everything happened so fast. He did not think, he went straight up. People were screaming, they were shocked.  When we saw that he had finally managed to climb up there, everyone shouted in relief. Both the hero and the boy were looked after by firefighters. The child escaped with just a torn nail, while the man suffered scratches from his climb.

The group\u0027s guru, hippy Georg Berres, claims he only found out it was the former champ\u0027s holiday home when German media turned up on the doorstep. Mr Berres said he wants to give the villa, named Son Coll in the rural north-east town of Arta, a spruce-up. Squatters have already cut weeds and picked up rubbish around the property. But Mr Berres, a 44-year-old carpenter, insisted this week he would leave if police turned up to tell him to go.   As of today, no complaint from the owner of the Majorca house is thought to have been received by Civil Guard officers.   Becker , 50, was declared bankrupt last June after blowing his \u0026pound100m fortune.  The triple Wimbledon champion’s wife Lilly vowed to stand by him but revealed in March their marriage came close to collapsing.  The retired tennis star purchased his Majorcan villa in 1995 and briefly put it on the market in 2007 for a figure reported to be close \u0026pound13million before withdrawing it shortly afterwards. Locals in Arta said last year around the time he was declared bankrupt they had not seen Becker for years. The pundit is thought to own Son Coll through a Spanish company.

Prior to that the Tangerines were unbeaten in 15 of 16 league games he played.With the 25-year-old set to return around the start of the new season, Duff believes it was vital United beat off interest from Championship rivals Ross County to get him fixed up on a new two-year contract. Having known him since he was a kid at Aberdeen the best part of a decade ago, Duff is well placed to judge what he can do.“I actually watched one of United’s play-off games with Fraser and from speaking to him I know he is working hard to get back fit,” he said.“He’s about to start running again so it shouldn’t be too long before he is back. That, and him signing a new deal, is very good news for United.“You saw the quality he has when he played for part of last season.“He was a bit of a stand-out in the United team and I will not be surprised if that’s the case again next season.“It really will not surprise me if they build the team around him because that’s the level of ability he has.”With most of last season’s team gone, Fyvie will be surrounded by new faces.That will make United something of an unknown quantity and bringing so many players in at one time has to be something of a gamble.For Duff it’s a calculated risk and, so long as the right type of player is sourced, he believes the team can gel.“I think if you go out and get the right players with the right attitude and philosophy, it can work.“You want players who want to come in and work hard to prove, basically, why the club signed them and that they should be playing at a club like United. If they do that then United can be where they want to be.”And having spent the best part of a decade at Tannadice from the start of his career, he would like nothing better than to see them back in the top flight.Last week he was back in a United strip for Dave Bowman’s annual game to raise cash for skin cancer and dementia charities. Running out at Tannadice reminded Duff where United should be.“You look around the place and it’s geared up for the Premiership but no one has the divine right to be there, you have to earn it. It will be a battle again next season because it’s a tough league.“But I was here nine-and-a-half years from when I was a kid and the upbringing here was very good – second to none – so I want United back up.”At 36, and despite recently taking on a new job with the Connect Energy Group that involves a lot of travelling, Duff has no plans to hang up his own boots.Next season he’ll again be plying his trade in the Highland League with Inverurie Locos.“The new job is keeping me busy but I do get Saturdays off so I’m available and happy to keep playing.“We finished third last year, so the aim is to go a bit higher next season.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/Sbro_Viridor_Fire_Perth-8.jpg.jpg ","title":"lithium ion batteries may have

the club and Transport Scotland have already taken place but the authority will only give their verdict once they’ve received detailed proposals.“Road safety is of paramount importance for everyone

That still amazes Dixon.“Honestly, knowing Kev’s talent when he went down to Burnley and got promoted to the Premier League, I expected him to do what Virgil van Dijk and Andy Robertson have,” he said.“I was sure it would be a stepping stone to one of the top-six clubs down there because that is the kind of ability he has.“He was thrown in at the deep end at Dundee, like a few of us were, but he quickly became a very big player in the team and it wasn’t a surprise when English clubs started watching him every week.“Burnley seemed a good move for him because he was getting a game and they got promoted but something went wrong and it knocked him back for a while.“What exactly the story was I don’t know and maybe we never will, but for me the good thing is he is back in with a chance of getting up to the highest level again.“I have to say when you look at the clubs he’s played for down south and the number of games he’s had, you would never say he’s had a bad career.“It’s just that he belongs in their Premier League and I really do hope Fulham win tomorrow and he can spend the next few seasons at that level.”He notes with interest McDonald is no longer the attacking midfielder of his Dens days, but tends to be the man who sits a touch deeper.For him, that’s just a another sign of his all-round ability.“Kev was very much an attacking midfielder when we played together but the times I have seen Fulham on television this season he has had more of a holding role.“He can still get forward and chip in with a few goals and he’ll be a very important player for them at Wembley.”Such is the “small world” nature of football that McDonald is not the only reason Dixon will be rooting for the Cottagers in a game that could earn the winners £160 million, even if they were to be relegated this time next year.“Oliver Norwood plays beside Kev in their midfield and I played in the same team as him at Huddersfield, so it would be good to see them both go up.“I even know the other midfielder, Stefan Johansen because I played against him a few times when he was at Celtic and I was at United.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/08/598c50e5ced49-e1505748380849-940x557.jpg ","title":"poll do you back a name change for dundees dens park home","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDens Park could be set for a historic name change ahead of next season’s kick-off.The Tele revealed earlier this week that Dundee FC, which has played at Dens since 1899, may be set to incorporate the name Kilmac into the stadium title.Sources have said the name change would be similar to that introduced by former Premier League counterparts Partick Thistle FC, who now play at The Energy Check Stadium at Firhill.We want to know whether you think a naming rights deal is a good idea to give the Dark Blues more income.Simply answer yes or no below.Dens Park no more?
