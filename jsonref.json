Instead Harris\u0027 office pursued a life in prison without parole conviction.  Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein was invited to give a eulogy at Espinoza\u0027s funeral, where she called for the death penalty to be used in the case.  Feinstein received a standing ovation from the hundreds of rank-and-file officers at the funeral as Harris sat in the front row.Harris has made her prosecutorial experience one of her primary arguments for why she should take on President Donald Trump in 2020. \u0027My whole life, I\u0027ve only had one client: the people,\u0027 Harris said in January 2019 when she formally launched her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.\u0027Fighting for the people meant fighting on behalf of survivors of sexual assault - a fight not just against predators but a fight against silence and stigma.\u0027She ran for California attorney general in 2010 and for Senate in 2016. While in the Senate she made headlines for her questioning of Attorney General Bill Barr at a May 2019 hearing of the judiciary panel.\u0027Has the President or anyone at the White House ever asked or suggested that you open an investigation of anyone? Yes or no, please, sir,\u0027 she said to him. Barr stuttered and didn\u0027t answer her question.  From her perch on judiciary she\u0027s questioned a number of high-profile figures in hearings, including then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who said Harris\u0027 questions made him \u0027nervous\u0027 Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Trump\u0027s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.  She was one of the female senators who called for Senator Al Franken to resign after allegations of sexual harassment. She voted for both counts of impeachment against President Trump, who was acquitted by the greater Senate. Harris was born on October 20, 1964, in Oakland, California, across the bay in a much less affluent neighborhood than the one in which she would make her mark. Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was the daughter of an Indian diplomat and a women\u0027s rights activist, graduated from the University of Delhi at nineteen, and, in order to avoid an arranged marriage, went to the University of California at Berkeley to pursue graduate studies. There, she met another graduate student, Donald Harris, from Jamaica, who was studying for his Ph.D. in economics, during a political protest.Her parents orced when she was seven. Gopalan, who was one of the most prominent breast cancer researchers in the country, is credited by Harris as introducing her to the civil rights movement and social activism. \u0027My mother used to say, don\u0027t sit around and complain about things, do something,\u0027 Harris told 20,000 supporters at her kick-off rally in Oakland on Martin Luther King weekend 2019. Gopalan died of colon cancer in 2009. Harris\u0027 father is still alive but the two are not close.  He is a retired Stanford economics professor who studied issues like income inequality.Harris began her career as a lawyer in 1990, after graduating from Howard University in Washington D.C. and the University of California\u0027s Hastings College of the Law.She married Emhoff, a corporate lawyer in Los Angeles, at a small ceremony in 2014 after meeting him on a blind date the previous year. He has two children from a previous marriage: Cole and Ella. Harris calls herself \u0027Momala,\u0027 the name she says her stepchildren gave her. She is close to her sister Maya, who served as her campaign chairwoman. She also helped raised her niece, Meena, who was born when Maya was 17.  Her first job was at the Alameda County district attorney\u0027s office in Oakland, where Terence Hallinan plucked her to come work for him, starting her political ascendency. POLITICO Playbook¿s guide to veep stalking - POLITICO"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c06d014002a9691b7e0d8fc06ac00a53dab22d7b/0_409_1441_864/master/1441.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8642884e41f0987be9b665f3cc10c95f","title":"london borough of brent to get george michael mural by dawn mellor","story":"No, it’s not a careless whisper: a nine-metre-high image of the singer, by artist Dawn Mellor, is set to adorn BrentTurn a different corner in the London borough of Brent from September and you’ll be confronted with the strangest thing: a nine-metre mural of local hero George Michael.No this isn’t just a careless whisper.

Oil prices also headed higher.Airbnb is likely to be a target for investors that believe global hospitality and leisure industries will bounce back from the virus. Last year, the firm became one of the biggest names to say it would pursue a stock market float.Earlier this year, Airbnb raised $1bn in funding from private equity after dropping its internal valuation from $35bn to $26bn, although there was speculation that it could try and float at the higher price before the end of the year.An Airbnb spokesman declined to comment.Economists said the stock market was likely to appear detached from more immediate and difficult economic news for some time as investors looked ahead to the corporate winners over the next year.Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said there were further potential gains for equities over the coming months as long-term interest rates fell further and company earnings began to recover.Edward Moya, a senior analyst at New York-based stockbrokers Oanda, said investors also welcomed news that Russia had approved the world’s first Covid-19 vaccine and a better than expected German survey and US economic data.“But for record highs to be sustained, US-China relations need to see a major de-escalation. If the world’s two largest economies continue to deliver tit-for-tat punitive measures, big tech could ultimately drag global equities.”Expectations of a strong recovery in Germany reached to the highest level since 2004, according to a well-respected business survey “and that could spell good news for the overall outlook for Europe”, said Moya.In the US, hospitalisations for the coronavirus declined to the lowest level since early July and US Covid-19 deaths dropped for the first time in four weeks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e72d317ff7a22c8070e1a6ff65cea99f1c80d4dd/42_279_4190_2514/master/4190.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8875fb2a9d7d972e9ecd5f1826d5a4d","title":"uk government serco contact tracing contract leaked memo","story":"Email leaked to shadow health minister prompts questions over whether company was cherry-picked The government has been urged to demonstrate there was no favouritism at play in awarding Serco a contact-tracing contract worth £108m, as a leaked memo revealed the outsourcing firm was enlisted to help with the Covid-19 response as early as January.Serco is facing growing calls to be axed from any future involvement in contact-tracing services amid concerns over the performance of private firms contracted to trace people who have mixed with infected iniduals.An email leaked to Justin Madders, the shadow health minister, showed the company was approached by Public Health England in January over preparations to tackle the pandemic, prompting questions over whether it was “cherry picked” by the government and given the inside track.The £108m contract was directly awarded to Serco by the Crown Commercial Service on behalf of the Department of Health and Social Care (DoHSC) in May. It was not put out to open tender but selected via an existing framework of suppliers.It comes after the government announced on Monday that NHS test and trace was cutting 6,000 contact-tracer jobs and allocating roles to regional teams to work with councils, after criticism that the centrally run system was failing to tackle local outbreaks.Along with outsourcing firm Sitel, Serco has been contracted by the government to oversee “non-complex” contact-tracing cases in England, where call centre workers contact iniduals who have spent time with an infected person. The firm has been forced to defend its performance, however, after figures showed just over half of people from the same household as an infected person were being contacted. Concerns have been raised by contact tracers that they have made just a handful of calls and feel untrained.With Serco’s £108m three-month contract up for renewal on 23 August, the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, and the shadow Cabinet Office minister, Rachel Reeves, jointly wrote this week to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, urging him not to hand Serco any more money to run contact tracing. They are calling on the government not to extend the contract, which could be worth up to £410m.On Tuesday Madders released an email that he said was sent to Serco contact tracers in early June on behalf of the firm’s customer services director, Garry Robinson, which suggested the company had been contacted by health officials in January asking for help.In the email, Robinson conceded it had been a slow start but stated there would be a “steady increase in the workload” in the coming weeks. In a section titled “journey so far”, he detailed the company’s early involvement in the pandemic response, writing: “I received a call from Public Health England officials on 22 January, explaining there was a virus in China, which was causing them concern, and they asked if I could stand up a small team in case they required urgent support. Since then, I have been responsible for a number of support lines across various government departments offering support to citizens of the UK concerned about their health, the financial impact CV-19 has had on them, their children’s education and the impact on their companies.”Madders told the : “That email went out to contact tracers in early June and suggests Serco was cherry picked very early on by the government to get involved in the pandemic response. It looks like they’ve had the inside track from the start. It begs the question, why was Serco asked as early as January to get involved in the government’s response to the pandemic?“It’s clear that adequate procurement processes were not followed when Serco was later awarded a £108m government contract to oversee contact tracing. Like with some PPE contracts, this seems to be creating a bit of stench. It’s up to the government to demonstrate there was no favouritism at play here.”Cat Hobbs, director of We Own It, an organisation that campaigns for public ownership of public services, urged the government to give the money it could spend on renewing private contact-tracing contracts to local authorities. “Local teams have the tools and the local knowledge they need to do this vital work before any second wave this winter. Now they need the money,” she said.A government spokesperson said: “As a result of public and private sector organisations working together at pace, we were able to protect our NHS and strengthen our response to this unprecedented global pandemic. Contracts have been awarded completely in line with procurement regulations for exceptional circumstances, where being able to procure at speed has been critical in the national response to Covid-19.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93396bf68ea67ae6f669a19a90e38722bda0f886/0_217_6500_3901/master/6500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7729775e08295cf3c4a56dd52aedd477","title":"uk staff how is your employer introducing a sense of community to a virtual office coronavirus","story":"We would like to hear about how you are staying in touch with colleagues while working remotely due to coronavirusHow are employers helping homeworking colleagues keep in touch with each other?

What about humanity? Bosses don’t often play down their products. Sam Altman, the CEO of artificial intelligence company OpenAI, did just that when people went gaga over his company’s latest software: the Generative Pretrained Transformer 3 (GPT-3). For some, GPT-3 represented a moment in which one scientific era ends and another is born. Mr Altman rightly lowered expectations. “The GPT-3 hype is way too much,” he tweeted last month. “It’s impressive … but it still has serious weaknesses and sometimes makes very silly mistakes.”OpenAI’s software is spookily good at playing human, which explains the hoopla. Whether penning poetry, dabbling in philosophy or knocking out comedy scripts, the general agreement is that the GPT-3 is probably the best non-human writer ever. Given a sentence and asked to write another like it, the software can do the task flawlessly. But this is a souped up version of the auto-complete function that most email users are familiar with.GPT-3 stands out because it has been trained on more information – about 45TB worth – than anything else. Because the software can remember each and every combination of words it has read, it can work out – through lightning-fast trial-and-error attempts of its 175bn settings – where thoughts are likely to go. Remarkably it can transfer its skills: trained as a language translator, GPT-3 worked out it could convert English to Javascript as easily as it does English to French. It’s learning, but not as we know it.But this is not intelligence or creativity. GPT-3 doesn’t know what it is doing it is unable to say how or why it has decided to complete sentences it has no grasp of human experience and cannot tell if it is making sense or nonsense. What GPT-3 represents is a triumph of one scientific paradigm over another. Once machines were taught to think like humans. They struggled to beat chess grandmasters. Then they began to be trained with data to, as one observer pointed out, “discover like we can” rather than “contain what we have discovered”. Grandmasters started getting beaten. These days they cannot win.The reason is Moore’s law, the exponentially falling cost of number-crunching. AI’s “bitter lesson” is that the more data that can be consumed, and the more models can be scaled up, the more a machine can emulate or surpass humans in quantitative terms. If scale truly is the solution to human-like intelligence then GPT-3 is still about 1,000 times smaller than the brain’s 100 trillion-plus synapses. Human beings can learn a new task by being shown how to do it only a few times. That ability to learn complex tasks from only a few examples, or no examples at all, has so far eluded machines. GPT-3 is no exception.All this raises big questions that seldom get answered. Training GPT-3’s neural nets is costly. A $1bn investment by Microsoft last year was doubtless needed to run and cool GPT-3’s massive “server farms”. The bill for the carbon footprint – a large neural net is equal to the lifetime emissions of five cars – is due.Fundamental is the regulation of a for-profit OpenAI. The company initially delayed the launch of its earlier GPT-2, with a mere 1.5bn parameters, because the company fretted over its implications. It had every reason to be concerned such AI will emulate the racist and sexist biases of the data it swallows. In an era of deepfakes and fake news, GPT-style devices could become weapons of mass destruction: engaging and swamping political opponents with isive disinformation. Worried? If you aren’t then remember that Dominic Cummings wore an OpenAI T-shirt on his first day in Downing Street."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92affcac648deb900f6acbfe2721cfebf04fe3fd/0_2_6016_3609/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7dd587107860917497dec10dcbba5d1c","title":"a level students tell us how youre feeling about getting your results","story":"We’d like to hear from sixth form students about the upcoming results dayThis week, the Scottish Qualifications Authority came under fire after admitting it downgraded nearly a quarter of all the recommended A-level results, heightening existing fears that school leavers’ grades would be negatively impacted by the pandemic across the UK.However, some assessment experts have said that this year’s results, based on a combination of teachers’ recommendations, class ranking and the past performance of their schools, and statistical modelling by examiners, will be fairer than ever.As results day approaches, we’d like to hear from students about how they’re feeling, and what they’re expecting.You can get in touch by filling in the form below.

They casually dish out hugs, wipe tears and help blow snotty noses, all without any hint of anxiety or signs of protection. These people work in children’s nurseries.I found it so strange to see people, as a matter of routine, put aside the messages coming out of press conferences around the world about the risks of being in close contact with others. It’s something they have to do each time they pick up and hug a crying and blubbering child. They don’t reach for masks and gloves, but for the kids instead.Leaving the outside world full of people in masks and gloves dodging each other on buses and in shops, ever vigilant of their own personal buffer zones, and coming into the local authority-funded nursery is like going back in time to when other people weren’t a mortal danger to us all.But they tell me it has to be this way. Without normality and contact and support, the children will suffer. Just as plants need water and sunshine, children need a loving and caring environment. As the Harlow experiment from the 1950s and 60s showed, primate infants will forgo food for care and contact, and whether the people in the nurseries know of this experiment or not, they are all convinced that without care and contact the children will suffer.They are so sure of this that they are willing to place themselves in harm’s way. Of course they take precautions, such as constantly cleaning, but you’re fooling no one when you pick up a blubbing child that then tries to bury itself into your neck.These people’s radiant beliefs are so tangential to those that result in empty clapping outside No 10 that I find it almost hard to find my bearings, until I’m back on the streets and surrounded by sideways glances once more.“I’ll be honest, at first, it was quite frightening. I’m sure we’d all like to stay at home and keep safe, but that’s just not the way the whole world works. I’d imagine the parents that have to go to work too, and how they feel leaving their children. It’s so important for their day at work, that they know that their children are safe and happy at nursery. I’m a mum, and I’m a key worker, and that for me would mean everything.“I imagine that they’re going to work every day frightened – will they get ill, what will happen to their child, how are they going to keep the roof over their heads? And so allI could do is come into work myself and put my best foot forward, thinking if we can make their children’s life a little bit better, it’ll make their day a lot better too. At least they know that their child is safe. And so I just thought, come on, you know? My son’s safe, he’s out of harm’s way. And as long as I keep myself well, I can keep on doing what we’re supposed to be doing.“But I also wanted to show my son a good role model: that through tough times, through uncertain times, I can still get up and be positive, and bring a little bit of positivity to the children here in the nursery too, because they don’t really understand what’s going on. It’s quite frightening for them – the world’s changed all of a sudden in their eyes. So I just thought, I’m a mum, come here to the nursery and let the children’s parents know that they’re in safe hands – that was my everyday get-up-and-go thought.”“Kids require contact because they need the reassurance that that brings. You’ve got to understand that these are very young children, and they’re still very vulnerable. They need to feel like they’re in a secure and safe environment, and so you have to show them that kind of love. It’s just not possible to stand 2 metres away from them, wearing a facemask and gloves. Your face is one of the primary ways in which you communicate with a young child, especially as a lot of the time their language isn’t there yet.“If we’re treating the children differently from how we did before this whole situation – if we were not giving them cuddles, if we were not being attentive to their needs, if we were not in close proximity with them – then they’ll pick up on that, and we’ll have a bigger problem because the children won’t feel safe and secure.“To be honest, it didn’t really bother me being in close proximity with others while everyone else in the country wasn’t, because I know what this job entails. To do it properly, you need to have that tactile environment, and so there’s no point in saying I’m not going to do X, Y and Z. You’ve just got to get on with it.“We’re not doing anything different now, we’re still doing what we were doing in January, in November and last summer, and that is to provide children with a really stimulating, loving and caring environment in which they can flourish. It’s as necessary for a child as sunshine and water is for a plant.”“With Covid, we are much more thorough with the cleaning. Previously we’d clean the toys, tables, door handles and surfaces probably twice a day, but now it’s every 30 minutes. That’s a major, major difference, and it’s taking up much more of our time.“Another is splitting the rooms. So for example, the toddler room now has no more than 10 children, although before it was more like 20. And it’s going to be an ongoing challenge because we’ll need a lot more staff to be in different areas. And even a lot more rooms.“I think everyone needs to understand that with children it’s not possible to social distance. They don’t understand, and you can’t just tell them ‘don’t hug your friend’ or ‘don’t go near your friend’ – that would just create an atmosphere that’s really negative for the children. On the one hand, you’re aiming for everything to be as normal as possible, but at the same time we have a duty to ensure that the environment is safe and that we’re following the guidelines that are set out by the government, though much of that is confused. “The management here are trying their best with the information that they’re being given by the government, but so much of that doesn’t seem to take into consideration that every centre is different, and that they can’t all just adapt and do all of these things that they’re telling us to do. It’s just not possible. For this reason, I think that the way we’re currently working is just not sustainable.“Before we had a much closer type of communication with the parents. They could actually come into the centre’s classroom and directly drop their children into the room, and see them go off and play with their friends, whereas now we just straight away take them from their parents and take them into the room ourselves. And at pickup we have to take the child to the entrance to meet their parents, and if you’re trying to give feedback to, say, five parents, it’s a little bit awkward and rushed, and so the parents might feel like they’re not really as involved in the centre as they were before. They don’t actually know what’s going on behind closed doors, and they don’t see the beneficial changes that we’ve made.“Because of the fear and anxiety of parents, some of the children might not come back to school. It is a worry for me, especially as a practitioner, knowing that some children are going to be left without an education, especially those children who are vulnerable and who need more of a push than other children. To accept that as a reality, is quite disheartening.”“These children’s parents are working on Covid wards, they’re GPs having to do emergency appointments, they’re seeing people face to face, and when they’ve finished their shift they’re coming to us. We open that gate, and what do they want to see? A child with a smiley face, that’s really tired and has had a really great day. The kids pick up on the slightest thing, so if you’re stressed you’ve got to turn it on. You want their journey through Covid to be as positive and happy as it could be.“I do think that there are some people, including myself at times, who have been in quite a fragile state of mind. I’m exhausted, more so than I ever have been, because you’re using your nervous energy. You’ve got worries as well, so you don’t sleep as well as sometimes.“When I get back home I’m exhausted. I use the buses as I don’t drive. And then it’s wash your hands, take your clothes off, have a shower – and I make sure and I’m wiping down everything in my home too, so it’s not just your shift here. But you do feel a sense of achievement, and I do feel that you need to have that, in order to go home, rest, eat some nice food, have a glass of wine and then come back the next day.”“The age group that I work with are too small to understand anything to do with Covid. Some of them don’t even speak yet. And when a baby cries, you can’t just leave them crying over there with you watching. They’re babies, we can’t do that. Even with the older children, when they come for a hug, you can’t just tell them to keep a distance.“It was weird in the beginning because, despite what I said about hugging the children, those children are coming from outside and we don’t know where they have been or whether they’ve had contact with anyone else, and so of course it was worrying to be at work and then go home and see my family, my two children and my husband, after that. But I can’t just tell a child to stay away from me. I can’t do that. They’re too small, they don’t understand that and they aren’t gonna get it.“In the classroom, we’ve had to remove everything like rugs, soft toys, blankets, Lego, books – everything. And the toys which we have kept on our floor, we have to spray them every single day to wash them and make them ready for the next day. So we make sure we spray everything, which is a lot more work, and you have to do it every day for them because they do touch it, in fact everybody touches it, or maybe they put in their mouths. So I make sure it’s nice and clean for them as well. They need it done for them.”“At first the pandemic was scary, but we have to face it. I think that if it’s meant to be, it’s meant to be. You can’t lock the door and stay away from it. And if you accept it, it’s not difficult. Then you don’t feel like you’re scared or vulnerable.“The first two weeks, I didn’t go out as I was off from work. And then, when I did go out, my eyes were hurting from the sun as it was so bright. And so from that day I said I’m not going to stay inside all the time because it’s not good – not for your brain, for your body, or for everything else.“Some children here are coming from other nurseries, and that transition for them is very difficult. You need to make them both come here and be happy, all at the same time. It’s easy to put pressure on yourself, but when you do, the children get pressure as well. So first, the adults have to become calm, to get nice and smooth, and then the children will be too.“Without contact, it’s no good for them. It’s no good because children, when they play, they talk and move, and their brain and emotions develop. When they communicate with friends, they pick up speech. When they move, they become strong. So we just have to be calm, and then do as normal.”“This is the foundational stage for the child, one where they start to develop, and if they miss something there can be under-development. It’s important that they create a bond with people, with significant others, and with the people next to them. And if you are distant, you cannot create this bond. Instead you will disconnect with the child.“Children like to play, and if I say to them ‘no, no, don’t come to me,’ the child can look at me confused and ask ‘why don’t you want me? Yesterday you were playing with me, but today you won’t play with me?’ It’s very important for them to have continuous care and continuing provision, both educationally and emotionally, and if you’re far away from them, you lose this connection.“Without this, a child might start to cry, become very quiet or withdraw. If this happens at this age it could have a detrimental effect on the child, educationally and emotionally. But I think, in my personal opinion, the effect is more emotional, because at this stage the child needs this emotional support, and this attachment, to develop a better foundation.”“I’ve been at this nursery for 30 years, and in that time I would say this is the biggest challenge I’ve had to face, because it’s unlike anything we’ve ever known before. Friday was the announcement you’re going to close, and Monday we were back open just for vulnerable children and the children of key workers, all from different places.“So the phone started ringing and the referrals started to come in. I think the challenges were: how do these children adjust to new environments? What could we do to make sure that they had a good transition, to reassure parents from home, and send out messages and activities to them? We were really, really busy, with a small skeleton team. Myself and Fiona, the deputy manager, have worked really closely with Nick from Haringey council, and that’s been really instrumental in terms of advice and support.“I don’t think we have come up for air yet. Every day brings a different challenge. You come in and something’s changed, for example more calls for places for children whose families are key workers.“Previously we were offering places to 130 families, and now we’re accommodating 77 families, which is a lot of children in this environment. We’re working at a high percentage. But there are families staying at home who are not now having that face-to-face contact, and are not having their issues resolved quickly. Like before, a parent would come up and say: ‘Can I speak to you for a minute?’ And I would always make time. I’d have a little conversation, share a few techniques, and within two or three weeks that stress is over. But now it’s very different, which is a worry.“In general, looking at the national picture, I’m very worried, and not just educationally. By only staying home, children’s socialising and wellbeing is compromised.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16f202e6d30bfd7914eba25d905b40996706ff55/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b2f800f4a137b8769fceec90143b7c8","title":"keir starmer england must alter course on a level grades","story":"Gavin Williamson announces that pupils may use mock results if unhappy with gradesMinisters made an eleventh-hour bid to stave off a revolt over the handling of exam results on Tuesday night, granting pupils the right to use mock exam results if they are unhappy with their grades.The intervention, on the eve of the release of 730,000 A-level results decided by an algorithm on Thursday, follows growing alarm in Downing Street.The Scottish government was forced to take the extraordinary step of reinstating 124,000 downgraded results, and Labour had called on the government to change course on the system for deciding A-level results or risk “robbing a generation of young people of their future”.Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, abruptly announced that pupils could instead substitute the grades they received in mock exams held by their schools earlier this year – so long as the mocks were held under exam conditions and could be “validated” by the school.The offer would be open to pupils receiving A-levels or GCSEs, if they were unhappy with the grade awarded via the algorithm adopted by the exam regulator Ofqual to replace exams that were cancelled in the Covid-19 pandemic.But immediate concerns were raised that the partial climbdown will fail to help students with weak mock exam results, including those from disadvantaged backgrounds. The move is likely to anger many headteachers who opted to cancel mocks scheduled for March as the coronavirus lockdown encroached.Williamson said: “Every young person waiting for their results wants to know they’ve been treated fairly. By ensuring students have the safety net of their mock results, as well as the chance of sitting autumn exams, we are creating a triple lock process to ensure that they can have the confidence to take the next steps forward in work or education.The Department for Education also announced £30m available for schools to pay entry fees for the extra set of A-level and GCSE exams being held in autumn.Students will still be able to sit exams in autumn if they are unhappy with the grades they secured in mock exams, or if they are dissatisfied with results awarded by exam boards on Thursday. All three grades will hold the same value with universities, colleges and employers, the DfE will say.After a week of controversy, the Scottish education secretary John Swinney announced that all students awarded a worse result than their teachers predicted would see that decision reversed, affecting a quarter of total grades.The climbdown prompted calls for Swinney’s resignation – and piled pressure on Williamson.Lawyers warned that the Scottish U-turn could potentially lead to legal challenges in England when pupils from either side of the border competed for university places.There are particular concerns that the algorithm will disproportionately hit high-achieving pupils in schools without a history of strong grades.Starmer said: “The Scottish National party have been forced into a humiliating U-turn after a shambolic few days. With 24 hours before results are released, I would urge the prime minister to change course, or he risks robbing a generation of their future.“Pupils and parents are rightly worried that years of hard work are about to be undone because a computer has decided to mark their child down.”As in the now-discredited Scottish system, grades in England have been standardised on the basis of an algorithm. It relies on a school’s recent exam history and each pupil’s past exam results, as well as grades and rankings submitted by teachers.Labour is calling for a series of changes, including permitting inidual appeals, as in Scotland a “credible” system for allowing exam resits and statutory guidance to universities to ensure they take a flexible approach when it comes to offers.Party sources added that if Thursday’s results reveal widespread injustices, Labour would advocate a Scotland-style U-turn.Williamson’s department has been reassuring Tory MPs alarmed by events in Scotland that the outcome in England will not unfairly penalise disadvantaged students – a political flashpoint north of the border.But the National Union of Students (NUS) and the University and Colleges Union (UCU), which represents lecturers, were among the voices calling for the education secretary to follow Scotland’s lead.The UCU general secretary, Jo Grady, said: “Allowing algorithms to downgrade marks and hold students back was wrong. Many students’ life chances could still be damaged because of a clearly faulty system.”The NUS president, Larissa Kennedy, said: “This temporary measure must be taken to avoid a situation in which thousands of students do not receive the grades they deserve because of where they live.”Concerns were raised over Scotland’s decision putting it “out of kilter with the rest of the UK where standardisation is being used”, with English and Scottish pupils competing for the same university places based on different grades criteria.Labour’s calls for a straightforward appeals system was echoed by the Conservative chair of the education select committee, Robert Halfon, who said he would analyse Thursday’s results closely.“I very much hope that those from disadvantaged backgrounds will not suffer from unfair grading, but whatever happens there needs to be an appeals system that is second to none, and accessible to everyone, not just the sharp-elbowed and the well-heeled,” he said.Former Conservative education secretary Justine Greening also criticised the government’s approach, describing the A-level awards process as “levelling down in action” – a pointed reference to Boris Johnson’s “levelling up” agenda.She said: “It’s been bad enough for students losing months of education but A-level students now face their grades being downgraded essentially because of background and circumstances of their school. That’s levelling down in action and it’s totally unacceptable when it hits getting into university too.”Lib Dem education spokeswoman Layla Moran said: “Young people have already had their education derailed by the coronavirus crisis. They shouldn’t be further penalised by inaccurate grades.”“Ministers need to make the appeals process for A-level grades straightforward, with inidual pupils able to appeal directly to the relevant examination boards free of charge. They must also make clear the process for resits, again at no cost to pupils.”Williamson was already under pressure after appearing to pre-empt the results of a yet-to-be-published Public Health England study into Covid-19 infections in schools. He suggested the research “makes it clear there is little evidence that the virus is transmitted at school”.Amid reports that the study in fact showed older children may transmit the virus as readily as adults, health minister Edward Argar rowed back on Tuesday, saying: “I think we should be cautious about reading too much into that work in progress it’s important work but it isn’t complete yet.”During a school visit in east London on Monday, the prime minister defended the system being used to determine A-level grades in England, saying the government would “do our best to ensure that the hard work of pupils is properly reflected”.“Clearly, because of what has happened this year, there is some anxiety about what grades pupils are going to get, and everybody understands the system that the teachers are setting the grades, then there’s a standardisation system,” he said.But Downing Street will be keen to avoid fresh controversy over education, as Williamson battles to meet the prime minister’s promise that every school pupil will return to the classroom in England full-time next month.Leon Glenister, a barrister specialising in education law, said: “I struggle to see how the government can now refuse to apply the same rules in Scotland to England.“If a university gives a place to a student in Scotland on the original predicted grade, but then refuses a place to a student in England based on their standardised grade where their original predicted grade would have led to an acceptance, the university would probably be discriminating against the student in England and acting unlawfully.”In Wales, there is less concern about mass downgrading of A-level marks as the education system is modular and uses coursework, which has been all but dropped in England under reforms set in motion by former education secretary Michael Gove.Julie James, a Labour member of the Senedd, said: “We’re not expecting what happened in Scotland to happen here. We absolutely do trust our teachers and our headteachers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d518da9536a76e3f18f6c3c978d3ababf3977981/0_0_2374_1426/master/2374.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=3385032c00fe1a0665fdf8d93b79125e","title":"powerhouses nanotechnology turns bricks into supercapacitor batteries","story":"Research could pave way for cheap supercapacitor storage of renewable energyThe humble house brick has been turned into a battery that can store electricity, raising the possibility that buildings could one day become literal powerhouses.The new technology exploits the porous nature of fired red bricks by filling the pores with tiny nanofibres of a conducting plastic that can store charge. The first bricks store enough electricity to power small lights. But if their capacity can be increased, they may become a low-cost alternative to the lithium-ion batteries currently used.Strictly speaking, the power bricks are supercapacitors rather than batteries. Supercapacitors store electricity as a static charge in solids, rather through chemical reactions as in batteries. The advantage of supercapacitors is that they charge and discharge far faster than batteries, but to date they can only hold a small fraction of the energy.Researchers around the world are working to increase the energy density of supercapacitors, as well as the charging speed of batteries. Finding better ways to store electricity is a crucial part of fighting the climate crisis, as it would allow abundant but intermittent renewable energy to be stored until it is needed.“A solar cell on the roof of your house has to store electricity somewhere and typically we use batteries,” said Julio D’Arcy, at Washington University in St Louis, US, who was part of the research team. “What we have done is provide a new ‘food-for-thought’ option, but we’re not there yet.”But the hope is to eventually match the energy density of lithium ion batteries. “If so, this technology is way cheaper than lithium ion batteries,” D’Arcy said. “It would be a different world and you would not hear the words ‘lithium ion battery’ again.”Dan Brett, a professor of electrochemical engineering at University College London, UK, said: “Heat has been the overriding area of interest when considering energy storage within the fabric of buildings. This study shows there is potential to store electrical energy as well. The performance is a long way short of bespoke supercapacitors, but the principle is proven and there is significant scope for improvement.”The researchers created small prototypes of the power bricks using chemical vapours to react with the red iron oxides in the bricks and then to form a network of plastic nanofibres. A special plastic, called Pedot, was used as it is a very good conductor of electricity. The reactions turned the red bricks a dark blue colour.Another advantage of supercapacitors is that they can be charged and recharged many more times than batteries before losing their ability to store electricity. The power bricks can be cycled 10,000 times before their capacity falls significantly.The charge stored by the first bricks is too small to give a shock when touched. But a wall of connected bricks would need an insulating coating and the scientists demonstrated this using epoxy resin, which even allowed the bricks to work underwater.The reactions used to create the power bricks may have a small weakening effect on their structural properties, D’Arcy said, but in any case bricks were most commonly used today in houses as decorative facades.One company uses gravity to store energy by stacking large bricks into a tower, then releasing the energy by dropping the bricks back to the ground. Similar schemes using heavy weights and mineshafts are also being explored.Compressing air into a liquid to store energy is another option, with a large plant now in construction near Manchester, UK. Some experts are backing hydrogen, which can be produced by splitting water using renewable energy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f5030ea13b0355ba296fe307d29aecf5c44b40c/0_68_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=5a62293a777009ba96189396af90905d","title":"atalanta results are a really important cure covid19 bergamo people champions league","story":"Atalanta take on PSG in a Champions League quarter-final and hope to provide more succour for their Covid-19-ravaged cityFor two months, the wailing of ambulances cut into Bergamo’s soul. It knew no difference between bleak days and dark, tortured nights that came to seem endless. “The constant noise, you had to kill it in some ways, it was getting in your mind,” Franz Barcella says. “The news on television looked nothing like as bad as what those noises will tell you. You had fear, but it was more than fear for yourself.”The cruelty of what had hit Bergamo, which became the centre of Europe’s worst Covid-19 outbreak in March, was hard to reconcile. So was the spectrum of emotions when, on 10 March,Atalanta beat Valencia to reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League. The last-16 second leg was being played behind closed doors in Spain, with the extent of the disaster now becoming clear. Alberto Savi watched at home as Josip Ilicic swept in the team’s, and his own, fourth goal of a night that should have been the stuff of unfettered fantasy. The television commentators balanced their own incredulity by reminding Bergamo’s citizens to resist any urge to convene on the streets.“Nobody went outside,” Savi says. “It was quite strange. You’d imagine there would be a big celebration. But there was only silence, and sirens moving through the town.”Barcella remembers a strange, awful mental conflict. “From one side you have the highest moment of your football team, probably a point we will never reach again. On the other side you have the darkest hour of your city. It’s a complex mix of feelings. But in that moment, if I can be honest, the sense was of sadness.”The sirens are more or less silent now but, on Wednesday, the dualism will rear up again. Atalanta are Bergamo’s pride and joy they are “La Dea”, a 112-year-old institution hard-wired into the city’s every aspect. If they beat Paris Saint-Germain in Lisbon the records will show that they are one of Europe’s four best teams so will the visual evidence, given the intoxicating attacking football produced by Gian Piero Gasperini’s team. Outside Edone, the bar and cultural centre Barcella co-runs, a giant screen will be up and everyone will wait: first, for the result second, to see how far, if at all, football can succeed in healing the agony of an estimated 3,000 deaths around the city, and 17,000 in the Lombardy region.In one sense it has already helped. A mile to the city’s south-east, Dr Oliviero Valoti is standing in the centre of what, in happier times, the Bergamaschi know as its “Fiera” – an exhibition and trade centre. Above his head are signs pointing towards bars and other refreshment areas. At ground level there is the stark, silently apocalyptic sight of beds, ventilators and maze of screens separating six ad-hoc intensive care units. From 8 April this became the “red zone” of an emergency field hospital created to alleviate the enormous, devastating load placed on Bergamo’s main Ospedale Papa Giovanni XIII. The Fiera was completely repurposed after 10 days’ work, overseen by emergency and the medical corps of Italy’s Alpini mountain troops. Scores of volunteers helped, the majority of whom were recruited from among the ultras in Atalanta’s famed Curva Nord.“You’d see these people wearing an Atalanta jersey, running around from left to right, transporting materials and setting up panels to ide different departments,” Valoti says. “People with tears in their eyes as they worked, trying to take the smallest amount of time possible but while still doing everything perfectly, not just quickly.“We all found ourselves in the same boat. Shoulder to shoulder, fighting the same enemy. I think it can be described with a single word: emotion. The idea of working here in Atalanta’s colours was really emotional.”Valoti, a lifelong Atalanta fan, was in charge of overseeing the field hospital’s operations. Nowadays it operates on a surgery-like basis, performing follow-up checks on many of the thousands who were hospitalised locally. Around 150 patients eventually passed through here at a relatively late stage in the pandemic’s peak, and all bar one were saved. He lists some of the fans’ numerous fundraising initiatives and describes how Atalanta – who partly funded the ventilators – lent their own medical professionals to help out. Staff would work 10-hour shifts here they are heroes and so is Valoti. His feelings, upon standing in a building now silent except for the hum of electricity generators, are “difficult to control”. While Ilicic was outclassing Valencia, Valoti himself was ill with coronavirus the experience told him that, while the joy may be suppressed, anything Atalanta achieve now can only help make things better.“That night in particular I remember well, because I was really sick,” he says. “Seeing the team win, watching the game on the couch, was the best therapy. So I think their results, for the people of Bergamo who lived through this tragedy, are a really important cure.“At the moment the pressure of this epidemic began to decline, the psychological pressure reduced. But you saw the emergence of stress, depression … we registered a high number of suicides, even of young people. Perhaps the lockdown, the isolation, was a factor. So I think for those who have a passion for football, and put their heart into it, it certainly gives a bit of energy and relief.”Atalanta, steeped in the whip-smart ownership of the footballer-turned-entrepreneur Antonio Percassi, reflect that and so do today’s players. Ilicic, Duvan Zapata, Papu Gómez, Marten de Roon and the rest are more attached to the city than any of their predecessors, even though they are stars now and only two of the squad were born locally. They come from 14 countries but none of them left Bergamo during lockdown the trauma was more than a piece of distant bad news.“It was a crazy few months,” says De Roon, the former Middlesbrough midfielder. “I live in the centre and for five weeks there was no movement at all, no life on the streets. I looked high up to the old city, and low down both sides were like an abandoned city.“But this city is so connected with the team. Everybody in Bergamo is linked with Atalanta. We’re the ones who can give joy, give something back to people it’s all connected and if Atalanta plays nice football it helps to build up the city. We have players who have reached levels here that they never did before, growing with the club. You get a bond with the place, and you feel at home.”That partly explains why, in the early hours of last Tuesday morning, Barcella could be found among a group of supporters emblazoning giant posters backing Ilicic in five areas of the city. Ilicic will not face PSG for personal reasons, perhaps linked to the lockdown but perhaps not, and the concern was neighbourly beyond anything else. Savi saw some of them the next day. “We care about the person, the feeling of the player,” he says. “And after the situation we have had here, that is now even stronger.”De Roon says recent months “give us extra motivation”. Valoti describes a WhatsApp conversation in June with Gómez, the brilliant captain, asking how he had found the team’s return to training. “I’m devastated,” Gómez replied, referring to the physical and mental strain to which he had submitted himself in searing heat, tossing over the rawest of memories. “This tragedy certainly pushed them to achieve much more than they could have,” says Valoti of the players, who won nine of their 13 Serie A games after restarting. “I’m sure of it.”In allowing itself even the possibility to enjoy what should never have been achievable on the football pitch for a provincial city of 122,000, Bergamo might have exceeded its own expectations, too. Daniele Filisetti, a successful centre-back in Serie B with Atalanta before moving to Lazio in 1983, was another who contracted Covid-19. He says it “reduced my lungs to mush” and that his health as a footballer aided his recovery. “It was a slaughter,” he says. “We realised something was happening, but we didn’t immediately realise how terrible it was.”It was virtually impossible to, which is why most locals – including Valoti –play down the significance of the home leg with Valencia, played at San Siro in Milan, in which 44,236 fans delighted in a 4-1 win two days before the first significant cluster of cases was confirmed in Lombardy. “It gives me a bit of regret because we didn’t have the foresight,” Valoti says. “But there had been no evidence of a growth in contagion, so we didn’t have this sensation of worry.”There will inevitably be self-consciousness in the revelling if PSG are Atalanta’s latest scalp, but perhaps it will be accompanied by the revelation that tragedy and beauty can, in complicated and heart-rending ways, walk hand in hand. “A lot of people say football can heal the suffering, and I don’t see it like that,” Barcella says. “But this team are playing with sorrow and pain in their hearts, and with audacity in their eyes. It reflects what the city is doing.

On Monday the signing was announced and the day after Mewis was talking to the English media – while in quarantine – about the move.“It’s a little scary doing something new but I’m hoping that making this decision will continue to push me, develop me as a player and put in the best position to make the Olympic squad,” she said. “I want to try and make that roster. It’s a tough roster to make, I’ve never made it, so part of me is thinking how can I be in the best position possible.”A move overseas was always on the agenda, but the uncertainty meant it “crossed her mind” sooner than anticipated. “I wasn’t actively seeking anything out,” she says. “My agent brought this to me over the summer and my ears perked up because it was Manchester City, an awesome club. And I’d heard so many good things about the team and the league.”The pandemic “has thrown a lot of twists and turns for everyone and I thought this season here in the WSL was a good opportunity to push myself and grow. It felt like a good opportunity and I didn’t want to pass it up.”The 27-year-old attacking midfielder exemplifies the grit and never-say-die attitude embedded in the US team and is a shrewd second acquisition for the new City manager, Gareth Taylor, following the signing of the goalscoring winger Chloe Kelly from Everton.“I hope I can bring my attacking mindset,” says Mewis. “I’m known for being aggressive and going forward. I think it’s a mentality piece that I’ve learned from my club team and the US team. I haven’t played with this team yet but I want to be productive, get goals and assists and to help the team win games. It will be tough and I have to earn my playing time but I think and hope the American qualities in my game will help me to succeed here.”In quarantine, Mewis is yet to meet up with the squad and “no way”, she laughs, will she be mentioning the US defeat of England at the Women’s World Cup in France last summer when she does link up with the team that provides a huge contingent of players to the Lionesses squad.The arrival of the midfielder is the first big transfer from the NWSL to the WSL this summer and it is expected that more will follow her path. Mewis, though, is coy about the possibility of an influx. “I can’t speak for anyone else’s situation,” she says. “Some of my teammates have played abroad but it’s an inidual decision depending on where you are in your career and your life. I don’t see there being a huge influx but that’s just my opinion. There could be though, the WSL is such a great place to play.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/332a787b34325b9fc6277b686352aefc352b546d/0_86_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=d3f5395b54891a230c56f71ef424f9f2","title":"hadley freeman on the future of the royals","story":" columnist Hadley Freeman discusses the fallout from the publication of Finding Freedom, a biography of Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and the latest allegations surrounding Prince Andrew columnist Hadley Freeman tells Rachel Humphreys why 2020 is not shaping up to be a great year for the royals.

It had lain idle and fallen into disrepair over a number of years. It is the only track of its kind in the north of England and attracted a Covid-19-limited capacity of 100 competitors and 500 spectators for its first event, entitled Dragtastic, on the weekend of 8 August 2020.The fundraising effort and venue revamp was organised under the auspices of Straightliners, the West Yorkshire-based motorsport event organiser and club which tapped into its thousands of followers on social media. The revamp involved a complete resurface of the drag strip.The prestigious track was set-up in the late 1970s as York Raceway by the Murty family, who organised drag racing events for decades. It isa well-loved drag strip that has played a part in so many racers and enthusiasts lives. It became the north of England’s premier drag racing venue and generations of families have come here to test their nerve and machines. Unfortunately, Melbourne Raceway closed down in 2017, a heartbreaking development for the motorsport community.The relaunch of Melbourne Raceway is the next chapter in motorsport history in the north of England. The community came together and saved this iconic venue, once again reborn to live another day.Competing side by side in a two-lane raceway, the racers take off from a standing start after dramatic tyre burnouts and the first past the finish line wins. All runs are electronically timed under the auspices of the UK Timing Association (UKTA), with competitors receiving a personal performance print-out showing their times and speeds.Event organiser and founder of Straightliners, Trevor Duckworth, thanked everyone for their fundraising effortsand help in order to getting the eighth-of-a-mile track ready for the event. “It’s new tarmac, drivers,” he said at the start. “Don’t expect super fast times today. We need to lay down some rubber and get it going,” he said referring to the practice of heating up the tyres on the start pad. This makes the vehicle tyres grip and perform better but over time it makes the track grippier and therefore faster. As the first event got under way and rubber was laid, Duckworth said: “I had a dream and it’s now very much a reality. Melbourne Raceway lives and it’s time to create new memories and inspire the next generation of racer and teams.”Mark Flavell’s Funny Car 7.8 litre recorded the fastest time of the day powering down thetrack in 5.41 seconds.One of the big draws at the event was Force of Nature, a steam-powered rocket motorcycle designed, built (with the help of others) and ridden by Graham Sykes from north Yorkshire and powered solely by steam. Built for drag racing, record breaking, exhibitions and events, it uses the latent energy of super-heated pressurised water released through de Laval nozzles, where it turns to steam and creates the thrust to propel the bike.Another big name attendee was Kevin Nicks, who holds the world record for fastest shed. Nicks was racing on his latest creation Barrow of Speed, which he built on a zero budget during the coronavirus lockdown.Duckworth said: “I had a dream. It’s now very much a reality. We have had some very unexpected hurdles but we prevailed and I can honestly say this is something remarkable. Melbourne Raceway lives. It’s almost time to create new memories and to inspire the next generation of racers and teams, who knows what the future holds? But I can tell you this: we surpassed expectations in many ways, and you have all done me proud. Long live Melbourne Raceway.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4c0181bd4c88a7d14e577199eb9d8abeebf63d7/0_118_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3207c57c1532254dca3dccf9d6d18060","title":"luke campbell boxing ryan garcia","story":"Eight years after winning Olympic gold at London 2012, the lightweight on fighting after losing his father, lockdown frustrations, and excitement over a potential bout against Ryan García“It’s been a fucking mess,” Luke Campbell says bluntly in his kitchen which spreads out into a vast living area. His home, in a suburban mews on the leafy outskirts of Hull, is as airy and spacious as boxing during Covid-19 is bleak and restrictive.“Since November I’ve trained for two fights. Neither happened. One because I was going for a world title and the other because of the pandemic. Fights are all over the place now and people talk so much shit. Like announcing fights without any sign of them happening. It’s absolute bollocks. I enjoy training with the lads and I’m getting better. But boxing’s pretty shit at the moment.”It’s a sign of how hard the Covid crisis has hit boxing that even the mild-mannered Campbell should talk so graphically. On Tuesday it is eight years to the day since Campbell won Olympic gold in the ring at London 2012. Since then he has become a gritty and impressive professional who has fought twice for a world lightweight title. In September 2017 he endured a split-decision defeat against Venezuela’s Jorge Linares, having lost his father to cancer shortly before the fight, and then last August he put up a creditable display over 12 rounds against Vasiliy Lomachenko who operates near the very top of the world’s pound-for-pound rankings.Over the past six weeks, while boxing has made a low-key return behind closed doors, Campbell’s name has been used repeatedly to hype a potentially intriguing and lucrative fight against the young American Ryan Garcia, who has a flawless 20-0 record with bouts won by knockout. Garcia is one of the rising names in US boxing partly because he has an Instagram following of almost 7 million but, also, owing to his speed and power. Yet it is difficult to know whether Garcia is actually world-class because he has not met anyone of the calibre of Campbell or Linares, let alone a master in Lomachenko.Garcia and his promoters, Golden Boy, have been calling out Campbell as the test he needs to prove his credentials beyond being a good-looking social-media sensation. The World Boxing Council also joined in the hoopla by issuing a statement that Campbell and Garcia would fight for their interim lightweight belt. A few weeks ago the fight seemed certain but now, stewing at home with frustration as boxing’s usual bluster becomes even more meaningless, Campbell explains he has had not had a single approach from García, his promoters or the WBC.How has Eddie Hearn, Campbell’s promoter, reacted to the speculation around Garcia? “Eddie’s put one offer to them and they declined it. That’s the last time he talked to them.”This seems depressingly typical of boxing. Unlike the UFC, where testing fights are made quickly and as a matter of routine, boxing remains a mess. The UFC is a dictatorship, and their MMA fighters earn less than boxers, but they supply a steady stream of compelling contests.McGuigan and Campbell are an excellent combination – as proved against Lomachenko. While the result was rarely in doubt, and the scorecards gave the Ukrainian a lopsided victory, Campbell was always competitive. “I actually hurt him in the first and the seventh,” Campbell insists. “The scorecards were shocking because that was a very competitive fight. But he’d always do enough at the end of the round to win it.”From the outside it resembled a dazzling Lomachenko masterclass. Is he as difficult to fight as he is a delight to watch? “He was very good at distance control,” Campbell says, “but I didn’t feel there was a lot of difference. I didn’t feel like: ‘Oh, I’m in here with the No 1 pound for pound in the world.’ But that’s showing how good I am as well. The stuff he’s done to other fighters, he couldn’t do to me. So I was disappointed I lost.”Was his father in bad shape when Campbell left for America in the autumn of 2017 to fight Linares? “Everyone nicknamed him Titanium Man,” Campbell says wryly. “He had been on his deathbed three times. The doctors would say he’s got minutes left and so I’ve said goodbye to my dad lots of times. But he’d bounce back every time. So he seemed OK when I was in the States. But then my older brother rang me one evening in Miami. I knew it was bad news because it would have been around one in the morning at home.”The devastating news of his father’s death hit Campbell hard. “My mum said: ‘Your dad would’ve wanted you to carry on.’ So that’s what I did but I should’ve pulled out. I was having panic attacks in those last two weeks before the fight. It would happen whenever I thought that my dad’s not here any more. It’s a different kind of grief when you lose a parent. I just wanted the fight out the way so I could breathe and mourn my dad. When the fight started I went down early. It was a flash knockdown and I wasn’t hurt. I just thought: ‘You’re embarrassing yourself. Get up. Let’s go to work.’”Many ringside observers, including one of the three judges, thought Campbell won the fight. The deciding scorecard was 114-113 in Linares’s favour. “I thought I won seven clear rounds so it was hard to take,” Campbell says. “I flew home on my own but I didn’t really want to go back because I knew it was his funeral the next day. That Christmas was really hard. I was burning up on the inside, getting angry while grieving.”It will be three years next month since his father died and Campbell seems at peace now. He explains that his dad, who had worked for years as a miner, never watched him box live. “He had eight discs taken out of his spine because of the damage done when he worked underground. It left him a bit hunched and weak. Maybe he felt vulnerable because my dad was a strong guy before it all happened. He didn’t like seeing himself that way as he was a proud man, and when he went out he wanted to feel good and look smart. So he never came to the fights but he was always there in spirit and watching on TV. He always told me the same thing: ‘Come out like a lion and you’ll be an Olympic and world champion.”Campbell has completed the first objective and he will fight on in pursuit of his dad’s second prediction. But the worrying impact of boxing, especially on his family, is plain. Campbell has been with his wife Lynsey since he was an amateur boxer and she never misses a fight. “But she’s always really nervous. Nowadays she always gets ill after my fights because of the nerves. She is wiped out because it’s so hard for her to watch. She feels helpless.”Campbell understands their concern. “Massively. It’s dangerous, innit? And you’re not just thinking about yourself when you’ve got a family. I don’t want to get punched in my face for the rest of my life but I still have massive passion for the sport. I strive to be the best day in, day out.”He is bruised under his right eye after sparring but Campbell emphasises that, while working so hard despite not being paid since he fought Lomachenko a year ago, he is better off than most boxers in lockdown. Some professional fighters are having to do ordinary work to pay the bills. It’s different for Campbell – as his lavish home shows.Anthony Joshua, who also won Olympic gold in 2012, has earned multimillions in and out of the ring. But Campbell feels no resentment towards the heavyweight with whom he is friendly. “That’s the problem in life nowadays – too many people look at what they haven’t got. I just think: ‘I’ve got a beautiful wife, family, good friends, beautiful home. I don’t need anything. I won’t change nothing.’“If someone had said to me 15 years ago you could be the most successful amateur in Great Britain history, Olympic champion and then one the best lightweights in the world, would you take it? You kidding me? Of course I’d take it.”Campbell needs to get back into the ring, hopefully against Garcia, in the next few months. “I feel physically and mentally great,” he says. “I can have as many years as I want in the sport because I’ve lived the life and haven’t got too many miles on the clock. I feel my best is yet to come. We just need to get past all the talk and make things happen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ff089bc372f5ff9b9ba44706b57ff76e918501d/0_215_4530_2718/master/4530.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb12b1fe75de353b1d6df69ce81001d0","title":"premiership clubs coronavirus forfeit 20 0 says sale director covid 19","story":"Premiership rugby teams could be required to forfeit games 20-0 if they cannot play because their players have coronavirus.Premiership Rugby insists postponements will only be triggered by a club announcing they cannot field a competitive team if, for example, all their props are in quarantine. In that event a panel will rubber-stamp the decision to award victory to the opposing team, with no space available in the tightly packed schedule for rescheduled fixtures.The move represents one of the first examples in sport of a Covid-19-related penalty for teams who are unable to fulfil fixtures.Games could still go ahead if a handful of players test positive but the situation will become more complicated should a clutch of tight forwards from the same club contract the virus. Because of the close contact in scrums and lineouts, it could be their immediate teammates will also have to be isolated in the interests of containing any spread.In the event of a local lockdown which is not the responsibility of a club and forces a match to be called off, the two teams are set to share the points.“If a club is unavailable through Covid then the opposition get a 20-point win,” the Sale Sharks’ director of rugby, Steve Diamond, said. “I’m not anticipating that to happen but we are in Greater Manchester. If there was a lockdown here and Exeter were coming up the following week, then they couldn’t play.”The ramifications for the entire league would be significant if there is an outbreak to match the current one at Stade Français, with L’Equipe reporting that 25 members of the club have contracted Covid-19. Training has been suspended and the players concerned will be required to self-isolate until at least 17 August, with the new Top 14 season starting on 4 September.In a bid to ensure the least possible disruption, all players and coaching staff are being tested twice this week, with an extra round of tests due on Wednesday in addition to the weekly tests on Mondays. The results of the latter batch will be released on Wednesday, with all concerned desperate to avoid a sudden spike in infections before the league’s resumption.The situation in England, for now, is less problematic than in France with Diamond revealing Sale have not had a single positive in five weeks. All Premiership clubs, even so, have their fingers crossed with Saracens’ director of rugby, Mark McCall, acknowledging a raft of enforced cancellations would be a nightmare for the sport. Teams are set to travel to and from away games in two buses to ensure social distancing, with Sale hiring a pool table and a table tennis table to keep their players occupied before the first game back against Harlequins at Twickenham Stoop on Friday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b267682adc86638a8ca12e59d4bb8442ba62786/0_143_5617_3371/master/5617.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e61c6993c81409d523c1512afa6293d2","title":"mike bartlett albion play interview brexit covid bbc","story":"The drama first staged after the EU referendum has taken on new relevance and is being broadcast by the BBC. Its creator reflects on the ‘emotional weight’ of BritishnessMike Bartlett’s 2017 play Albion returned to London’s Almeida theatre in February, the week after Britain left the EU. It didn’t mention Brexit but the story reflected its mournful isions. Then the Covid-19 pandemic struck and dwarfed the drama’s concerns of nationhood, patriotism and nostalgic notions of Englishness.Or did it? “Some were saying in the early stages of Covid that the virus had blown those isions out of the water,” says Bartlett. “Actually, I don’t think it has … Everything that has happened in regard to questions of national identity has become fundamental to what we want to do coming out of this.”The production’s director, Rupert Goold, reflected that “plays, like plants, grow over time”. Albion has gathered nuance each time it is repotted. It features a metropolitan, middle-class family who move to the countryside. Britain’s relationship with Europe was still seen by some to hang in the balance when it was first staged. By the time of its 2020 revival, Bartlett felt it to be a very different play.Several others plays by Bartlett have been brought back in the past year, from Snowflake at the Kiln to Love, Love, Love (whose run at the Lyric Hammersmith was cut short by Covid-19). On screen, his series Doctor Foster has been hugely successful, while his play King Charles III has also been adapted for TV. His BBC drama Life, expected to air this year, stars Hamilton, Alison Steadman and Adrian Lester, and revolves around a shared house in Manchester. Again it seems to untangle the issues of our day in its exploration of community and what we owe to other people. “We are all atomised, especially recently, but even before lockdown. It’s about people finding connections and also how we form a community when society doesn’t believe in it.”So much of his work burns with urgent themes – Earthquakes in London looked at climate change, 13 at religious belief in the 21st century and Game at video-game violence. These issues never set the plays’ agenda in themselves, says Bartlett, but are foregrounded by the more complicated drama of human relationships. Albion sought to explore the emotional aspects of the arguments around Britishness. “It’s not an academic debate about the EU, it’s absolutely fundamental to who people feel they are in the world. I felt it important to understand the emotional weight of it.”Would he describe Albion as a family drama or political play? “The phrase I stumble over is ‘political play’. I do think there’s a thrill to seeing a play that talks about what we’re talking about now. I love writing about politics and power. But the reason I stumble is because it conjures a more didactic, opinion-based drama that forces politics on the audience. We have already had to listen to so many opinions in politics and the media.Bartlett’s lockdown in Oxfordshire, with his wife and their children, has been pleasant enough. “I have a garden, I’m alive and healthy. We have been lucky to keep working remotely and to be able to enjoy a bit more time with the children. I’ve been doing some home schooling and finding that maths is more difficult than I anticipated. A lot of people will treasure this time with family – or at least, the lucky ones will.” He is acutely aware of the wider tensions that now lie exposed. “One thing the lockdown has done is magnify existing issues – of mental health, inequality, class, race, the value of the NHS.”Has he had the appetite for online theatre? “I have young children and getting to the theatre was quite hard so having it online is great.” He contests the suggestion that it’s a “lesser” form, citing the TV dramas of the 1970s, like I Claudius, which were staged like plays. “It’s half play and half TV drama. I was already feeling that there was a form there that was interesting.”When theatres reopen, what kind of drama does he want to make? “I want to see less plays documenting experiences that we’ve just been through and more stories that engage with the other side of this,” he says. “The question of what world we want to create.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16a95cee046b8e81af273332d7701bc844829e08/5_346_4747_2849/master/4747.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f57c89ffed321b8b93d886fe51106ba","title":"theatre festivals adapt summer covid brighton norwich belfast london","story":"From Brighton to Belfast, socially distanced performances are popping up in unexpected spaces, including the beach, a shopping centre and a church‘Dive in!” commanded the cover of Brighton fringe’s 2020 programme, listing more than 5,500 performances across 170 venues in May. But audiences couldn’t even dip into it. Amid the wave of cancellations caused by the coronavirus outbreak, the largest open-access arts festival in England was rescheduled for autumn. With dozens of other jamborees, including Edinburgh fringe, postponed or scrapped, the summer looked gloomy for arts lovers.“It was heartbreaking,” says Nicola Haydn, artistic director of Otherplace, which runs The Warren, a popular group of Brighton venues. Haydn had planned to celebrate The Warren’s 15th birthday with a programme featuring almost 300 visiting companies. She’d spent a year putting the lineup together. When it became clear they couldn’t go ahead, “none of us knew what the future held”.Now, Brighton boasts a brand new Warren venue on the beach. Comedy, music, magic and anarchic theatre will be staged outdoors, with audiences watching from picnic tables. While some theatres have been adapted for the age of coronavirus, this one has been designed in direct response. Rather than purchasing inidual tickets, audiences book one of 50 tables, which fit up to six people. Masks must be worn until audiences reach their table, drinks are ordered online and there’s “shed loads of hand sanitiser” available. “We’ve worked hard to reassure people the safety measures are there,” says Haydn.Plenty of innovative work has been made online during lockdown, she acknowledges, but for Haydn “there’s nothing like live performance” – and the new Warren stage has a stunning backdrop, too. On this summer’s warmer days, she has been wary of the beach because of overcrowding but the theatre offers a socially distanced space to enjoy entertainment in the sun (or otherwise, as there’s a rain-or-shine performance policy). The shows have been programmed to lift spirits: there’s a solo panto from dame Mama G, Shit-Faced Shakespeare doing a drunken Midsummer Night’s Dream and a cabaret featuring West End stars whose musicals were shut down. Haydn says a spirit of collaboration is in the air – her beach venue has comedy nights organised by the local Komedia club.Arts organisations are similarly joining forces in Norwich for an outdoor festival, this one in a big top pitched in a city-centre park. The tent belongs to local circus company Lost in Translation. Norwich theatre’s six-week season, Interlude, is a collaboration with Norwich Arts Centre, The Garage and other venues. “We’ve turned it around in about 24 days,” says Stephen Crocker, the theatre’s chief executive. “It’s quite the Herculean effort!”As government guidance is constantly updated, Interlude’s organisers are poised to be flexible. If there is a local spike in coronavirus cases and gatherings are restricted again, “we’d have to weather the storm”. Unlike some of this summer’s theatre activity, the festival is financially viable, primarily because of the support of local authority partners including the council. “The nighttime economy relies on venues,” says Crocker. “This is a boost for bars, restaurants and retail.”EastSide Arts festival in Belfast goes one step further, placing a summer show inside Connswater shopping centre. The King of East Belfast is written and performed by Stephen Beggs, and was planned for the festival before the coronavirus outbreak. It has been reconceived as a 45-minute production with Beggs performing at a three-metre distance from an audience of 22 who, in line with shopping centre restrictions, all wear masks. Another festival show, Late Lewis – a musical production about the author CS Lewis with a cast of four – will be fittingly staged in Belfast’s CS Lewis square, with its Narnia sculptures as a backdrop.Festival director Rachel Kennedy says the square, part of Connswater Community Greenway, was a lifeline for locals during lockdown and she was among those who visited it for daily exercise. “Now people can gather again a little more, they are able to return,” she says, acknowledging that there has been excitement among festival audiences about rediscovering live theatre. The festival’s theme this year is “moments of joy”, which has energised and inspired artists. “Lockdown has taken the joy out of life,” says Kennedy. “People miss laughing with their friends, being around other humans.”EastSide Arts festival is presenting a variety of live outdoor performance and digital productions. That mix is mirrored in the Virtual Collaborators festival, which runs for two weeks online and culminates in a weekend of shows in the grounds of St John’s Church in Leytonstone, east London. The outdoor festival is funded by Waltham Forest council as part of an initiative to bring culture back to the borough. It is the latest phase of a project that Danusia Samal launched in the early days of lockdown to enable creatives to collaborate remotely on a series of films. The festival is co-produced by theatre company Part of the Main whose artistic director Olivia Munk had planned to direct an immersive clubbing experience, Populist, at Brighton fringe and has also had to postpone her Edinburgh show Bloody Mary: Live! (it’s also a podcast).“The first couple of weeks of lockdown was about picking up the pieces of things that had been cancelled and asking … what now?” says Munk. The Virtual Collaborators festival was designed as a replacement for Edinburgh fringe, which offers a vital showcase to emerging artists. Munk was “floored by the generosity” of others in the industry who have offered advice and resources including free rehearsal space to those taking part in the festival. They are lifting up the next generation of artists, she says.Planning live events during a pandemic means everything feels provisional. As a producer, you’re usually one step behind where you want to be in your schedule, explains Munk. “But this is the first time I’ve felt it’s OK to be behind because the world is collectively behind what is happening.” The festival aims to give artists and audiences confidence that people can still connect and create work during the crisis. Contingency plans are in place should lockdown restrictions return in London. “Mostly what we have to count on, regardless of government guidelines,” says Munk, “is our spirit and our vision.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c478d8fb2cce2bbeef539f9d413bad8f06a629c6/376_221_3373_2024/master/3373.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=9851f270355ec3b3b7242c1b0584bc50","title":"kamala harris joe biden vp running mate election 2020 vice president","story":"Joe Biden has named California senator Kamala Harris as his vice presidential running mate, a historic choice he believes will bolster his chances of beating Donald Trump in an election year shaped by the global coronavirus pandemic and a national reckoning on race.Harris – a former Democratic presidential rival and a barrier-breaking former prosecutor – is the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India, and is the first Black woman and the first Asian American to be nominated for a presidential ticket.“I have the great honor to announce that I’ve picked @KamalaHarris — a fearless fighter for the little guy, and one of the country’s finest public servants — as my running mate,” Biden announced on Twitter.His campaign manager, Jennifer O’Malley Dillon added: “Ready to make history, change the world, and win.”Though Biden and Harris clashed during the Democratic presidential debates last year, she has become a strong supporter and a prominent voice on issues of racial justice in an election year convulsed by nationwide protests in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd earlier this summer.The decision is of great consequence, not only for Democrats’ immediate political prospects but for the future of the party.Biden, who, at 77, would be the oldest person ever elected, has pitched himself as a “transitional candidate” and a “bridge” to a new generation of leaders, fueling speculation that should he be elected, he would be a one-term-president.In selecting Harris, a 55-year-old Democratic star, he may not only be naming a partner, but a potential successor who could become the nation’s first female president.Harris is among the most prominent Black women in American politics with appeal across the party’s ideological spectrum. She served six years as the attorney general of California before arriving in the Senate in 2016.Though she struggled with criticism of her prosecutorial record during the primary, Harris developed strong ties to Black women, a critical Democratic constituency that the campaign hopes to mobilize in November.Black women were critical to Biden’s success in the Democratic primary, lifting him to victory in South Carolina after series of stinging losses. Pressure mounted for Biden to choose a Black woman as his running mate after Floyd was killed in Minneapolis in May, touching off months of mass anti-racism protests.Biden was unusually candid about the selection process, an affair traditionally shrouded in secrecy and intrigue. Having spent eight years serving as vice-president to Barack Obama, the nation’s first Black president, Biden recalled the experience fondly and presented their working relationship as a model for what he was looking for in a running mate.During Zoom meetings with donors and supporters, he would often expand on his search, emphasizing that he wanted someone “simpatico” with his personality and his world view as well as someone who was ready to govern on day one.Only two women have previously been nominated for the vice presidency of a major political party and neither was successful: Sarah Palin, the governor of Alaska, in 2008, and the congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro in 1984.Angela Davis, the philosopher and activist who became a prominent figure in the Black Power movement, was twice nominated as the vice presidential nominee of the Communist Party in the 1980s."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/132a091bd0b28b34f51c03ae716e4fefa892c39b/0_326_6600_3960/master/6600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=101bedb7a3665897bc965cf7028ed2c6","title":"chronic corruption and dirty tricks beirutis demand lasting change","story":"Many in Lebanon hope a new government of national unity will pave the way for reform after last week’s explosionIn the wake of Lebanese prime minister Hassan Diab’s announcement that his government will resign, the country has been left wondering whether the explosion that decimated Beirut is also strong enough to uproot Lebanon’s rotten political system.In a televised address on Monday night after more than a third of ministers quit their posts, forcing him to do the same, Diab said that the corruption of the country’s entrenched ruling class “created this tragedy” but avoided taking personal responsibility.“This disaster is the result of chronic corruption … A political class is using all their dirty tricks to prevent real change. We are heeding people’s demand for real change. Today we will take a step back in order to stand with the people,” he said.His words did little to quell the anger of protesters: hours later, a third night of clashes between demonstrators and security forces broke out near the parliament building, in which police used teargas and protesters threw stones and fireworks.One week after the explosion triggered by tonnes of unsafe and illegally stored ammonium nitrate that killed more than 200 people, left 6,000 more injured and up to 300,000 homeless, attention is turning from immediate recovery efforts to what the future may hold politically.Lebanon was already suffering from an economic crisis, years in the making, after the value of the Lebanese pound began to unravel last year, sparking nationwide protests. Coronavirus measures have exacerbated the existing problems, sinking almost half of the nation below the poverty line. Damage from the blast is now estimated at $15bn.On Tuesday, several Beirutis expressed contempt for the country’s rulers, most of them warlords who swapped their weapons for suits when the civil war ended 30 years ago and a confessional system of government resumed (under which religious communities are represented proportionally in political positions).“The government resigns, so what. The new government will be made up of the same people because of the sectarian system,” said Aram, who did not want to give his last name. He lost his cousin Jak Barmakian when the port explosion ripped through the 30-year-old’s apartment in fashionable Mar Mikhael, killing both him and girlfriend Nicole el Helo. Aram had been expecting Jak for dinner, but he never arrived.“Jak told me last month that he felt like he had finally got his life together, he’d just found a job despite the economy and he had a new girlfriend,” he said. “This place is hopeless.”There are many unknowns going forward: current ministers are set to assume a caretaker role before a new cabinet is formed. A push for more than one third of Lebanon’s MPs to resign, which would trigger fresh elections, is still under way.A scenario many are hoping could trigger substantive reform is the formation of a so-called national unity government that includes representatives of all the country’s main political parties, some under the guise of technocratic nominees.“For real change the country needs a totally independent government with legislative powers. Under the current parliament setup, that’s not possible, but Lebanon’s electoral law could be thoroughly reviewed by a national unity government,” said Mohaned Hage Ali, a fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center.“The new government would need to implement International Monetary Fund reforms to unlock international aid. That would make a big impact.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6429264389d3688fd6cbbf33e347b0664668a14/0_0_4979_2987/master/4979.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1a599c96ecd1e17eea9c77aa9e20092","title":"coronavirus in europe french and dutch on alert over rise in cases","story":"New infections back to nearly half their peak in the Netherlands as France reports ‘worrying increase’New daily coronavirus infections in the Netherlands are back to roughly half their level at the peak of the pandemic, while France’s prime minister has said it is crucial for his country to avoid a new lockdown amid a “worrying increase” in cases.The Netherlands has recorded a total of nearly 60,000 cases and just over 6,000 deaths, with the number of fatalities falling to about one every seven days in recent weeks, compared to more than 150 in early April.In France, which has reported an average of about 1,600 new infections a day for the past seven days, compared to roughly 4,300 in April, the president, Emmanuel Macron, held a virtual cabinet meeting to discuss a rapid rise in case numbers.The French prime minister, Jean Castex, said the government would be consulting with local elected officials with the aim of expanding the number of areas across the country – currently 330 – where wearing a mask is now compulsory in the open air.Castex also said a ban on gatherings of more than 5,000 people would be extended until 1 October. “For the past fortnight, the epidemiological situation has been deteriorating,” he said. “The number of hospitalisation and ICU admission has been increasing. Twenty-five new clusters are being identified every day. It’s worrying.”The prime minister said it was “indispensable, and within our grasp” to avoid a crippling new lockdown. “We must be lucid, and get a grip on ourselves once again,” he said during a visit to a hospital in Montpellier.Macron tweeted that existing measures must be observed. The virus was “not taking a holiday”, he said, adding that “vigilance and respect of hygiene and distancing measures remain indispensable. Stay prudent.” France has so far recorded just over 200,000 Covid-19 cases and 30,000 deaths.Ireland said it would increase testing at meat packing factories and asylum seeker centres after its new case numbers per 100,000 people soared from about 5 to 16.9, overtaking the UK rate of 16.5.New daily cases have fallen in recent days compared to last week but the acting chief medical officer, Ronan Glynn, said it could be next week before authorities know if the outbreaks have been tamed. The rise has increased scrutiny on meat plants, which rely on foreign, low-paid workers.At the height of the pandemic in March and April there were between 1,000 and 1,700 new cases a day, and 300-400 deaths. Belgium has recorded 75,000 cases and nearly 10,000 deaths since the start of the epidemic.Cases have begun to decline in Antwerp, a recent virus hotspot, but continue to rise in Brussels. But a leading virologist, Marc Van Ranst, told De Morgen the country was in a crucial week.“If the current stricter rules do not work, we will move towards lockdown again,” he said. “We know that that worked, even though it hurt us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19eb1b4ccec0c35b28f6682a017c230ff905dda9/0_141_4241_2546/master/4241.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fdb9bbd1323edcad8dd28e9dd07515aa","title":"coronavirus vaccine health secretary alex azar december","story":"The US health secretary, Alex Azar, said on Tuesday morning that America hopes to have a coronavirus vaccine approved by December and tamped down Russia’s celebrations over unveiling its own vaccine after rapid development.“The point is not to be first,” Azar said. “The point is to have a vaccine that is safe and effective for the American people and the people of the world.”Russia approved a controversial Covid-19 vaccine for widespread use after less than two months of human testing, including a dose administered to one of Vladimir Putin’s daughters.Kirill Dmitriev, the head of the country’s RDIF sovereign wealth fund, said the vaccine would be marketed abroad under the brand name Sputnik V with international agreements to produce 500m doses and requests for 1bn from 20 countries.The development was hailed by Putin as evidence of Russia’s scientific prowess, but the truncated testing regime has raised eyebrows elsewhere for skipping so-called phase 3 large-scale safety trials, which usually take months. Instead, phase 3 trials will be conducted in parallel with mass production of the vaccine, including in Brazil.Azar said on Tuesday that: “We need transparent data, it’s got to be phase 3 data that shows that the vaccine is safe and effective and that’s what President Trump is leading with Operation Warp Speed.”The top US public health expert Anthony Fauci, who sits on the White House coronavirus taskforce, has said he is “cautiously optimistic” about trials under way, but the trials would have to have their results before scientists will know if the US has a viable vaccine.Azar was challenged by ABC on reports from analysts looking at the work of Moderna, one of the US companies with a vaccine in phase 3 trials, and concluding that trials will not show results until early 2021.Azar said it depended on the speed with which people could be enrolled for the ongoing trials.Azar spoke to the TV network from Taiwan, where he is on a rare official visit by a US government figure and has praised the country’s handling of coronavirus, which contrasts sharply with the situation in the US where the pandemic is out of control.He met the Taiwanese president on Monday, with the visit threatening to escalate worsening tensions between Washington and Beijing.The People’s Republic of China claims Taiwan, the Republic of China, is part of its territory and takes issue with any acknowledgment of Taiwan’s status as a sovereign state.Trump on Tuesday told Fox Sports Radio that he used to have a very good relationship with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, but that changed after the pandemic and that he has not spoken to his Chinese counterpart in a long time.Azar in the TV interview praised Taiwan’s transparency over its public health plans, while saying “China has not been transparent and has not been collaborative”.Meanwhile, Trump will be briefed on US vaccine efforts later on Tuesday and will probably give a public update, the White House adviser Kellyanne Conway told Fox News."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f4461f659641912507c48d7c2a6b08e8fda98eb/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=7681e9c2368af7502ed3896572c092a0","title":"if ever there was a moment for change in lebanon this must surely be it","story":"Without a radical overhaul the next government could look like the one that resignedLike a break in a merciless heatwave, the fall of Lebanon’s failed government has reduced by a few degrees the political temperature in the country’s towns and cities. One week after the enormous explosion that levelled much of Beirut, its rulers have rightly paid a price. The power of the street had exposed the fragility of Lebanese leaders. Impunity hadn’t won the day after all.But what seemed like much needed relief is more likely to be the start of a familiar pattern the same line up of ministers who quit in disgrace will now take on a caretaker role, while those who really control the country haggle over the next incarnation of a government that is likely to look very similar to the one that has just resigned.Unless things change radically, and soon, Lebanon’s next government seems set to serve the same interests – primarily around a half dozen power brokers whose collective control runs the affairs of state, harnessing institutions, erting state wealth and subverting any notion of representative democracy.Oligarchs who have built fortunes in three deeply corrupt post-civil war decades are consolidated by around 200 establishment families. All get varying portions of the pie. The masses are left with crumbs. And, all the while, regional overlords watch on from the shadows.If ever there was a moment to change things, the near destruction of a country’s capital city from profound incompetence and corruption must surely be it. Even the resigning prime minister, Hassan Diab, acknowledged the atrocity at Port Beirut stemmed largely from endemic graft that had allowed 2,750 tonnes of one of the world’s most lethal explosives to be stored at the entrance to the town for six years.But as Diab promised to now “stand with the people”, battered, anguished and still furious Lebanese are once again coming to terms with the intractable challenges ahead how can a system so rooted in silos of power be overhauled? How can non-state actors like Hezbollah be defanged and incorporated into whatever kind of state emerges? How does a rentier state become self sufficient? How can subjects become citizens in a country that can credibly claim to be sovereign?The list of obstacles is enormous, and has been well beyond the capacity of the five cabinets (including Diab’s) to quit since former civil war general Michel Aoun became president in 2016. The agreement he brokered to bring Hezbollah into the government was a turning point in Lebanese history – at least in the eyes of the militant group’s foes who turned their back as a result, just as it was becoming clear the country’s finances were being run like a ponzi scheme.Even in the face of economic – and now physical – ruin, Hezbollah retains a decisive voice in what comes next, a fact that those who may otherwise be inclined to help Lebanon continue to find abhorrent. With no aid dollars, except for money sent to fund a recovery from the explosion, the country cannot stand on its feet again. Financial engineering, appealing to the diaspora, or pleading to the Gulf states no longer works – especially with the country’s catastrophic failings so gapingly laid bare in Beirut’s smouldering ruins.Attention is now being focused on the dysfunctional parliament, where process is cosmetic at best, but better described as redundant. A clean sweep of the country’s MPs and a new electoral law that governs how the next round are chosen is being touted as a chance to do things differently. For that to happen, 43 MPs would need to quit. Eight have done so, so far, and more will follow.A critical mass of resignations would pave the way for new blood, who may be emboldened to take on an old guard, which shows no signs of going anywhere – even now. Losing control is inconceivable to the men who run Lebanon, as the IMF has found out during three months of talks to try and find a way to hand over up to $5 billion in aid, by conditioning it on structural reforms.Every attempt has been rebuffed. In the meantime, Lebanon had been savaged by rising prices, increasing poverty, a plunging currency, and capital controls. And now an apocalyptic blast. If this isn’t the time to overhaul a failed state, it’s hard to see when could be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70f4835297c86091663aca8bfa5740ddbe9c849b/0_315_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48b2fcbdb57145105d6e0579b1f6bacc","title":"oldham may face full lockdown after covid cases double","story":"Sudden rise in infection rate means bars, restaurants and gyms might have to close againThe Greater Manchester town of Oldham is on the brink of being placed into a full lockdown after its number of coronavirus cases nearly doubled despite restrictions on social contact.Katrina Stephens, director of public health for Oldham council, said officials were discussing with central government the closure of bars, restaurants and gyms in the town following a “sudden increase” in the infection rate.Oldham now has the highest infection rate in England after the number of new cases nearly doubled from 137 to 255 in the week to 8 August, despite restrictions on movement imposed two weeks ago.The jump in cases means Oldham’s infection rate is now at 107.5 cases per 100,000 people – almost at the rate of 135 cases per 100,000 in Leicester when it became the first UK city to enter a full local lockdown.Stephens said the numbers were “absolutely something we’re concerned about” and that, having levelled off a fortnight ago following its first spike, there had been a second “sudden increase” in recent days.She said a full government-ordered lockdown could take place within “days rather than weeks” unless people adhere to the measures including not visiting friends and family.Stephens said the closure of pubs, restaurants and leisure centres required national powers to enforce and added: “Those discussions are taking place to start preparing for that, should it be needed. However, we are not at that point yet and if people take these actions we really, really hope that will bring down the rate and that won’t be needed.”The deputy leader of Oldham council, Arooj Shah, said the impact of a local lockdown on the town would be huge. She said it would be much easier to order the closure of hospitality across the wider region because people move across local authority boundaries daily, but added that “right now it’s just an issue for Oldham”.Shah said the 255 new cases were “in all areas, in all age groups, and in all communities”. The previous spike three weeks ago was concentrated in areas with large multigenerational households, with two-thirds of cases in the town’s Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities.It appears that the transmission of the virus is now increasing more widely. There has been particular concern about young people carrying the disease unknowingly and spreading it to elderly relatives following social trips to pubs, parks and house parties.Shah said people were “fatigued, fed up, scared, angry and confused” but reiterated the importance of following the guidance. “We are all at risk of this terrible virus and it is our responsibility to protect ourselves, our friends and wider society by obeying this tougher guidance and acting responsibly.”Residents in the town have previously been told not to have social visitors beyond those in their support bubble and that clinically vulnerable people would now have to shield until at least 14 August.

After reports that the study had found older children were more likely to pass the virus on, PHE said: “Evidence so far indicates that schools do not appear to be a primary driver of coronavirus infections in the community... Reports that PHE has recommended ‘tougher rules for older children’ are incorrect.”Here’s an extract from the ’s leader on the exam results fiasco, just published:...Nicola Sturgeon has rightly apologised on behalf of the Scottish government to pupils and on Tuesday, in an extraordinary U-turn, all the downgrades were reversed.What a shambles. On Tuesday, the former Conservative education secretary Justine Greening described the government’s approach in England as “levelling down in action”. Failing a pre-emptive U-turn in England, mitigating action must be urgently undertaken following Thursday’s publication of results. The appeals process, only introduced last week under pressure from schools, must be made easy, broad-ranging and cheap to access. Schools should ensure the voices of families who might normally lack the self-confidence to challenge the system are heard. Too often, post-exam appeals are the province of middle-class parents who are not afraid to assert themselves. Katrina Stevens, the director of public health for Oldham councils, tells the  that officials in the area are discussing with central government the closure of bars, restaurants and gyms following a “sudden increase” in the infection rate.Stevens said the numbers were “absolutely something we’re concerned about” and that, having levelled off a fortnight ago following its first spike, there had been a second “sudden increase” in recent days.Stevens said a full government-ordered lockdown could take place within “days rather than weeks” unless people adhere to the measures including not visiting friends and family.She said the close of pubs, restaurants and leisure centres needed national powers and added: “Those discussions are taking place to start preparing for that, should it be needed.

It will also intensify the competition with English students for university places.”Robin Swann, Northern Ireland’s health minister, has said there has been a “very concerning” increase in cases of Covid-19 over the last seven days.Swann said there had been 194 positive tests in the last seven days. No further deaths were announced on Tuesday but another 48 diagnoses of the infectious disease were confirmed - bringing the overall tally to 6,188.The Stormont minister said: “I am concerned about the rise in positive cases in recent days.“We now have an average of over 27 new positive cases per day compared to approximately three per day a few short weeks ago.“It is very concerning that nine people have been admitted to hospital with Covid-19, two of which are currently in intensive care units.“This highlights the continuing threat from Covid-19 and we must all do everything within our power to tackle this.”In a just-published community standards report, Facebook has said that Covid-19 has made it harder to remove suicide and self-harm related material from its platforms because so many of its moderators were sent home.The social network revealed it took action on significantly less material containing such content between April and June because fewer reviewers were in action as the pandemic struck.Facebook sent its moderators home in March to prevent the spread of the virus but boss Mark Zuckerberg warned enforcement requiring human intervention could be hit.The firm says it has since brought “many reviewers back online from home” and, where it is safe, a “smaller number into the office”.Facebook’s latest community standards report shows that 911,000 pieces of content related to suicide and self-injury underwent action within the three-month period, versus 1.7 million pieces looked at in the previous quarter.Meanwhile on Instagram, steps were taken against 275,000 posts compared with 1.3 million before.Action on media featuring child nudity and sexual exploitation also fell on Instagram, from one million posts to 479,400.“Today’s report shows the impact of Covid-19 on our content moderation and demonstrates that, while our technology for identifying and removing violating content is improving, there will continue to be areas where we rely on people to both review content and train our technology,” the company said.“With fewer content reviewers, we took action on fewer pieces of content on both Facebook and Instagram for suicide and self-injury, and child nudity and sexual exploitation on Instagram.The tech giant’s sixth report does suggest the automated technology is working to remove other violating posts, such as hate speech, which went from 9.6 million on Facebook in the last quarter to 22.5 million now.There won’t be any deaths data for England and the UK today, the government website says:Owing to technical difficulties with data processing, deaths data for England and the UK were not updated on 11 August 2020.If we get more details on why this is, we’ll update.Oldham is one of the areas covered by the additional restrictions imposed by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, across large parts of northern England on 30 August.The Greater Manchester town had already introduced its own restrictions two days earlier when the number of confirmed cases started to rise.Despite these restrictions, the number of cases has evidently continued to rise sharply.Arooj Shah, Oldham council’s deputy leader, said the 255 new cases were “in all areas, in all age groups, and in all communities”.The previous spike three weeks ago was more concentrated in areas with large multi-generational households, with two-thirds of cases in the town’s Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities.It appears that the transmission of the virus is now spreading more widely.

Care homes in the town have also kept in place strict visiting restrictions.According to NHS Digital, Oldham now has the highest infection rate in England, ahead of Blackburn with Darwen, Leicester, Bradford and Calderdale. Ahead of the release of A-level results in England, the National Union of Students has called on the government to follow Scotland’s lead.Larissa Kennedy, president of the NUS, said: “The Scottish government have taken decisive action to respond to this situation, which must now be reflected across the UK.“Students have worked incredibly hard throughout their education, and their efforts should be recognised. Now should be a time to celebrate their achievements rather than place a limit on their potential.”“In these unprecedented circumstances the UK government should follow the lead of Scotland by scrapping moderated grades. This temporary measure must be taken to avoid a situation in which thousands of students do not receive the grades they deserve because of where they live.”People in Oldham have been told they face a Leicester-style lockdown within days unless they adhere to additional lockdown rules after the number of coronavirus cases nearly doubled in a week.The Greater Manchester town now has the highest infection rate in England, according to NHS Digital data for the week to 8 August.Oldham council said on Thursday it had seen 255 new cases in that week – almost double the 137 cases in the previous week – despite additional lockdown measures being introduced on 28 July.The jump in cases means Oldham’s infection rate is now at 107.5 cases per 100,000 people – almost at Leicester’s rate of 135 cases per 100,000 when it became the first UK city to enter a full local lockdown. Councillor Arooj Shah, the deputy leader of Oldham council and cabinet member for Covid-19 recovery, said: “We know people in Oldham have, on the whole, been behaving responsibly and abiding by the coronavirus restrictions.“But coronavirus has not gone away – and rates are now rising.

I want other black and mixed-race people to see someone who looks like them, and for our white allies to see people who aren’t like them. It gives us all a more erse understanding of how the world is.”‘We have to question body image issues’“I had a problematic relationship with food and body image, and so did most of my friends,” says photographer Fanny Beckman. “Did you know that more lives are lost to eating disorders than any other mental health condition? Women of My Generation is a multimedia project which combines photography and a podcast to question beauty standards, and dismantle our body image issues. I want to prove that it is, beyond doubt, possible to feel confident regardless of body size, sexuality, ethnicity or socioeconomic background.”‘Look closer, and a new level opens up’“My illustration style is lowbrow, cartoony, so it might not strike you that there’s meaning beyond the skateboarding-style graphics,” says illustrator Chris Martin. “But I’m hoping to communicate bigger issues in my drawing. As with the Cambridge Analytica scandal, there are unseen forces at work. Forces we don’t see straight away, but which create a deeper tension. There’s always another level to what we first think we see.”This is what confidence looks like“I use my voice to empower women and celebrate the ersity I see in my home city, London,” says photographer Milli Ahern. “I use bright saturated colours to project strength and confidence – a confidence that I didn’t feel myself, growing up. I was bullied about my appearance as a teenager. But that experience actually gave me strength as it led to me learning about photography, which allowed me to find my voice and highlight the beauty in ersity. Everyone needs to be seen and heard.”At the heart of the Your Voice. Your Way campaign is a zine, paid for by Levi’s, celebrating voices outside the mainstream. Created jointly by the four incredible artists showcased here and four talented writers, it proves the power of expressing yourself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f8ef8771d704bcada862904664df8501847e82e/0_0_1335_801/master/1335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=227ac5f420b32dbae7c8172587057313","title":"a platform for the unheard the brand the zine and what it all means","story":"For the young creatives involved, deciding to apply to be part of a project to create a zine in collaboration with  Labs was easy. But why did Levi’s want to get involved?“Your Voice. Your Way is a celebration of imagination and identity,” says Yasmin Sinfield, brand marketing manager for Levi’s. But why does a brand best known for its denim care about amplifying unheard voices?“We believe we have a responsibility to support erse voices and make a stand against injustice – not just at this pivotal moment in history, but consistently,” she says.“As a brand Levi’s has a strong heritage of amplifying marginalised voices, and this zine has been in development for over a year. We’re committed to giving unheard voices a platform.”Levi’s, says Yasmin, has four core values: integrity, courage, empathy and originality. They serve as a reminder for the company to focus on what matters and to keep having important conversations. But what does that actually mean? And how does amplifying young voices contribute to those important conversations?“We’re doing our best to champion erse voices from the younger generation,” says Yasmin. This campaign wasn’t created to serve a financial purpose, but as a means to connect with, and rouse the voices of, this generation. Over the years, Levi’s has demonstrated its commitment to investing a portion of its annual earnings into communities. Take the Levi’s Music Project, for example, which connected global artists such as Alicia Keys and Skepta to young people to help them “champion their voice through music”.Levi’s also helped young LGBTQ+ photographers raise their voices, partnering with LGBTQ+ museum Queer Britain in celebration of Pride 2019 in the UK. The collaboration kicked off with a curated photography exhibition in London’s Covent Garden called Chosen Family. Levi’s truly believes that this zine is vital and authentic. From the company’s beginnings in 1853, it set out to enable people to express their iniduality. Now, Levi’s wants to work with us to empower our generation.Being courageous is about far more than building your own confidence. By raising your voice, you could inspire countless others. In this zine, Levi’s provides a platform for young voices because, says Yasmin: “Small changes spun together can create something much bigger that makes a real difference.”This zine isn’t the first Your Voice. Your Way project. Last year, the focus was on musicians from the Levi’s Music Project who had all faced barriers to achieving their dreams, but had transformed their lives by having courage in their own convictions.Musicians can make themselves heard when they perform, but there are so many people who don’t have a platform. “In a world where it seems like everyone’s talking over each other, it can be hard for young people to use their voices in their own way, because they don’t know where or how to do so,” says Yasmin.Levi’s thinks brands can provide a place to start, to platform emerging creatives and commit to listening to young voices. The partnership between Levi’s and  Labs has enabled us to set up and support a network of talented young creatives, bringing us together with mentors who will continue to encourage us.If you invented blue jeans, you have a good idea of what it means to be original. Levi’s had a practical purpose: its jeans were first created in 1873 to satisfy a need from workers who needed durable trousers those jeans evolved into one of the world’s most iconic fashion items. Now, our needs are more nuanced than durable workwear. Levi’s hopes Your Voice. Your Way will provide a “blank canvas for self expression”.When they told us we could create this zine our way, they meant it. We’ve had support but, ultimately, we called the shots. By giving us the opportunity to choose what stories to cover, we’ve had real creative freedom. We took the challenge to share our inidualism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e66095eef528002831fac4e99023fe4cd7c16d3d/0_0_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cb5a9af8f4ac55c3e0eaa2de5753670","title":"gen z on challenging stereotypes i only saw muslim women on arabic channels","story":"Writer Ayat Mohamed is 18 and, like all of us, she’s an inidual with many aspects. So why is it so hard for her to find people to identify with in the media?I’m a Gen Z Muslim woman with immigrant parents and I don’t fit many stereotypes. Other stereotypes fit me alarmingly well: I think rice is one of God’s greatest creations, I talk too much, I care about my hair too much – which is even worse as nobody outside my household sees it.I also care about climate change, animal exploitation, mental health, respect, feminism and more. I’m multidimensional, and I don’t see myself represented enough.Representation has the power to implant views and stereotypes into mainstream consciousness, for better or for worse. We all need role models and there are lots of us who are being let down.It’s up to all of us to fix that. Starting now. Here, five people reveal how they’re breaking boundaries in race, mental health, body image, religion and age representation ...Malin Andersson“Mental health representation will make us all stronger,” says Malin Andersson, a mental health advocate and TV personality.I talk about grief, depression, body positivity, and domestic violence on my Instagram to open up those conversations. I get about a thousand messages a day from people saying I’ve helped them, so I know I’m raising awareness.Speaking up, especially when you show your vulnerability, can make people feel less alone and encourage them to share their experiences too. The more we talk about mental health issues, the more we take away their shame and stigma. We create space to be ourselves without being scared of what others will think. I hope this will lead to better representation of mental health issues.Dr Fatumina Said Abukar“I experienced racism because of a lack of representation,” says Dr Fatumina Said Abukar, an award-winning UCL scientist, model and Stem ersity advocate.I grew up in a small village where my family were the only people of colour, and I experienced a lot of racism.People threw eggs at me and beat me up, and I faced racial slurs. I’m frustrated when I walk into ersity shoots and I’m the only person of colour. When you only have one token figure it’s impossible for them to represent their whole community. This can lead to them being attacked by their own community if they do or say something wrong. I want to see different types of beauty in the media.Stephanie Yeboah“If I’d seen someone who looked like me, I would’ve had less self-hate issues,” says body positivity blogger Stephanie Yeboah.“I grew up feeling uncomfortable in my own skin. I’ve always been into fashion, but I felt like I had to hide that because there were few plus-size-friendly shops. I hated myself and dieted constantly. After university, I went to New York and met a group of women who were all bigger than me – yet confident and effervescent. Inspired, I posted a full-length picture of myself on social media.I was shocked at how positive people were. This generation is so lucky to have role models like Lizzo – I would’ve had less self-hate issues if I’d seen her when I was growing up. The body positive movement was created to celebrate women whose bodies aren’t seen by society as beautiful, so I’d like to see more variety of body shapes in the media.Zaynab Shaikh“Muslim women need better representation in fashion,” says hijabi model Zaynab Shaikh.Muslim women aren’t represented enough. Take fashion: few fashion brands care about Muslim women who want to dress modestly. Shopping is difficult because everything is too tight, sheer or has cut-outs. Just: no.Now, young people ask me how they can start modelling, which is so nice because when I grew up I only saw Muslim women on Arabic channels.Zahra Mohamed“Young people deserve people who look like them,” says Zahra Mohamed, Ayat’s 15-year-old sister.Representation affects young people and the adults we become. I have an issue with adult actors playing teens on screen as they create unrealistic expectations of how we should look, which has led to a rise in eating disorders, depression and anxiety.I like TikTok because it’s full of normal people. Instagram is full of heavily filtered influencers who I can’t relate to. It’s not fair that teens have to obsess over their appearance.

Three children and two staff members at the Daoine Óga Community Childcare Centre in Navan tested positive for the disease in the past week.Management had closed three of the creche’s eight rooms in response to the cluster, but the entire centre has now closed following a recommendation from a public health officer. The centre is to reopen on August 18th.The three affected children were said to be asymptomatic while the two adults have demonstrated mild Covid-19 symptoms. Children using the creche had been split into pods of up to eight since it reopened in June.Local Sinn Féin councillor Eddie Fennessy is awaiting results for his two-year old son, Ned, who has underlying health issues and was tested at a centre in Slane on Monday.“The outbreak is in a creche where scores of children attend daily so the potential for mass transmission is high,” he said. “I’m not qualified to give a medical assessment on how to manage a pandemic but I can tell you one thing for sure – it is downright dangerous for almost a week to pass before you test people who’ve been in direct contact with an infected person.”Maynooth University immunologist Prof Paul Moynagh said delays in testing some children at the centre were “concerning” .Prof Moynagh said waiting almost a week to test close contacts of confirmed cases meant the process would be of “little or no value”.“It is very concerning if direct contacts of confirmed cases are not being immediately contacted and tested as part of the test and trace system operated by the HSE,” he said. “If the test and trace system is not done with speed, it is wholly ineffective.” The creche’s chief executive Marie Daly said parents and staff were notified of the decision to close on Monday evening.“We have always followed all guidelines and advice given to us from all the relevant bodies since the first staff member tested positive, and we have always kept staff and parents up to date with the situation,” she said, adding that it was “extremely devastating” news after investing in protective equipment and other Covid-19 measures.“We have done everything we can to try and stop this virus coming into this building and the worrying thing is that all the children who contracted the virus are asymptomatic. Everyone is worried but the parents and pre-school inspectors have been extremely supportive to us.”The HSE said it could not comment on inidual cases or outbreaks as it would breach its duty of confidentiality to the iniduals concerned.In a statement it said that if HSE public health staff determine there is an outbreak, a control team is convened to advise on control measures.

A spike in coronavirus cases has forced the reintroduction of local restrictions in Kildare, Laois and Offaly. Photograph: Collins PhotosIreland and other European countries experiencing a resurgence in Covid-19 cases should consider reinstating selected restrictions to avoid further increases in cases and deaths, according to a new risk assessment by the European Centre for Disease Control.The ECDC says there is a “true resurgence” in cases in several countries as a result of physical distancing measures being relaxed.The assessment comes as the Government plans to roll out a national testing scheme in food processing plants with more than 50 employees.Officials from the Department of Agriculture met the HSE on Monday to discuss the new testing regime for workers in the food companies.A senior source said the plans will involve weekly testing in all plants in Kildare, Laois and Offaly for an initial period of four weeks.Alongside this, testing will be directed at companies with more than 50 employees nationally although risk assessments will be carried out on smaller companies and testing may follow there too.Officials are examining the national testing capacity and turnaround times but a source said the Government hopes to have the new serial testing scheme up and running by next week. Overall planA spokesman for the HSE said an overall plan would be sent to the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) later this week, after engagement with key stakeholders. The ECDC risk assessment says further incidences of Covid-19 “can be mitigated if sufficient control measures are reinstalled or reinforced in a timely manner”.Alongside a tailored and comprehensive testing strategy, the speed of contact tracing is important to reduce transmission, it says. Efforts should be made to shorten the time needed for each step in the testing, notification and contact-tracing process.Despite the rise in cases, it says countries should be better prepared to control any resurgence given the public health measures in place.Speaking at a NPHET briefing on Monday, acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said Ireland is still “in a good place” relative to many places in the world, despite recent increase in case numbers. New figures from the ECDC show the incidence of the virus in Ireland rising above that in the UK for the first time on Monday. Dr Glynn said over the past 14 days, 879 cases have been notified, giving a 14-day incidence of 18.5 per 100,000. He said Ireland’s rate was much lower than the UK’s outside counties Kildare, Laois and Offaly, where a spike in cases has forced the reintroduction of local restrictions.Regional restrictionsWarning of “ups and downs” in the number of cases to be reported over the coming days, he said it would be next week before officials could assess whether the regional restrictions were working.A further 57 cases were reported by the NPHET on Monday – lower than expected – and no deaths. The emergency team has brought forward its next meeting to Wednesday to focus on the evolving situation in the midlands.Meanwhile, Tánaiste and Minister for Business Leo Varadkar is due to meet with publicans on Tuesday, and a meeting with Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath is also planned. Sources say the Government is coming under increasing pressure from pubs to set a date for reopening and to provide extra financial support in the meantime. WaiverGovernment TDs are also calling for an enhanced economic package to support the region. Fianna Fáil TD for Kildare North James Lawless said supports “over and above the July stimulus” were needed. He has submitted a list of potential policies to his party colleague, Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Michael McGrath, including a waiver on licensing fees, a rebate or grant for businesses that saw stock spoiled, measures to support the hospitality sector and an extension of the local authority rates referral.

Photograph: Collins CourtsIndependent TD Michael Healy-Rae believes shopkeepers should not have to enforce mask regulations, but he is fortunate as customers at the family’s supermarket and filling station in Kilgarvan are prepared to wear them.Over the course of an hour or so around noon on Tuesday, 90 per cent of people, locals and visitors alike, obeyed the regulations and donned face masks before entering the busy shop and filling station in the south Kerry village.Michael Healy-Rae himself donned one as he went for a cup of coffee during a break from building work on a nearby house, but he repeated his view that it is not the job of shopkeepers to enforce the Government’s regulation.“I would say we have nearly 100 per cent compliance. People are happy to comply, but it shouldn’t be up to shopkeepers to enforce it. We have enough to do to run shops, our job is not enforce it. “I’m not going to stop you going in to the shop if I see you are not wearing a mask. I might politely say to you ‘The next time, you are coming in, you might think of the old mask.’“But you’ll remember it yourself because if you’ve forgotten it, you will quickly realise it when you see everybody else wearing a mask. Nobody wants not to be compliant,” he declared.Michael’s wife, Eileen, who manages the store, reckoned there was 90 per cent plus compliance: “The morning lads are in a bit of a hurry and they forget, but as the morning moves on, they’re nearly all wearing masks.”Fine of €2,500Cork couple Brian and Mildred Callinan enjoyed a coffee outside the shop following a short break in Killarney but, unlike Healy-Rae, they believe shopkeepers should enforce the regulation which carries a €2,500 fine if breached.“Shopkeepers have to start telling people that they can’t come in without a mask,” said Mildred, “We need proper enforcement, otherwise we are never going to get out of it.”Her husband agreed: “We have a law saying people have to wear masks so I don’t see how the shopkeeper has any choice in the matter. We’ve been getting good advice but we were lacking the legislation to back it up – until now.”Jeff Rousseau, originally from near La Rochelle in France but living in Kenmare for 18 years, wore a mask as he entered the shop, though he does not like doing so as he has asthma. Nevertheless, he feels he should wear one.“I think we are handling it well in Ireland. People are showing common sense. Most people are wearing masks. I have asthma, so I find it difficult to breathe with a mask but I am making the effort,” he said.Wearing a bandana-style mask, Kilgarvan local Graham Fitzgerald agreed with Healy-Rae, though he feels peer pressure will do its job: “If you go into a shop now without a mask, you almost feel that people are looking at you oddly.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4324506.1596782289!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"gove announces 650m brexit support package for the north","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichael Gove visited Northern Ireland on Friday with Northern Secretary Brandon Lewis.

A new £650 million Brexit support and peace and reconciliation package for Northern Ireland was announced by British Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove who was visiting the North on Friday.The funding comprises £300 million of support for the European Union’s Peace Plus programme and £355 million to assist traders in the North deal with the complications of Brexit. Of the £355 million the package involves £200 million towards a new free-to-use Trader Support Service that will assist with import, safety and security declarations on behalf of traders.The other £155 million, according to Mr Gove’s office, will fund the development of new technology to ensure the new processes can be fully digital and streamlined.Mr Gove’s department said the “new service will be available to businesses bringing in goods from Great Britain or the rest of the world, providing guidance as well as dealing with their requirements for moving goods into Northern Ireland”. The £300 million confirmed by Mr Gove for the Peace Plus programme will help “to support peace, prosperity and reconciliation projects on the island of Ireland”.Mr Gove who, accompanied by Northern Secretary Brandon Lewis, was visiting Northern Ireland on Friday, said the £650 million investment underlined the British government’s “absolute commitment to the people and businesses of Northern Ireland as we move towards the end of the transition period”.“Our new free-to-use Trader Support Service will provide vital support and guidance to traders, while our £300 million investment in reconciliation projects will help to preserve the huge gains from the peace process and the Belfast Agreement,” he said. “As we continue to engage with businesses, and our discussions with the EU proceed, we will update these resources to ensure that traders are ready for the end of the transition period,” added Mr Gove.Mr Lewis said the Trader Support Service “will ensure that businesses of all sizes can have import processes dealt with on their behalf, at no cost”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4327551.1597155369!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government begins work on new medium term plan in covid 19 era","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Micheál Martin: said  Ministers will outline which measures they intend to introduce later in the week. The Government has begun work on a new plan to deal with the challenges of Covid-19 for Ireland in the medium-term.The new plan, which was agreed at a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Covid-19 on Tuesday, will be the successor to the current roadmap for reopening society but, unlike the current plan, will include no phases or prospective dates. A Government spokeswoman said the new plan will be operable until the middle of next year. It will involve detailed contingency plans to deal with various situations that arise and will be flexible and adaptable. The situations could include local clusters or lockdowns as has happened in Kildare, Laois and Offaly in the past week, or a winter outbreak that occurred during the flu season. The new plan will be based on detailed expert advice of the National Public Health Emergency Team on the continuing threat posed by the pandemic in Ireland. That was conveyed to the committee by the acting Chief Medical Officer Dr Ronan Glynn at the meeting on Tuesday. As expected, the committee - chaired by Taoiseach Micheál Martin - gave the go-ahead for a serial testing programme in meat processing facilities, in direct provisions centres and the continuation of the programme in nursing homes. The testing will initially be conducted on a weekly basis, with the first tests being conducted in the there counties affected by the lockdown before being spread throughout the State. That will result in more than 60,000 tests being conducted each week. There are an estimated 40,000 people resident in nursing homes and some 6,500 people living in direct provision. There are also about 15,000 people working in meat processing plants throughout the State. In addition to those measures the Cabinet committee also agreed that Tánaiste Leo Varadkar, Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath and Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe would begin to examine what kind of supports could be made available to affected business in Kildare, Laois and Offaly.The Ministers are expected to engage with business groups as well as local politicians during this process. Ministers will outline which measures they intend to introduce later in the week. The meeting, which lasted two hours, was attended by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, and Mr McGrath as well as by Dr Glynn. A number of other Ministers joined via video link including Stephen Donnelly, Dara Calleary, Simon Coveney, Eamon Ryan and Mr Donohoe. Speaking after a Cabinet committee meeting, Mr Martin said: “We had an economic assessment from the Minister for Public Expenditure and from the Tánaiste in relation to the business side and again we looked at measures that could be taken to help businesses in the three counties that are subject to the restrictions announced last Friday and relevant Ministers will be meeting this week with a view to actioning some response in relation to that by the end of the week.” In terms of the testing at meat plants, Mr Martin confirmed it will be weekly and there will be a “serial systematic” testing plan in companies, direct provision centres and nursing homes. Mr Martin said officials told Ministers that community transmission is stable.

Photograph: Brendon O’HaganBloomberg New Zealand announced on Tuesday it was shutting down its largest city, Auckland, after four new cases of Covid-19 were discovered in the city, the first evidence of domestic transmission after being coronavirus-free for 102 days.New Zealand’s successful fight against Covid-19 was hailed worldwide and the Pacific island nation of five million was seen as one of the safest places, as the pandemic raged globally.Director general of health Ashley Bloomfield said the four cases were within one family in South Auckland. One of those concerned was in their 50s, and they had no history of international travel. Family members had been tested and contact tracing was under way.News of the cases sent panic across the country with media reporting people rushing to supermarkets to stock up, and businesses preparing to shut.Prime minister Jacinda Ardern said Auckland would move to level 3 restriction from noon on Wednesday as a “precautionary approach”, which would mean people should stay away from work and school, and gatherings of more than 10 people would again be restricted.The restriction would be applied for three days until Friday, which she said would be enough time to assess the situation, gather information and make sure there was widespread contact tracing.“This is something we have prepared for,” Ms Ardern said in a surprise news conference, adding that the increased caution was being applied as the source of the virus was unknown.“We have had a 102 days and it was easy to feel New Zealand was out of the woods. No country has gone as far as we did without having a resurgence. And because we were the only ones, we had to plan. And we have planned,” she said.ElectionNew Zealand is set to vote in a general election on September 19th, which Ms Ardern is expected to win comfortably, according to opinion polls, on the back of her handling of the pandemic. But the return of the virus could prove damaging for the government.Ms Ardern said she had not given any consideration to the impact of the new restrictions on the polls at this stage.“This will come as a shock to all New Zealanders who believed what we had been told – that we had got on top of this virus,” the main opposition National Party leader Judith Collins said in a statement.Parliament is scheduled to be dissolved on Wednesday to make way for the election.Auckland mayor Phil Goff said: “I am urging Aucklanders to come together like we did last time to stamp out community transmission. Please remain calm, please do not panic buy and please follow the lockdown rules.”Ms Ardern said travel into Auckland, on the North Island, would be restricted unless you lived there. She said the rest of New Zealand would enter alert level 2 from midday on Wednesday for three days. This would mean social distancing measures would be applied again and mass gatherings would be limited to 100 people.New Zealand was placed under a tight lockdown for weeks after it reported its first known case on February 26th. The most recent case of community transmission had been detected on May stThe country marked 100 days without a domestic transmission of the coronavirus on Sunday, but warned against complacency as countries such as Vietnam and Australia, which once appeared to have the virus under control, now battled a resurgence.Mr Bloomfield said the unknown nature of the new cases meant it was likely there would be more positive cases in the coming days. He said people should use masks in places where it was hard to physically distance.“The case is a wake up call for any complacency that may have set in,” he said. – ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4327865.1597180809!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 uk reports highest number of new cases since june","story":"Dr Michael Ryan of the World Health Organization says that countries in western Europe should use localised measures to control Covid-19 flare ups and should seek to avoid, if possible, countrywide lockdowns.

Photograph: Oli ScarffAFP via Getty ImagesThe number of confirmed Covid-19 infections has passed 20 million, nearly five months to the day since the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared a global pandemic. In acknowledging the milestone, the health body’s chief warned against despair, saying that if the virus could be suppressed effectively, “we can safely open up societies”.Global cases reached 1 million at the start of April. By May 22nd, there were 5 million cases. The figure doubled to 10 million by the end of June, and, seven weeks later, it had doubled again to 20 million.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he thinks that despite the “great deal of pain and suffering” and the growing numbers, “there are green shoots of hope and . . . it’s never too late to turn the outbreak around”.He gave examples of countries that had successfully clamped down on the spread of Covid-19, citing New Zealand and Rwanda, and praised nations that had suffered major national outbreaks and were now responding quickly to local spikes.“My message is crystal clear: suppress, suppress, suppress the virus,” he said. “If we suppress the virus effectively, we can safely open up societies.”With much of the world caught in a cycle of outbreaks and economically crushing lockdowns, all eyes have been on the race for a vaccine. A WHO overview said 165 candidate vaccines were being worked on around the world, with six having reached Phase 3 – or large-scale human trials – of clinical evaluation.Russian president Vladimir Putin has said a coronavirus vaccine developed in his country has been registered for use and one of his daughters has already been inoculated. Mr Putin emphasised that the vaccine underwent the necessary tests and has proven efficient, offering a lasting immunity from coronavirus. However, scientists have been sounding the alarm that the rush to start using the vaccine before Phase 3 trials – which normally last for months and involve thousands of people – could backfire.But the WHO’s emergencies director, Michael Ryan, warned that a vaccine was “only part of the answer”, pointing to polio and measles as diseases with vaccines that have not been fully eradicated. “You’ve got to be able to deliver that vaccine to a population that want and demand to have that vaccine,” he said.The global death toll now sits at more than 733,000, with the US, Brazil and Mexico recording the most fatalities. The region of Latin America and the Caribbean has the most infections, with 5.6 million cases. The region has continued to see rapid spread, with more than half a million new cases in the past week alone.India is the country with the most new infections over the past week (402,287 new cases), ahead of the US (376,471).UK and USThe UK on Tuesday reported 1,148 confirmed new cases of Covid-19, its highest such daily total since June 21st. The cumulative total of UK cases stood at 312,789, government data showed. It was only the second time since June that the daily total of new confirmed cases topped the 1,000 mark. The previous instance was on Sunday, when the daily figure was 1,062.Also on Tuesday, some Scottish schools become the first in the UK to reopen as lockdown is eased. Local authorities across Scotland are taking different approaches with the timeframe for reopening schools for the first time since March 20th. Pupils in the Scottish borders were returning on Tuesday, as were some in Shetland on a phased basis.In the US, the Trump administration was considering measures to block citizens and permanent residents from returning home if they are suspected of being infected with Covid-19.A senior US official told Reuters that a draft regulation, which has not been finalised and could change, would give the government authorisation to block iniduals who could “reasonably” be believed to have contracted Covid-19 or other diseases.The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday reported 5,064,171 total confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in the US, an increase of 40,522 cases from its previous count, and said that the number of deaths had risen by 565 to 162,407.Florida reported a record 276 new Covid-19 deaths among residents on Tuesday, bringing the state’s cumulative total to 8,553. The state reported a cumulative total of 542,792 confirmed Covid-19 cases, up 1.1 per cent from a day earlier. Australia, Asia and Middle EastIn Australia there was some relatively good news on Tuesday, with the state of Victoria recording 331 new cases of the virus (down from the peak of 725 on August 5th), boosting hopes that case numbers were stabilising after a big infection surge sent the city of Melbourne into a strict six-week lockdown. There were also 19 more deaths.Singapore’s virus-affected economy shrank almost 43 per cent in the second quarter of the year, in a sign that the country’s first recession in more than a decade was deeper than initially estimated, official data showed on Tuesday.Tough curbs within the city state to contain the pandemic took a heavy toll on the economy, which is largely dependent on global trade and tourism. On Tuesday, China recorded 44 new cases, but only 13 were locally transmitted – all in Xinjiang. In New Zealand, Dr Ashley Bloomfield, the country’s beloved director general of health, took a Covid-19 nasal swab during a live news conference in order to encourage the public to accept the tests if offered. Lebanon on Tuesday announced a record daily number of more than 300 new Covid-19 infections, and seven deaths from the virus, as the country grapples with the aftermath of the Beirut port explosion that rocked the capital and overwhelmed hospitals.EuropeThe EU’s health agency has called on states seeing an increase in cases to reinstate control measures, as it warned of a “true resurgence” or “risk of further escalation of Covid-19” in several countries.Greece is “formally” in the midst of a second wave of the pandemic, one of the country’s top infectious disease experts said.A total of 4,036 new Covid-19 cases were confirmed in the Netherlands in the past week, up from the 2,588 cases reported in the seven days before, the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment said on Tuesday.The Dutch health minister plans to introduce mandatory home quarantine for people identified by local authorities as having been in close contact with somebody infected with coronavirus, and for travellers returning from high-risk countries.In France, which has reported an average of about 1,600 new infections a day for the past seven days, compared with roughly 4,300 in April, president Emmanuel Macron held a virtual cabinet meeting to discuss a rapid rise in case numbers. The French prime minister, Jean Castex, said the government would be consulting with local elected officials with the aim of expanding the number of areas across the country – currently 330 – where wearing a mask is now compulsory in the open air. Mr Castex also said a ban on gatherings of more than 5,000 people would be extended until October 1st. “For the past fortnight, the epidemiological situation has been deteriorating,” he said. “The number of hospitalisations and ICU admission has been increasing. Twenty-five new clusters are being identified every day. It’s worrying.” The prime minister said it was “indispensable, and within our grasp” to avoid a crippling new lockdown. “We must be lucid, and get a grip on ourselves once again,” he said during a visit to a hospital in Montpellier. France has so far recorded just in excess of 200,000 Covid-19 cases and 30,000 deaths.The German city of Hamburg has extended a ban on alcohol sales from outlets like kiosks and gas stations in a bid to thwart street gatherings that could fan the spread of coronavirus. The ban will run from 8pm to 6am local time this Friday and Saturday and applies to areas such as Altona in the western part of the port city, as well as the centre.Germany recorded 1,220 new infections in the 24 hours through Tuesday morning, up from 385 on Monday and above the 1,000 mark for the third time in less than a week, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.Germany has extended a partial travel warning for Spain to the capital of Madrid and the Basque region due to the Covid-19 pandemic, its foreign ministry said on Tuesday.Belgium’s government has ruled out cancelling trains to the seaside after a weekend beach brawl prompted local mayors to call for limits on visitors to the coast. Local politicians across Belgium’s 65km strip of coastline called for action after police confronted dozens of young people, who had been disturbing other holidaymakers, at a beach in Blankenberge on Saturday. Some of the young people threw sand in people’s faces and used parasols as projectiles against police. Three people from Brussels appeared before a judge on Monday charged with assault and battery following the disturbance.Cases in Belgium are rising at a slower rate than last month, with the week-on-week increase in case numbers slowing to 11 per cent compared with 58 per cent in July. Belgium had an average of 588 new cases a day in the week to August 7th.Finland will quarantine travellers from most of the world to halt the spread of Covid-19. Just 25 countries are currently exempt from the mandatory quarantine, Krista Kiuru, minister for family affairs and social services, told reporters on Monday. Passengers who fail to comply face at most three months’ jail time or a fine and airlines will be required to disclose transit passengers to avoid attempts to circumvent the rules. The government will also allow authorities to conduct mandatory testing of passengers for Covid-19, Ms Kiuru said, adding that the new restrictions will come into force as soon as possible. – AgenciesEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4327420.1597169716!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"russia set to begin covid 19 vaccinations within weeks","story":"Russian president Vladimir Putin says he knows that Russia\u0027s Covid-19 vaccine is effective because his own daughter was part of the trial. Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRussian president Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday that Russia had become the first country in the world to grant regulatory approval to a Covid-19 vaccine. Photograph: Alexey NikolskySputnikAFP via Getty Images.Russia has become the first country to grant regulatory approval to a vaccine against Covid-19, with mass production and immunisation of key workers to begin in the next few weeks.The move, the first time a Covid-19 vaccine has been approved for civilian use, comes after just two months of human trials and underscores Moscow’s desire to rush the vaccine through testing and trial procedures at breakneck speed in an attempt to beat western pharmaceutical companies.“This morning, for the first time in the world, a vaccine against the coronavirus infection has been registered,” President Vladimir Putin announced at a televised meeting with government officials on Tuesday.“I know that it works quite effectively, it forms a stable immunity. I repeat: it has passed all the necessary tests,” he said, adding that his own daughter had already been given the vaccine. Vaccinations of medical workers could begin as soon as this month, said Russian officials.But western experts have cast doubt on the Russian claims, questioning Russia’s ability to develop and approve a safe and effective Covid-19 vaccine even more quickly than projects in Europe, China and the US that are proceeding at full speed. They also criticised Russian regulators and vaccine developers for failing to make scientific and technical information available for independent assessment.“Everyone else in the world is publishing details of their vaccines and clinical trial protocols but it has been very hard to find out much about the Russian vaccine,” said Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College London. “We need a completely open, global assessment of different vaccine candidates.”The Russian vaccine, which will be marketed with the name Sputnik V, was developed by the state-run Gamaleya Institute in Moscow and financed by Russian Direct Investment Fund. It was developed using the same technology as previous vaccines developed by the institute to combat Ebola and Mers.Trials of the vaccine will continue even as it begins to be distributed to the public, the government said. Vaccinations for medical workers are expected to begin at the end of the month or in early September, according to deputy prime minister Tatiana Golikova. But Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology at Edinburgh university, said: “There is a big difference between a large vaccine trial, with careful and frequent follow up of all vaccinated iniduals, and deployment of a vaccine to the general public.“The current messaging from Russia is very unclear as to which of these two deployments – a large phase three clinical trial or mass vaccination of the general public – is being proposed,” she said.Ripped up rulesUS secretary of health and human services Alex Azar also challenged the Russian announcement. “The point is not to be first with the vaccine, the point is to have a vaccine that is safe and effective for the American people and the people of the world,” he said in a television interview. “We need transparent data and it’s got to be phase three data that shows that the vaccine is safe and effective.”Kirill Dmitriev, head of RDIF, said western criticisms of Russia’s vaccine development were designed to “discredit and conceal the correctness” of Moscow’s research.“Instead of constantly attacking Russia ... they would be better advised to enter into a constructive dialogue with us and provide their citizens in the near future with a high-quality and safe drug that actually saves lives and can halt the pandemic,” he said.Moscow had previously vowed it would win the race to develop and approve an effective vaccine. The government has ripped up typical rules for the length of trials in an attempt to get the vaccine ready for use, as part of efforts to limit the pandemic’s damage on its economy.Russia has also received “preliminary applications” from 20 countries for more than one billion doses of the vaccine, said Mr Dmitriev, and inked agreements with five countries to produce 500 million doses a year. Trials of the vaccine are set to take place in the UAE, Saudi Arabia and the Philippines. Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte said in a speech on Monday evening that he had accepted an offer from Russia to supply his country with free Covid-19 vaccines once mass production began.“When the vaccine arrives, in public, so no one will doubt, I will get injected,” he said. “If it’s okay with me, it’s okay with everyone.”Immune systemsResearch institutes, pharmaceutical companies and state agencies around the world are working on more than 100 potential vaccines to protect against Covid-19, which has infected more than 20 million people and killed more than 700,000.The Russian vaccine uses a harmless human adenovirus to carry coronavirus genes into people and prime their immune system to recognise and resist Covid-19 infection. Moscow said its vaccine used two different adenovirus vectors across two injections, boosting its effectiveness.Several other adenovirus vaccines are being developed around the world, including one from Oxford university and AstraZeneca, the UK pharmaceuticals group.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Names of victims read aloud at demonstration near site of explosion that killed at least 171Prime minister Hassan Diab says blast that killed at least 163 was result of endemic corruptionResignation of government could enable international donors to sideline corrupt administrationPolice fire tear gas near parliament as donors pledge \u0026lsquomajor resources\u0026rsquo after explosionPort officials globally have a tough time preventing the abandonment of ships or seafarersTwenty-five years after the Balkan conflict\u0026rsquos worst atrocity the Bosnian town remains idedDemonstrations stretch far beyond prime minister\u0026rsquos official residence in Jerusalem\u0026lsquoWe have no trust in our government . . .

Photograph: EPAPresumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden has ended months of speculation by naming Kamala Harris as his running mate in November’s US presidential election.The Biden campaign announced the decision on Tuesday afternoon, following a lengthy selection process involving a four-member committee that wrapped up its work in recent days. The announcement comes ahead of next week’s Democratic National Convention, which will be a mostly virtual-only event. Mr Biden and Ms Harris are expected to appear together at a campaign event in Delaware on Wednesday.Ms Harris is only the third woman from either major American political party to be selected as a vice presidential candidate – Walter Mondiale chose Geraldine Ferraro as his running mate in 1984, while John McCain selected Alaska’s Sarah Palin in 2008. Neither ticket was successful, however, with the result that the US has never had a female vice president. While Mr Biden committed earlier this year to choosing a female running mate, he had been under pressure to also select a woman of colour, particularly in the wake of the death in police custody of African-American man George Floyd in May. Ms Harris, who has Indian and Jamaican heritage, would also be the first black vice president, if Mr Biden beats President Donald Trump in November. She attended the historically-black Howard University in Washington DC.The 55-year-old California senator has been widely tipped as a favourite, though former national security advisor Susan Rice, Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and Illinois senator Tammy Duckworth had also been considered. Ms Harris campaigned for much of 2019 to become the party’s presidential nominee, finally dropping out of the race last December having failed to capitalise on the early enthusiasm around her campaign. In a stand-out moment of last year’s primary season, Ms Harris confronted Mr Biden during the June 2019 debate about his past opposition to bussing – a policy that sought to improve racial integration in American schools in the 1970s by transporting children from less wealthy, minority districts to more affluent areas. Ms Harris herself participated in a bussing programme as a child growing up in California. But despite her public clash with Mr Biden a year ago, her friendship with his late son, Beau, when both were attorneys general of their respective states, may have held her in good stead with the presumptive Democratic nominee. ScrutinyMs Harris had a long career as a public prosecutor in California – a track record that is likely to come under scrutiny in the coming months given the renewed focus on issues of systemic racism within the police force following the death of Mr Floyd. She was district attorney of San Francisco for more than six years, and was then elected as attorney general of California in 2010, a position she held until she successfully ran for the US Senate in 2016. She is married to Douglas Emhoff, a Los Angeles lawyer, and has two step-children. In a letter to supporters, Mr Biden wrote: “You make a lot of important decisions as president. But the first one is who you select to be your Vice President. I’ve decided that Kamala Harris is the best person to help me take this fight to Donald Trump and Mike Pence and then to lead this nation starting in January 2021.”Noting Ms Harris’s friendship with his son Beau, who died in 2015 from brain cancer, he said that his son had “enormous respect for her and her work. I thought a lot about that as I made this decision. There is no one’s opinion I valued more than Beau’s and I’m proud to have Kamala standing with me on this campaign”.“Her record of accomplishment – fighting tooth and nail for what’s right – is why I’m choosing her. There is no door Kamala won’t knock on, no stone she’ll leave unturned, if it means making life better -for the people.”Read more about the Donald Trump administrationStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"councils may not have enough contact tracers knock doors health","story":"Local authorities might not have enough contact tracers to knock on doors, a public health chief warned as more failings in the test and trace operation came to light.Earlier this week, it emerged that local authorities will be encouraged to send out their own workers to chase up the contacts of infected coronavirus cases who fail to respond after research showed that call centre staff were reaching just one case a month.Virus hotspots such as Blackburn with Darwen (see video below) and Leicester have already taken matters into their own hands amid test and trace failings.But the president of the Association of Directors of Public Health warned that more resources were needed to deliver that local approach nationally.Jeanelle de Gruchy told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: I think this is an evolution of the system... it\u0027s fantastic that the Government is recognising the value of local government, which is rooted in the community and the importance of this for the test and trace programme.Resources to deliver it will be an issue, because we are being asked to do a lot more.Health minister Edward Argar said the Government was not planning to give councils extra resources for the new system because they had already received billions of pounds.On Tuesday, it emerged that coronavirus contact tracers have failed to get in touch with more than 40 per cent of people who live in the same household as those infected, a finding described as bizarre by statisticians.Just 57 per cent of contacts who live with a person testing positive for coronavirus had been reached by call centres – 4,339 out of 7,589. In contrast, tracers had tracked down 67 per cent of outside contacts – 3,137 out of 4,690.Professor Sheila Bird said the poor performance of track and trace staff in contacting infected households was extraordinary and needed explanation.Prof Bird, formerly the programme leader of the MRC Biostatistics Unit at the University of Cambridge, said it was crucial to contact households with infected people as they would be most likely to have contracted the virus.Members of the household of the symptomatic index case would be expected to be most at risk, she said. We need to do randomly-timed visits to assess the risk of being asymptomatic but swab-test positive and to check on adherence to \u0027stay home\u0027 instruction.The NHS said contact tracers often ask cases themselves to advise their household members to self-isolate without the need for tracers to contact them inidually. This results in these contacts not being recorded as reached and asked to self-isolate, which is likely a contributing factor for a lower proportion of household contacts being reached in comparison to non-household contacts, a statement said.But the most recent figures show that contact tracing has got worse with, on average, only 2.8 contacts reached per positive case, down from an average of 3.4 in the previous two weeks. The Government has claimed that many people are not answering the phone because it is an 0300 number which they mistake for a cold caller.  But Prof Bird said: Has it really taken nine weeks to discover the 0300 number as a potential barrier? Problems should have been discovered early by follow-up visits.Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, told MPs on May 20 that the test and trace operation would be world-beating (see video below) and in place by June 1. But this week the Government said it will axe 6,000 national contract tracers and create a hybrid system, with national callers alongside a local door-to-door approach.Mr Agar told the Today programme: We have reached in the past 10 weeks, since this was set up, pretty much from scratch, around a quarter of a million people – that\u0027s a quarter of a million chains of transmission that have been broken by this.But for those hard to reach or for those people who can\u0027t be contacted then you\u0027ve got this door-to-door approach as well.Labour said the Government had been too quick to outsource the test and trace contract to Serco.Shadow health minister Justin Madders said: This is yet another example of the Government being too slow to tackle Covid-19 and too quick to hand out juicy contracts to the private sector.Labour has been calling for a locally-led contact tracing system for months – it\u0027s welcome that local authorities are now finally being given additional support to tackle the virus in their areas.The Unite union said a new lucrative contract for Serco should be scrapped and the cash given to local councils.Baroness Harding, who chairs NHS Test and Trace, said the new system followed successful trials in a small number of local areas.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hair loss emerges latest long term covid 19 symptom","story":"An American actress has called on the public to take the Covid-19 pandemic more seriously after revealing her hair is now falling out in clumps months after contracting the disease.Alyssa Milano posted a video to social media demonstrating her hair loss five months after she first experienced symptoms in March.Lasting effects of the coronavirus such as fatigue, breathlessness and muscle degeneration have already been documented, but health experts are now warning that hair loss could be the latest long-term effect for patients.The British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) has seen a significant rise in patients reporting “dramatic hair loss” months after experiencing virus symptoms, but warned the long-term impact of the virus on the hair follicles is still unknown.Dr Sharon Wong of the BAD said patients appear to be experiencing telogen effluvium, a form of hair loss which occurs after stress, shock or trauma. It can also be triggered by an acute illness and high fever, she said.Patients who experienced Covid-19 symptoms in March and April, some of whom tested positive, began to notice hair shedding around June and July, she added.“The patients who were coming to see me specifically had symptoms during the beginning of the pandemic related to Covid, and then a few months later they were getting telogen effluvium,” she said.“We are definitely seeing quite specific Covid or pandemic related stresses and illnesses, and then subsequently the hair shedding a few months later.”Dr Mabs Chowdhury, consultant dermatologist and lecturer at University Hospital of Wales, said he has been receiving numerous referrals for patients experiencing hair loss, which is likely to be caused by Covid-19.“Covid does make sense (to be causing the loss), with a multi-system disease, especially with the high fever, it can cause this two to six months down the line,” he said.Studies have also shown the impact of the pandemic on hair loss.And a study by scientists at Uşak University School of Medicine, Turkey, also reported around a third more patients were diagnosed with alopecia in recent months than before the pandemic.Typically, we shed around 30 to 150 hairs a day, but when telogen effluvium occurs our hair cycle shifts from the growing phase to the shedding phase, known as telogen.Around 10 per cent of hair is usually lost in the telogen phase, but this can increase to up to 70 per cent when experiencing telogen effluvium.The effects are temporary and the normal hair cycle should return within six months.But Dr Wong said it is not yet known if Covid-19 has impacted the hair follicles in a different way or how patients will recover.“It is early days, it\u0027s a new strain of virus,” she said.Dr Wong said she will be following up with patients on a longer term basis to assess the true impact of the virus. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"joe biden announces kamala harris running mate","story":"Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, has chosen California senator Kamala Harris to be his running mate for the November election. Ms Harris, the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants to the US, makes history as both the first woman and the first person of colour to be a vice presidential nominee for a major US political party.  I have the great honor to announce that I\u0027ve picked Kamala Harris - a fearless fighter for the little guy, and one of the country\u0027s finest public servants - as my running mate, Mr Biden said.In a text message to supporters, Mr Biden said, Together, with you, we\u0027re going to beat TrumpMr Biden, 77, will appear alongside Ms Harris, 55, in Wilmington, Delaware on Wednesday for their first formal event together. Mr Biden, himself a former US vice president, committed to selecting a woman as his running mate several months ago and assembled a group of officials, aides and close friends who spent the last few weeks vetting potential candidates.The short list was thought to include eleven women, including US senators Elizabeth Warren, Tammy Duckworth and former National Security Adviser Susan Rice.Given Mr Biden\u0027s age - he turns 78 in November - many pundits suggest his choice of running mate is more consequential than for any previous presidential candidate.Ms Harris had been considered a favourite from the beginning. As an early Democratic presidential contender herself, she gained national name recognition and has an impressive CV she served as California\u0027s attorney general before becoming the first African American from the state to serve as a US senator.Coming from California is also an advantage. The country\u0027s most populous state will play a huge role in the election, and Ms Harris has access to its wide network of donors. However, Ms Harris does not offer much to the liberal wing of the Democratic Party - she has flip-flopped on whether she supports a universal healthcare system and her background as a prosecutor has come under criticism from those calling for greater criminal justice reform.During last year\u0027s Democratic candidate debates she launched a scathing attack on Mr Biden for his past views on a busing policy designed to desegregate schools - a clip Mr Biden\u0027s opponents are likely to play on repeat. The confrontation became the stand-out moment of that debate in June 2019 and reportedly frustrated some in Mr Biden’s camp at the time, including his wife Jill, and had been seen as a potential barrier to Ms Harris\u0027 selection.According to Politico, Ms Harris expressed no remorse over the confrontation when interviewed by Mr Biden’s vetting team, joking “that’s politics”. Others in Mr Biden’s campaign played down the significance of the incident, insisting that Mr Biden does not hold grudges.Read more about Ms Harris in our profile here.In a nod to the historic nature of the decision, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) called it a defining moment in US history.Eric Garcetti, the Los Angeles Mayor, praised his dear friend, calling Ms Harris a true ally for people who have needed a voice within the corridors of power.Should Mr Biden win in November and Ms Harris take office as vice president, Mr Garcetti would be eyed as a potential successor for her Senate seat.Meanwhile Donald Trump\u0027s campaign have given a first taste of the attacks they are likely to launch against Ms Harris. Mr Trump\u0027s campaign adviser, Katrina Pierson, said on Tuesday Ms Harris will abandon her own morals, as well as try to bury her record as a prosecutor, in order to appease the anti-police extremists controlling the Democrat Party.Ms Pierson said Ms Harris has gleefully embraced the left\u0027s radical manifesto, calling for trillions of dollars in new taxes and backing Bernie Sanders\u0027 government takeover of healthcare.For weeks, the Trump campaign promised an aggressive response against whomever was selected by Mr Biden as his running mate.Ms Harris is seen as a tough and effective politician with a strong track record as a prosecutor and a rare demographic appeal as a biracial woman.Tracy Sefl, a Democratic strategist and former adviser to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, spoke to The  earlier this year and described her as a “sharp political intellect” and believes her impressive record as California\u0027s attorney general will stand her in good stead. “In terms of biography that is an important piece of hers and perhaps a bit of a differentiator among 2020 candidates who are often mentioned in the same breath,” she says. “I have no doubt if she chooses to do this she would campaign aggressively. She\u0027s been travelling to some of the early states already and it\u0027s my understanding that those events have gone very well, so credit to her for doing that early leg work.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"roundabout bikes belongs one dantes circles","story":"I am glad to say I live on the other side of town to Cambridge’s new “Dutch style” roundabout, because just looking at photos brings me out in hives. The layout more closely resembles a Ludo board than a roundabout, and winning – in terms of crossing the darn thing – appears to require similar levels of luck and guess-work.Each approach has a zebra crossing giving pedestrians priority, and when you’ve negotiated that in your motor you are faced with a red-surfaced outer ring for cyclists that you should also give way for.There are also some bamboozling grassy features that narrow the roundabout and which I’d be tempted to park on, while I scratch my poor addled head. It’s no wonder that within days of the grand opening a car had crashed into “an unfinished beacon”. I’m guessing they thought they’d somehow landed in a parallel universe where our alien overlords all wear bike helmets.I must confess roundabouts strain my concentration at the best of times. When I drive along the outskirts of Milton Keynes, the Mecca for circular traffic-flow fetishists, my blood pressure goes through the roof. There’s the constant underlying anxiety about taking the correct turning (I’ve been known to drive round the beastly things four times in a row before getting it right). Then there’s an equal fear I’ll hover at the give-way point for many minutes in my submissive low-acceleration Ford Focus, while other bolder drivers barge their way into the flow and the people behind me honk horns in fury. If I decide to join the inner traffic circle, I never quite know when to move to the outer one. In fact, it strikes me Dante could have usefully added a roundabout to his seven circles of hell.You would have thought when the grand panjandrums of road design decided to re-invent the roundabout, they would’ve made it easier for slow-witted motorists like me to understand the rules. Instead they’ve made it a game of risk and dare like Crossy Road.I say this from dual perspectives, as I spend most of my time in Cambridge on my bike. Do I trust this roundabout from a cyclist’s perspective? Ha! About as much as I trust Donald Trump to be the soul of diplomacy, and local residents say the same. If drivers haven’t come across a Dutch roundabout before, how will they know to stop for little ol’ me on my sit-up-and-beg bike? It may not be a coincidence that it’s very well placed for Addenbrooke’s hospital.The geniuses from the local county council have recently “improved” my local zebra crossing in North Cambridge, so it has a bike crossing running parallel to it. Roughly a third of cars show no sign they feel they should brake for a bicycle on this special track and speeding cyclists can be even worse offenders. I fear for local children every time they use it.But by far the most eye-popping aspect of the Dutch roundabout is its cost. The original estimate was £800,000. By kick-off that figure was £1.4 million and by the time of opening it came in at £2.4 million. Cambridgeshire County Council says it will review how it carries out project management and cost estimates for infrastructure following the huge cost and time delay. As a wiser person than me once said, “No s---, Sherlock.” In fact they could give me a pack of Sharpies and I’ll design a lovely British roundabout for a tenner. We’ll put a maypole in the middle, get Morris Dancers to open it and it will still be simpler than the Dutch one.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sardines make comeback brits turn tinned food lockdown","story":"Sardines are making a comeback in modern kitchens after Britons turned to tinned food during lockdown, Waitrose has revealed.Sales of the popular post-war staple have jumped by 500 per cent in recent months, as many people in the UK stocked up on longer-life food in a bid to cut down on shopping trips.Mel Tillotson, fisheries manager at Waitrose, said: “Customers are ersifying their choice of fish, opting for sardines instead of, or alongside, traditional favourites such as cod or haddock.“Fresh sardines are seasonal but people have learned a lot from Covid-19 about stocking up meaning tinned foods have been in demand.Eighty per cent of fish consumed in the UK belongs to the ‘Big Five’ species of cod, haddock, prawn, tuna or salmon.But the increased popularity of sardines during lockdown, coupled with one of Britain’s earliest sardine seasons in history, means shoppers can expect to see an increase in supermarket stock this year.A record 700 tonnes were captured in Cornwall, the result of perfect temperatures and nutrients in the water which offer a healthy amount of prey.George Clark at the Marines Stewardship Council, added: “Sardines are a fantastic, versatile fish and very good for you. “The sardines in Cornwall have been MSC certified for over ten years and continue to demonstrate best practice in how this iconic UK fishery is operated and managed. It’s always a joy to see these sparkling silver fish on counters with their little blue label when they come into season, recognising the efforts made by fishermen to ensure these stocks remain healthy and sustainable.”Typically,  80 per cent of sardines will be sold overseas to markets such as France, Italy and Spain. Ocean Fish, a 15-vessel crew which has been catching sardines with ring nets and supplying them to the UK and overseas since the 1700s, has been uplifted by the strong season.A spokesperson for Ocean Fish said: “We are very fortunate that the start of the British sardine season has coincided with the restart of the food service sector, which, in addition to the export market in Western Europe, forms a substantial part of our trade. “Fish counters are sadly declining across many of Britain’s food retailers so we rely heavily on the export market.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/08/10/14/one-hit-wonders-comp.jpg","title":"barbra streisand donna summer enough is enough ad lgbtq rights","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Streisand makes an appearance in the clip encouraging people to ‘vote proud’The Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism.

to know that if you use e-cigarettes, you are likely at immediate risk of\u0026nbspCovid-19\u0026nbspbecause you are damaging your lungs,’ researcher saysYoung people who use e-cigarettes are five to seven times more likely than non-smokers to be infected with coronavirus, a study suggests.Vaping also appears to diminish the protections afforded by youth against the symptoms of the virus, warned scientists who analysed data from across the US.“Teens and young adults need to know that if you use e-cigarettes, you are likely at immediate risk of Covid-19 because you are damaging your lungs,” said the study’s senior author Bonnie Halpern-Felsher, professor of paediatrics at the Stanford University School of Medicine.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesResearchers analysed survey responses from 4,351 people aged between 13 and 24 from across every US state. Participants were asked in May whether they had ever used e-cigarettes or conventional cigarettes and if they had vaped or smoked in the last 30 days. They also answered questions about whether they had suffered coronavirus symptoms and been tested for or diagnosed with the disease.Among people tested for Covid-19, those who had used e-cigarettes at any time in the past were five times more likely to receive a positive result than those who had not, the study found. That figure rose to 6.8 times more likely among respondents who had used both e-cigarettes and tobacco in the previous month.Vape company used coronavirus to market to teens, FDA hearsDoes smoking or vaping increase your risk of contracting coronavirus?“Young people may believe their age protects them from contracting the virus or that they will not experience symptoms of Covid-19, but the data show this isn’t true among those who vape,” said postdoctoral researcher Shivani Mathur Gaiha, co-lead author of the research.She added: “This study tells us pretty clearly that youth who are using vapes or are dual-using are at elevated risk, and it’s not just a small increase in risk it’s a big one.”Young people who had both vaped and smoked in the previous 30 days were almost five times more likely than non-smokers to suffer Covid-19 symptoms, such as coughing, fever, tiredness and difficulty breathing, the data showed.The results were adjusted to account for factors such as age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index, local coronavirus rates, and compliance with lockdown restrictions.Previous research has indicated smoking tobacco increases the risk of patients falling seriously ill with coronavirus. The disease primarily attacks the lungs, whose function is impaired by regular cigarette use.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And we need to tell everyone: If you are a vaper, you are putting yourself at risk for Covid-19 and other lung diseases.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Swindon is now the fourth worst affected area in the UK when measured as a proportion of population, having seen a 200 per cent increase in new cases over the last seven days.It has nearly as many new cases per person as Leicester, which was the first place to see tougher local restrictions put in place after the nationwide lockdown lifted.The UK as a whole remains a long way off its peak levels from April and May, when daily new cases frequently reached above 5,000.Yet local spikes could see the recent upwards trend continue if not brought under control, as has been the case in other countries like France and Spain.Having endured a big surge in cases during the early stages of the pandemic, London has since seen its number of daily cases drop at an even greater rate than the rest of the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

I was proud then, and I\u0027m proud now to have her as my partner in this campaign.Senator Harris, who suspended a presidential campaign among a host of contenders vying for the party\u0027s nomination in 2019, is expected to speak alongside Mr Biden from Delaware on Wednesday to discuss working together to restore the soul of the nation and fight for working families to move the country forward, according to a campaign announcement.From a prosecutor to Biden\u0027s VP pick, the making of Kamala HarrisSenator Harris\u0027s selection follows a heavily scrutinised search among several women on the vice presidential shortlist, including former national security adviser Susan Rice, California congresswoman Karen Bass and former Georgia lawmaker Stacey Abrams, as the campaign was pressed to nominate a black woman as the candidate\u0027s running mate.If elected, Vice President-elect Harris would be the nation\u0027s first woman and first black and first Asian American person in the role, alongside the nation\u0027s oldest president-elect, and another historic achievement in her milestone-making career.You make a lot of important decisions as president, candidate Biden wrote in an email to supporters. But the first one is who you select to be your Vice President. I\u0027ve decided that Kamala Harris is the best person to help me take this fight to Donald Trump and Mike Pence and then to lead this nation starting in January 2021.In a statement, the senator said: Joe Biden can unify the American people because he\u0027s spent his life fighting for us. And as president, he\u0027ll build an America that lives up to our ideals. I\u0027m honoured to join him as our party\u0027s nominee for Vice President, and do what it takes to make him our Commander-in-Chief.The Democratic National Committee\u0027s nominating convention begins on 17 August.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Kamala is that person, the former vice president wrote. I need someone who understands the pain that so many people in our nation are suffering. Whether they\u0027ve lost their job, their business, a loved one to this virus. ... This president says he \u0027doesn\u0027t want to be distracted by it.\u0027 He doesn\u0027t understand that taking care of the people of this nation – all the people – isn\u0027t a distraction.

In Minsk, which saw the worst violence, water cannon, stun grenades and rounds of rubber bullets were deployed against protesters. In two instances, a police van drove into crowds. At least four people ended up in intensive care, with one man reportedly in critical condition. In other cities across the country, officers reportedly laid down arms and crossed to the side of protesters. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe unity opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who claimed victory in the face of the scarcely credible 9.9 per cent assigned to her by the official preliminary results, called on police and army officers to stop the violence. “I want to ask them to remember that they are part of the nation too,” she said. Hours before voting ended, Belarus had all but declared a state of emergency. Footage of soldiers and military equipment entering the capital was widely shared by locals.By 6pm local time (3pm GMT), most of the capital’s central squares and government buildings had been cordoned off. Transport systems were shut down. Roads in and out of the capital were also closed. The regime’s obvious nervousness extended to widespread efforts to control the internet. Major disruptions to mobile networks were reported from the morning, with connections practically grinding to a halt at around 10pm local time. Proxy servers, used widely in these parts to get around censorship, became unreliable.Belarus’s upcoming election spells out two very different futuresUnidentified forces want ‘massacre’ in Belarus, says LukashenkoBelarus charges opposition politicians with assisting Russian plotJournalists and other independent observers appeared to be a target. At around 2pm local time, three reporters from the Russian liberal outlet TV Dozhd were handcuffed, held to the ground, and arrested. Just before midnight, AP photographer Mstyslav Chernov was admitted to hospital with suspected concussion after being beaten by riot police while in their custody. Sunday’s events came at the end of an unexpectedly panicked campaign for Belarus’s longtime leader – one that saw opposition candidates jailed, protesters snatched from the streets, the president claim a scarcely believable Russian-backed plot, and where the opposition candidate was forced into hiding on the eve of voting.Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, 37, was never supposed to mount a serious challenge, only entering the race after President Lukashenko jailed her husband, and presidential hopeful, Sergei Tikhanovsky. Famously dismissive of women in politics, Mr Lukashenko seemed to believe the housewife and former translator didn’t have a chance.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailBut her invigorating, earnest campaign surprised Belarus and it wrong-footed Mr Lukashenko. Few expected Ms Tikhanovskaya to reach an agreement with the campaign teams of other banned opposition candidates – but she managed to do so in just 15 minutes. Few believed she could lead a clear campaign – but she did so with simple promises to deliver fresh elections, walk back authoritarian changes to the constitution, and free political prisoners.Flanked by Veronika Tsepkalo, the wife of Valery Tsepkalo, another barred candidate, and Maria Kolesnikova, campaign manager for jailed Viktor Barbariko, Ms Tikhanovskaya’s opposition campaign took on unmistakably feminist, modern slant. It also brought over 200,000 people to the streets in support – an astonishing achievement in Belarus, a police state of just 9 million people, and where dissent often leads to jail.Underestimating Ms Tikhanovskaya was not the only mistake the usually clever and adroit Mr Lukashenko made in the run-up to the elections. His electoral rating was hit hard by a perceived cavalier approach to the Covid-19 epidemic: he claimed the virus was avoidable with vodka, trips to the sauna and work in the potato fields. His management of the country’s increasingly desperate economic position – and its rapidly unwinding model of Soviet planning with Russian subsidies – also provoked much anger. The extraordinary campaign to unseat Belarusian ‘dictator’ LukashenkoGiven the fact independent polling is illegal in Belarus, it was never entirely clear quite how vulnerable “Europe’s last dictator” actually became to Ms Tikhanovskaya’s challenge. But results from a handful of more reliable Minsk polling stations appeared to support the opposition claim that Ms Tikhanovskaya had, in fact, won — and convincingly.Unprecedented numbers of voters appeared to answer Ms Tikhanovskaya’s call to turn out late on Sunday — and the logic this would make falsifications more difficult. But Lidia Yermoshina, a key Lukashenko ally and chief vote counter as the head of Belarus\u0027s election committee, described the huge queues as “provocations” by the opposition. In an earlier interview on state TV, she described the opposition as a “totalitarian sect”.Independent exit polls conducted outside polling stations in foreign embassies also painted a starkly contrasting picture to the official figures. According to these surveys, Mr Lukashenko received just 6.25 per cent, compared to Ms Tikhanovskaya with 79.69 per cent. Ahead of the end of voting, Mr Lukashenko dismissed his rivals as being “unworthy of repression”. But he also seemed to make ominous warnings for those intending to protest. “All our structures and special services are ready and waiting,” he said. “There is no reason for our country to be plunged into chaos or civil war.

It took just over six weeks for that number to double.The worldwide count of known COVID- infections climbed past  million on Monday, with more than half of them from just three countries: the U.S., India and Brazil, according to the tally kept by Johns Hopkins University.The average number of new cases per day in the U.S. has declined in recent weeks but is still running high at over ,, versus almost , in India and nearly , in Brazil.The World Health Organization has not received enough information on the Russian COVID- vaccine to evaluate it, the assistant director of its regional branch, the Pan American Health Organization, Jarbas Barbosa, said on Tuesday.Asked about plans to produce the potential vaccine in Brazil, Barbosa said that should not be done until Phase  and  trials are completed to guarantee its safety and effectiveness.#Any vaccine producer has to follow this procedure that guarantees it is safe and has the WHOs recommendation,# he said in a virtual briefing from Washington.More than . million people have been reported to be infected by coronavirus globally and , have died, according to a Reuters tally.Infections have been reported in more than  countries and territories since the first cases were identied in China in December .Dental patients and staff need to be protected from any potential infection by aerosol-generating procedures, the World Health Organizationsaid today, as dentiststo work in areas where the COVID- pandemic is easing.There is currently no data on the spread of coronavirus from the dentists chair, it said, calling for more research into common procedures that produce tiny floating particles that may cause infectioninhaled.These include three-way air water spray, ultrasonic cleaning equipment that removes deposits from the tooth surface, and polishing, the WHO said in new guidance.#WHO guidance recommends in case of community transmission to give priority to urgent or emergency oral cases, to avoid or minimise procedures that may generate aerosol, prioritise a set of clinical interventions that are performed using an instrument and of course to delay routine non-essential oral health care,# Benoit Varenne, a WHO dental officer, told a news briefing.He added: #The likelihood of COVID- being transmitted through aerosol, micro-particles or airborne particles # today I think is unknown, its open to question at least.

No wonder some locals consider new lockdowns an over-reaction.And experts predict the economic hit may not be as bad as feared, assuming schools reopen fully next month and millions get back to work.From a poor start, things are looking up.THIS Government promised to take back control of our borders. When will it Yes, it has detailed plans to regulate the flow of legal EU and non-EU migrants once Brexit is complete. Quite right. But its record on tackling those landing illegally on our shores in ­soaring numbers is dismal.Not one of the , who have arrived since May has been ed to France.

But also because he was only  years old and had been married to his beautul we Lissie for just a month.It was heartbreaking to see the photos of the pair overflowing with love and happiness at their wedding — while knowing his le had been needlessly ended.Our hearts went out to Lissie, who no doubt is still trying to make sense of the tragedy. So too his mother and father. For any parent, such a loss is unthinkable. Nobody should have to bury their child.It is against the natural order of things, especially when your beloved son or daughter has been murdered.That kind of pain will never go away. It becomes the defining moment of a parent’s le.Who would blame someone in that position for opting out of le ­altogether and sinking into inertia and depression  To me, that even seems the most likely response.Instead, his mum Debbie Adlam has hit the campaign trail, arguing for longer sentences for anyone who kills a policeman.PC Harper’s killers were convicted of manslaughter but cleared of ­murder.Henry Long, , who drove the getaway car, was jailed for  years. His accomplices Albert ­Bowers and Jessie Cole, both , were each given  years.Unduly lenient sentences, to my mind — and probably yours too.On Wednesday, Lissie began a campaign to bring in “Andrew’s Law”, in memory of her late husband. She wants anyone who kills a police officer, firefighter, nurse, doctor or paramedic to be jailed for le — meaning a minimum of  years.Mrs Adlam, who has been robbed of growing old happily with her beloved son in her le, has joined the campaign.“We got to the end of our trial and we didn’t feel like justice had been done,” she said. “We felt like we had been punched.“We didn’t walk away feeling that we had done Andrew proud.”That is the nub of the matter. She wants to do right by her late son. And I imagine she will not rest until she feels she has done that.It is only when tragedy strikes that many people realise how strong and determined they can be.Nothing can bring back PC Harper. ButAndrew’s Law comes to pass, acting as a deterrent to other criminals, at least one positive will have come from an otherwise senseless death.The need for justice is a stronger force than most of us can comprehend. I think of Stephen Lawrence’s mother Doreen, whose le changed overnight when her son was ­murdered in a racist attack in .She campaigned tirelessly for reforms to the police service and founded the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust.She forged positive change from the tragic murder of her son, ­showing the strength of her feeling and the scale of her loss.I think also of Michael and Sara Payne who also campaigned with great determination after the murder of their eight-year-old daughter Sarah.As a result, parents and ­carers can now formally ask the police for information about a person who has contact with a childthey fear that person poses a threat.Then there is the Jodie Chesney Foundation, set up by Peter Chesney to tackle kne crime after his daughter was murdered last year.When faced with unimaginable loss, some people respond by taking action to change things.They are gripped with the strength to move mountains — and get the law changed.We salute their courage and their determination to find light amid the terrible darkness of their loss.How sad it is seeing footage of Keeley Bunker dancing with her trusted friend Wesley Streete, who walked her home that evening . . . then went on to murder her.Keeley was a beautul young woman, just  when she died and with her whole le ahead of her.But her “friend” chose to end that le.It is tragic seeing any le wasted – and for what  Streete’s own gratication.Let us hope he is haunted by his actions and choices for the rest of his le.Wonderful news this week as the parents of poor Charlie Gard – who died of a rare genetic condition three years ago – gave birth to a healthy baby boy.As Connie Yates said: “The world feels a whole lot more beautul this morning”.I am so happy for them after the tragedy of losing Charlie, and what a beautul baby.Congratulations.WARNINGS this week that menopausal women could be unfairly denied entry to pubs and restaurantstheir hot flushes are confused in temperature checks for Covid symptoms.Take note: No one in their right mind should keep a menopausal woman from her chilled white wine . . .It feels a bit like a sword of Damocles is hanging over the nation at the moment, with yet more job cuts announced this week – at LGH Hotels, Pizza Express and Wetherspoons.Thousands more workers are living in fear of redundancy. It is a scary prospect. But don’t panic.The best defence is preparation. Find ways to be positive. That means not taking it personally.The ROLE is redundant, not you. So don’t view redundancy as a reflection of your ability or your worth.Know your rights and get the best settlement you can. A proper redundancy process comes with a consultation period, which will give you time to weigh up your options.My advice is to engage in that process. Ask for written clarication of any offer andyou are unhappy in any way, there are plenty of employment lawyers you can talk to. Or free help is available from Acas.Sort out your finances. Work out how much money you need for day-to-day living and,you can, keep some back for emergencies. Cut out spending on non-essentials and work out how to manage everything from mortgage payments to credit card debt.You might have to tighten your belt for a bit but that’s not the end of the word. For many people, redundancy is a chance to consider what they might do dferently.That is easier said than done but try to see it as an opportunity – to go freelance, start a business, become a consultant, get another job or re-enter education – rather than an ending.I love a romantic gesture as much as anyone.But the -year-old man who spelled out “Marry Me” using  tea lights made me wonderhe might have found another way.The candles set fire to the living room and seriously damaged the flat he shared with his girlfriend.But she still said yes!And at least she knows what she is getting herself into.It is always hard seeing photos of people enjoying a holiday in the sun when you are working.And this year, more than ever, I’ve been consumed with envy of the lucky souls who somehow got away despite all the travel restrictions.Having seen multiple beachtastic photos of Coleen and Wayne Rooney, who jetted off to the Caribbean what seems like weeks ago, is it wrong of me to admit I’ll be quite pleased when the holiday season is over We need a word for the irritated envy of others’ amazing holidays.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Labour councillors and MPs shake their heads about the dangers of opening while never reflecting on the risk of keeping schools closed.Even Labour’s new leader Sir Keir Starmer is worried about safety . . .  and his own children attended school during lockdown.The risks to children from Covid- are next to non-existent. Teachers are more likely to be hit by a bus than contract coronavirus from kids.Butthe risks of the schools opening in September are minimal, the cost of schools staying shut is beyond measure.Already, a generation of kids have seen their education become another victim of coronavirus.Some , of them could not sit their GCSEs in spring. And , could not sit their A levels.The years below them, due to sit those le-changing exams next spring, have lost six months of their education they will never recover.A report by the National Foundation for Educational Research said  per cent of state-school children had between none and one online lesson a day during the long months of lockdown.The most disadvantaged children have suffered the most.The schools are due to open in just  days and the vast majority of parents — almost  per cent — want them to start as planned.But even as Gavin Williamson was making his bold promise to throw open the school gates, Business ­Secretary Alok Sharma was mewing that school closures would be ­considered on a “case by case” basis, while Schools minister Nick Gibb bleats he can’t “decree” that every pupil will be back at their desk in September. These timid Tories must start showing some spine.With the schools closed, parents cannotto work. Already unemployment is soaring. Already there are hard times ahead.If parents and their children stay at home during the autumn months, this country will be on its knees for years.The A-level results will be announced this Thursday and the class of  will finally discover the damage that Covid- has done to their dreams.For the first time ever, A-level grades will be estimated, and there are countless families across the country holding their breath, me included.But for the millions of children meant to be in school, the future is even more uncertain.If their schools do not open in September it will be a craven act of surrender to extremist teaching unions.And a national tragedy that ­effectively chucks an entire generation on the scrapheap.IT is  years since Cameron Diaz made her movie debut opposite Jim Carrey in The Mask and six years since her last film.Cameron says retiring from the movies has brought her the peace she has always craved.And, of course, having an estimated £million in the bank usually has a calming effect.The thieving simpletons responsible for his death will all be free before they turn .The police get endless stick these days. But PC Andrew Harper was the best of us.Andrew had been married to his childhood sweetheart Lissie for just four weeks when he was dragged to his death after becoming entangled in a tow rope dangling from the back of a car being used to steal a quad bike.Driver Henry Long, , got  years. Albert Bowers and Jessie Cole, both , got  years. Not once have they shown even a flicker of remorse. But the law allows a third of a term off sentences for murder and manslaughter.Now Andrew’s widow Lissie has launched a campaign for “Andrew’s Law”, which will mean a full le term for killing  workers.“I wish to ensure any widows of the future will not have to experience the same miscarriage of justice,” says Lissie, . “I pledge to my late husband to never stop until I have made the dference this country needs.”I know that every reader of this paper will wish Lissie well.The sentences handed down to Long, Bowers and Cole might be what we would expect for manslaughter convictions.But God knows it does not feel very much like justice.“NO one here gets out alive,” sang The Doors’ Jim Morrison.Jim could have been thinking of Public Health England, the quango of clowns charged with protecting the nation’s health and wellbeing.PHE has developed a unique way of counting our corona- virus dead. If you catch Covid-, PHE claims you as a virus victim evenyou recover and die many months later of something .Who does their maths, Diane Abbott PHE’s madcap counting system means all , cases of coronavirus in England will eventually be added to the UK’s Covid- death toll – because we all have to go some time.PHE receives £million of your money a year to produce this garbage.The explosion has left more than  dead, , hurt and , homeless.Israa Seblani, , is the bride who was posing for wedding photos at the very moment the Lebanese capital was devastated by the huge blast.A doctor herself, Israa helped the wounded before seeking safety. A reminder that, even in the midst of tragedy, there is still kindness, decency and courage.CALAIS politician Pierre-Henri Dumont says: “Maybe we should do more” to stop migrants crossing the Channel. Love that “maybe”, monsieur!Priti Patel threatens to send in the Royal Navy but that shouldn’t be necessary. It is contrary to international law that these desperate souls are not claiming asylum in the first safe country they reach.But as they continue to arrive here on a daily basis, you have to say they look happy to have reached this country from the war-torn wastelands of, er, France.Perhaps the UK is not quite the racist hellhole it is frequently cracked up to be.THE Government is mocked for launching its wildly popular Eat Out To Help Out scheme while, at the same time, Boris is posing in gyms and waging his private war on obesity.

Yesterday, the Prime Minister hit the road to inspect the measures schools have put in place.He said: “It’s not right that kids should spend more time out of school. It’s much better for their health and mental wellbeing, and obviously their educational prospects,everybody comes back full-time in September. It’s our moral duty as a country to make sure that happens.”Thanks to social distancing and hygiene measures, St Paul’s Church of England Primary School in Swanley, Kent, fully reopened in June.Here, its head teacher blasts the unions for failing children with their “can’t do” attitude. AS a country, we are trying to get back to some sort of normality — and schools have a big part to play in that.Getting children back into the classroom is vital so parents can get back to work.Yet this is proving anything but child’s play.Unions have hit schools with a checklist of  demands before opening next month. This exhaustive list includes assurances that schools will take specic measures to stop children drinking hand sanitiser, extra support for the wellbeing of staff suffering from workload worries, anxiety or the effects of trauma and insisting classes be held “one week on, one week off”.Union members have been urged to present this checklist to headteachers and to expect its completion.It is not helpful. Unions should be working with schools to ensure there is a safe , not creating ision — which is what this will do. If we keep looking at checklists of things that need to be ticked off, we will never get schools reopened.It will never be perfect for everyone. Nothing is. There are always dfering opinions.When askedthe checklist raised the bar too high, NEU president Amanda Martin responded: “This is people’s safety. What cost is safety ”Of course safety is important. But unions should be pulling together and supporting schools, rather than making it very dficult for them to come back.Before my school reopened, I was stunned to hear some unions were encouraging teachers not to engage in conversation with head-teachers. How is that helpful to anyone We have a responsibility to children to be back. If we don’t come back now, when We can’t keep putting it off. We must come back at some point and September is as good a time as any.It is about common sense and making sure the school community is as safe as it can be. Get the basics done from the off and tweak it as we go. That is how it should work.And I know — because I made it work.When we reopened our school in June we followed the guidance the Government set out to the letter.We didn’t have any cases of staff or students falling ill with the virus.We installed a marquee in our playing field to create extra space, as well as supplying portaloos and mobile handwashing facilities to keep pupils and staff safe.Classes were kept apart with inidual entrances and exits. Yes, we are a smaller school with fewer children.But I have fewer staff and less space to play with.As a community, the school came together, did the right thing and got the children back. That’s what it is about: Working with your community — the pupils, parents and staff.Inevitably, there was going to be some sort of drop in pupils’ learning. But children are really resilient. We saw that when they came back.They were straight back into six-hour days, with a full timetable of learning.They dealt with it really well. Actually, they loved coming back to the stability and routine of what they knew.As much as you try to put in a timetable at home, you don’t follow it because the environment is very dferent.I have two children myself and know how hard it was during that time . . . and I’m a teacher.My we and I were both working full-time from home. To get my six-year-old to do more than an hour’s work was incredibly dficult.You don’t get the same experience sitting in front of a screen watching a teacher online as you do being in a classroom interacting with other people.I strongly feel schools have a responsibility to give parents the opportunity to get back into some sort of normality with work.Because we brought all our children back, parents were able to work better from home and do the things they needed to do.We had a number of parents who were made redundant during lockdown.With not having the children at home, they had the chance to look for other work. Meanwhile, their kids were safe.Just this week, Professor Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the “very low” risk to children from Covid- meant the reopening of schools is safe.Research carried out in  institutions across the UK will confirm “there is very little evidence” of coronavirus transmission where pupils have ed.I hope this will help reassure parents, as the negative impact of keeping children away from classrooms runs deeper than their education.The effect on the mental health of our nation’s youngsters could be catastrophic. The social impact of schools is vital.We were back for a month before the summer holidays and that was one of the overriding factors parents talked about. Lots of children were sad, very quiet and not their normal selves during lockdown.But coming back to school really changed them. That was evident from day one.Parents had been concerned about their children’s mental health and could see how happy they were to be back at school, where they were able to interact with their friends and peers and reignite those friendships.It was wonderful to hear children laughing and enjoy- ing each other’s company.That is something you can’t get in lockdown — the social aspect of school le.Schools are at the heart of most communities.Andschools can get back safely, the rest of the community will hopefully follow back into some normality.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That is why I am urging universities to be as flexible as possible in their admissions and to hold places for those whose grades are being appealed.“Our ambition for students this year is no dferent to any other year and it is in everybody’s interest to see them progress.” But Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said he was confident the exams moderator Ofqual was grading fairly.He said: “Im confident the system Ofqual has put in place is fundamentall a fair one, that will award the vast majority of students a calculated grade that genuinely reflects the grade they would have achieved.“Provisional data published by Ofqual suggests that the number of As and A*s being awarded will increase compared to last year and moderation has ensured students from all backgrounds have been treated fairly.“We know that, without exams, even the best system is not perfect. That is why I welcome the fact that Ofqual has introduced a robust appeal system, so every single student can be treated fairly - and today we are asking universities to do their part to ensure every young person can progress to the destination they deserve.

Mr Argar told BBC Breakfast:is not something thats a prospect at this point.The Department for Education has been very clear that that poses a challenge to the ability to teach and the ability to learn in a certain context. The health minister said the measures already in schools - including keeping each class as a bubble that has to social distance from other bubbles - was more than enough to keep kids and staff safe. He said: We are essentially setting up dferent class groups or year groups as social bubbles.Were there to be a case and schools are a low risk environment then we could implement a version of the local lockdownthe testing, the tracing, for those classes to contain any such outbreak. He added: At the moment we believe the measures that have been put in place in terms of social distancing around those bubbles and around the facilities are the right ones. Boris Johnson said this lunchtime during a visit to a hospital that he thought schools and teachers have done a fantastic job or getting ready for the new term. He told Sky News: I have no doubt that it can be done, it can be done safely. schools are doing a huge amount to make sure it can be done safely.Just for the sake of social justice, for ensuring that all kids get the education they need, we need, to get our pupils back to school in September.But Mr Argar saidthere was strong scientic evidence suggesting wearing masks would keep any fresh outbreaks in schools at bay they would consider introducing them. The Government has stressed that all schools in England will open for all pupils on September . The PMs official spokesman tried to allay fears schools could close againareas were thrown into local lockdowns. He said yesterday Schools would be the absolute last sector to close in any local lockdown.Other venues would be expected to be closed first in the event that strict lockdown measures would have to be applied.It is a national priority to get schools open and keep schools open.He said a detailed and robust plan had been developed in the event of pupils coming down with the virus, adding: Local directors of public health would agree appropriate measures with the schools – for instance, the bubble which the infected child was in not attending school for  days.Test kits will be available for schools to help them quickly get a child or member of staff testedthey need to.Mr Argar assured worried parents that it was safe to send their kids back to schools after a study suggested teenager could spread coronavirus just as easily as adults. Last night The Times reported the fresh study from PHE is expected to say that older, secondary school pupils can transmit it just like adults do.Kids under  already are not required to wear masks in areas where adults are expected to wear them - such as public transport. He said: That isnt complete research, that work is still underway and I dont want to prejudge what that will and wont say.Multiple international studies from France, Australia and Denmark have shown children are much less likely to become infected and pass it on to other people, Mr Argar said. He said: One study does not a consensus make. Parents can have confidence that their children can go back to school. Kids in Scotland were the first children in the UK to head back to full classrooms since March today, with all schools in Scotland set to be reopened by August . Social distancing measures have been put in place - including staggered lunch breaks and extra time for hand washing between lessons. Boris Johnson visited a school yesterday as teachers prepare for kids to come back to classrooms. He said it was the nations moral duty to ensure children can restart face-to-face learning again.

Co-authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand say Princess Michael’s choice of accessory was “at the bare minimum” an “insensitivity to Meghan’s African American roots and the racism she had encountered since pairing up with Harry.”The authors write: “When it comes to royal fashion, much thought goes into every detail.“Princess Michael’s choice of brooch could have simply been a mistake, but in the back of Meghan’s mind, she wonderedthere wasn’t a message being sent in the pin of the torso of an African man wearing a gold turban and ornate clothing.”Finding Freedom claims revealed today include:Blackamoor is a style of artwork dating back to the s, usually found in sculpture, jewellery and textiles.Black men and women are often depicted as slaves and blackamoor is now considered to have racist connotations.

It is now considered to be racially insensitive and even the name has been slammed as a term of abuse for anyone with dark skin.The figures - usually men but sometimes women - are shown fixed in positions of servitude, such as footmen or waiters, or persony fantasies of racial conquest.Some argue that many European ornaments often depict black people as exotic noblemen and women.The figures are usually painted with gold leaf in a highly decorative style and can be worth signicant sums of money. It was not the first time Princess Michael  - dubbed Princess Pushy - had been embroiled in a race storm.In , she was accused of insulting black party guests at a New York restaurant by allegedly telling them to “go back to the colonies” in a row over noise.She strongly denied the claims and said she had said she would be “ready to go back to the colonies” during the dispute with the table.The royal also later referred to African people as “adorable” in a TV interview discussing her travels through the country. Finding Freedom sheds new light on the intimate details of Meghan and Harry’s relationship and their departure from royal le.

Right in the head, I never miss...I am Eagle One. I follow every order. I am happy to be part of the Sinaloa Cartel. Indeed, El Mayos power is felt through every level of authority, with Victor Gerardo Garay Cadena, who was formerly in charge of the federal police anti-drug unit, saying: He is the mastermind of the drug business here in Mexico. Meanwhile a Mexican journalist adds on camera: Mayo is well known that when hes angry, its better for you to hide wherever you can...If they want you dead, youre going to be dead.David Lorino, an ex special agent in Chicagos DEA, managed the agents that put the case against El Mayo together. He explained they began their hunt for him by buying drugs on street corners, before listening into phone calls and tracking the chain back up to Mayo and Chapo.Meanwhile former special agent Jack Riley, who was part of the hunt for him, revealed that their main tactic was to focus on his son and brother - who are less cautious when using phones.They started monitoring his brother Jesus El Rey Zambadas house in Mexico City on October , , before a huge shootout and raid resulted in his arrest. Desperate, Zambada called the chief research officer of the federal police anti-drug unit - who it turned out had been working for the cartel in secret.Zambada was very well protected. Today we understand why - he was surrounded by policemen, Cadena reveals.Because he paid them, as the saying goes, money talks. The police is state-funded but drug dealers pay more.In most of my career, in some areas Ive been, I noticed half of the officers were involved with them.It snowballed from there and El Mayos son, El Vicentillo, was also later arrested.After holding him for two years in complete isolation, agents finally persuaded him that hed only ever be freedhe gave information on the cartel and their enemies.If we can take information from one bad guy, and take another bad guy out of business, is that a bad thing  Lorino says on camera.We told him, youre going to have to tell us about your dad and your dads activities. Thats your only option for probably ever seeing the outside of a jail cell again.Eventually, Mayo himself spoke to his son on the phone and apparently told him: You do what you have to do son, to help yourself and your family.Sure enough, Vicente spoke to officers and Riley explains: He led to probably hundreds of arrests. He showed us how they operate.Chapo, seeing the net closing in, reportedly began to make more public appearances.Towards the end, Chapo became stupid. He started going places he shouldnt and doing public things. Mayo was concerned that Chapo was going to lead to more heat for the organisation, Riley adds.Eladio agrees on camera, saying: He felt over-confident about his safety.Its now widely believed that El Mayo continues to run the cartel in his former partners absense - but with claims hes suffering health issues including diabetes, its unclear for how long.We still think Mayo may be the number one bag guy in the world, Riley admits.Worlds Most Wanted also uncovers the stories of four other wanted fugitives.They include Félicien Kabuga, who is suspected to have been involved in the Rwandan genocide, Samantha Lewthwaite , Sacilian Mafia boss Matteo Messina Denaro and Ukrainian-born Russian organised crime boss Semion Mogilevich.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I just saw it in the corner of my eye and just straight away took a video.”It was the size of a medium dog, lean and very agile looking. It was a light sand colour with dark spots, and big pointed ears. Much bigger than a regular cat.It had no collar and didnt seem to be in any panic. It just simply walked on by.The markings on the cat, which Dan filmed, are distinctive and look similar to those of a Savannah Cat.These animals are larger than a domestic house cat, and can be as tall as cms.They are the result of crossing a domestic cat and a Serval — a medium-sized, large-eared wild African cat.Dan said he began researching what the animal he saw on Sunday could have been and came across stories of the Fen Tiger, which has allegedly been spotted by numerous people throughout the county over for over  years. The most recent suspected sighting of the animal happened behind Abbotsley golf club in St Neots on December  last year. He added: I looked it up on Google and Im pretty certain it was a Savannah cat, a hybrid of a Serval and a domestic cat. As far as I am aware they are legal in the UK but onlythey are under a certain size.Earlier this year armed cops swooped after reports of a “large cat” prowling through a back garden in North London.The hybrid Savannah cat escaped from the garden of a mansion on Billionaires Row, in leafy Hampstead, before scaring locals by wandering through their backyards.And last year a mum told how she saved her two young children from a ferocious “supercat” as it stalked them in their garden.The cat, also thought to be a hybrid Savannah cat, was on the loose before police investigated.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are already at work finding you,” Lightfoot said. “I dont care - I do not care - whatever justication was given for this. There is no justication for criminal behavior ever. You have no right to take and destroy the property of others.”Lightfoot added that Chicago residents “deserve to be safe” and businesses deserve to “enjoy safety and security.”Black Lives Matter Chicago criticized Lightfoot in a statement obtained by the Chicago Sun-Times.“The mayor clearly has not learned anything since May, and she would be wise to understand that the people will keep rising up until the [Chicago Police Department] is abolished and our Black communities are fully invested in,” the statement read. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It would mean teachers have the right to stop workingthey say they feel unsafe because of Covid- risks in the classroom.If the unions exploit this loophole, it jeopardises Boris Johnson’s promises to get schools up and running from September.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer was last night under pressure to distance himself from Hendy’s wrecking bid.A Government source said: “Sir Keir Starmer needs to stop dancing to the unions’ tune and start helping to get children back into the classroom safely.”The Sun understands the NEU, the UK’s largest teaching union, attended Hendy’s briefing on his plan. So did the PCS public sector union and the RMT union.The meeting was organised by the Trade Union Coordinating Group in June and his advice has been widely circulated in union circles. Hendy had not last night responded to repeated requests for comment.The leak reveals his plan involves using the  Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations as a loophole.At the virtual meeting, Hendy said the laws “require that the employer shall ensure that the exposure of his employees to ­substances hazardous to health is prevented”.He said: “Substances hazardous to health clearly include the virus Covid-.”He added employees, including teachers in his view, have the right to stop work in “circumstances of danger, which the employee reasonably believed to be serious and imminent and which he could not ­reasonably have been expected to avert”.He added: “Nobody could doubt that ­coronavirus is serious. The imminence of the threat depends on the circumstances of the workplace: The lone tractor driver ploughing a field is not likely to be in such circumstances, school teachers in a small classroom with  kids in them might be in a very dferent situation. So, workers do have rights to refuse work.”The NEU yesterday said: “The NEU is not being advised by Lord Hendy on Covid-. We want schools to open as a priority and to remain open as a priority.”Tory Party chairman Amanda Milling said: “At a time when everyone should be working together to get children back to school, it beggars belief a key Labour figure is actively working to hinder the education of children. It’s time for Sir Keir to come off the fence and unequivocally back efforts to get children back into schools.”A Labour source said: “It’s a matter of record Keir wants schools open in September and making it happen is a priority.

Exam results day in Scotland was described as a “shambles” last Tuesday after nearly , predicted grades were downgraded by the Scottish Qualications Authority .And there are fears the same thing will happen in England when A Level results come out on Thursday, and GCSEs later this month.Exams chiefs came under fire after large numbers of pupils had their scores marked down. But the models take into account ious factors including data on a schools historic grades in the same subjects.Soone year group did particularly well - better than last years cohort - they would be unlikely to get the higher grades they may have been predicted.The system is said to have penalised kids from poorer backgrounds more - as their school marks are more likely to be dragged down.In a grovelling apology Mr Swinney told the Scottish Parliament today: I can confirm to Parliament today that all downgraded awards will be withdrawn.   Using powers available to me I am today directing the SQA to re-issue those awards based solely on teacher or lecturer judgement.He added: Perhaps our approach to maintaining standards for the  cohort alongside every other year - even though  is so unique - did not fully understand the trauma of Covid- for this year group and did not appreciate that a dferent approach might actually help to even things out.However, its not yet clear what the decision means for England - as exam boards are separate and use dferent systems.No exams were sat this summer due to the coronavirus crisis.A mixture of teachers and computers decided this years grades.Sir Michael Wilshaw said today he feared that children eagerly expecting their exam results on Thursday may end up being bitterly disappointed toothey use the same model.He told Sky News today: I am concerned and I suspect a lot of other people will be very concerned that we don’t see a replication of what happened in Scotland, which has shown a large number of downgrades and a disproportionate number of downgrades of youngsters from poor backgrounds in some of the most disadvantaged schools.That must not happen here, and I hope Odqual, the regulators of exam systems in England, are aware of the dangers of that, and are going to be taking remedial stepsthat does happen.He said what has happened in Scotland... may happen here in England and Wales.There has been an imbalance in the judgements made between the schools performance and its history of examination performance, and taking into account inidual student performance, he said.If there is an imbalance in that and they get that balance wrong then things will go badly wrong.Exam board Ofqual should make sure they drill down into the results of each school before changing marks.The Office of Qualications and Examinations Regulationis being urged by leading headteachers to overhaul the system over concerns a generation of teenagers could lose outtheir grades are off.But the Department for Education says the English system is dferent to Scotlands and there are ways for kids to appeal their gradesthey feel they have been unfairly treated.Dr Martin Stephen, the former High Master of St Pauls Boys School, said the current results system was tantamount to imposing a le sentence on children.Ministers in England are under pressure to not let a similar Scots-style fiasco happen here.The Department for Education has said pupils will be able to resit the examsthey dont like the grade they are given later this week.But they wont automatically get a right to appeal their marks this time around, which could throw into chaos university applications and moving on to further education. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Managing director Peter Heath added: “The live events industry supply chain, essential to every single event in the UK, is set to completely collapse without financial support from the government, due to social distancing prohibiting mass events. Large scale events are not expected to reopen until Spring  at the earliest, and the reality is that the sector can’t wait that long.

There had been moments where he felt people working with his brother had put things out to make William look good, evenit meant throwing Harry under the bus. It was a confusing time, and his head was all over the place - he didnapost know who or what to believe, and he and William werenapost talking enough either, which made everything a lot worse. Meghanaposs tears before final engagement as emotions aposfinally set inapos The Sussexes said their goodbyes to royal le at the Commonwealth Day Service at Westminster, when they joined the Queen, Prince Charles, Camilla, Kate, William and other senior members of the firm for the annual celebration. While the couple looked happy and relaxed as they took their seats, Scobie and Durand claim it was a very dferent story just moments before when emotions final set in. They write: Harry quietly slipped through the door of the  Room to say hello, and the reality - and the emotions - finally set in. Meghan turned around to hug goodbye the last remaining people in the room, including an author of this book. With the state room almost empty except for a few familiar faces, the tears the duchess has been holding back were free to flow. She embraced some of the dedicated team members whose tireless efforts - to promote the coupleaposs work, launch landmark projects, and deal with the near-daily crisis brought on by the tabloids - had come to an abrupt end. aposI canapost believe thisapos, she said, hugging one of the young female aides she had become close with. Though Team Sussex was a much smaller operation than the more sophisticated offices at Clarence House and Kensington Palace, in the short space of a year since setting up, they had become like family. Meghan then went to change into the stunning green outfit she chose for the historical event, joking with staff that it was her last hat for a while. Meghan underwent SAS training, which she found aposintense and scaryapos After their relationship was made public, Meghan received a a large number of threats, the book claims.She was therefore given two days of SAS training, which she found intense and scary. Scobie and Durand write: The training - which all senior member of the royal family except the Queen have completed at SAS headquarters in Hereford - is preparation for all high-risk security scenarios including kidnapping, hostage situations and terrorist attacks. The authors describe how the duchess was bundled into the back of a car by a terrorist and driven to a location before she was saved by officers. As well as this, Meghan also had training to prepare for a new le as a royal - just like the Duchess of Cambridge. The book claims: Set to undergo the same informal training Kate had embarked upon following her engagement to William - a series of instructions that covered everything from how to most gracefully exit your chauffeured sedan while wearing a pencil skirt to when to courtesy to members of the family several rungs up the hierarchy from you - Meghan was connected to a team of experts. Meghan and Harry were forced to sack Archieaposs nanny after aposirresponsible behaviourapos Despite initially not wanting a nanny, the couple started looking for a night nurse to help them sort out Archieaposs sleeping routine. However things didnapost go well and they were force to let the woman go in the middle of her second night working from them. The book states: They decided to hire a night nurse to establish a sleep schedule and be an extra pair of helping hands. But their time with the couple brief. Meghan and Harry were forced to let the nurse go in the middle of her second night for being unprofessional and irresponsible. Despite the bad experience, Meghan and Harry decided to try another nanny, however the first experience had left them too nervous. The book continues: Neither found themselves comfortable sleeping through the night without going to check on Archie regularly. So after a few weeks they decided to let her go and take on the nighttime duties themselves, instead employing a nanny to help them in the day. Envelope containing racist musings and unidentied white powder sent to palace During her time in the royal family Meghan was subjected to a number of racist threats, including a terrying incident where a letter filled with white power was sent to Kensington Palace, the book claims.  The authors write: Kensington Palace security specialists intercepted a letter addressed to the couple. While on the outset it seemed to be much like any other piece of mail received by the busy mail room based at Clarence House, this one was filled with racist musings and an unidentied white powder. The material, feared to be anthrax, turned out to be harmless. At least physically. The night of the incident, though, Meghan barely slept, later admitting to a friend that she worried the incident was her aposnew normalapos. A good friend of Meghanaposs called her Grace Under Fire, because despite whatever pressure she was under, she didnapost fall apart. Russian hackers stole hundreds of the couples personal photos, including wedding pictures The book also claims that a computer programmer in Russia managed to get their hands on hundreds of Meghan and Harryaposs engagement and wedding photos.  The authors write: Among the stolen images were pictures of the couple sharing personal moments during their engagement photo series as well as others from their wedding day reception . The large set also included outtakes with eyes half closed and other unflattering moments meant for the trash can. The book claims that the hacker published the photos online, but many fans just believed they were fakes. As well as causing upset, the data breach also made they extremely concerned about security. The authors write: Harry and Meghan were aposalarmed to hear that it was so easy to get such personal files of theirs. The Queen was very fond of Meghan There have been many reports in the months since Meghan and Harry quit about the Queenaposs upset and disappointment at their decision. However the new book also details how the Monarch felt about Meghan prior to that, during her early days in the royal family.  The two royal women undertook their first joint engagement - a day in Chester in June , just a few weeks after the royal wedding - which was a huge success.Despite a few hiccups which proved Meghan was understandably still learning the ropes, including a slightly awkward moment when the Duchess asked who should get in the car first - they were seen laughing and chatting and seemed to thoroughly enjoy each otheraposs company.Scobie and Durand write: The Queen had a level of confidence in Meghan, because as a Palace source shared, aposshe handles these situations flawlessly because sheaposs always well prepared and respectful. Sheaposs very clever and good at understanding whataposs requiredapos. The source continues: The Queen was wonderful, warm, and generous toward the new Duchess. She made sure Meghan knew what was going on and made her feel very much at home because it was her first trip. Scobie and Durand also note that the Queen gave Meghan a beautul pair of earrings, featuring pearls and diamonds, to mark the special day.  They write: Meghan, an avid learner studying all she could on royal protocol, was often seen carrying binders full of research so she didnapost put a foot wrong. She took her new role incredibly seriously. That day was dferent, though she was getting a royal master class in training from the Queen herself. Harry was apospleasantly surprisedapos when Meghan peed in a bush In the early days of their relationship Meghan and Harry travelled to Botswana for a romantic getaway. Despite making a luxury lodge their main base, they spent five days of the trip alone in the wilderness. It was during this time that Harry realised just down-to-earth Meghan was, and was delightfully surprise by how she was roughing it. The Duchess reportedly packed very little clothing and cleaned her face with baby wipes and happily wandered into the woodlandsshe needed a bathroom break. A friend of the couple told the authors: The fact that theyaposre both as happy just throwing on a backpack and going out to eplore...I honestly think these experiences will never stop for them. Meghan Markle was convinced Princess Michael of Kent apossent hurtful messageapos with brooch Princess Michael of Kent was widely criticised for wearing a brooch many believe is racially and culturally offensive for a Christmas event, and the book claims Meghan was convinced she was sending her a message. Meghan was invited to spend Christmas with the royals in Sandringham in , breaking tradition as she wasnapost yet officially in the family, and joined them for a church service at St Mary Magdalene.  However Scobie and Durand claim the celebrations were overshadowed by Princess Michaelaposs blackamoor brooch. Blackamoor is a style of Italian decorative art dating back to the end of the Middle ages and typically displays images of African men wearing head coverings and rick jewels to contrast with their skin colour.

Todd Jarrett, , told BirminghamLive he was working on a roof when he spotted two masked people walking down the road on Monday last week. They werenapost wearing coronavirus masks and they were not acting normal, he said.They were fidgeting and was walking straight for me. Thinking nothing of it he continued to help his colleagues but the teens crossed the road and an argument erupted, Todd says.  They were just staring at me, he said.So I said aposwhat are you looking atapos and he began shouting it back at me. One of them started throwing his arms around and me, being a boxing coach, I got into my stance just in case. He said to me aposjust you wait, just you waitapos.  One of the pair then brandished the firearm and shouted “do you want me to shoot you ” at Todd. Undeterred by the threats, Todd called out the tracksuit-clad man, saying: Do you think youaposre a big man  What are you going to do, shoot me Speaking about the incident Todd said: Iaposve been stabbed a couple of times before and Iaposve learned to get used to these kinds of stressful situations. When you think back you go aposf*** I could have been shotapos. But, at the time, it didnapost really cross my mind.  I was already in too deep at that point and wasnapost going to back down.If I was going to stop, I would have done it at the start of the argument and not at the end. In the astonishing dash cam clip, the grey tracksuit-clad man can be seen pointing what turned out to be a BB gun towards Todd as cars continue to pass by. Residents and other members of the public can also be seen in the area as the drama unfolds.  Firearm officers from Staffordshire Police were deployed to the scene shortly after and two people were later arrested and a “realistic-looking” BB gun was recovered.

Mark Bonito and Sophie Why bought the Fiat Ducato at an auction after it could no longer be used by medics, with all of the ambulanceaposs le-saving kit still inside. They disconnected the equipment and stripped it out, before giving it a good clean and starting the project of turning the emergency vehicle into a home. Mark was determined to use as many reclaimed items as possible, and the pair scouted car boots, charity shops and garage clear-outs to find what they needed. The interior is now unrecognisable, with a kitchen, living room, bed and desk all fitted out for just £,. The flashing blue lights have been removed and the outside has been restored so it still resembles a van but wouldnapost be mistaken for one. Mark and Sophie, who named the van Florence after the hero nurse, now use their mobile home to travel around and take in some of the best sights on offer.  Mark, a web developer from Surrey, said: Weaposve been to Dorset for the amazing panoramic views of the sea, with a am alarm to sit and watch the sunrise with a cup of tea. Weaposve had a few forest adventures, some riverside stays and last weekend we stayed with the children in the South Downaposs National Park, which is a dark sky reserve with an amazing view of the stars. When weaposve been travelling to these places and there has been heavy traffic, we always say how handy it would be to still have the blue lights. We often get a second glance from other road users too.  The van has also been great for our relationship. We both have families from previous relationships, so it is great being able to have time alone together in the van but be able to get back quickly to our kidswe need to. Mark, , previously owned a Volkswagen T which he converted into a camper, but in April  he decided to upgrade his crash pad and set about refurbishing the ambulance. The bunk bed was picked up at a garage and the kitchen area was constructed from a rescued block found in a skip, with the original ambulance cabinet being converted into a sink. It took two months to complete and Mark recently passed the enhanced driving test required to drive such a heavy vehicle.  Sophie, , who works as a radiographer, said: Mark is always the first to admit that some research should have been carried out, as owning an ambulance does come with its complications. He likes things a little on the quirky side and liked the idea of buying a van that was complete with a good standard of servicing, and fully equipped with gadgets galore. Rescuing a service vehicle that had done a heroic job from being scrapped seemed the right thing to do. Mark added: We love the fact we have a reuse theme with all our reclaimed and upcycled items. Each item bears a memory of where we got it from.

Nigel Wright, , from Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, also sent letters threatening to inject salmonella into tins of food, the court was told. The farmer is accused of demanding £.million in Bitcoin by sending letters to the supermarket giant in order for him to reveal what goods had been contaminated. He denies two counts of contaminating goods and four counts of blackmail. On the first day of his trial at the Old Bailey today, the jury heard Wright had initially demanded  bitcoin from Tesco. He claimed to be part of a cohort of disgruntled dairy farmers calling themselves Guy Brush and the Dairy Pirates who believed they had been underpaid by Tesco.  This sum later rose to  bitcoin - worth around £. million in February . Prosecutor Julian Christopher QC told the jury: The prosecution allege that over a period of two years from spring , the defendant hoped to make himself rich by means of blackmail. In November and December , two mums found slivers of metal in jars of baby food as they fed them to their children. The first jar was bought in Rochdale, while the second was bought in Lockerbie. He also claimed the salmonella and chemicals had been injected into cans from other brands, and threatened to continue poisoning Tesco productspayment was not made, it is said. A draft of messages sent to Tesco was found on Wrightaposs laptop and photos of tins of food and jars of baby food and slivers of metal. There is no evidence that any other products other than the two jars of metal-spiked baby food discovered were actually contaminated, the Old Bailey heard. In one of the counts of blackmail, Wright allegedly threatened to kill a driver with whom he had had a road rage altercation unless he paid him bitcoin worth £,. Wright allegedly tracked him down and sent him a letter including a picture of the complainant and his we with bullet holes and a target superimposed on it, the court heard. He was eventually traced to his family home on a farm outside of Market Rasen where he lived with his we and two children and their flock of sheep.

It was a light sand colour with dark spots, and big pointed ears. Much bigger than a regular cat. It had no collar and didnapost seem to be in any panic. It just simply walked on by. It walked by, stopped for a sec then carried on walking. I got up and followed it and it just scampered away into the hedgerow. I tried to follow it some more but it had gone. After his search for the wildcat was unsuccessful Dan decided he would look into it a bit more and research what the animal could have been, which is where he came across the stories of the Fen Tiger. The Fen Tiger has, as the myth goes, been on the prowl in Cambridgeshire and beyond for over  years, with numerous sightings being reported throughout the county. The most recent suspected sighting of the animal happened behind Abbotsley golf club in St Neots on December  last year. He said: I know there is a lot of buzz around the myth of the aposFen Tigerapos so it could be quite humorous to find it is just a large cat.

Anmol Chana, , is said to have been obsessed with knives and had previously fantasised about attacking his mother with boiling oil. Jasbir Kaur, , and her husband, Rupinder Bassan, , were found dead at their home in Oldbury, West Midlands, two days after he moved back to live with them. Jurors were told that after stabbing the couple more than  times, Chana met several women, including an escort, before heading to the pub. Prosecution barrister Jason Pitter QC, opening the case, said: You will hear something of the contact he made with some ladies - at least one of them was an escort.  He visited a pub where he had a drink and calmly played pool knowing his mother and her husband must have been dead. “We know he was making plans to leave the country and purchased a plane ticket to Italy via Turkey. “There was a reminder on his phone to buy another kne, but fortunately this was not put in effect. Chana is said to have had a fascination with knives since the age of . Police were called out on several occasions and it is alleged blades had to be locked away by his family, the court was told.  In  Chana is said to have sent a text saying: Man, I want to kne her or pour boiling oil down her throat,her head in a chip pan. But Birmingham Crown Court heard that despite his behaviour Jasbir and Rupinder wanted to look after him at their home in Moat Road. They readied a bedroom for his arrival on February  this year. But by the early hours of February  the defendantaposs sister Kiran phoned police after she was unable to contact her mum. Mr Pitter told how officers were immediately met with a bloody scene when they attended the address.  He added: Drag marks leading to the bodies in the rear living room area. ...Both of them, we say, had been brutally murdered - stabbed multiple times with a kne in what must have been a ferocious attack. The tragedy is they were killed by the defendant who they had only, that same Saturday, allowed to stay under this same roof.

Kusi Kimani, , from East Sussex, was shocked when she discovered a brown bra on the retaileraposs website was called tobacco. The lighter colours of the £ Marks  Spencer Collection padded bras are described as cinnamon and fudge. Ms Kimani complained about the bra for her skin tone carrying negative connotations, while more positive words were used for lighter colours. Yet two months on from her initial complaint, the bra is still being sold in a tobacco colour on the Marks  Spencer website. However, the retailer pledged to drop the name when approached by the Mirror and apologised for not acting sooner. Ms Kimani told : I saw it about two weeks after George Floydaposs death and it was particularly raw to see at that time. Why not call it cocoa, caramel or chocolate - sweet dessert items  But they used tobacco. I was shocked when I saw it. Itaposs hurtful to me and my friends. If a young girl who is already uncomfortable with the colour of her skinshe will be feeling even more alienated. Each week that website is showing that racism is another week a young girl may come across it and feel bad for the rest of her le. To see that apostobaccoapos is for their skin tone will make them feel unwanted by society. Tobacco is referred to in society as bad, unhealthy, and highly likely to kill - ‘smoking kills’.  This is an example of how bias is ingrained into society and only helps fuel racism, be it overt or covert, however in this instance this is a form of covert racism. The pharmaceutical clinical trials manager said she just wanted Marks  Spencer to change the name online - and to explain its reasons for the delay. The companyaposs customer service team previously told her that its colour names were not supposed to carry negative connotations.  In an email on June , the retailer said it was reviewing its naming convention and also looking at its product range with BAME staff. The message said: The names we use are taken from those on a colour palette and were never designed to match to a skin tone - I would like to assure you the choice of names is absolutely not intended to carry any negative connotations. We review design trends in the market each year to ensure we are offering a fashionable palette to all our customers, and we are actively reviewing our naming convention in the light of the feedback we are receiving. We liaise with our store colleagues on a regular basis to determine which colours we need to offer our customer and we are also working with our BAME colleague network to receive their input too. The customer service representative said the company knows it had to have a better, wider skin colour offer, particularly for black and dark skin tones. They added that the range is currently under review so improvements can be made. Ms Kimani told : I approached Marks  Spencer as I thought it could have been an oversight. It shouldnapost be a matter of having to fight to be taken seriously. They are willing to stand with the Black Lives Matter movement but they are not willing to put in the work to make changes. In the past I would have been upset about it and buried it away. But this BLM movement has given me courage.

It comes amid the global release of a biography that has sent shockwaves through the royal households, revealing explosive claims about their fall out with The Firm. Well placed sources have told how ‘Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of a Modern Royal Familyapos, paints a “very one sided account” that “will leave lasting scars” on the couple’s relationships with senior royals. The book chronicles the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s romance and brief period as members of the monarchy before they sensationally quit their royal roles to forge a new le for themselves and their son Archie in America.  Royal reporters, Omid Scobie, , and Carolyn Durand who co-authored the book, claim they did not have interviews with the couple but instead spoke to “more than  sources, with access to the couple’s inner circle..... everything corroborated with at least two sources”. A palace source said: “One may indeed wonder who those two sources are. “It’s fair to say there is a great deal of skepticism over the involvement of the book’s two primary subjects. “It’s sadly hard to imagine a world where this won’t do lasting damage to many of the personal relationships explored in this very one sided account.” Royal watchers have likened the book’s release to Andrew Morton’s sensational  biography of Princess Diana, titled ‘In Her Own Words’. The Princess of Wales was later revealed to have heavily corroborated with the journalist which led to a tit-for-tat airing of grievances in the media between herself and Prince Charles after their orce.  Here we explore the latest raft of claims and allegations on behalf of Harry and Meghan. Asked whether Harry and Meghan corroborated with his book, Mr Scobie told ITV’s Lorraine show yesterday: “I know there’s a lot of rumours and talk about the couple cooperating with the book and us having secret interviews with them and that’s really not the case.”. Harry felt he was “thrown under the bus” by aides working for his brother Unhappy at playing second fiddle to his brother William and sister in law Kate, Harry believed the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s aides conspired against him to plant stories in the media painting him in a negative light. A source told the authors: “Harry was upset that it was playing out so publicly. There had been moments where he felt people working with his brother had put things out there to make William look good, evenit meant throwing Harry under the bus. “It was a confusing time, and his head was all over the place—he didn’t know who or what to believe, and he and William weren’t talking enough either, which made everything a lot worse.”  The authors claim that royal aides feared Meghan and Harry’s popularity was eclipsing that of the Royal Family itself. Meghan has in recent weeks told how she felt “unsupported” by the royals as it appears she and Harry were unhappy playing second fiddle to William and Kate, the future King and Queen.. Royal courtiers feared the brother’s falling out threatened the end of the monarchy The authors of Finding Freedom claim a crisis meeting was held in  to “protect the monarchy” amid speculation Harry’s deteriorating relationship with William. Harry had bizarrely labelled William a “snob” for referring to Meghan as “that girl” after he voiced concerns that he might be rushing his romance with the TV actress. After the hype of Harry, Meghan, William and Kate being labelled the ‘Fab Four’, relations soon soured with Harry and Meghan moving out of Kensington Palace and deciding to set up their own brand under the SussexRoyal banner. One courtier allegedly told the authors the royal households were in full blown panic mode as the brothers’ relationship disintegrated, saying: “It’s no secret, the future of this monarchy relies solely on the four people currently in Kensington Palace. “The public popularity only lies with them . . . “When he [the Prince of Wales] becomes King, the only way it lasts isthe four of them are not at war. “We cannot have them at war.”. William and Harry’s relationship with Prince Charles is “hot and cold” The book claims The Prince of Wales’ official th birthday photograph with his family turned into a “nightmare” because his sons blew “hot and cold” with their father. The book also comments on how when Charles contracted Covid-, Harry immediately telephoned his father to find out how the -year-old was doing.  A source said: “The boys can be hot and cold with their father”, alleging neither William nor Harry “made much of an effort to make themselves available”. The authors wrote: “’While Charles may be father to Harry, he’s also their boss, and that makes the relationship complex for a number of reasons. “Charles is extremely focused on his public image, and there have been times Harry has felt that has taken precedence over everything .” Royal sources said: “Nothing could be further from the truth. Both the Duke of Cambridge and the Duke of Sussex enjoy a strong relationship with their father, both checking in on him regularly when he contracted coronavirus earlier this year and their bond is as strong ever.” . Meghan received SAS training after being suspicious white powder sent to Kensington Palace Meghan and Harry were overwhelmingly welcomed into the arms of the British public but in certain quarters there remained a dark and worrying reception to their union. This culminated in not only vile hate speech on social media s, but also in Kensington Palace security teams intercepting an envelope that was feared to contain the deadly toxin Anthrax. The book says: “While on the outside it seemed to be much like any other piece of mail received by the busy mail room based at Clarence House, this one was filled with racist musings and unidentied white powder. “The material feared to be anthrax, turned out to be harmless. At least physically.  “The night of the incident, though, Meghan barely slept, later admitting to a friend that she worried the incident was her ‘new normal’.” As past of her training for entering the royal family, just as Harry, William and Kate had before her, Meghan had to take part in a mock kidnapping scenario from former SAS soldiers. She was taught how to establish a relationship with her abductors as well as being “saved” from a hostage situation by officers firing fake guns. . Meghan and Harry sacked Archie’s nanny after two days following an unknown “incident during the night” After initially deciding not to have a nanny for their first born, Meghan and Harry changed their minds when Meghan’s mum Doria went back to the US after visiting her new grandchild. But the book reveals they were forced to dismiss their first nanny after finding her to be “unprofessional and irresponsible” on just her second night working for them. Speaking about what they describe as an “incident” with the first, the book reveals: “They decided to hire a night nurse to establish a sleep schedule and be an extra pair of helping hands.  “But their time with the couple was brief. “Meghan and Harry were forced to let the nurse go in the middle of her second night for being unprofessional and irresponsible. Archie’s second nanny also left her job working for the couple - as did several members of their staff in just a matter of months. Meghan and Harry also sacked  of their loyal staff as soon as they handed in their notice to leave the royal family. . Despite lawsuits and ambitious charity plans on ice, the couple are “thriving” since stepping back from the royal family, author claims. Harry and Meghan are “very forward focused” despite a catalogue of setbacks since they left The Firm. Their plans to launch their own charity ‘Archewell’ after being banned by the Queen from using ‘Sussex Royal’ have still not been realised due to the global pandemic. Their scheduled programme to make millions delivering speeches for numerous corporate giants are also in tatters - with both Harry and Meghan having to settle to make statements on zoom calls.

The couple shared a number of official snaps from their nuptials in May , but the bulk of the photo album - including shots from the evening reception - were kept private. A new biography on the coupleaposs decision to quit the royal family, Finding Freedom, claims that in September  a computer programmer managed to access photos stored in an online cloud system. The drive included  unseen photos from their wedding and engagement shoots, including shots of them with the Queen. Authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand write: Among the stolen images were pictures of the couple sharing personal moments during their engagement photo series as well as others from their wedding day reception . The large set also included outtakes with eyes half closed and other unflattering moments meant for the trash can. The book claims that the hacker published some of the photos online on Tumblr. Several of the snaps were spotted by royal fans but most believed they were fake or Photoshopped. As well as causing upset at the intrusion, the data breach also made they extremely concerned about security.  The authors write: Harry and Meghan were aposalarmed to hear that it was so easy to get such personal files of theirs. The whole situation was a wake up call. The book also talks about a terrying day when an envelope addressed to Meghan and Harry containing racist messages and an unidentied white powder was delivered to the palace. The authors write: Kensington Palace security specialists intercepted a letter addressed to the couple.  While on the outset it seemed to be much like any other piece of mail received by the busy mail room based at Clarence House, this one was filled with racist musings and an unidentied white powder.

A good friend of Meghanaposs called her Grace Under Fire, because despite whatever pressure she was under, she didnapost fall apart. As part of her royal training, Meghan had two days of SAS training which she described as intense and scary. Scobie and Durand write: The training - which all senior member of the royal family except the Queen have completed at SAS headquarters in Hereford - is preparation for all high-risk security scenarios including kidnapping, hostage situations and terrorist attacks.

The Duchess of Sussex revealed she is planning to vote in Novemberaposs US presidential election, a royal first. Traditionally, members of the royal family remain politically neutral, and while they are entitled to vote, they choose not to.But Meghan will break that tradition on November  when Donald Trump bids for another four years in the White House, and will probably go up against Joe Biden. Explaining her decision to vote, Meghan told magazine Marie Claire : I know what it’s like to have a voice, and also what it’s like to feel voiceless.I also know that so many men and women have put their lives on the line for us to be heard. And that opportunity, that fundamental right, is in our ability to exercise our right to vote and to make all our voices heard.  “One of my favourite quotes, and one that my husband and I have referred to often, is from Kate Sheppard, a leader in the suffragist movement in New Zealand, who said, ‘Do not think your single vote does not matter much. The rain that refreshes the parched ground is made up of single drops.’ That is why I vote.  Although Meghan didnapost reveal who she will be voting for in the election, she has often spoken of her support to the Democrat party. She also supported Hilary Clinton in the  election.Meghan regained her American citizenship when she moved back to the US with Prince Harry and Archie earlier this year after the couple announced they had stepped down from royal duties.

Labour said Boris Johnson must “wake up” and experts have warned worse is in store. And official figures out on Wednesday are expected to confirm Britain is in recession for the first time since . Immediate action must be taken by the Government to get people back to work, unions have warned as dire figures showed the extent of the jobs bloodbath. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “The alarm bells couldn’t be ringing any louder.” About , people were removed from company payrolls between March and the end of July. While the number of self- employed slumped by a record , between March and June, with many throwing in the towel as work dried up overnight. It means that, in total, the pandemic has already cost nearly a million workers their livelihoods – and there are warnings that far worse is to come. The numbers do not include the vast amount of people at risk of redundancy but still technically employed for now.

Department store Debenhams added to the bad news as it axed , jobs in branches and warehouses.It came as the Government reported the highest daily coronavirus cases – , – since June . Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the economy will have more “bumpy months” ahead. He added: “We always knew this was going to be a very tough time for people.”Speaking during a visit to a construction site at The County Hospital in Hereford, he said: “What we are going to have to do is to keep going with our plan to ‘build, build, build’ and build back better, and ensure we make the colossal investments we can now make in the UK economy to drive jobs and growth.” Yesterday’s figures from the Office for National Statistics show the biggest drop in people in work was among the self-employed, part-timers and over -year-olds.

Experts say unemployment would be far worsenot for the Government’s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. HMRC figures show the Government was still paying the wages of . million furloughed staff at the end of July, with the cost of the scheme now almost £billion. It meant the number of hours worked dropped to a record low. There are fears of a spike in job losses as firms have to begin paying towards furloughed workers’ wages, with the scheme ending altogether in October. John Phillips, acting general secretary, at the GMB union, warned: “This is the tip of the iceberg.”  The TUC is calling for the Job Retention Scheme to be extended. Ms O’Grady said: “The alarm bells couldn’t be ringing any louder. Ministers must act now to protect and create jobs.” Jonathan Reynolds, the Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, said: “The Government must wake up... and put an end to this jobs crisis and adopt a more flexible approach, targeted at the sectors who need it most.” The ONS revealed the number of people in work fell , in April to June, the biggest drop on the previous quarter since .  This figure does not even include huge numbers of people not classed as looking for work because the jobs market is so bleak.

Here we look at a world ravaged by a terrying and unpredictable disease… For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE BRAZIL Cases: ,, Deaths: , When on Sunday, Brazil became only the second country to pass , Covid deaths, president Jair Bolsonaro, instead of passing on condolences, criticised the country’s main TV network, Globo, for reporting the sombre milestone. Many blame the right-wing leader’s cavalier approach to the crisis for the death rate. After dismissing the pandemic as “hysteria” and a “little flu” he then urged people to disobey lockdown measures, encouraged supporters to “invade” field hospitals to film beds. Then, when questioned about the death rate, he enraged many by replying “So what ” ECUADOR Cases: , Deaths: , Early on in the pandemic, images of dead bodies piling up on the streets shocked the world as the country emerged as the epicentre of the disease in South America. Hospitals and morgues in its biggest city, Guayaquil, were overwhelmed and workers were collecting  corpses in the streets every day. But after eventually imposing a strict lockdown, including heavy fines for anyone not wearing a mask and closing all beaches, infections stabilised. Ecuador is even taking Covid patients from neighbouring countries.  EGYPT Cases: , Deaths: , Egypt reported Africa’s first confirmed case on February  and although the country now has more than , cases many believe the true figure to be much higher. Doctors have claimed they have been threatened and detained by the country’s National Security Agency for alleging that government figures are too low. Amnesty International has noted the arrest of at least six doctors for speaking out over it. MEXICO Cases: , Deaths: , After a brief, non-obligatory quarantine, the country started reopening its economy while cases were still on the up – and it now has the world’s third-highest death toll.  Notoriously frugal president Andres Obrador, , known as Amlo, has refused to spend money on testing, instead telling countrymen to beat the virus by losing weight, cutting out junk food and finding spirituality. Last month he defiantly said he will only wear a mask when the country eradicates corruption. NETHERLANDS Cases: , Deaths: , Contrary to most of the rest of the world, Holland’s government has told people not to use face masks, claiming there is no firm evidence to back them and even that they may actually hamper the fight against the disease. Yet the country has recently seen an alarming rise in infections, which have more than doubled over the past week, leading to fears Holland could be among the next countries to be remove from the UK’s “safe list”. USA Cases: ,, Deaths: , The US, which on Sunday passed five million infections, accounts for a quarter of the global case total and one in five deaths worldwide.  One in every  Americans has tested positive for coronavirus, while one in , has died from Covid- since the start of the pandemic. President Trump’s botched response to the virus has included suggesting injecting disinfectant and exposing patients to UV light, and telling officials to “slow down testing” to get the numbers down. Last week he repeated that he believes coronavirus will soon just “go away”. AUSTRALIA Cases: , Deaths:  One of several countries which had appeared to have controlled the virus, Australia suffered its deadliest day this week, with  deaths. The nation is dealing with an outbreak in its second-largest city, Melbourne, which began in quarantine facilities. The city is now one week into a strict lockdown expected to last until the middle of next month. CHINA Cases: , Deaths: , In the country where the virus first emerged in December, new locally transmitted cases fell to just  in  hours on Monday, the National Health Commission reported. There were also  cases brought into the country by Chinese travellers from overseas arriving in seven dferent cities and provinces across the country. There are now  countries with more cases than China, which has had fewer than , deaths. FRANCE Cases: , Deaths: , Cases increased by % last week from the previous week, leading to warnings that the country could be next on the UK quarantine list, with huge consequences for Brits on holiday there. Face masks became mandatory in busy areas of Paris on Monday after the country saw more than , infections on Friday. Officials said around  infection clusters are under investigation. IRAN Cases: , Deaths: , One of the first countries to face a surge in cases, Iran is still struggling to contain the virus, with deaths believed to be many times higher than the official figure.  Yesterday the government shut down daily newspaper Jahan-e Sanat after it quoted a top epidemiologist who claimed that Covid cases and deaths could be  times higher than the number reported by the Health Ministry. NEW ZEALAND Cases: , Deaths:  The response to the pandemic has been praised around the world. But yesterday, after  days without domestic transmission, PM Jacinda Ardern announced that four people from one family in South Auckland were found to have contracted Covid-.The city was put in lockdown for at leastthree days and people were told to “act asyou have Covid, and asthe people around you have Covid.”PHILIPPINES Cases: , Deaths: ,The country has among the highest number of infectionsin Asia. A surge in cases this month led maverick president Rodrigo Duterte, , to restore lockdown in and around Manila for two weeks, warning that he would mobilise the military toenforce restrictions.Yesterday, he offered to be “injected in public” with the  new Russian vaccine, amid concerns over its safety. RUSSIA Cases: , Deaths: , Experts here yesterday announced the world’s first vaccine for Covid-, despite concerns that the product may not have been fully tested.

I still wanted to go back home for a few weeks to a month but unfortunately I cannot do that this summer.“It is what it is but I love staying in Dundee and staying in Scotland and enjoying all the things we have to do here because it is such a beautul place.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

The word reliance often is used in the same breath but the Edinburgh side are so much more than that.Of course, with Horgan and Boyle, they use the wide areas well, with both players capable of bombing forward with terrying speed.However, what should scare their opponents more is the balance Hibs possess. It is something Ross is big on – his team being able to move and create space for each other.Everyone knows their roles and they seem to interchange like a finely-tuned machine.Full-backs Josh Doig and Paul McGinn overlapped at will against Livingston, with -year-old Doig getting beyond Horgan with regularity as Hibs overloaded the left side of the pitch.Gogic and Newell worked in tandem to control the middle of the park, while goalkeeper Ofir Marciano and centre-halves Ryan Porteous and Paul Hanlon weren’t scared to work with the ball at their feet either.Conversely, a lot of Hibs’ problems still lie at the back.Where their wide defenders seem to relish the wing back side of their role, defending as full backs they look susceptible to being overrun.United should be tasking Jamie Robson and Liam Smith, impressive in attack so far, to get at them.In the heart of the defence, giving away silly fouls, particularly on the edge of the box, looks like a major Achilles heel for the Hibees.Too often at Livingston, Porteous and Hanlon flew into challenges and created dangerous situations for their team, with Livingston’s consolation strike coming from a penalty the former needlessly gave away.A little bit of pressure could cause them to crumble and neither would enjoy the physical battle with big Louis Appere just days after Lyndon Dykes caused them problems.One benefit of games with no fans is you can hear almost every interaction on the park and in the dugouts.While Livi’s players and management launched verbal volleys at each other for the duration on Saturday, Hibs sauntered through the -plus minutes with an unwavering self-belief.They seem to possess a quiet confidence and a discipline that guides them through games, no doubt stemming from boss Ross himself.Although Hanlon is the captain, he is more of a silent leader. The Hibees are a side ruled by committee and governed by high standards and accountability.From experienced heads like Maricano and Horgan to younger players like Porteous and Doig, no one was found hiding.It would be obvious, and correct, to say Hibs’ main man is Nisbet – particularly after his three goals.However, with Scott Allan, so often the key man, riding the pine in West Lothian, it was Newell who really stepped up to the plate.The former Rotherham and Peterborough midfielder dictated the tempo superbly for the Leith men, picking out some delightful passes and taking up set-piece responsibilities, too.Horgan, too, impressed out wide and, despite it being a quiet day at the office for him, Boyle always seemed like he was about to make something happen.However, Newell was the man who made Hibs tick and one United, particularly Calum Butcher, will have to keep a close eye on.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

This happened during the latter phase of Brexit, to some extent under Boris Johnson, but in particular under Theresa May.#But that is rather dferent to the ing of the Cabinet of the UK Government.#The Cabinet Manual itself, which sets out the main rules for the conduct of government, makes clear what Westminster#s relationship with the devolved administrations should look like.The manual specically states that devolved governments are #separate administrations and not subject to the collective responsibility# and as such #consideration should be given to writing separately where they have an interest#.It adds that in some #exceptional# circumstances #ministers from the devolved administrations may be invited to attend meetings#.There are other forums in which ministers from the UK and devolved governments can meet, but as we have previously reported they have been widely criticised.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

While this comes as a relief to all concerned, it in no way diminishes the seriousness or stupidity of the player’s actions.”The eight Aberdeen players were told to self-isolate after two tested positive for Covid- after a night out at a bar in the city.As a result the Dons game against St Johnstone was called off.A statement released by the eight players read: “First and foremost we would like to apologise to every AFC fan, the manager, everyone at the club, the football authorities, the First Minister, all healthcare workers along with everyone  that has worked tirelessly around the clock to get the country, and in particular football, back up and running again.“We, as a small group of players, made a huge error of judgement last weekend by thinking it was ok to visit a city centre venue together.“None of us could have foreseen the escalation of Covid- cases in the Grampian area, nor did we deliberately attempt to flaunt or disobey Government guidelines which we all must adhere to, or indeed the clear guidelines set out by the club.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

It is also hugely damaging to the image, reputation and sustainability of the game.“We sympathise with the position this puts the Scottish Government in as the country is tentatively easing its way out of lockdown restrictions.“We agree wholeheartedly with the unequivocal message relayed to managers and captains by the National Clinical Director for Scotland, Professor Jason Leitch, last night. Clubs and players are in no doubt that there is now no more margin for error and no more scope for further breaches.“Since March, the Joint Response Group has worked hand-in-hand with government advisers and medical experts to ensure a safefor the professional game, with clubs undertaking to fulfil their obligations.“Players must heed the warning of the First Minister that this is a yellow-card moment for Scottish football.#Neil Doncaster, SPFL Chief Executive: “We have only been able to restart matches thanks to the enormous efforts and sacrices of literally thousands of people across the Scottish game. For anyone to put that in jeopardy in such a thoughtless and selfish manner is just beyond belief.“The vast majority of players and officials who have strictly observed the necessary restrictions will rightly see this as a real kick in the teeth.“Everyone knows that this season’s fixture schedule is already horrendously tight without having to reschedule matches because of the irresponsible actions of a handful of players.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

However, there are still numerous restrictions in place, including no operation of locks and bridges, limited services and limited staff available on the ground. This remains the position.#We are, however, pleased to let you know that Scottish Canals is planning to re-open canals to navigation in line with the announcement that Scotland’s tourism sector is preparing to reopen during phase three of the Scottish Government route map on July .

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer.Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go.The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence.Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel.  If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing.  Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport.  Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond.The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful.They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff.Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing.“We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.  Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping.“You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked.  They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place.  Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.·         Wales is open for camping from  July.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans. Executive general manager Margaret Livingstone-Evans said: “We have stayed upbeat and optimistic and have managed to generate enquiries throughout lockdown, by being creative about the ways in which we can make things happen, in a safe way.” More details at langleycastleFor more information on staying safe, please go to visitscotland"},{"url":null,"title":"creative writing how to begin","story":"Kenneth StevenUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe last few months have been a dficult and unsettling time. But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

I#d thought with it being near a pre-historic site they might say no, but he thought it sounded great. I was a bit taken aback. The forestry people were also up for it and all of a sudden it was all go,# said Gabi.Weather depending, it should take  days from start to finish. The first job is to clear brambles and other trip hazards before the lime washing can be applied.Dr Aaron Watson from Kilmartin Museum will be documenting the project.Gabi continued: #When I was researching what to white the stumps with I knew I wanted to use something traditional to Scotland that would not contaminate the place. Limewash is used to paint houses here. Then I discovered it creates crystals. Rockart was made using quartz # they would peck at rocks with it to make their marks. I liked the link.

Reduce light from the hall. Make sure there are no electronics sending out light e.g. a digital alarm clock with a lit display, sleep buttons on equipment etc.\"You may want to put black curtains at the window or wear an eye mask to limit the light getting into the eye.\"Sleep Scotland suggests wearing an eye maskOn the other end, you should also get lots of light in the morning to help you feel awake and alert.They added: \"Exposure to light at the right time helps keep the circadian clock on the correct time schedule.\"Make sure you open the curtains and turn on the lightsyou need to. Going for a walk is a great way to start the day.\"RoutineIt is only natural that during lockdown many of us have found that we have lost our routine and have been staying up later and lying in bed longer in the morning.Sleep Scotland said: \"Your body clock works best when you stick to a schedule.\"In an ideal world, yoursquoll go to sleep and wake up within a half hour of the same time each

times are very important for regulating your body and its s.\"Sleep PressureSleep pressure is the term used to describe the feeling of tiredness we have, due to the activity we undertake through the day.,params: .pushSleep Scotland say it is important to be active in order to make sure we create the sleep pressure and drowsiness that will help us to fall asleep.They argue that having a nap can relieve our sleep pressure, meaning we find it harder to fall asleep at bedtime.Take a tech breakNaturally during lockdown many of us have resorted to using screens to help keep us entertained,to work and to socialise with friends.And while most modern tech has a blue light filter, it does not filter all light.More importantly, the things you do online are usually things that stimulate your brain and make it harder to turn off when you get into bed.Therefore, Sleep Scotland say you should unplug from all screens at least an hour before bedtime.They added: \"In the hour before bed, ensure you

However, a report concluded that no additional evidence could be found to corroborate what the air traffic controller had spotted.In August , a member of the public in West Kilbride wrote to the Ministry of Defence to report an a \"fluorescent green UFO, saucer shaped\" that was \"harassing\" a plane near Prestwick Airport.Have you spotted a UFO  Get in touchThe A Abduction: Missing hoursTravelling along the A near Harperrig Reservoir in West Lothian on August , , Garry Wood and Colin Wright saw a two-tiered, disc-shaped object above the road.According to their testimony, Wood put his foot down on the accelerator and as they passed beneath the UFO, it appeared to emit a \"curtain of white light\". The car began shuddering and they emerged to find themselves driving on the wrong side of the road.When Wood and Wright arrived in the South Lanarkshire village of Tarbrax, where they were due to drop off a satellite TV system, they discovered that several hours were unaccounted for.

He was first alerted to something out of the ordinary by a humming noise, similar to that from high voltage power lines.Macpherson describes a sudden uneasy feeling as he turned towards the water to see the object coming towards him. He stood frozen, watching it for more than  minutes.According to his statement: \"The craft came close enough for me to see that it was definitely metallic and had several points of dfused light on its underside, inside a darker coloured rim.\"It was only as the disc flew off at high speed that Macpherson felt able to raise his camera and take two photographs. He said: \"The crafts acceleration was phenomenal ndash by the time Id wound the film on between the two shots, it was a mere dot in the sky.\"By his own admission, Macpherson had no interest in the subject of UFOs. Subsequent checks with the RAF, airports and the police, confirmed no known air traffic at the time."},{"url":null,"title":"12-natural-wonders-scotland-must-visit-lifetime","story":"Narrowing down a list of favourites was no easy task, but wersquove given it a bash, bringing together a mix of well-known spots and lesser-visited gems deserving of more column inches.If you are heading out to explore this weekend, herersquos some mesmerising and memorable locations courtesy of Mother Nature.Here are  natural wonders of Scotland:Eshaness, ShetlandYou can feel the raw power of nature pulsating from what has been described as one of the most high energy coastlines in the world.

Amanda had been diagnosed in November  and given  weeks to live.David and Trevor are raising money for Pancreatic Cancer UK after Trevor was diagnosed with an aggressive form of the condition in November last year,  months after Amanda.His diagnosis is terminal and he has received  chemotherapy sessions.Trevor was also given  weeks to live but chose to go through treatment to extend his le.He is receiving more treatment in September.This is not the first time that the pair have embarked on a tour like this and it was this previous trip that inspired them to go again.In Christmas , David received a present to go on a motorbike ride and the following February he left with Trevor to go on a -day tour around Europe.However, they were on their trip during the Beast from the East snowstorm of early , which saw them ride through snow in mainland Europe.David, who owns a couple of coffee shops in London, said: ldquoWe went through the Swiss Alps, France and Italy and people were following us through France and beeping their horns at us, so we said thatwe ever do this again that we must do it for charity.The pair then set up their own website, called the Hairless Bikers www.hairlessbikers, inspired by lsquoHairy Bikersrsquo David Myers and Si King with their own twist, as both David and Trevor are bald.The pair were planning their next trip until Amandarsquos terminal diagnosis, with David saying the news came ldquoall of a sudden.After Amandarsquos death, David spent time dealing and coming to terms with his loss and then Trevor received his diagnosis.And when the coronavirus pandemic started earlier this year, it added to an already dficult year.The pair were waiting for Trevor to finish his chemotherapy before starting the tour, with Trevor phoning David last month and askinghe wanted to go.David told the Courier before he set off: ldquoWersquove always said we will do it but now itrsquos all go.ldquoTrevor phoned me last weekend and said: lsquoLetrsquos just do it.rsquo If we donrsquot do it now then itrsquos never going to happen.ldquoWe thought about all of the news going on at the moment andanything happens or we need to come back we are just in Europe so can easily catch a plane home.Ahead of the trip, David said he was ldquovery excited, adding he was just going to focus on riding and see what happened.He added: ldquoWe wonrsquot stop laughing, wersquoll be like little kids.An initial target of pound was raised, with more than pound, raised in a few days.David saidan average of pound a day could be raised ldquothat will be brilliant.Donate at www.facebook donate  "},{"url":null,"title":"column-tory-disarray-not-reassuring","story":"It cannot be reassuring for the Scottish Tories that their leader has only been in the position since February and has now left the party in disarray.It is clear the party do not hold Scottish Parliament seats in a high regard, given that it is looking likely that the next leader will be Douglas Ross, who is not even currently an MSP.Scottish Parliament seats require a member who is willing to commit time and effort to their constituency, they are not simply a stepping stone for jumping into a leadership bid.If you compare the Toriesrsquo leadership with that of Nicola Sturgeon over the last few months, with her clear and consistent messaging throughout the Covid- crisis, it is easy to see why polls for the SNP and independence are through the roof.I know that many are looking forward to enjoying the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, which will offer discounts of up to  per cent at restaurants and cafeacutes throughout August.I welcome this help for local businesses, and I am sure that this will benefit them in their restarts following lockdown.I would like to stress, however, that guidelines should always be followed within these establishments.That means that you should be socially distancing from those who are not from your household or extended household, and you should maintain good hygiene by regularly washing your hands for  seconds, as well as not touching your face.To keep yourself safe, it is important to use businesses that are taking these measures seriously and putting safety precautions in place to protect their customers.This week I will be hosting the first meeting of the Esk River Improvement Group.I look forward to working with them to make progress towards cleaning up the Esk."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-mist-midges-memories","story":"Oh and I forgot to mention the midges, which add a particularly Highland flavour to any camping trip up north.Such was our experience last weekend after we managed to find a campsite that was open. We managed just one overnight stay in Glen Nevis.It has always been a favourite glen of mine.Its beauty challenges the majestic Glencoe, but its landscape is gentler and less rugged, and the upper reaches of the glen take you back in time, to the majesty of the ancient Caledonian forest.In the days when I was a tour guide, I always thought that mist and rain were an essential part of a trip to the Highlands.People would refer to hot and sunny weather as good weather, but Irsquod always say that in the Highlands mist and rain can be good weather too.On such days, the weather would add the veil of mystery and unpredictability that makes the landscape so intriguing.Hardly ever was the approach to Glencoe the same because of the weather it changes the landscape in ways the imagination could never predict.Swirling mists which dress the peaks, layers of low lying cloud which suddenly break to allow sparkling rays of sunshine itrsquos spine-tinglingly magical.On days of so called good weather, when the skies were a cloudless blue, I always felt there was something missing in the experience.I know all this might sound like patter from VisitScotland attempting to persuade rain drenched tourists that they are lucky to have experienced the true mystery of our country but for me it has always been true.Of course, days of endless pelting rain are no fun and can spoil a holiday, but for me, some mist and rain, in moderation, makes a Highland holiday all the more memorable.Such was our experience last weekend, with two days that seemed to be in dferent seasons.When we arrived we were lucky to be able to put up the tent just in time, before the rain got heavy.Itrsquos always an awkward moment for me putting up our tent in full view of other campers, as we struggle to remember which pole goes where and try not to look like we need assistance.It couldrsquove been easy to be despondent at the weather. Dark brooding clouds shrouded the sides of Ben Nevis, bringing rain that threatened to dampen everything but I refused to let it dampen our spirits.I recited the famous quote: ldquoIn Scotland there is no such thing as bad weather just bad clothing.We had a hearty camp stove meal and then set off for our walk in the Nevis Gorge.Itrsquos a well kent walk now, but when I was first taken many years ago before the internet it was a relatively unknown secret. I still remember the sense of awe as I heard the roar of the river below, and the sight of the distant waterfall An Steall as we emerged from the gorge.Our trick was to go on our walk when it was raining, and after teatime so we had the place almost to ourselves, well apart from the midges.Our midge repellent was gold dust, and Irsquove always found the trick in avoiding midges is to keep moving, which we did, except for once, and we momentarily paid the price.It was a walk in the childhood footsteps of my younger self, where my young children were re-pacing along the route also taken by their older siblings years ago.It was about saying ldquohere is a place important to me, part of who I am itrsquos yours now,you want it to be.Yet not saying it with words, but by making memories that I hope will last as long as mine have.The rain and mist was all part of it, and yes even the midges. As often happens, the weather began to clear as we headed back.The sun broke through and the clouds developed a sparkling yellow tint. The mountains appeared, like giants awoken and rising to their true height.Sunshine briefly warmed our faces and it seemed a gt from the gods for our endurance.The kids danced and sang the song ldquoI can see clearly now the rain has gone as they saw a rainbow.I knew the rain hadnrsquot really gone so we didnrsquot dally.We made it back to the car, tired with sore legs, but before the next dark cloud arrived.That evening we recounted our experiences in the tent, and I told stories about the Jacobites and the old Highland way of le, and the connection to the Battle of Prestonpans on our own doorstep.The kids listened, partly because we were camping and they had no screens, so no choice but Irsquod like to believe partly also because we were in a land where stories and legends are steeped in the soil and they now felt a small part of them.It lashed with rain all night. But its rage had ended by morning and the new day welcomed us with sunshine.New adventures beckoned, with other memories to impart, on what was to become our sunny day.Loch Oich, rich in family memory and where the ashes of both my parents were scattered.Then Loch Ness, a fitting end to a pilgrimage, especially for my monster daft wee boy, and his sisters who love the mystery of the story.Such was our short ldquostaycation this summer.Wersquod followed what I have always called The Road of Legends which is the title of my yet to be published novel, an abridged version of which will be serialised on this page very soon."},{"url":null,"title":"column-tourist-home-help-love-area","story":"I WAS on holiday a couple of weeks ago and on one of the days I went to the local amenity

morning cycle.As I came out from Musselburgh Lagoons towards the mouth of the Esk, I saw the magnicent sight of all the seabirds, the swans and the geese gathered at that point where river meets sea.It occurred to me then that my best holiday this year could be to live in my own place as though I were a tourist.In my own hometown, I can still be awed by unexpected beauty, delighted by the

There is a massive shortage of long-term spaces for these kinds of people.ldquoI can see why they want to put these measures [on the east end of High Street] in place but we need more long-term parking.David said he had visited two nearby car parks that had recently been made short term on two separate occasions and they were each one third empty.And he thought much of the opposition to the Elcho Green plan was due to misinformation about what it would consist of.David said that the new parking measures on High Street had not negatively affected his business and that there was enough short-term parking for his customers.Those at gt shop Time  Tide, however, say they have not been as busy since the measures were introduced.Staff member Lorraine, who has always lived in North Berwick, said: ldquoNorth Berwick is a seaside town and is not built for this kind of traffic.ldquoA lot of people live in flats and holiday homes nearby and they used those [long-term] car parks. These have now turned into short-term parking ndash where are these people to park now Lorraine said that restricting parking on the east end of High Street affected customers who wished to purchase heavy items such as furniture, as they would be unable to carry them to a car parked further away.She added: ldquoWersquove had to do something like a lsquosmash and grabrsquo, where we watch for the person coming and quickly put the item into their car.ldquoSome people think the area is pedestrianised and are walking on the road, whereas before the cars parked on the side of the road made people realise and they were walking on the pavement.Beverly Gilhooley, owner of pet shop Barker and Bone, said business was slightly quieter than usual but the restrictions made things ldquoa little safer, adding that she thought the short-term parking should be a permanent feature in summer.She said the restrictions suited the town during the summer, when tourism was high, but not during winter.She added that the restrictions had affected deliveries to her business, which were harder to carry out, and customers who wished to purchase heavy items.Beverly said: ldquoItrsquos a brilliant idea in summer but I hope itrsquos a more temporary thing every summer.We can keep this up for a couple of months but not for any longer.The North Berwick resident said her business could afford ldquoa little hit butthe parking restrictions continued through the winter her business would not survive.Judy Lockhart, chair of North Berwick Community Council, said the group wanted to know more about the councilrsquos future plans.She said on Monday: ldquoThe community council emailed East Lothian Council on July . . . and requested a meeting to discuss Elcho Green and have since followed our request up.

Reduce light from the hall. Make sure there are no electronics sending out light e.g. a digital alarm clock with a lit display, sleep buttons on equipment etc.\"You may want to put black curtains at the window or wear an eye mask to limit the light getting into the eye.\"Sleep Scotland suggests wearing an eye maskOn the other end, you should also get lots of light in the morning to help you feel awake and alert.They added: \"Exposure to light at the right time helps keep the circadian clock on the correct time schedule.\"Make sure you open the curtains and turn on the lightsyou need to. Going for a walk is a great way to start the day.\"RoutineIt is only natural that during lockdown many of us have found that we have lost our routine and have been staying up later and lying in bed longer in the morning.Sleep Scotland said: \"Your body clock works best when you stick to a schedule.\"In an ideal world, yoursquoll go to sleep and wake up within a half hour of the same time each day, even on weekends.\"The routines of the day also give us powerful signals and demands that the body remain alert for certain tasks and events.\"Regular waking and bed times, alongside regular meal times are very important for regulating your body and its s.\"Sleep PressureSleep pressure is the term used to describe the feeling of tiredness we have, due to the activity we undertake through the day.Sleep Scotland say it is important to be active in order to make sure we create the sleep pressure and drowsiness that will help us to fall asleep.They argue that having a nap can relieve our sleep pressure, meaning we find it harder to fall asleep at bedtime.Take a tech breakNaturally during lockdown many of us have resorted to using screens to help keep us entertained,to work and to socialise with friends.And while most modern tech has a blue light filter, it does not filter all light.More importantly, the things you do online are usually things that stimulate your brain and make it harder to turn off when you get into bed.Therefore, Sleep Scotland say you should unplug from all screens at least an hour before bedtime.They added: \"In the hour before bed, ensure you focus on doing things that are calming.\"Now is the time to read, draw, do some calming exercises, have a warm bath

Theyre the one point of contact between the vehicle and the road, meaning any issue with them could prove disastrous. Its why its so important to check them. Look at the sidewalls for any cuts or damage which could lead to a puncture, and scope out the general condition of the rubber. If its cracked and dry, it might be time for a change.And, of course, look at the tread depth. The legal limit in the UK and Ireland is .mm, and one of the easiest ways to tellyour tyres are within this is with a p coin. Simply insert the coin into the tread groovesthe outer band of the coin is obscured by tyre, then youre within the limit. If you can see the band, the tyres need replacing.Wed check the tyre pressures too. Most garages have air compressors to top up air . Check the required pressure for your tyres by consulting your cars handbook or on the instruction  inside the fuel filler cap. Adjust your pressures accordingly and not only will your tyres perform more effectively, but itll save you money in fuel, too.OilOil is crucial to the smooth running and operation of your cars engine. Without it, youre in for a whole heap of trouble. Its why ensuring your cars oil levels are correct is so important, as without a proper amount, theres the potential for a lot of damage to take place. Yet despite being so crucial, its simple to check. Simply wait for the engine to coolits been running, and find the dipstick within the engine bay. Its often highlighted with a yellow handle, butyoure struggling to find it, consult the cars handbook.Then, once found, pull out the dipstick and clean it with a rag or paper towel. Re-insert it into the engine and take it out once more now, youll be able to see the level of oil in the engine via the dipsticks markers.If its too low, add more oil. Only do a bit at a time, and repeat the dipstick process each time - you dont want to overfill it.Windscreen washer fluidParticularly during the summer months when theres more dust and insects on the road, making sure youve got enough windscreen washer fluid is important. Much like oil, its dangerous to run out of, but easy to check. Again, look under the bonnet, this time for a blue cap. If the levels are low, simply top up with the correct washer fluid. Avoid using just water.CoolantCoolant is integral to keeping your cars engine at the correct temperature. During summer this is very important, but its just as key during colder months too. Though its unlikely that your coolant levels will have dropped, its always worthwhile checking the tank - again, this is typically found under the bonnet. Only ever use the manufacturers recommended coolant to top up the systemits low.FuelIt might sound simple, but ensuring that youve got plenty of fuel in the tank in readiness for a long journey can easily slip peoples minds. In fact, plenty of drivers undertake a trip and forget to fill up, resulting in a fair amount of stress during travel.Before you set off, check your fuel gauge and ensure youve got enough to get you to your destination. If not, its worth filling up closer to home, where you know the location of filling stations. Leaving it until later could result in the stressful situation of having to find a fuel station in an unfamiliar area.LightsLights can be an aspect of a car which are easily forgotten during the lighter months when the days are longer and the nights shorter. However,youre making a longer trip, theres a good chance that youll be driving in darkness as you near your destination, which makes fully working lights crucial.Check that your headlights and indicators are working up front, and test the rear lights and brake lights too.

Exams having been cancelled, thanks to the pandemic, Scottish school teachers were given the delicate task of imagining what their charges might have achieved had the tests taken place. Teachers in some of the most deprived areas gave what could only be called optimistic estimates of their students likely attainment in the Highers ndash about % higher than in previous years.The Scottish Qualications Authority, SQA, which is supposed to ensure fair play in assessment, took one look at this unprecedented grade inflation and said: Youre not on. Schools were estimating examination success wildly out of step with their own recent performance.:Iain Macwhirter: Heres how a New Union could keep us living apart togetherSo the SQA moderators took an axe to the results to make them look a bit more credible. The results in the poorer postcodes went down by %, which still left grades inflated over previous years. In the more affluent schools, where estimated grades were around % above par, they adjusted scores by %.Thats an oversimplication, but in a sense it doesnt matter. What it looked like was the SQA brutally crushing the hopes and dreams of poor students while only marginally reducing the scores of pupils in the posher colleges.Assessment by algorithm is always going to be a poor fit with reality. So, Shaun did well in his prelims, but he might have coasted the rest of the year whereas Siobhan got such a shock that she worked her derriere off for the next six months. Why are they both being cut down I mean, arent teachers themselves the best judge of performance  Why didnt the SQA just suck it up, accept that this was an exceptional year and that Covid  engendered a study revolution in less advantaged neighbourhoods.:Iain Macwhirter: Sturgeon should bring Salmond in from the cold ndash hersquos just too dangerousThats what the educational experts on Twitter argued, including the outspoken educational pundit, James McEnany. They complained that most of the , pupils who had their futures stolen were from working class neighbourhoods and that this confirmed education is biased to the rich.The consultant, Sir Keir Bloomer, who helped devise the Curriculum for Excellence, disagreed insisting that the adjustment process was ldquojustied and necessary. And the First Minister agreed. She said bluntly that the estimates submitted by teachers were simply ldquonot credible. Accepting grade inflation on that scale would bring the entire standardised assessment into disrepute.This was Nicola Sturgeon trying to be wise before the event. Sure, the estimates were doing wonders for the attainment gap. She couldve gone into the May Holyrood elections saying that she had delivered the greatest narrowing of the educational class gap in history. But the First Minister is much too canny.Students who narrowly failed last year would be furious for a start. The very people now berating her for crushing the hopes and dreams of the less well off would be attacking her for undermining the credibility of Scottish education. Ms Sturgeon would have been accused of closing the attainment gap by fraud.The More or Less programme on BBC Radio would be calling it the most shocking misuse of statistics since the UK government claimed that it was conducting , Covid  tests a day, when all it was doing was sending out kits.But the ldquoclassist accusations wont go away. A hundred or so young people gathered in George Square holding banners saying ldquoTrust our Teachers and ldquoI am not my postcode. Sturgeon is being called the ldquograde snatcher, echoing the claim that Mrs Thatcher was the ldquomilk snatcher.Part of the problem is that the SQA seems incapable of giving a coherent and convincing explanation of its methodology. Tens of thousands of appeals are expected against what parents regard as an arbitrary and unfair process that took no account of real pupil attainment.The Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, is in for a torrid time. Indeed, he has been having a torrid time for as long as I can remember. There has been persistent grumbling about the Curriculum for Excellence which seems anything but. The PISA international performance scores have gone south. Standardised testing of primary one children led to accusations of child abuse. Progress on the attainment gap has been glacially slow.Mr Swinney held out against the teachers % pay demand just long enough for teachers to threaten a strike, at which point he gave in and awarded them an eye-popping .% over three years. Nice work.Last month, parents across Scotland revolted at pandemic plans to give children as little as one day a week of ldquoblended learning. That forced an embarrassing U-turn as Mr Swinney promised full-time, full-fat education from this month onwards.:Iain Macwhirter: Does Nicola Sturgeon still want independence  Some in the SNP arent so sureBut the Educational Institute for Scotland says that only a fth of their members are confident itrsquos safe to reopen the schools. Its still not clear what is going to happen this week. Will teachers turn up  Will parents send their children We appear to be seeing,not the second wave of Covid, then the long tail of the first wave. Lockdown is in the air again. Its conceivable that children couldto school just long enough to exchange infections before being sent home again.Its not Mr Swinneys fault of course. This is a pandemic after all. Teachers unions have the Scottish Government over a barrel ndash and they know it. Parents are incensed as only parents can be when they feel their offspring are being treated unfairly.But it might be time to put poor John Swinney out of his misery. The Deputy First Minister has been a sterling defender of the First Minister, the ultimate safe pair of hands. But those hands arent looking so safe any more. He is beginning to look like a work horse that has taken more beating than it can stand.A fresh face,such a thing exists in the  year old Scottish Government, in charge of the education brief might help get the government over this hurdle. In the last SQA exams crisis in  the then Labour education minister, Sam Galbraith, had to step down after being mauled by, er, one Nicola Sturgeon.The SNP is streets ahead in the polls and that is unlikely to change any time soon, given the dire state of the opposition parties in Scotland. But there are a lot more parents in Scotland than there are teachers. It would only take a few thousand parental votes to go astray in May to deprive Nicola Sturgeon of that absolute majority she needs for an independence referendum.This is a full scale crisis, possibly Nicola Sturgeons worst yet. Young people are up in arms. The teaching profession is in a state of perennial discontent. The very credibility of standardised assessment may be in doubt. She will have to get a grip or face an unmoderated ldquofail in May.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions. They do not necessarily represent the views of The Herald."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-surely-now-bring-end-school-examination-certification-process","story":"Reactions to the debacle demonstrate the gulf between those who design and administer the system and those who \"experience\" it. Parents, students and teachers highlight the failure of the system to recognise the hard work of learners, their application and commitment to task, together with their personal and academic problem-solving abilities ndash all skills and qualities that modern employers tell us they value most. On the other hand, politicians and examination body spokespersons emphasise their statistical processes and historical comparisons.A quarter of candidates this year have been told: Sorry, but you are not as good as youthink you are. We the \"system\" know better ndash because we have a model wersquove used before. These are the same young people ndash and their parents ndash that,Scotland is to compete successfully in the st century world, we need to convince of the value of a lelong commitment to education and training. How exactly does this contribute to reducing the attainment gap and promoting a \"can do\" culture This debacle was not an accident, the consequence of an aberrant computer glitch or systems personnel mals. The process of assessment and grading worked this year exactly as intended and designed by the examination body and politicians. Every year candidate results are manipulated, by the same process, to fit the demands of the normal curve of distribution ndash a statistical process increasingly regarded as spurious, as a mechanism for producing valid assessments of anything but the simplest of human capabilities.For those prepared to look critically at the evidence there is an irrefutable case for the abolition of current models of assessment and certication in Scotland.Students were demonstrating in Saturday in George Square and Dalkeith to protest about their treatment. They have been failed by the system. They deserve our strongest possible support.Jim Rand, Blanefield.WHATEVER the rights and wrongs of the recent SQA marking furore and the consequences that may fall from it, I think that a degree of naivety and or benign ignorance may be present in the approach and beliefs of some of those seemingly disadvantaged by apparently poorer exam results than expected.Put simply, and using mathematics as an example of a subject discipline whose \"answers\" in a test must surely be as objectively \"correct\" as is possible, it is not the case that a persons test score of, say,  per cent on the day will be the mark grade that ends up as that persons final mark grade. For a iety of reasons, that \"raw\" score is then subject to an equal iety of \"adjustments\" based on all sorts of indicators.The Bell Curve, for example, the rationale of which argues that human intelligence is substantially influenced by both inherited and environmental factors and that, ipso facto, is therefore a better predictor of many outcomes, is a common type of distribution for a iable on which the highest point represents the most probable event in a series of data while all other possible occurrences are systematically distributed around the mean. This has the consequence of forcing groups of people to be categorised as poor, average, good. Also, for smaller groups, having to categorise a set number of iniduals in each category to \"fit\" a Bell curve will do a disservice to those iniduals.Of course, none of the above in any way, diminishes the sense of anger and frustration felt by those most affected. There are many people, too, who hold that such social engineering, for whatever reason, is simply not on. However, the point is that these types of assessments  re-adjustments, and many more, are taken into account when final grades are being awarded.Consequently, those who believe, like the head of Clton Hall school in Edinburgh, that the professional standards of teaching staff are being called into question are aiming at the wrong target. Its not the teacher marking thats in any way imperfect rather its the myriad statistical contortions gone through by those who have rarely seen the inside of a classroom or struggled face-to-face with the learning dficulties of many of our youngsters that are the issue.Finally, as an anecdotal pointer to the iniable cries of marking inconsistencies that arise every year, as a teacher and SQA marker of many years, manys the time when I and other colleagues have smiled wryly at the idea of appealing for some students grades to be downgraded, such is our surprise when they \"over-achieve\". But we dont. Nor have I ever come across a student who, having done better than expected, has appealed their grade.But then, as Mark Twain reportedly said: \"Ive never let my schooling get in the way of my education.\"Gerard McCulloch, Saltcoats."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-mark-smith-leaked-snp-email-shows-nicola-sturgeon-well","story":"Mr Smithrsquos email was actually about a pretty dull subject on the whole: the make-up of the partyrsquos executive committee, but in talking about it, he tackled one of the issues that goes to the heart of Scottish nationalism: the primacy of independence. Nationalists usually argue that Scotland would be better off economically and socially because of independence, but it actually doesnrsquot matter because independence is their top priority. Their thinking is: the economy and equality are important, but not as important as independence.This is the way, to be honest, that a lot of nationalists think, but they usually keep quiet about it because they know left-leaning voters would not be impressed. Lots of voters actually put equality as their top priority rather than the constitution and some of them voted Yes in  because they thought independence would improve equality and some voted No because they worried it would make inequality worse ndash I talked to lots of voters who think along these lines when I was on the ground with the Yes campaign in . Theyrsquore the opposite of nationalists: equality comes first, not independence. For nationalists, itrsquos the other way round.It is this kind of context that makes Mr Smithrsquos email so interesting, and embarrassing. What he said was that changes were needed to the SNPrsquos national executive committee because so much of the partys oxygen was taken up, in his words, by peripheral issues like reform of the law on gender. The BAME, womenrsquos and disabled conveners and others should lose their places on the NEC, he said, and become part of a separate forum instead. ldquoEqualities are close to my heart, said Mr Smith, ldquobut not as close as independence.:Nicola Sturgeon admits party disputes pose risk to SNP successIt is that last phrase thatrsquos the killer and itrsquos a bit unpleasant to see it written down in such stark terms ndash unpleasant but not surprising. In , Nicola Sturgeon wrote a piece for The Sunday Herald in which she said the case for self-government transcended the issues of Brexit, of oil, of national wealth and balance sheets, and of passing political fads and trends. The comment may have been less nakedly honest than Mr Smithrsquos, but it amounts to the same thing: independence matters more than everything , even ndash and this is the extraordinary bit ndash national wealth.But letrsquos not over-egg the comparison between Ms Sturgeon and Mr Smith because therersquos a big dference between them and it demonstrates why the First Minister is doing so well during the pandemic. Scottish independence transcends every other issue for her ndash she said so in The Sunday Herald ndash but as First Minister she also knows that the public health problem has to be the priority. In times of crisis, she said at the start of all this, the issues that ide us seem less important.This approach by the First Minister has not gone down well with some supporters of independence ndash the ones that take the ldquoIndependence First principle literally, or want new pro-Yes parties, or are aching for theof Alex Salmond, like Aslan from Over-The-Sea. We also shouldnrsquot be too lenient on the First Minister ndash pupils and parents caught up in the SQA debacle, for example, might disagree that she has put independence to one side to concentrate on domestic matters.However, for another constituency of voters, Ms Sturgeonrsquos approach is playing very effectively and probably explains why her party, and its cause, is doing well in the polls. Scotlandrsquos first SNP government, from , knew it was more important to look responsible than pick fights with London and it was relaxed about passing motions which allowed Westminster to enact laws on which there was common ground and it played well with voters. The same is happening now: Ms Sturgeon knows itrsquos important to look responsible in a time of crisis and itrsquos playing well with voters.The fact that the First Minister has handled the crisis in this way reflects well on her the way in which shersquos getting it right is also demonstrated by the way in which Alyn Smith got it wrong in his email. Mr Smith said equality was close to his heart but not as close as independence whereas the First Minister has backed off on the pronouncements about independence because she knows it would sound wrong during the coronavirus crisis.All of this has led the First Minister to a pretty clear interpretation of whatrsquos been happening for her party, as well as a strategy for the future. ldquoRight now, she says, ldquothe majority of the people in the country we serve are worried about their health and theyre worried about their ability to pay their bills. Opinion polls would suggest they massively trust the SNP to lead them through that crisis. If they ever thought the SNP was turning away from that priority and focusing on its own agendas and engaging in in-fighting Im sure they would pass a verdict on that.\":Lord McConnell in stark SQA warning to Nicola Sturgeon and John SwinneyI think itrsquos hard to disagree with that analysis, but it creates two problems for Ms Sturgeon. First, there are many in her party who disagree with her and think the focus should always be on the agenda of independence first and the disquiet is likely to get louder the longer the First Minister ldquofocuses on what matters to people rather than independence.However, the second problem is potentially more serious. The dissenters in her party ndash troublesome as they are ndash will ultimately, always, support independence, whereas the voters impressed by the First Ministerrsquos handling of coronavirus may be more fickle. At the height of a crisis, theyrsquove liked the First Ministerrsquos tactics and style, but as coronavirus drops down the agenda and independence s to the top of it, they may not be quite so happy. The First Minister and leader of the campaign for independence has been guided by her head rather than her heart.

Meanwhile, the Trussell Trust reported an unprecedented  per cent rise in food parcels given to children in April .The UK Government has announced its intention to launch a new anti-obesity drive, while the first independent review of UK food policy in almost  years has just published its initial recommendations for a National Food Strategy for England. But there are some measures ndash like serving healthy food in our schools ndash that we already know work.Nearly , children attend Scotlandrsquos schools. For some of them, the school lunch is the only hot meal they will receive all day. Only % of packed lunches meet the nutritional standards that apply to school food, but a meal thatrsquos freshly prepared from unprocessed ingredients, low in additives, sugars, fats, and salt, and high in seasonal fruit and vegetables ndash like the majority of meals on a Food For Le Served Here menu ndash is an opportunity to make a real impact in fostering good health. Right now, itrsquos not one we can afford to miss.But school lunches arenrsquot just calories on a plate. Investing in sourcing and serving fresh, local, and sustainable food has knock on benefits for jobs and the environment. Prioritising meals that are made from scratch in the kitchen protects the jobs of the unsung heroes of childrenrsquos nutrition: the skilled frontline catering staff working in our schools.Whatrsquos more,councils take the opportunity to source produce from local food suppliers, school meals can play a role in supporting the local economy too. In an average year, Scotlandrsquos public sector spends almost pound million on food and drink. Now more than ever, that public money should be spent in a way that supports local food businesses.Many local authorities ndash such as the  Scottish councils that hold our Food For Le Served Here award for their school meals ndash are already making great strides in supporting local businesses. Like everyone , their service was badly disrupted by lockdown. But those who have prioritised sourcing local produce for their meals and food boxes are clear about the benefits it brings.Argyll and Bute Council included locally made bread rolls in their food boxes, which meant the bakery was able to bring a worker back from furlough. And the delighted messages and phone calls that the council received when it included Scottish strawberries and cream in the boxes showed how highly people valued fresh, local produce.Jayne Jones, commercial manager at Argyll and Bute Council and chairwoman of ASSIST FM, recently told a meeting of Scotlandrsquos local authority Food For Le Served Here award holders that the council is committed to its ldquogood food first approach as the schools go back. The operational challenges canrsquot be underestimated, but the effort that has gone into making lunchtime safe is more than worth it.A poll showed three-quarters of people living in Scotland want to see measures that prioritise a green recovery from the pandemic. We need to build on this appetite for change. In putting good food on the table in our schools, the public sector has the power and skills not only to protect childrenrsquos health, but to help Scotland to build back better from this crisis.Sarah Duley is Head of Food at Soil Association Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-potato-day-leads-love-allotment-life","story":"And here we are at the eighth annual potato day in Glasgow, perusing the spuds, checking out the ieties on offer. My ego draws me each year to the Catriona iety. We are a strong grower with high yield, blue and oval with a light yellow flesh and excellent flavour.There are no Catrionas this year and I am popped. It is February and, unruffled about the news of some virus from somewhere , we merrily eye the seed potatoes, pick up some shallots and some onion ieties for the allotment. At the seed swap table packets are switched with some excitement. Its not my allotment, its the allotment of the potatoes-are-treasure pal, but I love potato day because I love time in the company of people who have passion for not obviously passionate things.There is a tatty bash - a competition to chit and grow a potato in a bucket. The heaviest yield wins. I love to win so pay my donation and take my bucket.At home I pop my new friend in an egg box and stick her in a corner of the kitchen. Then work becomes very busy because suddenly everyone is very ruffled about a virus from somewhere  that is now here.By late March we are locked down and I am looking for things to do at home that arent Netflix or housework.I remember the, by now, lumpen alien thing in the corner of the kitchen. Green little sprouts have formed from the smooth surface of the misshapen brown egg and I decide to plant her in the bucket and see what comes next.Having lived my le in flats, my grandmothers garden was really the only chance I had to see how things were grown and tended. She had a rhubarb patch in the back garden and rose bushes in the front. There was always mint growing and she took great pride in the lilac trees that lined the back fence.I regularly drive past my grans house and was livid recently to see that the new owners have chopped down the lilacs, decades of care thoughtlessly felled.In my flat, now, I have three pot plants but a potato was uncharted territory. Very rapidly a pointy green nose began to poke from the top of the soil. My morning routine now revolved around a peek into the bucket to see what was happening next. A morning cuppa became a pot so there was enough to share with Tater.And yes, I know the tea thing is an old wives tale but those of us living alone in lockdown must take our comforts where we can.The speed at which Tater shot forth from the soil was quite something, I could almost see her growing.Unassuming, an under appreciated staple, the potato alleviated famine in Europe, changed the course of modern agriculture and is credited for the rise of the west. Impressed by their blossoms, Marie Antoinette is said to have worn them in her hair while Louis XVI threaded them through his buttonhole.I have eaten potatoes in the Andes mountains in Peru, where the tuber originated. I have driven over the Hoover Dam in an Idaho plate vehicle displaying the state motto: Famous Potatoes. I have eaten a potato cooked in a h#ng# in New Zealand.Yet here in a bucket in my living room is my favourite spud so far.Im worried Tater isnt getting enough sunlight but Im also afraid someone might interfereI leave her outside unattended. With heart heavy at the loss of our shared morning cuppa, I take the bucket and the fast growing contents to the allotment where the fresh air and sunshine sends her star-shaped leaves shooting into a constellation of dense green.Of course, being regularly at the allotment, it would be rude not to make myself useful. Suddenly Im weeding, planting runner beans and onions, tucking zucchini plants into compost.I am itching each day to get to the plot to see how my garlic cloves are growing and check on Tater. Truly you never know where le will lead you.Its amazing to me that no one has invented see through soil. This is torture, knowing all the good stuff is happening underground and we cant see it. Whats in the bucket  How many tubers are down there This must be what pregnancy is like: some outward signs of new le flourishing but all the best bits happening out of sight.Finally Taters leaves are turning yellow and her stalks spilling over the edge of the bucket. It is her time.\"Its like digging for buried treasure,\" I say as I wriggle the soil around. Well. My careful ministrations have resulted in... are you ready...  potatoes.I send a photograph to my friend. \"Very impressive,\" he replies, \"Not award winning but very good.\" Not award winning  I have an absorbing new hobby and its edible.

It is deeply regrettable that we got this wrong. I am sorry for that.ldquoWe have listened to young people and I hope that all will now feel satisfied that they have achieved the grades which their teachers and lecturers judged that they deserved.\"I assure Parliament that we will look to learn lessons from the process of awarding qualications this year that will help to inform any future actions.\"Explaining how he intended to resolve the crisis, he said:\"I can confirm to Parliament today that all downgraded awards will be withdrawn.\"Using powers available to me in the EducationAct , I am today directing the SQA to re-issue those awards based solely on teacher or lecturer judgement.\"Schools will be able to confirm the estimates they provided for pupils to those that are ing to school this week and next.\"The SQA will issue fresh certicates to affected candidates as soon as possible and, importantly, will inform UCAS and other admission bodies of the new grades as soon as practical in the coming days to allow for applications to college and university to be progressed.\"In those cases where moderation led to an increased grade, learners will not lose that award.\"Many of those young people will already have moved on to secure college or university places on the strength of the awards made to them. To unpick them now would not in any way be fair.\"Finally, due to the unique circumstances of this situation, we will this year make provision for enough places in universities and colleges to ensure that no one is crowded out of a place they would otherwise have been awarded.\"Pupils, who had been encouraged to appeal their downgrades, will get their new results automatically, although appeals will still be possibledesired.Nicola Sturgeon yesterday apologised for the fiasco, which stemmed from exams being replaced by estimates because of the coronavirus lockdown, saying: ldquoWe did not get this right and Irsquom sorry for that.Ahead of Mr Swinneyrsquos statement, the First Minister said this yearrsquos grades - and the context- should be regarded as ldquotruly unique by employers and others.She admitted the credibility issueldquodoesnrsquot just go away, but said it was eclipsed by the impact of the downgrades on young people.She said: ldquoThat concern that I articulated last week has, I suppose, been outweighed in my mind in the days that passed since by this sense... of having some young people, particularly from working class backgrounds, thinking that the system is stacked against them no matter how hard they work at school.ldquoThat for me is a bigger issue now, and I donrsquot want that to be the case.ldquoSecondly, maybe we just need to see  being more unique and just accept that it is unique.ldquoHopefully by the exam diet next year wersquoll be out of this and this year will be truly unique.ldquoIf it is the case that some young peoplersquos teacher estimates are above what statistically they would have been predicted to get in an exam, not inidually, but statistically, then when you weight that against the not enormous disadvantage that young people have been served up as a result of Covid, then maybe wersquore just balancing that out a little bit.The Government changes mirror the demands of the Scottish Greens, whose support was critical to Mr Swinney avoiding a successful no confidence vote.The Greens had demanded the restoration of all teacher estimates which had been downgraded and the small number of upgrades left alone an independent review to confirm exactly what happened despite four months of warnings that the SQA was going down the wrong route and a wider review into how Scotlandrsquo assesses pupil attainment.After the coronavirus lockdown led to exams being cancelled for the first time in more than a century, teachers estimated pupil results and submitted them to the SQA.With the estimates far out of kilter with past years, the SQA used a mathematical modelling exercise called lsquomoderationrsquo to adjust grades to what it considered more realistic levels.This process included looking at past yearrsquos data, including inidual school data, and led to almost a quarter of all results being changed, almost all of them downgrades.Last year, the national attainment rates at A to C for National , Higher and Advanced Higher were . per cent, .% and .% respectively.Raw teacher estimates saw these jump to .%, .% and .% respectively.After moderation, these were cut back to .%, .% and .% respectively.Because the overestimation was greatest in schools in deprived areas, the downgrades were also greatest inthose schools, leading to claims poor pupils were being treated especially harshly and marked down because of their schoolrsquos track record, not their own efforts.Last year, the A to C attainment rate in the most deprived areas for National  was .%, the teacher estimate was up . points to .% and after moderation this was cut to %.For Highers, the deprived area A to C rate was .% in , the teacher estimate this year was up . points to .%, and after moderation it was cut to .%.For Advanced Higher, the  pass rate in deprived areas was .%, the teacher estimate was up . points to .%, and after moderation it was cut to .%.In the most affluent areas, the changes were less dramatic: the National  attainment rates in , teacher estimates and moderated results were .%, .% and .%.For Highers, the respective figures were .%, .% and .% for Advanced Highers they were .%, .% and .%.The SQA had previously reassured MSPs about the quality of its model, and that moderation would not result in large numbers of grades being changed.Mr Swinney took a dferent note, saying the SQA had developed its model \"in a very short space in time\" and \"in the absence\" of someinformation, and that it had and involved a very broad moderation of estimates.However he said the SQA had followed his instructions in \"good faith\", and he had no criticism of their actions.He said: \"As a result of the SQA moderation process, , teacher estimates were adjusted, with just under , candidates having one or more of their grades lowered when compared to the teacher estimate.\"Despite the headline improvements in the pass rate at National , Higher and Advanced Higher, despite the fact that the pass rate amongst pupils in the most deprived areas increased at a sharper rate than those in the least deprived communities, and despite the fact there was progress in closing the attainment gap, the results left many young people feeling that their future had been determined by statistical modelling rather than their own capability and capacity.\"That has left a feeling of unfairness in the minds of young people.\"I hope that our pupils now move forward confidently to their next step in education, employment or training with the qualications that teachers or lecturers have judged were deserved.\"Covidhas placed, at times, unbearable pressures on us all and I wish our learners well in building on the achievements they have justiably been awarded in these most dficult of days.\"Green MSP Ross Greer said: \"ldquoI warned for four months that this would happen, and that it would be unacceptable.\"Unfortunately, the Education Secretary and SQA refused to listen then, but I am glad that they are listening now.ldquoThe Scottish Government has agreed to implement the solutions demanded by the Greens, starting with the restoration of , grades which were lowered by the SQArsquos discriminatory lsquomoderationrsquo system.\"In this extraordinary year pupilsrsquo grades should always have been based on the professional judgement of those who know them best, their teachers.ldquoWith UCAS and other admissions bodies being informed of these changes imminently, young people whose hopes of moving on to university and college were shattered last week will now be able to move forward with the places they worked so hard to secure for themselves.ldquoThe Priestly review also announced today is of vital importance. The unacceptable situation that arose this year can never be allowed to happen again. Listening to pupils and teachers is essential in ensuring that. Of course,they had been listened to in the first place, as we had called for, much of this fiasco could have been avoided.ldquoThe Scottish Greens have long made the case that high stakes exams at the end of the school year are a poor way of judging a young personrsquos attainment and may be a particularly bad way of judging pupils from the most disadvantaged communities. We look forward to the results of the OECD review and the opportunity to replace Scotlandrsquos outdated assessment system with one fit for the st century.ldquoScottish Greens were clear throughout this process that our priority was securing a solution for the tens of thousands of pupils, teachers and parents affected. We are glad to have achieved that today.Tory MSP Jamie Greene said Mr Swinneyrsquos -page statement had been the longest resignation document in history minus a resignation.He said there had been a lack of transparency, teachers had been ignored, endless denials, and the reputation of a system put ahead of inidual pupils.Labour MSP Iain Gray said it was a ldquohumiliating climbdown but a ldquovery welcome one.He said it was a ldquovictory for fairness, commonsense and above all those young people who refuse to take this injustice lying down.He also asked Mr Swinney how he had managed to get things so wrong, ignoring warnings and defending the results for a week in which young people had been ldquotwisting in the wind.He said the Education Secretary should take proper responsibility and resign.Mr Swinney said he had taken responsibility for his actions by fixing the problem.He also said moderation was used in ldquocountless other jurisdictions around the world, including where in the UK, a remark that was jeered by opposition MSPs.Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie accused Mr Swinney of undermining the education system, and of being ldquopart of the problem not the solution.Mr Swinney said he had tried to ensure young people in an extreme situation got qualications despite beng unable to sit exams, a previously inconceivable situation.He said

Pamela Walker, NHSO ambulatory care manager has explained that services are gradually being remobilised, with the situation ing to normal, but there are limitations on the number of patients who could be operated on every day due to the additional COVID- restrictions. “We can now do four general anaesthetics every day ,# she said. #However, patients needing local anaesthetics are being fitted in around the general anaesthetics and this is reducing the number of those still waiting for a procedure increasing the number of procedures being safely undertaken.”The theatre Day Unit teams are also limited to doing surgeries linked to one discipline a day as space in the Day Unit is reduced from ten to six trolleys. This is because some of the space normally used for theatre Day Unit has been given over to the COVID ventilation unit which, is to remain in place for the foreseeable future.“But we are working through the lists and we are confident that all those waiting will be attended to,” Ms Walker added. “While some people might feel we have forgotten about them, this is not the case. The impact of COVID means there have been long delays.”Senior charge nurse, Diane Gray, said those coming for a general anaesthetic had to have a COVID test  days before their surgery, then shield with everyone in their household for  days, then have another COVID test the day before their operation.“We understand that not everyone wants to or can do this,# she said.#If a patient is waiting for elective surgery but they don’t want to shield for two weeks, they can let us know and we will contact them again when the guidance changes. It is important for them to know that they will not be prejudiced or moved to the bottom of the list.Both Ms Walker and Ms Gray said that the decision to have an elective procedure during this time rested with the patient. They understand that this is a very dficult time, that the situation is continually changing and that not everyone wants to come into a hospital environment.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

These estimates, based on their work during the school year, were then submitted to a Scottish Qualications Authoritymoderation system which downgraded the results — on criteria including the historic performance of the school.This sparked a huge backlash from students and politicians.Orkney Islands Council’s executive director of education, leisure and housing James Wylie said he was “delighted” by Tuesday’s announcement, made by an under-fire education secretary John Swinney.He said: “The signicant and detailed work carried out by teaching staff and school managers was to an incredibly high standard, and I had every confidence in the approach and final outcome presented to the SQA.”The u-turn now means that teacher estimates will be reinstated, and there will be no need for any appeals process.In Orkney, the downgrading of awards totalled .The total number of exam entries at Kirkwall Grammar School was , across National s, Highers and Advance Highers. Out of those,  were downgraded by the SQA.At Stromness Academy, there was a total of  entries, and a reduction of  across National s, Highers and Advanced Highers. In total, around  estimates were raised by the SQA at both schools.With the small numbers at Junior High Schools, there were very few changes made by the SQA up or down on teacher estimates.Mr Swinney, who is now fighting to save his political career, has already conceded that they got it wrong, and said an independent review would take place to look at where lessons can be learned.The SQA will now reissue grades, based solely on teacher judgement. UCAS and other admission bodies will be informed of the new grades as soon as practical to allow for applications to college and university to be progressed.The headteachers of Stromness Academy and Kirkwall Grammar School, Jane Partridge and Don Hawkins both said they had full confidence in their teachers’ judgements to produce “well-considered” estimates.Mr Hawkins added: “The staff have gone above and beyond to ensure a considered and moderated set of results.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The council is also looking at ways to fill gaps in childcare provision for children under two and after school care for older children.The move is in tandem with schools and marks a signicant milestone in the Government’s “route map” out of lockdown as Scotland continues to make good progress in suppressing COVID-.OIC executive director of education, leisure and housing James Wylie said the focus is very much “getting it right for every child” in ing to these services after a challenging period of many months.“The decision to close Early Learning and Childcaresettings has had an impact on the lives of children and families throughout Orkney,# Mr Wylie explained.#There was little time to prepare, or scope to explain, the changes to our youngest children. Their relationships and friendships were abruptly interrupted as well as their learning.“Our focus must be on supporting children when they are in settings, to form a secure and emotionally resilient attachment base which will stand them in good stead as they grow and develop.  Nurturing and attached relationships are essential to creating the conditions for children to flourish in early learning and childcare.“All children have a right to play, to learn and to access experiences that meet their physical, social, emotional and cultural needs, and they have a right to associate with their peers. The health and wellbeing of children and adults is vital and these important rights and considerations have all been factored into the development of a framework for reopening and delivering ELC services.“We now know that young children are less likely to be affected by or transmit the virus. This means we are able to reduce some of the restrictions on ELC delivery laid out in previous guidance. However, we cannot yetto normal ELC practice – we all need to ensure that we continue to manage services and mitigate risks.”Mr Wylie pointed out that every child will have dferent levels of required support. He explained that some children have additional support needs and it will be important as part of the risk assessments carried out to consider the inidual needs of a child. Where there is a need to work in close proximity with adults and children the appropriate safety measures should be put in place based on that risk assessment.There will be a short transitional period for introducing our youngest children back into their learning and childcare services this week and this will y within each setting. The aim is to have all children, where possible, back into their settings by August .In line with government advice, there will be no requirement for physical distancing between children in nurseries. In nurseries two metre distancing will not apply between adults and children as, this does not meet young children’s social and emotional needs.

Teachers were told to submit the grades they thought each student would have receivedthey had sat the papers.Exam boards have moderated these grades to ensure this yearrsquos results ndash for students in England, Northern Ireland and Wales ndash are not signicantly higher than previous years.But now Education Secretary Gavin Williamson is due to tell students in England awaiting their A-level results this week that they can keep their grades in mock examsthey are higher than the calculated grade.Students will still be able to sit exams in the autumnthey are unhappy with the grades they secured in mock exams, orthey are dissatisfied with results awarded by exam boards on Thursday.All three grades will hold the same value with universities, colleges and employers, the Department for Educationis expected to say. vw,vw,px, px\"Secretary of State for Education Gavin Williamson Mr Williamson is also due to announce an additional pound million in funding to help schools and colleges carry out the autumn exam series for students wishing to sit GCSE and A-level exams.But the appeals process ndash where inidual students in England are dependent on schools and colleges to appeal against results on their behalf ndash is expected to remain the same.Mr Williamson said: ldquoEvery young person waiting for their results wants to know they have been treated fairly.ldquoBy ensuring students have the safety net of their mock results, as well as the chance of sitting autumn exams, we are creating a triple lock process to ensure they can have the confidence to take the next step forward in work or education.Evidence will need to be presented to satisfy the exam board that the mock exam was genuine.The announcement comes as Labour warned that Boris Johnson risked ldquorobbing a generation of young people of their future unless unfairness in the exams system was addressed.Concerns were raised by Labour that A-level and GCSE results could be downgraded for thousands of pupils in England because of the replacement grading system introduced.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ldquoThe SNP have been forced into a humiliating U-turn after a shambolic few days.ldquoWith  hours before results are released, I would urge the Prime Minister to change course, or he risks robbing a generation of their future.Geoff Barton, General Secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, accused the Government of a ldquopanicked and chaotic response.He said: ldquoThe idea of introducing at the eleventh hour a system in which mock exam results trump calculated grades beggars belief. The government doesnrsquot appear to understand how mock exams work. They arenrsquot a set of exams which all conform to the same standards. The clue is in the name lsquomockrsquo. And some students will not have taken them by the time that schools were closed in March. So, this immediately creates the potential for massive inconsistency.ldquoSchools and colleges have spent months diligently following detailed guidance to produce centre-assessed grades only to find they might as well not have bothered. There is certainly concern about the standardisation process applied by the exam boards, but there are also good reasons for having this system in place because it ensures that this yearrsquos grades are roughly in line with those of previous years, and this is important in terms of fairness to students over time.copy -.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over

Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges.

After the devastation caused by the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, , British and Commonwealth troops were posted to Japan to help support the US occupation and reconstruction effort.Among them was Tom Clarke from Ballymena and his daughter Sandra gave theaccess to her collection of photographs of her father and spoke about his memories to mark this sombre anniversary.Sandra, who lives in the village of Lundin Links on the coast of Fe, still keeps in contact with her old friends locally via social media.“Dad was born to Joseph and Jeannie Clarke nee woodcock at Clonavon Place. “He must have been a character in his earky years because he ran away to Belfast at  to try and join the RAF, but he said they gave him a good kick in the backside and and sent him home,” laughs Sandra.SELECTIONEventually Tom met the selection criteria and joined the RAF, subsequently being posted as groundcrew to the Far East where he served in Burma, India and Japan. “My dad was fiercely, proud of his time in RAF. He valued the comradeship and the friends he made during times of hardship far away from home. “I suppose that’s why he took so much interest in the Burma Star Association in later years. He could talk with people who’d been out in the South East Asia theatre and who had experienced similar things.”When Tom was quizzed by his prooud daughter about his role in the war he often preferred to joke about his experiences.“I asked my dad how many planes he had shot down but I remember him saying the closest he got to flying, was laying in bottom of flat bellied boat going into Hong Kong harbour! “Lots of servicemen ended up with bad illnesses out in the Far East and Dad was no exception.“I remember him telling me how he suddenly took sick in the street. He had to throw up and it was then that his  teeth came out and fell into the stream of filthy water which was running down the alley.“He had to chase after them and give them a rinse off - he was never going to get replacments in India during the war!” But it was in the immediate aftermath of the conflict that Tom became one of a very small number of British servicemen to be posted to the Japanese mainland to help with the clean-up of the devastated cities.With the prospect of terrible losses in any military invasion of Japan, the decision had been taken to unleash the Atomic Bombs in a bid to force the Japanese into surrender. The United States detonated two nuclear weapons over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August  and , , respectively, with the consent of the United Kingdom. The two bombings killed between , and , people and remain the only uses of nuclear weapons in armed conflict.Tom received a medal for working in the zones but rarely talked about the more distressing experiences. “He would just say that the whole city had been wiped out. He - and no-one  - had ever seen anthing like it,” says Sandra. “You can only imagine the kind of things he saw.”In later years, Sandra remembers her father’s breathing problems.“My dad was a chronic asthmatic and I remember, after he died, a woman came to see me. They were trying to seethere was any link about ex-servicemen with chest problems and whether it was related to working in areas,that were contaminated after the bomb.“My dad had his normal medals then years later he got the Southeast Asia Medal and I believe he was was the only member in Ireland to hold it“As a wee girl about , I can remember people in the house, were discussing what they would like to inherit.“I wanted my dad’s medals. He was very proud of me taking an interest so he made it his job looking to see any medals he should have had. So he always used to phone me saying I’ve got you another medal - he actually got another  medals,which were commemorative only.”Sandra looked set to follow in her father’s footsteps but her initial attempt ended in failure!“ I asked at  for my dad to sign my papers to join WRAF, but he refused, only for me to join QARANC  years later.” Sandra’s memories of her father also revolve around musicianship.“I asked him one day what would you like to be remembered for and he said his love of music. “He played the trumpet all his le and was in the Silver Band with his brothers Joe and James and their cousins the Woodcocks.“He had a little dance band in the early s ,I remember them playing in the green hut down Harryville Park.”Footnote: Japan surrendered to the Allies on August , six days after the Soviet Unions declaration of war and the bombing of Nagasaki. The Japanese government signed the instrument of surrender on September  in Tokyo Bay, which effectively ended World War II.

Mr Bell noted how the current Students# Union President, Grian Ni Dhaimhin, had posted on social media in the past expressing her apparent support for militant republicanism.He also claimed two other full-time officers of the Students# Union executive regularly show support for socialist republican activist group #Lasair Dhearg# via social media.Irish nationalist student councillors consistently put forward motions which are nothing but an insult to the unionist community on campus, he said.The latest example being a motion which attempts to ban the British military and PSNI from appearing on campus, a blatant insult to any student, regardless of political views, who intends to join the armed services or police upon graduating.There are #student bars# where unionists, and in particular Protestants, refuse to enter as they have a genuine fear of being the victim of sectarian abuse.In June members of Lasair Dhearg #renamed# Queen#s as #Mairead Farrell University Belfast# in a stunt to remember a former student who was shot dead in Gibraltar in  while engaged in IRA activity. Two other incidents that Queen#s Ogra Sinn Fein were engaged in have gone unpunished by the Students# Union, he added. During Freshers Fair , the Ogra Sinn Fein stand displayed a #Brits Out# sign. And Sinn Fein posters are consistently displayed on lampposts. Strictly speaking, these posters shouldn#t be erected outside election time and constitute littering because they do not have planning permission. These posters represent an attempt to mark territory.There are fewer ways to create a more unwelcoming atmosphere for unionists.Queen#s University as an institution might not be a cold house for unionism now but the Students# Union and attitudes on campus are certainly sending us head-on into an ice age.Queen#s University has been contacted for comment.

When someone dials  their call is initially answered by the Public Emergency Call Service operated by BT. The operator then attempts to connect the call to the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service#sEmergency Ambulance Control.However, in some circumstances calls are routed to the Scottish Ambulance Service as part of a #buddy# arrangement.These include where calls to the emergency control room exceeds its normal call handling capacity, or where an unplanned disruption to  call handling services occurs, through technical or other failures. NIAS said the #buddy# arrangement ensures an appropriate route for  calls to be redirected.It said arrangements in place as standard across all UK ambulance services to ensure business continuityHowever, the number of calls being answered in Scotland has risen sharply.In the last five months of ,  calls were sent to Scottish operators.But by  this had risen to , rising further to  last year. Last September alone  calls were answered in Scotland.The figures were released to this newspaper after a Freedom of Information request.Mr Givan, who has raised the issue with Health Minister Robin Swann, said the reasons for so many calls being sent outside Northern Ireland must be identied.He said: These findings suggest a deeply worrying trend in the number of emergency calls from members of the public in need of medical assistance in Northern Ireland being rerouted to the Scottish Ambulance Service. In ,  such cases took place compared to  the previous year, and only  in the last six months of . This demonstrates a stark and steady increase in contact lost between households and iniduals in need of help locally and NIAS Emergency Ambulance Control. Rerouting these calls naturally increases the risk of delay and disruption in coordination of services.Whilst we recognise the need for effective #buddy# arrangements with services where in the UK to ensure interrupted service in unforeseen situations, this should not be normal course day and daily. Reports of technical faults leading to calls being answered in Scotland extend as far back as  and the root causes need to be identied and rectied.In recent weeks concerns have been raised over ambulance cover in the Newry, south Down and south Armagh regions.The Ambulance Service estimates it needs  additional staff to meet targets.Mr Givan added: It is also vital that an evidence-based approach is adopted to staffing in the NIAS and ambulance control in particular in order to ensure appropriate capacity to meet service demand across Northern Ireland. Covid- has already placed our dedicated ambulance crews and staff under additional operational pressure and they deserve to have every resource available to ensure they can carry out their roles in the most effective way.It is imperative that the Minister of Health moves to address these concerns as a matter of urgency.NIAS said: All UK services have buddying arrangements in place with neighbouring ambulances services. This is considered best practice.NIAS has a #buddy system# with the Scottish Ambulance Service. This ensures continuity of service in the event of #call surges# or interruption to the telephony network. This is a reciprocal arrangement and NIAS will take calls for Scotland.When this happens the Scottish Ambulance Service takes the call and it is passed to NIAS#s command and control system via an electronic gateway for an ambulance to be despatched.

Retail NI, meanwhile, has insisted it is not for shop owners or staff to enforce the rules.Professor Heneghan, who is director of the University of Oxford#s Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, said the implementation of the new regulations has been a triumph of opinion and policy over evidence - one made on observational data, and not on randomised, controlled trials.The Department of Healthhas insisted, however, that it considered a wide range of evidence in making its recommendation for masks to be made mandatory, including two Royal Society reports.Read More Medic behind BBC coronavirus #conspiracy# complaint says: we must stay vigilant Professor Heneghan said: Northern Ireland should be honest with the population when it deems to put a whole policy together and say that we#re going to do this, and be clear: there is very poor quality evidence to inform what we#re going to do next, but we#re going to do it anyhow.The GP insisted the policy has been driven on the basis of decision-makers selecting evidence to suit their opinions.There#s a long history of people trying to use observational study to confer treatment effects. And that#s what people have done, he said.But there#s a real problem with when you do that approach, because you can cherry pick the evidence to suit your argument.So for instance, people use observational data that in countries with masks, infection rates are low. However, when you come to higher quality evidence, randomised, control trials, you see that#s not the case.The question is:you keep introducing interventions like this, people are not questioning do they work, and not questioning how will we evaluatethey work.This is a triumph of opinion and policy over evidence. And the biggest factor is, how can you inform the public of the benefits and the harms of these interventions Read More Suppliers hit hard by pause in Northern Ireland gigs sector Professor Heneghan said not enough focus has been given to the potential counterbalance - or equipoise - to public health intervention policies such as masks.He said: The other thing people don#t understand is that interventions are likely to increase benefit as well as increase harms. People seem to perceive there are no harms with any interventions, which is wrong.It is not clear to me that cloth masks are beneficial or harmful, but it is clear that we don#t use them in healthcare settings because they have been shown to increase the rates of infection compared to surgical masks. By all means wear a mask, butyou#re imposing it on society, then politicians should really ask questions.It#s unacceptable for people to say: #Here#s a review on poor quality evidence that we#re going to use to confer a policy#.Addressing how it is presented to the public, the Oxford expert added: Anything that has #might#, #could# or #may# shows you that you have a problem.If people want to wear masks, then that#s completely up to them. My job is to reduce the uncertainty about whether it#s beneficial or harmful. If you wear it, unfortunately there#s no evidence that I can help you with that#s going to benefit you with high quality studies.In mid-July, Prof Heneghan spotted major discrepancies in how Public Health England recorded coronavirus deaths that led Health Secretary Matt Hancock to order an urgent review.A health spokesperson said: The department has considered a wide range of scientic evidence from a number of sources when developing recommendations around the use of face coverings and new evidence emerges all the time.Questions have also been raised about the huge disparity in cross-border penalties.The £ fine here is far below the Republic, where anyone caught flouting the rule can face a fine of up €, or up to six months# imprisonment.

People will have loved ones that have been sick or passed away, so for them to hear it dismissed on the evening news like that isn#t nice for them to hear.So it was insensitive but the important thing is that they acknowledged the error.As with all healthcare workers in Northern Ireland, working to protect vulnerable patients from the pandemic has become part of Dr O#Neill#s daily le in recent months.I work in acute medicine so would often be the first port of call after people are admitted from AE, he said.I#m also in rheumatology so I have had issues there as lots of patients will be on steroids and immunosuppressive medication.They will have had a tricky time over the last few months with shielding. So it#s fair to say I#ve been thinkinga lot in the last few months.He said yesterday was a big day with face coverings becoming mandatory in shops so it will be interesting to see how well people adapt to that.A BBC spokesperson said last week: The inclusion of this clip was an error of judgment and it was removed from later bulletins and from the BBC Newsline Facebook page.The BBC is a  for engagement and debate, but ideas which fall outside the scientic mainstream should be scrutinised and challenged, which did not happen in this instance.In recent weeks a number of high profile figures, including Formula  champion Lewis Hamilton, have been criticised for appearing to support Covid- conspiracy theories.Mr Hamilton backtracked after sharing a post on Instagram about Bill Gates, with the post suggesting the billionaire lied about vaccine safety or claims vaccines would be used to microchip people. The sports star has since apologised and said that he hadn#t read the post properly, and was not against the use of any potential vaccine.

Justin McCamphill of teaching union NASUWT said the decision from the school was welcome, and would put the health and wellbeing of pupils, staff and school community first. All post-primary schools should be following this good practice, he said.Read More Coronavirus Northern Ireland: Robin Swann expresses #concern# about rising Covid- casesThis has to be done to mitigate the removal of social distancing that has come about as a result of the Executive decision [to reopen all schools] last Thursday.Belfast Royal Academyannounced the decision in a letter to parents, the BBC#s Stephen Nolan radio programme reported.Due to our large pupil and staff population it will be extremely dficult to maintain strict social distancing requirements, the letter read.Therefore, in order to protect all members of the school community, including those who are vulnerable, all pupils, staff and visitors must wear a face covering within the school building.If a pupil arrives to school without a face mask, they will not be permitted to enter the classroom.Read More #This is all about saving lives. It#s a risk I#m willing to take# - on the trail of a Covid vaccineIntegrated Ballymena post-primary school Slemish College announced on Tuesday it would also ask all members of the school community to wear masks inside the college building. As the NI Executive recently announced that face coverings should be worn in places where social distancing is dficult, we would ask everyone to wear face coverings when inside the College building, said a Twitter post.Y students should ensure they have one for collecting their results on Thursday.Mr McCamphill said the decision to enforce the wearing of masks will protect vulnerable teachers and pupils. [We] call on the executive to make the wearing of mask compulsory in all post-primary schools.We are aware that some students may not be able to wear masks for medical reasons, however the fact that other pupils are wearing masks will also protect them, he said. Read More Mandatory face coverings in Northern Ireland is wrong policy, says professorMLA Daniel McCrossan also welcomed the decision from BRA, saying the school was making the decision in the best interests of those that attend school and the wider community.He said there had been a lack of leadership and guidance from education authorities, as well as the Executive. This is an argument around face coverings which rumbled for weeks before a decision was made, he said. He said that while the SDLP was part of that Executive, the shots are called by the DUP and Sinn Fein.BRA said it made the decision after a meeting of the school#s health committee and plans to provide washable face coverings to pupils in school colours.The stance is in direct opposition to that of Education Minister Peter Weir, who has said imposing face coverings in schools is not necessary or implementable at this stage.Mr McCrossan said there is concern around the reopening of schools. Teachers are worried about ing and being exposed to risk, children and their families are also very concerned.What is more concerning is we get closer to the reopening of schools and there is still no clear guidance from the department, he said. Disruption for children needs to end and we need to do more to ensure schools reopen safely. I want to see clear guidance. Schools are reopening .. and there is not one extra penny to support schools in the extra resources that are going to be required to ensure the health and safety of staff and pupils. That is the concern... where is the funding If school children are being crammed into classrooms with no guidance they are being left to make a decision on their own.A Department of Education spokesperson said: Any specic public health advice will be followed regarding the use of PPE and face coverings for teachers and pupils. Detailed guidance on the reopening of schools will be issued this week and will include advice on the use of PPE and face coverings.Belfast Related ContentCoronavirus Premium#This is all about saving lives.

AnnaSophia Gallaghergrew up in Glenavy but has lived in the Lebanese capital for the last two years.Last Tuesday, she was sitting outside a restaurant with a friend around a mile away from the port where the huge blast took place.She said the heroic efforts of volunteers since then stand in stark contrast to shocking neglect by the authorities, with an angry backlash forcing the government to resign on Monday.It#s believed that over  people died in the explosion - caused by , tonnes of ammonium nitrate being stored unsafely in a warehouse for six years - with thousands more injured and displaced from their homes while the threat of coronavirus remains.Speaking to the Belfastshortly before a minute#s silence was held across Lebanon, AnnaSophia recalled the terrying moment of absolute, total destruction.I was sitting outside a restaurant with a friend who had just arrived. I was facing towards the port and it felt like slow motion, she said.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThe devastation in AnnaSophia’s neighbourhood after the explosion FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe devastation in AnnaSophia’s neighbourhood after the explosionWe felt the earth move like it was an earthquake and then I saw this huge gust of hot air coming towards us.The buildings seemed to inhale and almost exhale and just spat out all of the contents, all of the glass just fell out onto the street.The sounds of cars screeching to a halt and screaming soon followed in the confusion.AnnaSophia had been sitting beside a concrete wall, saving her from the shards of glass that fell over others.She quickly contacted her family and co-workers across the city, who initially believed there had been multiple explosions due to the sheer scale of the blast.A close friend of mine in Lebanon called me in panic, there were dead bodies where she was. She had fallen over at work and there was walking wounded in the street, people deeply injured, she said.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThe cafe table where AnnaSophia was sitting when the blast struck FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe cafe table where AnnaSophia was sitting when the blast struckHer whole apartment had been blown up, her dog had run away.

The dramatic U-turn followed a public outcry after a moderation system - based on criteria that included schools# past performances - saw , estimated results being downgraded. These have now be withdrawn and replaced by the original estimates.In a subsequent statement issued to the Belfast , however, Mr Weir said there has been no change to the Department#s guidance, adding that it is important we await the outcome of the current examination process.But with Northern Ireland using a not dissimilar format to the one just abandoned by Scotland, the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessmentand Department of Education are bracing themselves for a backlash which could ultimately involve legal action.Mr Allister said that one of the most concerning things is that Mr Weir and the Executive took no involvement in this issue, merely handing it over to CCEA.I don#t think Peter Weir can wash his hands as lightly as that, said TUV leader Mr Allister. He#s the Minister of Education. If an outcome of this is that pupils get an unfair grade then I don#t think the minister who set up the system and handed it over to CCEA can say, #Nothing to do with me#. That certainly isn#t what#s happened in Scotland and I don#t think it would be sustainable here. In his statement, Mr Weir said: Following the cancellation of the summer  examinations due to Covid-, CCEA put in place a process to award GCSE, A-level and AS-level grades based on a combination of teacher professional judgment and statistical modelling. A key element of the process is to ensure that qualications standards are maintained this year. There has been no change in this guidance.The statement added: Pupils in Scotland do not undertake GCSE and A-level examinations.Meanwhile, Northern Ireland#s Commissioner for Children and Young People, Koulla Yiasouma, said she doesn#t believe there is a strong enough appeals process in place at the moment. And Janet Williamson, principal of Royal Belfast Academical Institution , told the Belfastthere is a collective concern among head teachers here about the use of a school#s historic results to determine grades for inidual pupils. I agree with colleagues who have a concern that historical trajectories are being used, because each year group is an inidual cohort with their own specic strengths and weaknesses, she said. For example, at RBAI I have a Year  where our predicted grades are higher than in previous years because that reflects that particular set of pupils and subjects they have chosen.I completely agree with colleagues that to not take into account the fact that each year group is dferent is a concern.I have expressed that to CCEA through ASCL .I have every confidence that the grades identied and veried by my heads of departments with their colleagues are accurate, robust and rigorous.At this stage we do not know what percentage weighting will be given to this by CCEA and so whilst I have no concerns regarding the reliability of my in-house data, like everybody  the uncertainty around what is going to happen with the Z score is causing a slight increase in the normal tension we would always have had about the results.Mr Allister said he expected parents to reactthey feel their child has been unfairly graded. He also said it#s possible that solicitors will be inundated with calls from concerned parents come Thursday but added: It will require the internal appeals system, flawed as it is, to be exhausted before there#s recourse to the High Court.He continued: I#m quite sure, however, there will a judicial review challenge to the fact that there#s procedural unfairness.He also outlined the limits of the current appeals process.There obviously is an appeals process but it only seems to deal with data that is misunderstood or miscalculated. It doesn#t allow you to change the model, which I think is at fault here, he said.The model says you can moderate a result according to the school history. It sounds aswe#re judging the school rather than the pupil and the whole essence of testing and exams is that you judge the pupil irrespective of where they are from or who they are.Every one of these pupils has a right in public law to procedural fairness and a right to good administration, andthat is impacted by this system then it#s a fundamental flaw in the system just as it was in Scotland.He added: I wouldn#t be surprisedthere were at least some test cases of judicial review of the decision.Ms Yiasouma said the pandemic has only added to the anxiety felt by young people waiting on their results this year and she applauded CCEA#s efforts to address their concerns and to reassure them.My hope when the A-level grades come out this week is that teacher assessments have been given a strong weighting as there is generally a corresponding strong evidence base in terms of young people having completed a range of formal assessments in those subjects, she said.I also hope there will be a strong and robust quality assurance process in place, so that in all cases where the standardisation process has downgraded a teacher assessment, this has been done fairly and is adjusted were necessary.For some time now I have advised that there needs to be a more robust appeals process open to young people who believe they have not been graded properly. I hope the Scottish experience has once again highlighted for CCEA the need to revisit and revise their proposed appeals process.The CCEA was approached by the Belfastfor comment ahead of publication.

The facility would link up with the new Magee medical school to train future doctors. The Derry News has learned that plans for a ‘capital build’ project at the Derry hospital are at an ‘early stage’ but have been costed. The development comes shortly after the news emerged on Friday that Ulster University’s Graduate Entry Medical Schoolis now recruiting students for September  intake. The Western Trust has and will be the main partner to the medical school. Professor Louise Dubras, who will lead the course, appeared at a Western Trust board meeting to update members on the GEMS on August . googletag.cmd.push Speaking at the meeting, Mr Alan Moore, Director of Strategic Capital Development, offered a ‘hearty congratulations’ to Prof. Dubras. He made reference to on-site teaching facilities at Altnagelvin Hospital which were included in the business case. In response, Prof. Dubras said: “We costed in to our business case the requirement for a capital build at Altnagelvin Hospital to determine the amount of money that would be required for that. “What our expectation is, is that we wish to work with the Trust and Queen’s University Belfastto have a building which serves everybody and I think it’s really important that this is not two universities, two buildings and duplication of everything. googletag.cmd.push “We’re not big enough to do that and it doesn’t provide good education, the only way that this will work well as we move forward is to have a provision which covers all undergraduate education and that enables post-grad activity to take place there. “That’s really important for students to see and work with foundation year doctors and doctors at other stages of their training so that what you have as a Trust is a culture of education and growing educational excellence in the area – and a single place, which is the hub, is where it needs to happen.” TENACITY Addressing the meeting on behalf of the Trust, Dr Catherine McDonnell expressed her admiration for Prof. Dubras’ ‘patience and tenacity’ over the past two years for ‘sticking with the project’ to deliver a medical school in the North West. She said it is ‘extremely important’ to the hospital in terms of stabilising the medical workforce and creating local jobs. To clear up some ‘confusion’ there may be about the nature of the medical school Prof. Dubras pointed out that it’s not a post-graduate medical school for people who are qualied as doctors and doing a master’s degree. She explained that this school will accept students who will be trained as doctors and their degree could have been in any subject as long as they achieved a :. It will be situated within the faculty of Le and Health Sciences. “The medical school is about supporting local young people and improving the economic potential of the region and tackling long-term social deprivation.” Work is ongoing to refurbish buildings at the Magee campus in readiness for students next year. Prof. Dubras said staff recruitment is an interesting area and people have already expressed an interest in coming to Derry to work. Chairman of the Western Trust board, Sam Pollock, said he believes the medical school will help attract staff to address the ongoing issue of agency costs. Director of Performance and Service Improvement, Mrs Teresa Molloy, said there has been extensive interest from partner organisations such as Fermanagh and Omagh Council about the long-term benefits it could bring. EARLY STAGE In , the Department of Health commissioned a Review of Medical School Places which recommended that Northern Ireland needs  more medical students a year to meet the increasing demand for doctors. At last weeks meeting Prof. Dubras pointed out how the medical school will start off with  students and discussions are continuing with The Executive Office to increase that to . Currently, approximately % of medical graduates in Northern Ireland tend to stay and live within  miles of Queen’s University Belfast after graduation, according to the GMC. The new School of Medicine at Magee will address departmental recommendations by providing access to medical education in the North West, positioning theDerryCity region as an attractive place to study and work. Students will benefit from access to clinical placements across the full range of general practice, medical and surgical specialities with primary care-based experience from week one. This will enable students to develop knowledge and appreciation of the interconnectivity between primary, secondary, social and community-based healthcare. A spokesperson for Ulster University confirmed: “Ulster University continues to engage with local partners including the Western Health and Social Care Trust on medical education. “Discussions around joint additional training sites are at a very early stage and no plans have yet been agreed.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The new centre will be moved a short distance to Anderson House at Altnagelvin. Derry was the first city to set-up a COVID centre back on March  at the out-of-hours Western Urgent Care building. The other Covid centre in the Western Trust area opened at South West Acute Hospital on March . The Trust continues to maintain a state of readiness for admissions of patients with suspected Covid- and a further surge. Speaking at the Western Trust’s monthly board meeting, Dr Anne Kilgallen, Chief Executive, said: “Both centres continue to operate, preparing for a potential second surge. googletag.cmd.push “The Altnagelvin centre will move to Anderson and South West centre will reduce its footprint to free up space in the outpatient department. “Movements are allowing us to recommence our outpatient services.” Antibody testing has been offered in the Trust area as of July , she told the Western Trust board. These tests are used to detect antibodies to the COVID- virus to seeyou have previously had the virus. The test works by taking a blood sample and testing for the presence of antibodies to seeyou have developed an immune response to the virus. A total of  tests were carried out and only  ed as positive, which Dr Kilgallen described as an ‘interesting find’. googletag.cmd.push A Covid swab testing service available to staff, patients pre-operatively and staff in the independent sector continues to operate at C-TRIC at Altnagelvin Hospital and Lackaboy in Enniskillen. However, those services are also relocating in August as part of reset plans. The latest NISRA statistics show that  people have died of Covid- in Derry City and Strabane. In the council area there have been  confirmed coronavirus cases –  in the last  days. In response to the Coronavirus pandemic a network of new Primary CareCovid- centres were then rapidly established to manage the growth of Coronavirus cases in the community. They were seen as an essential part of the fight against this virus.  To ensure vital GP services can be maintained, it is believed to be absolutely critical that those who show symptoms are separated from the patients with nonCovid- related conditions.  These centres are not testing facilities and are only for patients who are very unwell, are suspected of havingCovid- and require medical attention.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The start of the summer. A time of hope. A time of new beginnings. To celebrate my th birthday, my friends and I had travelled to Belfast on a minibus on a school-night in the middle of A Levels for that momentous YES concert. We were thrilled to get to see Ash and Bono at the Waterfront. We were extra ebullient at the sight of John Hume taking to the stage. The unlikely trio of David Trimble, John and Bono were applauded with yells of “Yesss!”. googletag.cmd.push  The burning pride deep inside on that night could have set the world alight. To the friends I had yet to meet, some of whom were at that concert, I would always be Proud Mary from Derry. I had come of age just in time to vote in the referendum three days later. Not all of us would have that privilege. My sister, Deirdre, who was singing and shouting her heart out for the entire excursion, was  months shy of voting age. In fact she would never get to vote as she was killed in a car accident we were involved in  months later. googletag.cmd.push I had meticulously studied the Good Friday Agreement text during the referendum campaign. As excited as I was to be on my way to Loch an Iuacuteir for Cuacutersa na Casca that Good Friday, my inner political nerd was sorry to be missing all the TV and radio coverage. No mobile phones or social media in those days. Just two days before the signing of the Agreement, I was at Stormont with a delegation of Derry Girls lobbying the British Government for a new school. I was on The Thornhill Talks Team with Mrs Boyle, Miss Hamilton and Head Girl, and my lelong friend, Emmylou. The eyes of the world were on these negotiations and the hand of history was on our shoulders. John Hume took time out to facilitate the meeting withMinister of Education, Tony Worthington MP. John was the architect of the unfolding momentous peace accord, but he was focussed on bread and butter constituency issues. He knew the importance of education in creating opportunities and building inclusive and peaceful communities. I was engaged in current affairs and local politics from a young age. I was fascinated by the work of my godfather, Uncle Mark. His job as John Hume’s parliamentary aide brought him to ious countries. He gted me with great stories and good lessons over the years. I proudly flaunted a “Hume for Europe” Tshirt in . I read newspapers. I listened intently to the kitchen wireless and followed the TV debates. Always rooting for John and rehearsing the Humespeak: You can’t eat a flag. Spill sweat, not blood. Respect ersity. An accident of birth. Dference is the essence of humanity. This language is now common parlance. John brought others on to his page and round to his way of thinking and speaking. It is impossible to consider John’s achievements without recognising the influence of his we and key adviser, Pat. On completion of my A Levels, I had the pleasure of working in the Bayview Terrace constituency office in the run up to the first Assembly elections. I learned so much about public service, not least in witnessing the compassion and care shown by Pat to every person. The office was buzzing. Phone calls were coming in from journalists, humanitarians and politicians from all over the world. I could hear John speaking in French on the phone one minute, then dealing with a constituent on a housing issue the next minute. Pat had time and warmth for everyone. Amidst the flurry, Pat still found time for banter and indulged my frivolous chats about nights out. I still regard Pat as a mentor and hero. I can only try and imagine the extent of sacrices made by Pat and her family over the years. After that short stint in the office, I spent three months working in Seagate , before starting my chapter at Queen’s and all the adventures that came with that and after that. The Omagh atrocity that summer was a stark reminder of the fragility of the hard-earned peace. John Hume was a political giant, a living legend and an international statesman. Above all, he was a Derry champion. He was a man of global thinking and local action. First-hand experience of poverty in his community motivated his relentless quest for social justice, and his role in founding the credit union movement was instrumental in giving opportunities to people and families. His civic leadership in the community was as impressive as his political leadership on the world stage. John Hume was a man of vision. Steadfast in his ambitions. Resolute in pursuit of solution. Willing to work with anyone. Determined not to be distracted by the viliers. He kept his shoulder to the wheel and his eyes on the prize. Not any of the acclaimed world prizes he won . Ultimately the prize for John was the prize for everyone: peace and the prospect of a brighter future. Those coming of age today face immense challenges as we emerge from a global health pandemic and enter a world recession. Climate emergency is real. In this part of the world we face the added challenges of Brexit uncertainty. Today’s generation need an injection of the hope that my generation were given  years ago. We still have much work to do. The “isolation of the West” remains a pertinent issue. The fight for a proper university presence in the city continues. “I sometimes wish it was that summer again…..” We should always maintain a little bit of that summer, even in the middle of the longest winters. The spirit of partnership and reconciliation underpinning the Good Friday Agreement and defining Hume’s pathway must be restored. And we shall overcome.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Entering the school foyer you’re struck that John Hume sits alongside illustrious company in what must have been a golden age of thinkers and creators. A bust made in the Derry man’s honour rests between two gentlemen who excelled in their own fields in Seamus Heaney and Brian Friel.  Each of these men attended the former Bishop Street school around the same time and went on to become giants in their respective disciplines. googletag.cmd.push John Hume’s own journey at the college began in  . “He told his mother he was going to the College and she said, ‘no you’re not, we can’t afford that’, but he passed his Eleven Plus and got in,” current principal Finbar Madden said. Hume was part of the first generation to avail of opportunities through the introduction of the Eleven Plus. It allowed more young people to continue their post-primary education which may go some way to explaining why men like Hume, Friel and Heaney grasped the opportunity with both hands. There was obviously ‘huge talent and ability’, Mr Madden said, as Hume left the school with a scholarship to study at university. googletag.cmd.push He had ambitions of joining the priesthood at the leading Catholic Seminary in Ireland, St Patrick’s College, Maynooth. Hume didn’t complete his clerical studies but instead opted to serve his community in another way. He graduated from the National University of Ireland in  with a bachelor’s degree in French and history and went on to receive a master’s degree. Returning to Derry, Hume would became a teacher at St. Columb’s. Mr Madden said that career lasted from -. At the time, the history curriculum was limited in schools and Hume taught the subject in a broader sense, keen to instil his vision of Ireland’s place in Europe. As he departed, transitioning into a career in politics, some of the key developments in the civil rights movement were starting to unfold. That, however, wasn’t the end of his journey with the school and his legacy endures. The colleges former pupils association present an annual award - the Alumnus Illustrissimus Award - to a past-pupil who has achieved something of major signicance or has made a considerable contribution in his own field. In , the Most Reverend Dr Edward Daly received the inaugural award and the following year John Hume would be recognised for his contribution to politics and peace in Northern Ireland. Mr Madden said: “The school is able to boast of many exceptional students who went out and made their mark locally, nationally and internationally. “The award recognises achievement whatever the field may be sport, science politics, religion and so on.” A proud College boy, Hume maintained connections over the years and wouldfor prize giving ceremonies. “He presented a facsimile of his Nobel prize to the school,” Mr Madden pointed out next to the assembly hall, “and our politics A-level prize is the John Hume prize in government and politics.” “And for as long as he could, he would come every year to prize-giving, he usually turned up unannounced but we always expected him to come, until unfortunately he wasn’t able to. “He had a very, very clear sense of his connectedness with this school and he never lost that right throughout his le. “In a way that many others weren’t able to do, by his connectedness here, by his presence, he was making it clear that St. Columb’s College meant a huge amount to him. “He recognised what the college had helped him to become.” The school’s principal believes that pupils have looked up to Hume over the years and used him as a source of inspiration in their own studies. Mr Madden concluded: “I think Colum Eastwood said it last night, John Hume was Ireland’s Martin Luther King and we recognise that Martin Luther King had a dream and did all he could to achieve it. “I think John Hume did exactly the same thing here.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The club have never tasted adult championship success. With the manner of victory over Glenullin on Sunday afternoon, it would suggest that consistency will be what Eamon Gibson will be looking from his squad during this condensed season. It leaves John Heaneys side with some soul-searching ahead of their clash with Limavady this weekend. From the way Ben McCarron careered through the Glenullin defence in the opening seconds, until the final whistle, they never looked like being reeled in. If anything, they shouldve won by more. If they are to stand up and be counted when the serious heat comes on, they will need a more ruthless streak in front of goal. The pleasing thing for them, they appear to have the raw materials. googletag.cmd.push They will have to take somewhat of a reality check. Glenullin didnt offer the threat many expected and showed signs of the form that found them in relegation trouble last year. It was a big ask for Michael Oacuteg McKeown in his first game in goals to replace the injured Pearse McNicholl and when they failed to secure possession at midfield, it was a long hour for him. Steelstowns runners through the middle hurt them and with Ben McCarron playing as a third midfielder, their mobile attack thrived in the space. Dermot OKane, one the best dead ball kickers in the county, was off colour and Eoin Bradleys relaxed  metre free coming off the post summed up a day they will want to forget. googletag.cmd.push Stephen Cleary played in the reserve game, but was forced off injured and  minutes into the senior game Eoghan Bradleys ankle injury saw him replaced. On came Rory Maguire who had while he had a terric game, he will be disappointed not to have bagged three further goals. Cahir McMonagle will be another option in attack, but its hard to imagine him getting the room he was afforded yesterday when the real action comes to town. Glenullin put Conor Rafferty onto Neil Forester in what seemed like a curtaining job, while Feargal Close pushed back on to Gareth Logue. It was Logie who dictated the game and even when Gerard OKane was sent out to mark him, the Steelstown mans movement caused Glenullin trouble. Steelstown were three points ahead when the first goal chance presented itself, but it fell to Glenullin. Dermot OKane picked out Paul Rafferty in front of goal but the low pile-driver was instinctively turned onto the bar by goalkeeper Marty Dunne. Seconds later Jacob Duffy had the ball over the bar at the other end. Brothers Dermot and Gerard OKane kicked two terric point, but it did little to stem Steelstowns incessant running game. Whoever is going to stop them, cant afford to drop off. They will need a half-forward line that will occupy them and top the overlap. When the first goal came, it was a majestic diagonal ball from full-back Shane OConnor who found Logue in space and his unstoppable shot went to the bottom corner of McKeowns net. Ryan Devine floated over a fine score from distance before Jacob Duffy made the second goal, with the strong-running Maguire blasting to the net. Steelstown missed three point chances before Maguire was blown up for over carrying when through on goal, almost ashe was caught in two minds to flick to the final support runner. Glenullin brought on three substitutes at the break. Brian Mullan was pulled out from goal with Eoin Bradley now stationed at full-forward. Early in the second-half he won a free but somehow spurned it from close range. He missed a chance in front of goal and the attacking unit didnt have the movement that would have tested Steelstown. At times Brian Mullan, who kept trying to push Glenullin forward, tried to float balls forward. The dference being was that the same space wasnt there that Gareth Logue made for the city men. The half took seven minutes to produce a first score. The move began with Dunnes monstrous kick over midfield, Rory Maguire was again involved and when the ball came from a Mark Foley, he was brilliantly denied by Eunan OKanes ing block, before Foley drilled over the . Then came a moment Gibson and his assistant Raymond Tracey wont be too happy with. Mark Foley had the ball at his feet in front of goal, with time to engineer a chance. He opted to lazily soccer the ball to Jacob Duffy who missed without working goalkeeper McKeown. On another day, this lack of urgency could be crucial. Ben McCarron and Darren McDaid, from opposite wings, floated over two sweet scores. And still the goal chances kept flooding in. After a neat move, McCarron and Jason McAleer created another opening but Maguires thundering shot hit the bar before spinning over. Maguire also brought out a fine save from goalkeeper McKeown who brilliant clawed the rebound clear, as the Steelstown attacks kept pouring forward. The chances Steelstown were mounting and missing had no bearing on the result. At the other end a fisted Eoin Bradley effort dropped into Dunnes arms and Conor Rafferty fired over when a goal was on, but it was always going to be Steelstowns day.

The fact he was man of the match in a dominant team tells enough about his performance. The finish for his goal combined power and accuracy to the bottom cover. With Ben McCarron playing further out, it was Logues running that made th Steelstown attack tick. MOMENT OF THE GAMEDUNNE SAVE – There were many scores in the game, but Marty Dunnes save was something . Dermot OKanes ball came in from the wing and Paul Rafferty just pulled on it along the ground and when the shot zipped off the turf, Dunne somehow got enough on the ball to prevent a goal that wouldve levelled the game in the thminute. TURNING POINTQUICK POINTS – While the first half goals gave Steelstown a , having Eoin Bradley lurking at full-forward meant they could not rest easy at the back. There were seven points between the teams with  minutes gone, but in the next five minutes Foley, McCarron, McDaid and McMonagle chipped in with scores to kill off the game.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Initially testing was restricted to health and social care workers, it then accepted key workers and their families who had symptoms and more recently any member of the public with symptoms. googletag.cmd.push These tests can be booked via the Public Health Agency website. Many medical and disease control experts have said that testing and contact tracing is key to tackling the spread of COVID-.

The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate.

Jim McReynolds, the popular former owner of McReynold’s Bar, died peacefully last week at his home in Dungiven. Mourners at his funeral heard how Jim had given his time generously to his parish, community and family le. “Jim was a man of faith and trusted in God all his le,” Fr Seamus Kelly told the congregation. “He was very involved in the le of this parish, taking up the collection, doing his time working with St Vincent de Paul, helping and supporting people. googletag.cmd.push “Growing up he was an excellent footballer and represented Dungiven with distinction, gaining a place on the Derry minor team in . “He sponsored many groups and clubs down the years, and club members often said that Jim was the saviour of the hurling club on many occasions. “Even when they hadn’t the money, he would have bought hurls and kits where required until they could raise the funds.” Jim was dedicated to the bar, running what Fr Kelly described as a ‘tight ship’, and he helped cement the bar’s place as a community hub in the town. “He ran a tight ship in his pub. He did not make sales or money his god, but often refused to serve customers he thought were too young or who had already had enough to drink,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “McReynold’s Bar has been famous, not only in Dungiven, as it was the only chief landmark for weary and thirsty travellers from all over the world, and it remains as popular today. “Just last year I had a friend or two visiting and the person wanted a pint, so I said I’d take them down to the best pub in town, McReynold’s Bar, and we had a few pints there. “He had a ready ear for customers’ problems, which were always treated confidentially, and he helped countless numbers of people in a iety of ways over the years. “I’m also told Jim enjoyed cooking and often provided the family meal. The children wouldfrom school, and Rose from teaching, to find a dinner waiting for them. “It had been cooked by Jim while he dodged in and out between the bar and the house, keeping the customers happy as well.” Fr Kelly also spoke of how Jim’s love and commitment to his family, in particular his we Rose, shone through in all that he did. “He met and fell in love with a wonderful Drumsurn girl, Rose Boyle, who was a teacher in her local school.” he said.  “Once they met, Rose and Jim had eyes only for each other and naturally they got married in Drumsurn chapel  years ago. “He loved the cottage in Donegal and was in his element entertaining family and friends when he got off there for a break. I’ve no doubt it holds great memories for all the family. “I enjoyed my visits to Jim and Rose when we were able to visit the sick, Fr Joseph and myself always got a great welcome. “Jim was most generous and appreciated having Holy Communion brought to him when he could no longer go to Mass. “He and Rose always sat side-by-side and I could sense the closeness in their relationship together. I know all the family will miss Jim, but especially his dear we, Rose.” Jim is survived by Rose and his children Finvola, Siobhan, Fanchea, Bernard, Bronagh and Ciara. He was the much-loved grandfather of James, Claire, Anne, Michael, Chris, Katy, Patrick, Cathal, Domnaill, Conal, Niall, Ciaran, Oliver, Liam, Ellen-Rose and great grandfather of Darragh. Jim was pre-deceased by his siblings Frances, Mary, Jean, Patsy, Kathleen and Tony.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Lisa McGee was doing her A-Levels at Thornhill College when the Good Friday Agreement was signed in , and grew up knowing about Mr Humes work for the peace process. He was just there all the time, she recalled. There wasnt a time that you didnt know about him. There was never any debate about it, he was a good man. At a time where everything was debated about and talked about nobody ever questioned that. Not that you would ever have needed to, or have wanted to, question what he was doing. googletag.cmd.push Ms McGee said the news of Mr Humes death on Monday morning came as a shock, despite knowing that he had been ill for some time. He was a hero who walked among us, she said. I got really upset I was surprised at how emotional I felt. We were just so used to having him. It was phenomenal what he did, the influence he had and the amazing vision of what our future should be. Ms McGee believes hundreds of people owe their le to Mr Hume, due to his role in the cessation of violence. He was an incredible person and he was sent here for a reason, she said. googletag.cmd.push I was just thinking yesterday of all the people that may not be herehe hadnt been able to do what he did and built the peace process. When you think of everything he did and he never gave up- thank God. Ms McGee doesnt knowJohn Hume ever watched Derry Girls, but she hopes he would have approved. I dont knowhe ever saw it, but he and Pat knew I was a big fan, she said. I hope they thought it was alright. He was always in the background in the news, so he was present in the show. And Erin chats about him a lot in the Derry Girls book that I did recently. There would be no Derry Girls without John Hume because I wouldnt have had the opportunities that I had,” she added. The Derry writer that she wants her two young children to learn about John Hume as they grow up. There was an amazing image of him on the front of thetoday [Tuesday] and I want to get that framed for the house because its important that they know about him, she said. This was always going to be a very sad time because it was always going to be about looking back over the past and that was a very painful time in our history. It has been a sad thing for me that towards the end of his le he couldnt remember everything he achieved. Thats why we have to remember for him.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He noticed that for special occasions people in the city rush out to buy a personalised cake from Doherty’s Bakery and thought why not also give them a special memento they can hold on to forever. Christopher Ferry is a Derry man with over  years’ experience in the design industry. He has won ious awards in that time for graphic design and social media management through his work with local businesses. Being on furlough at the moment and confined to his home during lockdown, he felt there was no time like the present to kickstart his own business, aptly named Ferry Clever. googletag.cmd.push It allows people to personalise cards or buy those with famous Derry faces for every occasion. A host of Maiden City icons appear on cards such as John Hume, Nadine Coyle, Micky Doherty , Pat Ramsey and places such as Free Derry Corner, the City Walls and, of course, The Ice Wharf.  Most of them are accompanied by local sayings, for example the common phrase ‘I love you to the moon and back’ is given a local spin to read, ‘I love you to the Bog and back’, with a sketch of the Bogside as the backdrop. It is not just cards but personalised images that can be framed, with a Liverpool-themed design currently proving popular after they were crowned Premier League champions. googletag.cmd.push Families can customise an image of them standing outside the Shankly Gates where it says ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’. The business has been built at home but Christopher’s ambition is to eventually open a shop in the city centre where the tagline will be ‘make it personal’. Working as a DJ he has established relationships with numerous bars and businesses in the town. “Years and years ago they seen me doing the designs for my own posters, this was back when social media was starting to explode, and they asked meI fancied doing posters for them. “I’d do everything from menus printed in their premises, posters, social media campaigns, to online videos – the lot. “But now I want to go full pelt at it and open my own business.” Recently he was in the town looking for a Father’s Day card and couldn’t find any he liked.  He said: “I thought it would be greatyou could just go on to some place and they could make the card for you. “So I thought, you know what, I’m going to try this as well.” He started off selling on the website Etsy and sales have been rising, ‘people are just buying the cards flat to the mat at the minute’, he added. As someone who is social media savvy, he has been keeping an eye on trends and designing cards accordingly. During lockdown the charity work of local celebrity Micky Doherty was well publicised which is why his image was selected to grace one of the cards.  The ultimate ambition for Christopher is to be the ‘go-to person’ whenever a special occasion comes up. “In Derry, and all over the world, it’s always going to be someone’s birthday, it’s always going to be Christmas, it’s always going to be Father’s Day so I just want them thinking of me for a card.” Micky Doherty said he loved the cards. “Im totally honoured,” he said. “Like someone wants a birthday card with my face on it, he laughed.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Playhouse will host performances of a new play about the devastation of the Troubles from September .

However, because of the coronavirus restrictions, an audience of only  people will be allowed into each performance. The auditorium at the Playhouse usually has room for  people.

Rather than having all these empty chairs that would be housing absence, we would be housing something of signicance,” he said. Kieran Grfiths, Producer Director of thePlayhouse, said they believed it was a fitting memorial for people who have passed away. “Like a low-laying fog, grief has sat amongst us all this year,” he said. “It’s grey, feels impossible to lt and kicking it sees it rise around us. “Our plan is to honour that grief and to fight through with resilience and creativity to simply try and make something move.” googletag.cmd.push As well as being performed live in front of a small audience, the play will also be broadcast live on the internet.

Chief Executive Paul Clancy has said the Northern Ireland Executive’s decision to make the wearing of face masks mandatory in shops is positive news because it protects both shoppers and staff. The decision also gives more certainty to businesses about the steps that need to be taken to keep people, including staff, safe. In a survey carried out with the Chamber’s members last week, % of  respondents supported the mandatory wearing of face masks in shops by the public. googletag.cmd.push Londonderry Chamber Chief Executive Paul Clancy said: “We are glad to see some certainty on this issue. A vast majority of our own members in the North West are supportive of the mandatory wearing of face masks in shops because they recognise that it protects the health and safety of their own staff, as well as customers. “The reality is that we will all have to make some changes to how we live, work, shop and socialise andthe wearing of face coverings is mandatory, it will help promote more of a cultural change in the acceptability of wearing face coverings. googletag.cmd.push “Shops in the city have put in place new measures and changes which will protect their customers and staff. Many retailers have invested a great deal of time and money to make people feel safe and secure and it is important that customers support the new guidelines. “This has been an enormous time of change, but we must all play our part to protect public health, keep the spread of coronavirus to a minimum and avoid a second wave which will be catastrophic for many businesses. “I hope that people will embrace this change and support local businesses as they try to navigate this new landscape. I would also urge members of the public to be mindful of shop staff and treat them with patience and respect. “The number one priority of retailers is the welfare and safety of their customers and staff and have taken these measures to protect everyone. By shopping local and staying local, we can support small businesses who have been impacted by the lockdown.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The new vaccine research registrywill help large numbers of people to be recruited into trials over the coming months, potentially leading to an effective vaccine being identied and made available to the UK public against coronavirus sooner. It has been developed as part of the UK Government’s Vaccine Taskforce, in partnership with the National Institute for Health Research , NHS Digital, and the Northern Ireland, Scottish and Welsh Governments. Dr Janice Bailie, Assistant Director, RD Division, Public Health Agency, said: “Health researchers are currently working to find a vaccine for COVID-, but without the help of members of the general public willing to participate in vaccine trials, this work will not be able to succeed. googletag.cmd.push “The NHS COVID- vaccine registry allows people to register their interest and be potentially contacted with an offer to participate in clinical studies. “You can sign up to give permission for researchers to contact you about taking part in COVID- vaccine studies. By collecting details about people who are interested in taking part in vaccine studies, the registry service will help cut down the time it takes to find volunteers for vaccine studies. This will help us to carry out studies and find a vaccine faster.” The registry is available to anyone aged  or over, living in the UK. To register, people fill in some personal and contact details, and answer a series of basic health screening questions on an NHS web form atwww.nhs.uk researchcontact. googletag.cmd.push   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The former Top of the Hill Celtic and Derry City youngster has made the move for an undisclosed fee from Championship side Bristol City. The -year-old enjoyed a successful loan spell during the - season, scoring twice in  appearances in all competitions. Holden, who has also had loan spells at Barrow and Rochdale, played in a iety of positions during his first stint with the Saddlers but particularly impressed in an advanced role in midfield. Holden expressed how excited he was to come back to the club and work with the players he played closely with last season, along with the backroom staff. googletag.cmd.push “I’m buzzing to be back,” said Holden. “After last season, I wanted to come back and I had been speaking to the gaffer over the off season and I’m happy to get it done now and I can’t wait to kick on. “Last season, it took a little bit of time for me to settle in but this year there won’t be that because I have made relationships with the staff and the lads who are here, so hopefully I can just hit the ground running and try and contribute as much as I can to the team.” “In my first season, you have to learn how people play and you have to learn about their game but this year I know what everyone is about and they know what I am like so it will be easy for me to settle back in.” googletag.cmd.push Saddlers boss Darrell Clarke is looking forward to working with the Northern Irishman again this season and he is looking for Holden to pick up where he left off last term. “As we all saw last season, especially towards the end of the campaign, Rory is a fantastic player,” said Clarke. “He was somebody who we were really keen to work with again and I’m really pleased to see him back at the club permanently this time. “Rory has an exceptional work ethic, which I mentioned last season, he knows the squad and what we’re about as a team and I’m really expecting him to push on again this season for us.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Theyre not top of the league for no reason.“Sticking together is the most important thing for us now. The performance shows that were not too far off it and we still have a few more boys to come in and everyone gets together.“We defended well in the game and everyone, even the subs who came on did everything they could. Two silly mistakes cost us but we just have to stick together as a team and look forward to the next game. There are loads more league games to come for us so there is more to come from us as a team.”Toal himself came so close to an equaliser in added time as Ciaran Harkins header came back off the crossbar before falling for the defender who saw his follow up brilliantly saved by Rovers goalkeeper Alan Mannus. Such thin margins cost City at least a share of the spoils.“Jackie has got a great header and its hit the bar and come across,” Toal recalled. “I tried to get as much pace on the ball as I could but he has come across and made the save. On another day they go in so its bitterly disappointing.“This league is a hard league and you need to be picking up points thick and fast. We were just unlucky and things could have went dferently and maybe another day they do. Theres still a lot to play for this season. We just need to focus on Saturday now.” googletag.cmd.push -- googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Parking restrictions will also be in place around the working areas.Ni Water says the investment is part of a programme of work to improve the existing sewers in Downpatrick, which will enhance the local sewerage infrastructure and reduce the risk of out of sewer flooding.It has confirmed that the essential work will involve repairing existing sewers and will mainly be undertaken using underground trenchless techniques, which will signicantly reduce the duration and disruption of the programme.But NI Water is warning that it will be necessary to undertake lsquoopen-digrsquo repairs at some locations due to the condition of the existing sewers.The organisation says that this particular aspect of the work is expected to last just one or two days with contractors also working in the evening, with every effort being made to minimise disruption.ldquoAppropriate traffic management and signage will be in place as the work progresses, said a NI Water spokeswoman.ldquoThe majority of the works will be undertaken during normal working hours. However, to reduce disruption to businesses and the public, some night-time works will be required at key locations.The work will take place at ious locations around the Downpatrick area, including some of the main streets within the town centre.NI Water has confirmed that the contractor working on the Downpatrick scheme mdash Geda Construction mdash will liaise with any affected businesses and properties.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWe appreciate that this work is disruptive and would like to thank the public in advance for their patience as we complete these essential improvement works.ldquoWe are all practising social distancing and our priority is to keep customers and colleagues safe. Please keep your distance and our workers will carry on with their essential work for you.South Down MLA Colin McGrath has met with NI Water officials ahead of work starting in Downpatrick, highlighting the need for communication with the community and the need to complete the scheme quickly.He said it was imperative that consideration was given to the works being done in the evening and at weekends to ensure that the level of public disruption was kept to as low a level as possible.ldquoI canrsquot think of a time in recent memory when Downpatrick has suffered road works after road works than has happened over the past few years, the MLA continued. ldquoIf the public is frustrated by this, it is entirely understandable and entirely justied.ldquoThe past few months have been incredibly worrying and stressful and people are finally able to step out of their homes. Shielding finally came to a end last week and the most vulnerable in our society are able to take those first tentative steps out of their homes again. It would have been altogether unacceptable for them to have to navigate this with works going on in their town.Mr McGrath said that having raised these issues with NI Water, the organisation is planning to use underground trenchless techniques, with contractors also working in the evening.He added: ldquoI will be in regular contact with the project manager to ensure that these works are completed as quickly as possible and due consideration given to the public.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has appealed to residents and the business community to remain patient as the work progresses.ldquoThis is an important scheme for Downpatrick and, as such, there will inevitably be disruption. NI Water intends to keep this to a minimum and it is important that this is the case, he continued.ldquoThis is a signicant investment in a much-needed scheme to not only upgrade the existing infrastructure, but also prevent so-called out-of-sewer flooding. Upgrading town centre sewers is an important scheme and NI Water must honour its commitment to keep disruption to a minimum.Cllr Curran said improving the town centrersquos waste water infrastructure was good news for residents and the business community.He added :ldquoThe suggested timetable to complete the work is five weeks and I hope that every effort will be made to ensure that back-to-school traffic is not impacted as the start of the new term is less than one month away..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 Downpatrick Cricket.jpg","title":"Downpatrick see off Saintfield by four runs in close contest  ","story":"WHAT a dference  hours makes in the game of cricket.Downpatrick, who had been humbled by Ballymena on Thursday, got back to winning ways at Saintfield with the batsmen showing some pride and application.Ross Boultwood won the toss and decided to bat first.

The original proposal was to end the scheme on August .Downpatrick councillors Gareth Sharvin mdash who initially proposed the free parking initiative ndash and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the extension of the free parking scheme.Cllr Sharvinrsquos suggestion was tabled at the June meeting of the local authorityrsquos Strategic, Policy and Resources when it was also agreed to review the decision in early August.ldquoI proposed the initiative to encourage shoppers back into Downpatrick to provide a boost for our local businesses who have continued to provide key services during the pandemic and the easing of lockdown restrictions, Cllr Sharvin explained.He revealed that when he used the Irish Street, Scotch Street and Church Street car parks theywere extremely busy and he was heartened by the usage, admitting that he did receive some feedback that there were some all-day parkers taking up vital spaces which would have had a negative impact on our local businesses.Agreement to extend the free parking initiative was accepted by the local authority on Monday following a proposal by Cllr Sharvin.ldquoThe near eight weeks of free car parking have been a great benefit to Downpatrick and in my proposal to extend the scheme until August , I have asked that the car park strategy the council is completing is fast tracked.ldquoThis is important to ensure equality across the district and to review the car park tarf of p an hour, with a reduction in the hourly rate being considered.Cllr Sharvin said while shoppers will not have to pay to park for almost two more weeks, he has vowed to continue working with local businesses to ensure that the local authority is doing everything it can do to support them.He added: ldquoWith this feedback from local businesses, I would not hesitate to call on the council to reconsider the car parking charges again,traders feel it is impacting on them signicantly during this continuing pandemic.Cllr Hanlon said while free parking had been extended, it was important that the public remembered that charges would be introduced shortly.However, she expressed disappointment at the lack of signs informing people that parking is free which confused some shoppers.Cllr Hanlon said a number drivers contacted her regarding the issuing of enforcement tickets whilst using the car parks for minor offences.She continued: ldquoThis, in my opinion, was counter productive to the reason why councillors had agreed to the extended free parking to encourage people to shop locally and provide businesses with some breathing space to adapt to the new way of working.She also highlighted the need for the local authority to press ahead with its car parking strategy and for an equitable charging system across the district..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C August 5%2C 2000  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK

Its need has been proven. There was no need to explore the feasibility of anything, she said.Mrs Trainor said the outcome of the meeting with health officials was that politicians, the community and trade unions stood together in demanding theof AE provision.She added: ldquoThis very much reminded me of the early days of the hospital campaign where everyone was saying the same thing. We won the case for the Downe but, from day one, administrators started to strip services from it.ldquoOver recent days what has given me the greatest heart has been the reaction of the politicians, the community and trade unions on the Downe Hospital issue.Mrs Trainor said she hopes that the unity will continue, insisting that when it comes to hospital services, the people of Downe are asking for nothing more than parity with those in other areas.ldquoThere has been substantial underfunding in this district for many years and we need parity with everyone  alongside rural proofing as, for those in authority, the centralisation of services is still very much alive. Their attitude is that everything stops in Belfast, she continued.ldquoBut everything does not have to be centralised in the city. The Downe is a beautul hospital but is being totally underused, yet it is one of the most modern of its kind. There is room to expand to increase service provision and we also want more consultants and staff alongside increased investment for student nurses.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoThere is total unity across the community on these issues and a strong defence of the Downe Hospital.ldquoThe hospital is the single biggest issue in our district.

In the obituaries for John Hume, after his death last week, many writers focussed on his belief in an ‘agreed Ireland’ that included all the ‘traditions’ on this island.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Recently, in the News Letter, Jeffrey Dudgeon ‘The endgame for unionists still has a long way to run,’ July  and Alex Kane Unionism needs a strategy, July  exchanged ideas about the future of unionism . While they both had dferent perspectives, I think they would agree that, particularly recently, the sense of crisis and negativity among unionists has deepened. Partly, this is because nationalist attacks on Northern Ireland’s place in the UK have become more virulent, but ultimately it is not up to nationalists to pull unionists out of their tailspin of negativity.Then, there is the dficulty of making preserving the status quo seem exciting. It is no accident that parties try to market themselves as a ‘vote for change’, even when they are linked firmly to the establishment. It is human nature to be dissatisfied with what we have got. I certainly would not suggest that unionists should stop worrying about the things they oppose. The proposed Irish Sea border, corruption of the legacy process, assaults on the Belfast Agreement’s three strands, the campaign to change citizenship law here— they are all important and insidious. It is not enough to look the other way. At some level, though, we have got to start telling a more positive story about what we want, rather than always talking about what we’re against.For that reason, it might be a useful exercise for unionists to think seriously about what unionism consists of in its most basic sense. What are the principles that nearly all unionists could sign up to  And,you were starting a unionist party from scratch, what would be its most fundamental aims  A ‘mission statement’you like that kind of jargon.Rather than leave the question hanging, I have had a think about the objectives that are most important to me. Quite deliberately, they are big, vague statements of principle, butyou cannot work out the essentials, then you are never going to master the details.By my thinking, the purpose of unionist parties in Northern Ireland is : • . to strengthen the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. And to maintain and consolidate Northern Ireland’s place in the UK. • . To ensure that Northern Ireland plays as full a role as possible in the social, political and economic le of thenation. • . To encourage positive relationships with our neighbours across the island of Ireland. And to make Northern Ireland a happy and prosperous home for people of all backgrounds.I know many of you would have things to add, or you might dispute the order and the emphasis, but I hope that most unionists agree broadly that these things are important. The critical point is that our leaders could do with thinking more carefully about what it is they want, then they can test their policies and strategies against how likely they are to achieve those aims. It is important too, to keep things clear and understandable. I know from experience that, when you get politically minded people in a room, it is easy to end up with a long complicated text that’s full of platitudes and buzzwords. If you cannot explain what you want clearly and simply, voters are not going to bother decoding a lot of jargon.Perhaps the statements above look too obvious, or like they go without saying. But,that is the case, why do so many people misrepresent unionism or get the basics wrong If there’s a proper effort to consistently think things through from first principles, then it will sharpen up unionists’ ideas about which issues are important, when we should be unbending and when we should show flexibility. If unionism wants to reach new people, then it needs to tell them a coherent story about what it wants and what it stands for.Alex Kane: ‘ Unionism needs a strategy because this is the endgame,’ July Jeff Dudgeon: ‘The endgame for unionists to which Alex Kane refers still has a long way to run,’ July ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Ms A is not and cannot be the natural parent of C.“Had she and Ms R taken one of the routes open to them they could have become the recognised legal parents.“By failing to do so they have lost that opportunity, at least so far as Ms A is concerned.”He found that any interference with family rights in the case was extremely limited and justied.Declining to make the declaration sought, the judge said Ms A can still cement her place in C’s le.He added: “In particular, orders can be made giving her parental responsibility and shared residence which, in the circumstances of this case, are likely to be long lasting in their effect since Mr P isn’t seeking anything more than some form of contact.”\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusGetting outFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAs reported in the Penarth Times on Thursday, the town councilsaid the results show ldquowidespread backing for changes.The survey, which attracted  responses, showed  per cent of people thought there should be more outdoor space for pedestrians and businesses.Seventy-five per cent thought parking arrangements needed to change, and  per cent said the town needs to ldquoprepare for the future.Some traders, who oppose the changes ndash specically a one-way traffic system around the town and making Windsor Road and Lower Glebe Street a traffic free zone, have said the questions in the survey were too generalised and misleading.As a result of the survey, Penarth Town Council have proposed the following changes to the original ideas:Windsor Road from Arcot Street to the roundabout as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and buses, with a mph speed limit.Lower Glebe Street as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and disabled bays. Other vehicles should not use Lower Glebe Street as a through road.Bus stops will remain as they are. There were concerns over the impact of a bus stop on Hickman Road for traders, due to air pollution, noise pollution and congestion.A two-way system to remain on Stanwell Road from the library to the traffic lights, to allow easy access to the bus stop on Rectory Road and to prevent congestion and ldquorat running through Hickman Road and Arcot Street. A two-way system to also remain from Windsor Road to Railway Terrace.The number of parking bays has also changed. There will now be  extra bays proposed, with  of them on Plassey Street.The leader of the town council, Cllr Rhiannon Birch, explained the findings and what happens next.ldquoEven before Covid-, town centres across the country were facing issues, including the need to modernise infrastructure, and the impact of online shopping, she said. ldquoThe current pandemic has added to the scale of the challenge.ldquoThe consultation shows that a clear majority recognise the need for a degree of change in the town centre, both for it to survive in the present and to thrive in future.ldquoThe results call for the establishment of a greater degree of safe space and proposals which increase a degree of pedestrianisation whilst also increasing parking spaces.ldquoThe results show substantial agreement on these aims. Reflecting this widespread and clear response, Penarth Town Council calls on our partners in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to embrace the results and recommendations.ldquoSpecically, Penarth Town Council believes that creating a safer environment through the closure of Windsor Road to traffic for part of the day, between Arcot Street and the roundabout, including the Lower Glebe Street, would be the best way to ensure that people can feel confident about shopping safely. It would allow safe use of the space in front of shops, bars, cafes and restaurants.ldquoIt also lessens the need for one-way systems on pavements for pedestrians, which are perplexing for many and hard to implement. These proposals can be achieved in a way which also increases the amount of parking spaces available.The results will now be put to the Vales Planning Committee for consultation.For more information, visit https:www.penarthtowncouncil.gov.uk news survey-results Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The government doesnrsquot appear to understand how mock exams work. They arenrsquot a set of exams which all conform to the same standards. The clue is in the name lsquomockrsquo. And some students will not have taken them by the time that schools were closed in March. So, this immediately creates the potential for massive inconsistency.ldquoSchools and colleges have spent months diligently following detailed guidance to produce centre-assessed grades only to find they might as well not have bothered. There is certainly concern about the standardisation process applied by the exam boards, but there are also good reasons for having this system in place because it ensures that this yearrsquos grades are roughly in line with those of previous years, and this is important in terms of fairness to students over time..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: A-level students can use grades in mock exams to progress to degree courses article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Officials state that the road will be open to traffic in the evenings during the week and all day on Saturday and Sunday.”He added, “It is also great to see work commencing in Laurelvale and Mullavilly with an investment of close to £,. A closure scheme in a similar manner will see the road closed from Monday  August to Friday  September between the hours of .am and .pm and access maintained for residents throughout the works phase and the roads will be open outside of construction hours.”He added, “When both sets of works are combined this represents a signicant investment locally in the constituency. The roads in question will certainly benefit from this work and in both instances the surfaces have been slowly deteriorating over time.”“Whilst there will be iniably disruption to traffic flow during the works, it will be a worthwhile scheme to ensure that the road surfaces in both locations are maintained to the standards expected and I thank Transport NI for this investment.”William Irwin MLAMr Berry said roads in the Mullavilly Road area of Laurelvale had been in a ‘dreadful state’ for a long time.He said: “I have lobbied Infrastructure NI for few years now and kept in close contact to ensure that the main street and a section of road from the bus shelter and footpaths be resurfaced. That section of road has been in dreadful state for a long time and the water gathered along the road, so drainage is key. There is also a need to look again at the current ramps as they are in over  years now and need redesigned. Obviously there is going to be traffic disruption over the next number of weeks but long term these road improvements will be great long term for the Village.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
