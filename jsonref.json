They are not directly linked to the Russian government and therefore they are plausibly deniable.\u0027Sources said the militia were briefed about Putin\u0027s plans against Ukraine back in December, long before the Russian army was told. Boris Johnson today urged NATO to act \u0027harder\u0027 against Russia to end the war \u0027faster\u0027 as he unveiled a wave of new sanctions - which include the Wagner Group.  The Wagner Group are among the targets in the latest set of measures, announced as the PM arrived in Brussels for talks with the military alliance.There are claims the notorious mercenaries have been tasked with assassinating Volodymyr Zelensky and other senior Ukrainian politicians.The new sanctions cover iniduals including billionaire oil tycoon Eugene Shvidler, founder of Tinkoff bank Oleg Tinkov, Herman Gref, and Polina Kovaleva, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov\u0027s alleged stepdaughter.Galina Danilchenko, installed by Russia as the \u0027mayor\u0027 of Melitopol has also become the first person sanctioned for \u0027collaboration with Russian forces\u0027 in Ukraine.Six more banks have also been sanctioned, according to the Foreign Office.As he arrived in Brussels, Mr Johnson said: \u0027We\u0027ve got to step up.

Meanwhile, 165 Britons died within 28 days of a positive test, climbing by a fifth in a the last seven days.And 1,979 infected people were admitted to hospitals across the UK on Sunday, the latest date figures are available for, 11 per cent higher than one week earlier.Separate data from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) today showed Covid cases jumped in all of England’s 149 local authorities in the week to March 20 for the third week in a row.The figures show the worst-hit areas are concentrated in the South West, with around 1.5 per cent of people testing positive in North Somerset, Cornwall and Isles of Scilly and Torbay.Scotland is currently treating 2,322 Covid patients, the highest figure ever recorded in the country, breaching the peak of 1,571 during the Omicron wave and 2,053 during the 2020 winter peak. But its daily admissions appear to have peaked at 223 last week, in a promising sign the outbreak is slowing down.In England, there are now 13,602 patients with the disease in hospital, which is less than half of the peak in early 2021. But figures from NHS England show more than half are not primarily unwell with the virus, suggesting the rise is a reflection of higher infection rates in the community, rather than a surge in severe disease.On the back of data showing rising admissions and infections, Dr Hopkins said the figures are ‘a reminder to us all that the pandemic is not over’.She added: ‘Hospital admissions and cases of Covid have continued to rise and we can expect to see further increases before we start to see a decline.‘Vaccination is the key to staying safe from serious illness and it’s vital that everyone gets all of their recommended doses.‘Wearing a face covering in crowded or enclosed spaces, socialising outside where possible, and always observing good hand hygiene will also help to reduce the spread of Covid.‘Anyone with symptoms or a positive tests should limit their contact with others as much as possible.’Her comments echoing pre-Freedom Day rhetoric come just one month exactly since restrictions were eased and public messaging on Covid was downgraded, with Brits encouraged to live with the virus and choose to follow protocols themselves where sensible."},{"url":null,"title":"Biden EU announce new deal natural gas Europe","story":"Share this article U.S. exporters have already shipped record volumes of LNG to Europe for three consecutive months, as prices have jumped to more than 10 times higher than a year ago.Getting more liquefied natural gas to Europe could be difficult.

Photograph: PA Proposals that would see non-Irish people forced to get an electronic visa waiver before crossing the border are not yet finalised as far as the Government is conerned, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said.Speaking following talks with Northern secretary Brandon Lewis in Dublin on Wednesday, Mr Coveney said the proposals were still in the legislative process in the UK and that Ireland would continue making representations on the issue.“I think it is important to say that this is not legislation that is finalised yet, there was a vote in the House of Commons last night but my understanding is this is likely to go back to the Lords and back to the Commons again,” he said.“What we have looked for here is an exemption for any non-Irish or British nationals who are resident in Ireland to be able to cross without having to get an ETA (Electronic Travel Authorisation), but as I say, that’s an ongoing conversation and as far as we’re concerned, that legislative process hasn’t concluded yet.”MPs at Westminster on Tuesday night voted to reinstate the requirement of a US-style visa waiver for non-Irish EU citizens crossing the Border as part of the proposed regime. The British government challenged an amendment introduced in the House of Lords, which would have exempted Northern Ireland from the legislation. Mr Coveney – who met Mr Lewis under the auspices of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference at Farmleigh House in Dublin – said on Tuesday night following the Commons’ vote that the Irish position had been “ignored”.He said that since the peace process was agreed, the relationship between North and South “has been based on uninterrupted travel opportunities and movement of people and we think that’s worth protecting”. “Northern Ireland, and the island of Ireland in terms of the relationships between North and South, is a very unusual construct and series of relationships and treaties and agreements,” he said, adding that it was “not for the first time we’ll be asking for special treatment to try to protect that relationship”. Mr Lewis said the decision to move ahead with the ETA legislation had nothing to do with reported concerns in the British government about whether Ukrainian refugees could cross into the UK. The plan had been in development for years and was “completely separate” to the Ukraine crisis, he said. The measure could affect as many as 645,000 non-Irish nationals living in the Republic - almost 13 per cent of the population, which will increase again with the arrival of Ukrainians fleeing the invasion by Russia. Sinn Féin reactionSpeaking in the Dáil, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said the proposal would create “a disgraceful situation” which undermined the Belfast Agreement and Common Travel Area. “It creates significant restrictions on freedom of movement across our island,” she said. Ms McDonald said she found it “wholly unacceptable” for a Polish person who lived and worked in Lifford, Co Donegal, would need papers to travel to Strabane, Co Tyrone, and that this was the reality “or so many people living in our Border region”. She urged the Taoiseach to intervene with British prime minister Boris Johnson and “to call this out”. Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath said the Government stood “foursquare behind the Common Travel Area and the open Border in all respects. We do not in any way support or endorse the decision that was taken in the House of Commons. We have serious concerns about the proposal for an electronic travel authorisation system. “We do not believe it is either practical or fair to seek to distinguish between EU citizens from another member state versus Irish citizens for example going over and across the Border.”The SDLP’s Lilian Seenoi-Barr, the only elected councillor in the North from a minority ethnic background, said Westminster’s Nationalities and Borders Bill will lead to more “racial profiling” and stigmatizing of minorities. “It is a racist bill,” she said. “It will strengthen the invisible hard border that already exists for non-Irish and non British citizens.”Ms Seenoi-Barr, a former asylum seeker from Kenya, added: “People like myself, who are black and brown, will be suspect communities. We will be asked to prove that we have the right to be on this island. How else can you tell if someone is Irish or British?” SDLP South Belfast MP Claire Hanna said the proposed legislation would be “hugely disruptive” for non-Irish or UK citizens living on the island, while damaging the North’s tourism industry. “This is a terrible piece of legislation overall, with a horrible approach to refugee and asylum issues,” she said, adding that it went “against the spirit” of the Common Travel Area. Troubles’ amnestyRegarding Westminster’s proposed amnesty for Troubles-era legacy crimes, mooted last year in the face of a backlash from victims groups and others, Mr Lewis said the move had not proceeded because the government wanted to consult with parties and civil society bodies in Northern Ireland. “We want to bring something forward that helps people of Northern Ireland get to the truth and get information,” he said, adding that he would not put a timeframe on that. Mr Coveney said the issue could not be forgotten “because the current status quo in terms of getting the truth and securing prosecutions and so on isn’t as it should be for many families and victims groups”. He said the Irish Government’s position was that the strictures of the Stormont House agreement on legacy cases was the agreed position. However, he added: “We also have accepted that if some want to move in a different direction, we’ll listen to those arguments and see if we can agree in places to move forward. We’re still very open to that engagement and partnership.”On comparisons drawn by British prime minister Boris Johnson between the Brexit vote and the Ukranian resistance to Russia’s invasion, Mr Coveney said Mr Johnson had clarified them and that his spokespeople had recognised “that’s not a good comparison to have in the same sentence”.A joint communique issued by the ministers after the meeting said they had discussed the development of the British-Irish relationship in the coming years, including “potential synergies” between the UK’s levelling up plan and Ireland’s National Development Plan. It noted “with regret” the developments at Stormont since it last met in December and reiterated commitments from both governments to the functioning of the political institutions established by the Belfast Agreement.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"long spells of sunshine and blue skies are coming for the weekend","story":"Soko Noritake from Japan photographs an apple blossom tree in Christchurch, Dublin.

She is even rumoured to have given birth to four children by the Russian president, though reports of any relationship between the two have always been denied by the Kremlin.As Putin commits ever greater atrocities in Ukraine, Kabaeva and her children are reportedly holed up in a Swiss chalet, facing growing demands to be extradited back to Russia.“It’s time you reunite Eva Braun with her Führer,” says a Change.org petition to the Swiss government signed by almost 64,000 people at the time of writing, comparing her to the woman who married Adolf Hitler in his Berlin bunker the day before they both took their own lives.Opponents of Putin believe Kabaeva is in hiding near Lugano, a quiet lakeside city known for its celebrated chocolate museum, though there is no proof she is even in Switzerland. Other reports place her in an underground bunker in Siberia’s Altai Mountains.Needless to say, facts about Putin’s private life are hard to pin down. One thing we do know is that the 69-year-old dictator is orced from his first wife, Lyudmila Shkrebneva, which was confirmed in 2014, six years after Kabaeva was first romantically linked with Putin.“I have a private life in which I do not permit interference,” Putin has said. “It must be respected.” He has also criticised “those who with their snotty noses and erotic fantasies prowl into other people’s lives”.This, though, has done little to quell the rumours, according to which Kabaeva continues to be Russia’s secret first lady, paid a £7.7 million salary for her job controlling a pro-Kremlin media group.Dr Elisabeth Schimpfössl, a senior lecturer at Aston University and author of Rich Russians: From Oligarchs to Bourgeoisie, says she has heard rumours that “Vladimir Putin and Alina live together in the Kremlin”. There are plenty of clues that point to a long-term relationship between the two, and to the origins of Putin’s interest in her, dating back to at least 2008 and possibly much earlier.Born in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, in 1983, Kabaeva’s father was a professional footballer and her mother played basketball for the national side, but she is said to have left her roots firmly in the past once success came her way. Kabaeva is said to have started rhythmic gymnastics at the age of five, and her parents took her to Moscow where she was taken under the wing of Irina Viner, a former Soviet-era coach.By the age of 13 she was competing for Russia, and she went on to win 14 world championship medals, 21 European championship medals and Olympic gold at the 2004 Athens Games. A doping conviction in 2001 saw her stripped of the world title she had won that year.The source who knew her when she was in her early 20s said she lived at the time in a “modest and quite Soviet” flat near the Central Moscow Hippodrome, decorated with small glass ornaments, and described her as “a sweet girl – simple, nice and friendly”. She seemed to want companionship more than anything. “I think she’d been put in that flat and it was quite new that she was living on her own, rather than living with her mother, who was pretty involved,” says the source.At the time, Kabaeva had a boyfriend, a Moscow-based policeman originally from Georgia, who “overnight became a colonel and got promoted wildly up the ranks”, says the source. “She talked to me about him and looked quite proud.”Her confidence clearly grew in line with her success as a gymnast. She became so popular that a Russian pop band recorded a song about her entitled Alina. Nor was she particularly modest about her talents. “Being a star in gymnastics is not just about skill,” she told one interviewer, “It is also about personality. Look at me. I don’t want to be rude, but everyone wants to be like Alina Kabaeva.”Dr Schimpfössl says it was through sport rather than politics that Kabaeva met Putin. Viner, who married the oligarch Alisher Usmanov, introduced them, she says. In 2001, Putin was pictured beside Kabaeva as he awarded her an Order of Friendship (a state decoration) at the Kremlin.Kabaeva’s relationship with the Georgian policeman reportedly ended in 2005 amid complaints of tabloid intrusion into her life. She is on record as saying subsequently she had met a man who “I love very much”, adding: “Sometimes you feel so happy that you even feel scared.” Described as Russia’s most flexible woman, she retired from gymnastics after 2004, but made a brief comeback in 2007, by which time her sights were firmly set on politics. It was in that year that Kabaeva was elected to the State Duma, representing the pro-Putin United Russia party.The source next saw her in 2008, by which point Kabaeva’s life appeared to have changed dramatically. The source was attending an awards ceremony in Russia, where Putin himself was present. “We had a massive formal dinner and afterwards I looked over and saw this girl in a white Grecian dress and realised, ‘Oh my God, it’s Alina,” she says.She was shocked by how much weight Kabaeva had gained, but a fellow guest told her, “Well, she’s pregnant.” He also told her Kabaeva was in a relationship with Putin.  The source witnessed no physical interaction between the gymnast and Putin that evening, but she noticed the attention Kabaeva was attracting from others: “There was a circle of people staring at her as she twirled around.” Her career had branched into modelling and hosting a television chat show called Steps to Success, and in 2014 she announced she was quitting parliament to take control of the pro-Kremlin National Media Group. In November last year, The Insider, a Russian investigative journalism website, reported she was paid an annual salary of 785 million roubles (£7.7 million), basing the figure on leaked tax records for 2018.She is reported to have been seen wearing a wedding ring and there have been claims she and Putin married in the Iversky Monastery in the Valdai hills between Moscow and St Petersburg.Rumour has it that she gave birth to a son by Putin, named Dima after one of the president’s close friends, followed by a daughter and then twins, all of whom are said to have Swiss passports. In 2015, Switzerland’s Bick tabloid reported Putin had flown to Switzerland to be with Kabaeva as she went into labour at the private Clinic Sant’Anna near Lugano, although Putin’s spokesman insisted that “information about the birth of a baby fathered by Vladimir Putin does not correspond to reality”. The twins are said to have been born in 2018, after which Kabaeva disappeared from public view for almost three years.She resurfaced last August, appearing on a state television channel to criticise Tokyo judges who deprived Russian star Dina Averina of gold in rhythmic gymnastics.In December, as tension between Russia and Ukraine ramped up, it was reported she was seen dancing at a party in Moscow’s Voskhod restaurant, not far from the Kremlin, resplendent in a glittering gold dress. The party followed an experimental rhythmic gymnastics international tournament called Divine Grace, which she herself had organised.In keeping with the status that she would command as Putin’s wife, she reportedly has a fleet of limousines at her disposal and has made visits to a Moscow café surrounded by security guards armed with machine guns.If she has indeed decamped to Switzerland lately, it is unclear how long she might remain. “Please decide whether the residence of this inidual in your country is warranted,” implores the petition to the Swiss government. “It’s time Switzerland takes action.”More from NewsWhy Joe Biden’s ‘red smudges’ may be the smartest way to prevent chemical warfareRussia-Ukraine latest news: ‘At least 300’ dead in Mariupol theatre bombingPolitics latest news: Rishi Sunak promises more cost of living supportBritish Summer Time 2022: How Chris Martin\u0026#39s great-great-grandfather ensured our clocks go forwardMan denies murdering pensioner in \u0026#39horrendous\u0026#39 home attackWatch: A haunting drive through Mariupol shows what a month of war has done to besieged cityMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"believe luck unlucky means likely pessimistic negative","story":"There is no such thing as being happy-go-lucky, a new study suggests, with those who believe in luck more likely to be unhappy.In a scientific experiment with more than 800 students at a university in Hong Kong, researchers from the University of Bath found that people who believe in the concept of luck – a random phenomenon over which they have no control – are often pessimistic and negative.Participants were asked questions such as: Some people are generally very happy. They enjoy life regardless of what is going on, getting the most out of everything. To what extent does this characterisation describe you?Iniduals who consider themselves lucky were more likely to describe themselves as happy. This, the researchers say, undermines the term happy-go-lucky.We thus find no evidence that the \u0027happy\u0027 in fact \u0027go lucky\u0027 in the sense of believing in luck. To the contrary, a belief in luck would seem to be a trait manifesting itself as an element of neuroticism and its suite of negative and maladaptive psychology traits that are linked to unhappiness, the researchers wrote.Taken together, these findings could lend support to a more accurate if less elegant aphorism that, broadly, though luck believers aren\u0027t happy those who believe themselves lucky are.Prof Edmund Thompson, of University of Bath School of Management, who led the team of international researchers, said: Those who irrationally believe in luck as an agentic phenomenon would appear to do so because they are by disposition more neurotic, pessimistic and negative.These are personality traits long associated with lower levels of life satisfaction, well-being and happiness.However, those who think they are fortunate because things have luckily turned out well for them, often by complete accident rather than purposeful design, generally believe this because they have characteristics disposing them to objectivity, logic and gratitude, personality traits found broadly to be linked to higher happiness levels.When it comes to happiness, the saying that the happy go lucky may be wrong, but the expression \u0027count your blessings\u0027 would seem to be quite right.The study has been included in the Current Psychology journal.More from NewsWatch: Inside the bombed Mariupol theatre where 300 people have lost their livesRussia-Ukraine latest news: ‘At least 300’ dead in Mariupol theatre bombingWhy Joe Biden’s ‘red smudges’ may be the smartest way to prevent chemical warfarePolitics latest news: Rishi Sunak promises more cost of living supportBritish Summer Time 2022: How Chris Martin\u0026#39s great-great-grandfather ensured our clocks go forwardMan denies murdering pensioner in \u0026#39horrendous\u0026#39 home attackMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"multi academy trusts pay record number staff 100000 year","story":"A record number of multi-academy trusts are paying staff more than £100,000 - an increase of 20 per cent in a year.While 1,875 trusts were paying at least one inidual this much in 201920, this rose to 2,245 in 202021, according to a report from the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee.This is an increase of almost 20 per cent and the highest number ever reported.Some 43 per cent of state schools in England are academies, which are publicly funded.However, the report warns that the Department for Education does not yet have a sufficient handle on excessive pay within the sector.Some academy trusts are building up large reserves. However, ministers do not have a breakdown of spending, so cannot effectively challenge academy trusts on the build-up or planned use of excessive reserves, the report said.The warning comes after an investigation by Schools Week found that 29 academy trust chiefs earned at least £200,000 between 2019 and 2020.Topping the list of highest salaries was Sir Dan Moynihan, chief executive of the Harris Federation, who reportedly earned £455,000.Dame Meg Hillier MP, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said: Parents deserve a lot more visibility and clarity over exactly what is being provided to their children, in what facilities, for the vast amounts of public money pumped into the school system.Parents and pupils have legitimate questions over the levels of pay at their schools and the conditions and facilities they\u0027re learning in.While mysterious millions disappear into the coffers of favoured trusts, the department has committed only a fraction of what is required to address potential dangers to our young people from schools in poor condition, including those where there is risk from asbestos.This unacceptable lack of transparency and accountability to parents and taxpayers must be resolved before the DfE presses ahead with plans to consolidate all of our schools into academy trust groups. The school system at least must give our children a strong start, on a level playing field that may be lacking in so many other parts of their lives.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: Trustees think very carefully about the appropriate level of pay for trust leaders and recognise the importance of being able to demonstrate value for money against rigorous performance targets.Mr Barton said it was also important that any further requirements were not unduly excessive in terms of time and bureaucracy. More from NewsWhy Joe Biden’s ‘red smudges’ may be the smartest way to prevent chemical warfareRussia-Ukraine latest news: ‘At least 300’ dead in Mariupol theatre bombingPolitics latest news: Rishi Sunak promises more cost of living supportBritish Summer Time 2022: How Chris Martin\u0026#39s great-great-grandfather ensured our clocks go forwardMan denies murdering pensioner in \u0026#39horrendous\u0026#39 home attackWatch: A haunting drive through Mariupol shows what a month of war has done to besieged cityMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"phone use driving loophole close","story":"A loophole allowing drivers to escape punishment for hand-held phone use if they are taking a photo or playing a game will be closed from Friday.New rules ban virtually all hand-held use of mobile phones on Britain\u0027s roads, in what Transport Secretary Grant Shapps described as a zero-tolerance approach.New legislation means making phone calls and texting are not the only functions banned when behind the wheel.Taking photos or videos, scrolling through playlists and playing games will also be prohibited.Anyone caught using their hand-held device while driving could face a fine of up to £1,000 as well as six points on their licence.Department for Transport figures show 17 people were killed and a further 114 were seriously injured in crashes on Britain\u0027s roads in which a driver using a mobile was a contributory factor.Drivers will still be allowed to use their phones to make contactless payments, such as at drive-thru restaurants, as long as their vehicle is stationary.They can also use their device as a sat-nav if it is secured in a cradle.Mr Shapps said: I will do everything in my power to keep road users safe, which is why I am taking a zero-tolerance approach to those who decide to risk lives by using their phone behind the wheel.I\u0027m ensuring anyone who chooses to break this vital law can face punishment for doing so, and we\u0027ll continue our efforts to ensure our roads remain among the safest in the world.The AA president Edmund King said: This is a much-needed toughening of the rules to help make our roads safer.The best thing to do is to convert your glovebox into a phone box. We all need to keep our hands on the wheel and our eyes on the road.An £800,000 Think! awareness campaign will run until the end of April.An RAC survey of 2,000 UK drivers conducted last week indicated that 43 per cent of motorists are not aware of the changes being introduced, and 45 per cent believe they will not be effective.Rod Dennis, an RAC spokesman, said: The dial really needs to be turned up when it comes to enforcement, and that means police forces having the resources and technology they need to more easily catch those drivers that continue to flout the law.Cameras that can automatically detect handheld phone use exist and are in use in other countries, so we think it\u0027s high time the UK Government evaluated this technology with a view to allowing police forces to deploy it at the earliest opportunity.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: ‘At least 300’ dead in Mariupol theatre bombingWhy Joe Biden’s ‘red smudges’ may be the smartest way to prevent chemical warfarePolitics latest news: Rishi Sunak promises more cost of living supportBritish Summer Time 2022: How Chris Martin\u0026#39s great-great-grandfather ensured our clocks go forwardMan denies murdering pensioner in \u0026#39horrendous\u0026#39 home attackWatch: A haunting drive through Mariupol shows what a month of war has done to besieged cityMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"10 mini budget graphs expose","story":" mini-Budget graphs that expose just how horrying the cost of living crisis isChancellor Rishi Sunaks Spring Statement had the usual cycle of a glossy sheen giving way to disappointment.

But what sets this one apart is the sheer scale of the crisis hitting Brits. whose disposable incomes will see the sharpest fall since records began in . The millionaire Chancellor promised to help families with skyrocketing prices through a p fuel duty cut now, and a big rise in National Insurance thresholds in July.It’s £bn of tax cuts - but analysis shows it’s a drop in the ocean, as inflation soars close to % and the tax burden still rises overall between now and . The Resolution Foundation also slammed the Chancellor for giving £ out of every £ to the wealthier half, as there’s no new increase to benefits or cash help for energy bills. With UK inflation soaring to .% - its fastest rise in  years - millions of households will be worrying about their own finances. The  cost of living crisis is hitting energy prices, fuel and the cost of food, with the governmentaposs only solution so far to offer all households a £ loan to help pay off their energy bills - which must be paid back eventually. Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement saw him announce a cut in fuel duty, although this will cost the Treasury billions without putting cash back in familiesapos pockets.

Boris Johnson said “it will continue to be tough, it will continue to be chippy, but we will get through it and we will look after people throughout”.But what do the charts from his own Treasury, watchdogs, and independent think tanks say  We’ve taken a look at  that highlight the enormity of the problems facing the economy... Inflation is rocketing to a -year high  Inflation is due to rocket to .% on average in   and could peak at nearly %. The Office for Budget Responsibility said the rise “will erode real incomes and consumption”, slashing GDP growth from a % forecast to .% this year. This graph highlights just how steeply inflation has climbedbeyond what experts thought it would hit five months ago , due to the Ukraine-Russia war. This will be the highest inflation in the history of the OBR, which was set up in .  This graph from the Office for Budget Responsibility shows the same inflation data but going back to . It shows inflation will peak above the .% it hit in  andto levels not seen since the early s. Disposable incomes will suffer the biggest drop since the s - at least  Brits’ household disposable incomes per person will fall .% in real terms in -, due to inflation outstripping wages. That is the biggest fall in a single year since records began in . And this is even after factoring in £ support for energy bills, the temporary cut in fuel duty and rise in National Insurance thresholds. The Office for Budget Responsibility said this help announced since October has offset around a third of the fall in living standards.  This Office for Budget Responsibility graph is an even starker way of portraying the same data. It shows disposable incomes only fell in real terms in nine years since the s - four of them since the Tories took power in . And the fall projected for - is by far the deepest, outstripping those in the s or the wake of the  financial crash. Wages are now £k lower than without the  crash  This shocking chart on wages from the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows the same problem in the starkest way yet. The experts warned wages are now £, lower than what they could have beenthe trend of - had continued. The financial crash of  still cases a long shadow over politics today. The national debt wasnapost cut by the Tories This chart from the Treasury explodes the myth that the Tories brought down ‘ Labour ’s debt’ from the financial crash with austerity.Net debt shot up due to the bank bailouts and other measures of , but has continued rising since and spiked again due to Covid. It is still predicted to be .% of the UK’s entire GDP in . And the cost of servicing that debt rockets as inflation rises. Since the last forecast, the cost of servicing the national debt has risen by more than £billion in - alone.  This chart shows the same data but with a longer timescale, showing how debt was more than double Britain’s GDP after the Second World War - but fell steadily as the decades rolled on. That falling of debt continued through the s and stayed low until the financial crash. It jumped, then climbed further under the Tories. Rishi Sunakaposs new apostax cutsapos do exist - but overall itaposs still a tax hike  Rishi Sunak boasted he’d become the tax-cutting Chancellor with cuts to National Insurance, fuel duty and a p income tax cut from April .But the IFS think tank has warned the tax burden will in fact be rising, not falling, overall because frozen thresholds will drag .million more people into paying income tax. In this chart, the Office for Budget Responsibility finds the Chancellor’s tax cuts barely make a dent in all the tax rises that have been announced in . The OBR found previously announced tax rises will add .% of GDP to the tax burden - already the highest in decades - by  . The freeze on fuel duty, change to National Insurance and p income tax cut in  will lower that tax burden by just .%.  This is a dferent way of looking at the same information on tax. In this chart, the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows how ‘Illusionist’ Rishi Sunak is in fact raising taxes on Brits - not cutting them. A median earner on £, will be £ worse off in   than   - a £k earner will be nearly £ worse off. Boris Johnson claimed the Chancellor had “cut taxes for working people by, I think, the biggest single amount for the last  years.” The IFS said this is technically true. But IFS Director Paul Johnson said: “He can now expect to raise more in tax as a share of national income by  than he expected last October. In fact, taxes are set to rise to their highest level as a fraction of national income since Clement Attlee was prime minister.”  This graph shows just how fast the tax burden has shot up to a record high since Covid. The OBR warns the tax burden overall will reach .% of GDP in - - the highest level since the late s. That’s up from % of GDP in -. It’s fuelled by rising National Insurance but also in frozen thresholds in income tax until .

The -year-old husband and father, a retired civil engineer, cast doubt over whether he would meet the PM, who he said did not even spare five minutes to call his family while he was jailed in Iran. Mr Ashoori was imprisoned for five years after he was arrested in Tehran while visiting his elderly mother in . He described his joy on touching down at Brize Norton on the same plane as charity worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratclfe. Appearing on Sky News’ Beth Rigby Interviews, Mr Ashoori voiced his anger over UK delays to paying its debt to Iran, and said his we Sherry Izadi did not get a response from Mr Johnson when she contacted him about her husband’s case. Mr Ashoori also told the broadcaster about a voice message he himself sent Mr Johnson, explaining: “That was during the time of the Covid that I was angry because at the same time I was blaming those who had captured us I was blaming the British government, why don’t you do anything about it ” He added: “I was really angry and that’s why I decided to send that voice message hoping that it would make a change.”  Asked about whether his we got a response, Mr Ashoori said: “No and it took Richard a hunger strike.” Richard Ratclfe, the husband of Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe, went on hunger strike twice during his we’s detention. Asked again whether his we had heard back from Mr Johnson, Mr Ashoori said: “No. Unfortunately. She made many attempts and all of them were unsuccessful.” Now Mr Johnson wants to meet them, according to Mr Ashoori. “Last night we received a letter, now he’s eager to see us. How would you interpret that ” he said on the programme. Asked how he feels about it, Mr Ashoori said: “I think that it’s a bit of opportunism involved in it at the same time as all of this has happened under his command. “So one could argue that it was the British government, the present British government, that succeeded in doing that which is correct, the same time you could say that why didn’t you contact us, my family and now you are eager to do that. “How would you expect us to absorb that  How would you expect us to think of you with this letter now  Why couldn’t this letter be sent five months ago, a year ago, two years ago  Why now ”  Askedhe will see Mr Johnson, he said: “I’m not sure.” Mr Ashoori said he “%” agreed with what Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe had said during a press conference about how she should have been released six years ago. Mr Ashoori said: “I agree with Nazanin %. She in fact put her finger on the right button by saying that. “She should have been here years agothat debt was paid. That wasn’t a ransom that was a debt that the British government owed. “It should have been paid andit was paid perhaps none of this would have happened. So yes, I feel a bit angry.” Mrs Zaghari-Ratclfe said it had taken too long for the Government to pay a £ million debt to Iran, which helped secure her release. Speaking about his time in Evin Prison, Mr Ashoori said: “Literally that was the valley of hell. “Because in addition to your own suffering you see the suffering of all the people who are around you. “Each of them in their own dferent way.

The telegenic Chancellor was praised for the generosity of the furlough scheme and his slick performances at the Covid press conferences. Sunak is now discovering that popularity can be as superficial as the images on his Instagram account. His Spring Statement did not just land badly, it belly-flopped. There was nothing extra to help people with the cost of living, an additional .million people will be dragged into poverty and workers are going to be hit with higher taxes. Those who had shares in Sunak are now trying to offload them before then reach the status of a Russian rouble. The fall in Sunak’s stock seems to have happened overnight. But the Chancellor’s downfall has been in the making ever since he stepped into Number . He was presented by his slick PR machine as a slightly nerdy guy who wears a hoodie to work, has a nice haircut and wouldn’t offend your motheryou brought him round to dinner.  He was a safe pair of hands whose grasp of detail and measured manner offered a reassuring contrast to the bumbling, chaotic style of Boris Johnson. That’s what made him an appealing prospect for many voters - especially moderate conservatives - as a potential future leader. But beneath the soft-speaking and cosy leisurewear was a Thatcherite Tory, whose privileged upbringing, private education and vast family wealth has apparently left him struggling to understand the real world.For example, the Government was today forced to admit the Chancellor had borrowed a Kia Rio from a Sainsbury’s garage employee for a staged photo of him filling up with petrol with a broad grin. Downing Street said he paid for the petrol himself. In an interview yesterday morning, Mr Sunak said the food item where he’d most notice a price increase was bread, because “we have all dferent breads in my house.” The gaffe led to him being branded “Rishi Antoinette” on Twitter.  And the same day, footage emerged of Mr Sunak apparently struggling to pay for a tiny can of Coca-Cola in a shop, because he kept trying to tap his contactless card on the bar code reader. He once in an interview described himself as a “massive Coke addict” - which he quickly claried, meant the drink. But he also revealed he was a cola snob, and prefers the formula only available by importing bottles from Mexico. He won’t touch the Diet or Zero ieties. Evidence of his expensive tastes doesn’t end there.  Photos ahead of his first budget in March  saw him pose up with a £ bluetooth coffee mug, which can be temperature controlled from an app on his phone. It’s been claimed the Chancellor’s favourite snack is a truffle-flavoured crisp made by Torres, which costs as much as £ a bag from posh department store Fortnum and Mason’s.  In pictures released before his  budget in October, the Chancellor was shown wearing £ designer flip flops made by LA brand Palm Angels and sold in Selfridge’s. And he revealed in  that he starts the day with a ride on his £, Peloton exercise bike, where he enjoys online classes hosted by Instagram-friendly New York trainer Cody Rigsby.  In December , just days after freezing public sector pay for millions of workers, the Mirror revealed he had dined with his we, Akshata Murthy, at Mayfairaposs  Hertford Street - known as Londonaposs most secretive private membersapos club. The Mirror understands Mrs Murthy - whose vast wealth reportedly puts her higher up the rich list than the Queen - planned to hold a surprise party for Mr Sunak’s th birthday at the same private club in , but Covid- restrictions got in the way. Mrs Murthy’s business interests came under the spotlight today amid questions about whether Mr Sunak’s family had benefited from interests in Russia.  Mr Sunak was forced to deny profiting from Vladimir Putin’s regime, after being asked about Mrs Murthy’s reported stake in Infosys, an IT firm founded by her billionaire father N.R. Narayana Murthy. Just last week, Mr Sunak warned businesses to “think carefully” about making investments in Russia. But unlike other ministers, Mr Sunak has resisted calls to declare his we’s shareholdings on the Register of Members’ Interests. He insists he “followed the ministerial code to the letter.”  And Mr Sunak’s decision making was called into question long before his failure to deliver help for working families in Wednesday’s mini-Budget. Analysis found his “Eat Out to Help Out” campaign failed to deliver a long-term boost to struggling restaurants and cafes, knocked sideways by the pandemic. Studies did suggest, however, that it helped to push up infections - with the scheme linked to a spike of between  and %.

Ministers attended eight meetings with testing firm Randox - twice as many as previously disclosed - but kept minutes for just two, according to the National Audit Office’s investigation. The firm and its strategic partner Qnostics Ltd were handed £. million with of contracts - % of which were awarded without competition under emergency procurement rules. The firm had former Tory MP Owen Paterson on their payroll as a consultant.And documents released last month revealed he had personally lobbied then-Health Secretary Matt Hancock for the firm - and asking him to kill news stories making claims about his involvement with the initial £m deal.Before the NAO’s report today, the government had admitted to four ministerial meetings with Randox since the start of the pandemic.  But the NAO identied a further four where the Department of Health and Social Carehad failed to record Randox’s attendance on official transparency releases. They also found documents which “indicated” one-to-one telephone calls between ministers - including Mr Hancock and former le sciences minister Lord Bethell - and representatives of Randox, including Mr Paterson.  DHSC could not confirm to the NAO whether the calls took place, or any notes from the discussions. Gareth Davies, head of the NAO, said: Even taking these exceptional circumstances into account, the documentation of the decision-making process for such large contracts was inadequate.”  Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee added: Government grasped the urgent need to increase the scale of testing early in the pandemic. But while it was fast on procurement, it was fast and loose on process. Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said: “Far from vindicating ministers from the Randox scandal, this damning report lays bare the sleaze and cover up running re at the heart of this Conservative Government. “This report shows that Steve Barclay, now No Chief of Staff, misled Parliament over the Randox papers, claiming that the NAO had access to documents when they did not. He must urgently come to Parliament and correct the record. “Ministers also breached their own transparency rules multiple times and failed to identy potential conflicts of interest relating to the first Randox contract. Had this work been done, the dodgy links between Owen Paterson, Tory ministers and Randox could have been identied at an early stage, protecting taxpayersapos money. While the body found no evidence contracts were handed out improperly, the gaps in records meant they were not able to provide positive assurance in the normal way.” The report read: “This report should not be considered as offering positive assurance over any of these contracts which are not detailed in the report or as offering any legal opinion on the use of public procurement regulations.” Despite this, Mr Hancock claimed the report had given ministers a “clean bill of health”, adding “the report found no evidence of wrongdoing because there was no wrongdoing.”The report noted Mr Hancock had used private email and WhatsApp to discuss Randox with Mr Paterson.He did not disclose all the messages to DHSC officials at the time, telling investigators he did not believe they were “substantive” discussions, and he was not required to do so under Cabinet Office rules. He later made his phone available to investigators and to the department.The report also notes the Information Commissioner is investigating the use of private correspondence channels at DHSC, but has yet to publish its report. DHSC was “unable to provide” key evidence to investigators about decision making - and because notes were not recorded in the department’s existing systems, they had to search several officials’ email accounts to find it. “The Department gave us incomplete or no documentation on other signicant aspects of the procurement,” the report reads. “Including detailed due diligence, detailed contractual negotiations leading to the first contact award, and considering of potential conflicts of interest.” Records seen by the NAO suggest officials did not think conflicts of interest rules applied to emergency direct awards. “This reflects an incorrect understanding of the relevant regulations,” the report reads. A spokesperson for Mr Hancock said: “Mr Hancock warmly welcomes this thorough report by the NAO, which confirms a total clean bill of health on Ministers’ work with Randox during the pandemic. The report found no evidence of wrongdoing because there was no wrongdoing - just lots of hard work to expand testing capacity. While the department will no doubt reflect on the technical issues that need to be addressed, the report sets out that Ministers and Officials in the Department were doing their very best to save lives in what was a quick moving and unprecedented situation. Mr Hancockaposs thoughts remain with the victims and their loved ones.  Ms Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said: “Government grasped the urgent need to increase the scale of testing early in the pandemic. But while it was fast on procurement, it was fast and loose on process. “The Randox contracts illustrate that proper transparency by government is vital. Government didn’t document decisions properly and the public is right to raise questions about whether it was playing with a straight bat. “Over % of testing contracts were awarded to ‘high priority’ companies, including those referred by ministers, MPs or Number . The public needs to trust that their taxes are spent on the basis that it’s what you know, not who you know. “As with many of the COVID response schemes, lessons must be learned about delivering at speed.” A spokesperson for Randox said: “We welcome the finding of the NAO report that there is no evidence of any impropriety in the awarding of government contracts to Randox. “This independent finding vindicates what both Randox and the Government have always said, that these contracts were awarded on merit and in keeping with government protocols and regulations at a time of acute national emergency. “During the pandemic, Randox delivered more than  million gold standard PCR tests, becoming the first laboratory in the world to process more than , tests daily. “In doing so, Randox played its part in helping save tens of thousands of lives, keeping vital sectors of the economy open and enabling essential overseas family and business travel. “The report states that four ministerial meetings took place which were, apparently, not fully documented by the DHSC. “While we cannot comment on government minuting of meetings, Randox can categorically state that the awarding of contracts was not on the agenda at any of these meetings.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON WhatsAppNational Audit OfficeLord BethellGareth DaviesOwen PatersonBoris JohnsonMeg HillierPoliticsSolar powerCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily health briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Families are facing a devastating a cost of living crisis. And the Chancellor could have helped them out, by scrapping his tax rise on jobs.He could have introduced a windfall tax on oil and gas companies to cut household energy bills. He could have finally brought forward a plan to support British business and create good jobs. That’s what a Labour Government would have delivered. But instead, years of Tory tax rises means that after today the OBR say that we will still have the highest tax burden in  years. Not only that, April will now bring the biggest fall in family incomes since records began.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section Even with the Chancellor’s cynical changes, he’s only shaving £ off every £ he’s taxing people. This simply isn’t going to cut it as inflation spirals out of control. Britain’s people needs a government on their side. Instead, we have one that wants to raise taxes and leave working people paying the price. Come April, a landlord with a large number of properties or someone who makes huge sums from buying and selling stocks and shares won’t be paying any more in tax, but their tenants will. Get the stories you want straight to your inbox.toone of the Mirroraposs newslettersWhy does the Chancellor repeatedly feel the need to raise taxes on working people, when no other major economy is doing so  Conservative governments’ failure to get our economy growing over the past  years means less revenue going into the Exchequer. And in the past two years, they have wasted taxpayers’ money – throwing it around like confetti, handing out covid loans to fraudsters which will never be repaid and wasting billions on unusable PPE. With UK inflation soaring to .% - its fastest rise in  years - millions of households will be worrying about their own finances. The  cost of living crisis is hitting energy prices, fuel and the cost of food, with the governmentaposs only solution so far to offer all households a £ loan to help pay off their energy bills - which must be paid back eventually. Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement saw him announce a cut in fuel duty, although this will cost the Treasury billions without putting cash back in familiesapos pockets. So how will the Spring Statement affect you The  huge big cost of living blows hitting you from next Friday What the fuel duty cut actually means - and whether weaposll see the dference in our pockets The Spring Statement  summaryaposs key announcements Everything you need to know about the National Insurance cut The UKaposs current inflation rate amid the Spring Statement - as Brits are left with crippling costsKeep up with live announcements from the Statement in the Mirroraposs live blogIf you need help with the cost of living crisis, weaposve put together a list of charities and schemes offering advice and grants to keep you and your family warm and fed this year. The Conservatives are the party of high taxes, because they are the party of low growth and wasteful spending. The promise of crumbs in two years’ time will be of little comfort to families struggling to pay the bills today. It is timed to suit the Tory party’s interests, not the national interest. Working families and businesses are set to endure greater hardship because of the choices Rishi Sunak has made.

The MoD has  entries in the Government Major Projects Portfolio, with “total whole-le” costs of £.billion, according to the National Audit Office. Worryingly, two of the projects are categorised as red, meaning “successful delivery of the project appears to be unachievable.Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletter “There are major issues with project definition, schedule, budget, quality and or benefits delivery, which at this stage do not appear to be manageable or resolvable.  “The project may need re-scoping and or its overall viability reassessed.” One programme rated red is the vital Crowsnest radar system to be fitted to Royal Navy Merlin helicopters protecting the aircraft carrier strike groups. It is meant to provide “organic airborne surveillance and control capability”.  The other is the £.bn Armoured Cavalry programme for  Ajax fighting vehicles. Just  have been delivered and they have given troops hearing problems. Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey said: “As NATO leaders meet to respond to Russian aggression, ministers are failing to equip our armed forces with the full kit and equipment to fight and fulfil our NATO obligations.“The Ministry of Defence is a uniquely failing department with no major programme set for delivery on time and on budget, while at least £bn has also been wasted in taxpayers’ money since .“On day one, Labour in government would get the NAO to do an across-the-board audit of MoD waste and make the MoD the first department subject to our new Office for Value of Money’s tough regime on spending decisions.” Projects in the NAO’s -page “Departmental Overview of the Ministry of Defence”, published last month, have come under fresh scrutiny amid Russia ’s war with Ukraine.Vladimir Putin ’s invasion has triggered tomorrowaposs emergency summit at NATO headquarters in Brussels, where the Prime Minister is expected to welcome new defence spending pledges by allies - and urge counterparts to go further in supporting Kyiv.But details uncovered by Labour reveal the extent to which Mr Johnson should be worried about defence procurement at home. Multibillion-pound deals are rated in one of five colour-coded categories.  According to Whitehall’s Infrastructure and Projects Authority, green means “successful delivery of the project on time, budget and quality appears highly likely and there are no major outstanding issues that at this stage appear to threaten delivery signicantly”. But that does not apply to any of the MoD’s schemes. Twelve are given the amber red rating, meaning “successful delivery of the project is in doubt, with major risks or issues apparent in a number of key areas. “Urgent action is needed to address these problems and or assess whether resolution is feasible.” Fourteen are rated amber, meaning “successful delivery appears feasible but signicant issues already exist, requiring management attention. “These appear resolvable at this stage and,addressed promptly, should not present a cost schedule overrun.” An MoD spokesman said: “Our latest available figures show the majority of MoD’s major projects are capable of being delivered on time and in budget. “We are making the largest investment in our armed forces since the end of the Cold War, with an additional £bn helping ensure they have the equipment they need to meet future threats.” It is understood the most up-to-date figures show % of the MoD’s Government Major Projects Portfolio are rated as amber or better, with problems that,addressed promptly, should not trigger extra costs or delays.

Families across the country are worried about rising food and fuel costs, soaring inflation and rocketing energy bills. A bold Chancellor would have seized this opportunity to deliver a new economic deal for the British people. Instead we got some tinkering with the tax system and a promise of more support further down the line. When families needed shelter from the economic downpour, the Chancellor offered the equivalent of raising a cocktail umbrella in the middle of a hurricane. Almost all the indicators on the economic dashboard are flashing red.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section Growth forecasts have been slashed, inflation is set to rise to a -year high and the country is set for the biggest fall in living standards since . What support Mr Sunak did provide was either too paltry to make a signicant dference, such as the cut in fuel duty, or a piece of fiscal sleight of hand. Nothing The raising of the National Insurance threshold and the promised cut in income tax will not compensate for the tax hikes coming into force next month. Overall, the tax burden is set to rise to its highest level since the Second World War. Mr Sunak’s claim to be a low-tax Chancellor is as absurd as his claim he was “standing by” families during the cost-of-living crisis. Get the stories you want straight to your inbox.toone of the Mirroraposs newslettersThere was no extra support to help people with energy bills even though they are set to increase by £, on average by this autumn. And there was nothing to help pensioners, the very low-paid and those on social security. Mr Sunak is condemning more people to poverty and more people to choose between heating and eating. Despite Conservative claims that the age of austerity is over, our public services will now receive less funding than originally announced. There will be less money for health, for schools, councils, and the armed forces. People looked to the Chancellor yesterday for help and reassurance. He delivered a financial statement that leaves only anxiety and trepidation.

A typical working-age household will see their real income fall % next year - a loss of £,, the Resolution Foundation think tank said. Absolute poverty - rather than relative poverty - is crucial because it is the measure Boris Johnson chooses to use.In  the PM controversially boasted poverty had fallen when relative poverty was up and absolute poverty was down. It comes after the Budget watchdog said soaring inflation - expected to nudge % in a four-decade high - will inflict the biggest disposable income drop since records began in the s. And today the Foundation warned poorer Brits will be hit harder as the Tory Chancellor refused to raise benefits - which will rise at less than half inflation. Meanwhile his £bn in cuts to National Insurance and fuel duty will mostly benefit people in work.Even with a p cut in income tax from , seven out of eight workers will still be paying more tax overall by , the overnight analysis found.The experts said: “The scale and distribution of the cost of living squeeze, coupled with the lack of support for low-income families, means that a further . million people are set to fall into absolute poverty next year, including , children – the first time Britain has seen such a rise outside of recessions.” With UK inflation soaring to .% - its fastest rise in  years - millions of households will be worrying about their own finances. The  cost of living crisis is hitting energy prices, fuel and the cost of food, with the governmentaposs only solution so far to offer all households a £ loan to help pay off their energy bills - which must be paid back eventually. Chancellor Rishi Sunakaposs Spring Statement saw him announce a cut in fuel duty, although this will cost the Treasury billions without putting cash back in familiesapos pockets. So how will the Spring Statement affect you The  huge big cost of living blows hitting you from next Friday What the fuel duty cut actually means - and whether weaposll see the dference in our pockets The Spring Statement  summaryaposs key announcements Everything you need to know about the National Insurance cut The UKaposs current inflation rate amid the Spring Statement - as Brits are left with crippling costsKeep up with live announcements from the Statement in the Mirroraposs live blogIf you need help with the cost of living crisis, weaposve put together a list of charities and schemes offering advice and grants to keep you and your family warm and fed this year. Despite the tax cuts yesterday, the think tank said only those earning between £, and £, will actually pay less income tax in -. And only those earning between £, and £, will pay less tax and National Insurance . Of the  million people in work, around  millionwill pay more in income tax and NI in -, the think tank said. By  earnings will be £, behind what they would have beenthey had continued growing on the pre- path.  Torsten Bell, Chief Executive of the Resolution Foundation, said: “In the face of a cost of living crisis that looks set to make this Parliament the worst on record for household incomes, the Chancellor came to the dispatch box yesterday promising support with the cost of living today, and tax cuts tomorrow. Signicant measures were announced on both counts, but the big picture is that policy does not measure up to the rhetoric. “The decision not to target support at those hardest hit by rising prices will leave low-and-middle income households painfully exposed, with . million people, including half a million children, set to fall below the poverty line this coming year. “And despite the eye-catching p cut to income tax, the reality is that the Chancellor’s tax changes mean that seven-in-eight workers will see their tax bills rise. Those tax rises mean the Chancellor is able to point to a swt fiscal consolidation and signicant headroom against his fiscal rules. “The big picture is that Rishi Sunak has prioritised rebuilding his tax-cutting credentials over supporting the low-to-middle income households who will be hardest hit from the surging cost of living, while also leaving himself fiscal flexibility in the years ahead. Whether that will be sustainable in the face of huge income falls to come remains to be seen.”  Office for Budget Responsibility watchdog chairman Richard Hughes said despite the measures announced by Rishi Sunak, people still face an unprecedented fall in living standards. He told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: So in total, they amount to about an £ billion giveaway in this spring statement coming from the Chancellor. That offsets around a third of the overall hit to living standards that people would otherwise have felt had he not taken those measures, so without the Chancellor taking action, people would have felt a % fall in their living standards in the coming  months. That reduces it down to around %, but itaposs still an unprecedented fall in peopleaposs standard of living over the next  months. Mr Hughes also said energy bills are doubling over the course of the year, rising by around % in April and another % in October.

But he said he had “always tried to be honest with people”, and said: “I can’t protect them from absolutely everything that we face.” Mr Sunak said he was “anxious” on behalf of the country and said he knew rising financial pressures were “the number one concern that people have right now”. Speaking on Beth Rigby Interviews on Sky News, he said: “Families are struggling with the rising cost of lots of things and that’s why in the spring statement I wanted to make sure that we demonstrated we were on people’s side, and we announced the tax plan that will deliver the biggest net cut taxes, net cut to personal taxes in two years, in quarter of a century taken together.” He said: “Where we can make a dference, we will, and I’m confident that the plan yesterday will do that.”  The Chancellor added: “I think what we’ve done is substantial. If you take together £ billion to help people with energy bills announced last month, the signicant tax cuts that we announced yesterday, they will all help. But of course they can’t mitigate all the dficulties that high inflation is causing. No chancellor could do that.”Earlier, Downing Street said ministers stood ready to provide further support to householdsrequired after Prime Minister Boris Johnson appeared to suggest more measures could be announced.Mr Johnson admitted it was “going to be tough” as households had to cope with rising prices and the cost-of-living squeeze. He said: “It will continue to be tough, continue to be choppy but we will get through it and we will look after people throughout.” Separately, he told LBC “as we go forward, we need to do more” and insisted the Government would “fix” the rising cost of living.Richard Hughes, chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility, said on Thursday that despite the measures announced by Mr Sunak, people still face an “unprecedented” fall in living standards.The Institute for Fiscal Studiessaid the Chancellor had failed to protect the country’s poorest households. But Mr Sunak insisted he had “protected those on the lowest incomes the most” in recent years.  Asked about figures from the Resolution Foundation think tank, which said . million Britons were set to fall below the poverty line next year, including , children, Mr Sunak told Beth Rigby Interviews: “Well, I mean, what we do know is the track record, because there’s lots of projections and speculation about the future, but the track record shows that over the last  years, since we’ve had Conservative governments in charge, the number of people living in poverty has actually declined by about . million people. “That includes , children from memory. So actually, that’s a record that I’m proud of. “Now, obviously, a lot of that happened before I was in post. But the actions I’ve taken over the past couple of years have ensured that we have protected those on the lowest incomes the most.” Told that it felt like the country was being “gaslighted” by his reassurances amid the rising costs and as inflation rose, he said: “I’m not denying for one second that inflation is dficult. Of course it’s dficult, and it’s most dficult for those on lower incomes.” The Chancellor, who has been tipped as a potential successor to the PM, also failed three times to rule out that he could launch a leadership bid in the future. He read a quote from Mr Johnson, who said in  that being prime minister “would be a great, great thing to have a crack at”,“the ball came loose from the back of the scrum”, and askedhe felt the same. Mr Sunak said: “I’m much more a cricket and football fan, so I don’t know what the appropriate analogy is. But as we’ve talked about at the moment, there’s a lot going on, there’s a big job to do and I’m fully focused on doing that job and trying to do it as well as I can.” Asked again, with a cricket analogy,he would be interested, he said: “At this point, I’m just trying to stay at the crease and keep in place and not get out.” Asked a third time, this time with a football comparison, he said: “We’re stretching these analogies too far.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyRichard HughesBoris JohnsonEnergy billsLiving standardsPrice risesPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She also watched a demonstration of traditional enamelling and gilding by hand by master artisans - all in the comfort of her own royal residence. The Queen was due to visit the Halcyon Days factory in Staffordshire in  to mark its own Platinum Jubilee of  years, but plans were put on hold when the pandemic struck.Much has changed since the outbreak of Covid-, with the Queen, , now using a walking stick, confessing to mobility problems, and usually carrying out only light duties at Windsor.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up .Last week she missed the Commonwealth Day service due to comfort issues. The extended audience on Wednesday was a rethinking of the original engagement, with the factoryaposs work and skills being brought to the Queen instead - on a minor scale. Dressed for spring in a silk floral day dress and wearing her favourite three-string pearl necklace, the Queen appeared in her element, smiling broadly as she was shown the presentation.  The intricately-decorated coffee cups and saucers and enamelled boxes were laid out on a white linen-covered table in the White Drawing Room. The Queen was said to have particularly enjoyed the visit, picking up some of the tiny enamelled boxes to inspect them. Among the items was a selection of the earliest designs - the company was founded in  just two years before the start of the Queenaposs reign.Taking a closer look at the antique pieces, the Queen held a small oval Windsor Castle trinket box with a red base, decorated with a black and white painting of the monarchaposs favourite royal residence. She also picked up a larger rectangular trinket box, edged in lavender, featuring three colour portraits of her late mother the Queen Mother as a young woman. The enamelled piece was released in  and features Samuel Warburtonaposs  triptych painting of the Queen Mother in the year she married the Queenaposs father.  The Queen Mother was an avid fan of the firmaposs creations, and first commissioned an enamel box in  of her London home Clarence House. Other members of the royal family soon followed suit, and the Queen Mother went on to issue the companyaposs first Royal Warrant in . The monarch also saw Halcyon Daysapos first-ever year box - from the Silver Jubilee of  - and viewed new Platinum Jubilee pieces which are dark blue and painted with platinum flowers of the realm.  Perched on the crook of the Queenaposs left arm was her trademark black patent Launer handbag, and she also held her walking stick as she stood to look at the display. She wore a sentimental piece of jewellery - her Flower Basket brooch - a basket of gem-studded flowers set with diamonds, sapphires, rubies and emeralds, which she was given by her parents in  to mark the birth of her first child, Prince Charles. The event was the Queenaposs first official face-to-face engagement with a number of people for more than seven weeks since her Platinum Jubilee reception at Sandringham House. She contracted Covid in February and also spent more than three months from October under doctorsapos orders to only conduct light duties. The Queen is hoping to attend the Duke of Edinburghaposs memorial service on Tuesday. Earlier today it was confirmed members of the Royal Family will attend but did not confirm the Queen would be among them. There are fears Her Majesty could miss the event in honour of her late husband of more than  years after recent bouts of bad health.

The couple were at a passing out parade of the Jamaican Defence Force, where Prince William inspected service personnel from across the Caribbean who have recently completed the Caribbean Military Academy’s Officer Training Programme.Kate looked elegant in a white lace McQueen dress with matching white heels and a hat by milliner Philip Treacy as she sat in the stands with dignitaries to watch the parade. William, who inspected the officers before joining Kate in the stands, wore the topical dress of the Blues and Royals for the event.  When the event was over, they travelled away in the same open-top Land Rover that transported Williamaposs grandparents in Jamaica on their visits to the Caribbean Island in  and . The Queen and Prince Philip also visited Jamaica in  when they travelled in another Land Rover and greeted school children.William also gave a speech at the event, where he talked about good leadership and paid a direct tribute to the Queen.He said: As Catherine and I visit Jamaica in celebration of The Queen’s Platinum Jubilee, I thought I might quote my grandmother on the subject.  In an address to the United Nations General Assembly in , she said: ‘I know of no single formula for success, but over the years I have observed that some attributes of leadership are universal, and are often about finding ways of encouraging people to combine their efforts, their talents, their insights, their enthusiasm and their inspiration, to work together.’ I think that’s a very good model to follow. William also quoted reggae legend Bob Marley in the speech when he told those at the parade that being asked to lead men and women through uncertainty and danger is daunting. He added: ‘You never know how strong you are, until being strong is your only choice.

The Commissioning Parade was comprised of  officer cadets from across the Caribbean including from Jamaica, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Guyana and St Kitts. A series of march pasts took place starting with one from The President’s Platoon, with the duke standing to attention for each one.When it was over, Kate gingerly walked up into the back of the vehicle via three red velvet steps with her husband’s help because of her heels.William then joined her and they stood holding handle bar as the vehicle slowly moved off work a motorcycle escort.As they did, the crowd was told that the pristine Land Rover was acquired by the Jamaican Defence Force in . It has just  kilometres on the clock since it was built in .After freshening up they walked to the officers’ club, Kate hanging into her hat in the gusty weather. Inside they split up to talk to several dferent groups of soldiers and their families.William chatted to a group of officers from Sandhurst who have been helping to organise the officers’ training programme for the last  months. I thought their drill was pretty good, he said. Really impressive. Among those he spoke to was Captain Matt Tiley who had worked as a groom in the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace for four years before going into the military and passing out at Sandhurst. He is now an instructor there with Marne Company. He said: It’s been such an honour to work with them. They have all been so enthusiastic. The duke clearly has fond memories of Sandhust. William told another group that they should take time to enjoy the day with their families like he did. ‘They should be very proud of you,’ he said.He and the duchess signed a visitors book before they left to change for their official departure from Jamaica . Later this afternoon William and Kate will fly on to the Bahamas, where they will stay until Saturday evening.Last night, they attended a glittering state dinner at the house of Jamaicaaposs Governor General in Kingston, where Kate dazzled in a green Jenny Packham gown and jewellery on loan from the Queen. She paired the dress with her Royal Family Order and GVCO Star - although there was no tiara. She also wore her hair in a chic updo. William, who gave a speech expressing his “profound sorrow” over the stain of slavery on Britain, also looked suave in black tie.

She and Prince William stepped off their plane after leaving Jamaica earlier today in a gorgeous custom-made Emilia Wickstead dress in aquamarine. So far, their tour has attracted ecstatic crowds as well as criticism from campaigners seeking reparations from the monarchy for slavery. The Bahamas is archipelago of  islands and islets that was the first stop in the western hemisphere for the famous explorer Christopher Columbus in . William and Kate will stay here until Saturday and have a packed schedule that includes going head to head during the Platinum Jubilee Sailing Regatta.  They will also visit a coral farm that focuses on reef restoration. The farm was awarded £million last year as one of five winners of the Duke’s inaugural Earthshot Prize. Before that they had an official meeting with the Prime Minister of the Bahamas who passed on his best wishes to The Queen. Philip Davis told William his trip to the Caribbean island was “long overdue” and said “it’s great to have you both here.” The royal couple were welcomed to the Prime Minister’s official office by Mr Davis who introduced his we Ann Marie, who told Kate “delighted to meet you”.

The couple arrived in the Bahamas after Kate wore her first recycled dress of the Caribbean tour as she and William waved goodbye to Jamaica. At the airport, Kate wore a stunning green dress, also by Emilia Wickstead, that she previously wore just last year on a visit to Wimbledon. Pinned to the dress was an incredible brooch on loan from the Queen, which shows a hummingbird - the national bird of Jamaica.The brooch was a gt to the Queen from Jamaica in  - her Golden Jubilee year.As William and Kate climbed aboard their RAF Voyager plane, they waved to the those gathered before flying on to the Bahamas.

Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Tom said: I don’t think it’s been done before, that’s for sure. It all happened because me and my climbing partner are the world’s most established or experienced roof crack climbers, and we’ve done most of the worldaposs hardest roof crack climbs.We had the pandemic and couldn’t travel, so we started hunting under bridges for the same thing.We thought they might exist between the concrete girders beneath bridges, we personally visited maybe hundreds and also had a whole Instagram and social media community looking out for them for us. We had people from all over the world looking for us.The one we settled on came from a friend who said they’d spotted something on Google maps, and another person from the area who said we should go check it out. It was just one of those on a whim vague suggestions that might work out, and it actually did.When Tom visited the site he was amazed, as he was expecting to see some sort of obstacle blocking the climb but instead he was greeted by unspoilt concrete as far as the eye could see.He continued: I was pretty certain it was something that was very very unique. I’ve looked at a lot of bridge roof cracks and I’ve never seen anything that – it’s continuous with no breaks in it, very clean line with no obstructing girders. It’s a once in a letime thing and I feel very lucky to have found it. Plus it was in Devon, so we could get to it.The Great Rt took Tom and Pete almost four whole days to complete, and during that time they never once touched the ground - sleeping on a ledge that they strung up beneath the M.The climb has been referred to as the aposEl Capapos of Bridges, referring to the iconic rock formation in Yosemite National Park, which was climbed without ropes by Alex Honnold in .Tom continued: On a bridge, the main things are that the concrete flexes and moves continually, so it’s a little bit scary because the protection youaposre placing in the crack feels less reliable, and the handholds are constantly moving size. It’s very noisy because of the M traffic, and it’s very dirty because of the dust and oil residue has washed down the crack. And you’ve got the public thinking you’re some kind of protester. They tend to call the police too, they came out and we got pulled down the first time. It took us four days to complete the climb, we slept on a portable bed underneath the M. Iaposve done it a lot, I’ve been climbing for  years. For the general population, it seems bizarre and scary, butyou’re a professional climber it’s a tool of the trade so you’re used to it. Not under the M though, that’s pretty unique. It’s a touch quieter at night. In the daytime, it is very noisy but it quietens down a bit. It’s a climb with a great deal of irony, we’re supposed to be out in the wilds and enjoying nature but there we are under the M. It feels very British, and bizarre.Lots of other things we’ve done are a bit odd so it fits in well - If you ask people in the climbing industry about us they’ll tell you we do things dferently.Tom and Pete are both professional climbers and would like to thank their sponsors Raab, Wild Country, Rhino Skin, Tendon Ropes, Unparalleled Shoes, Sterling Ropes and Patagonia.Their story features in the documentary Bridge Boys, which premieres in Reel Rock, an annual climbing film festival, on March .

The day has a long history and came about through years of dferent sorts of celebrations and traditionsMothers Day is a celebration of mums everywhere and is a great chance to show your mum what she means to you Image: Getty Images iStockphotoByBenjamin LynchTrends Writer:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar |commentsMotheraposs Day is upon us once again this weekend as families across the world gear up to celebrate everything our mums have done for us There are plenty of great Motheraposs Day gts and deals out there for people to take advantage of, including last-minute flower bouquets and bargain gts. The history of the day goes back a long way and is related to the Christian calendar, but its meaning has changed over time. The meaning can also y from person to person. For some, it is a chance to spend time with and give thanks to their mum, while for others it is a chance to honour the memory of people who have passed away. So when is Motheraposs Day, also known as Mothering Sunday  When is Motheraposs Day   Motheraposs Day  falls on Sunday, March . The term aposMotheraposs Dayapos technically means the day dedicated to the celebration of mums everywhere, whereas Mothering Sunday tended to refer to a Christian tradition that began in the th century where people would visit either the church they grew up in or were baptised.  The dates for the next few years are as follows: - March   - March   - March   - March Why does the Motheraposs Day date change   The celebration falls on the fourth Sunday in Lent and the date changes depending on Easter and the Christian calendar. Easter and Lent changes every year depending on the cycle of the moon and means that Easter Sunday can occur on any Sunday between March  and April . Motheraposs Day shouldnapost be confused with the day in the US, which always falls on the second Sunday in May. Why do we celebrate Motheraposs Day   There are ious reasons we celebrate Motheraposs Day, but it is now seen as a chance to be grateful to our mum for everything they have done for us over the years Until recently it was more commonly known as aposMothering Sundayapos. There were ancient Greek festivals that celebrated motherhood as well in honour of their god Rhea and festivals were also held by the Romans, so the tradition is nothing new. In Europe and the UK, a special service would see people ing to their aposmother churchapos during Lent.  Like with other Christian holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, the day has become more of a secular tradition and widely commercialised. In the US, abolitionist and suffragette Julia Ward Howe set up Mothers’ Friendship Day in the wake of the American Civil War in  to promote reconciliation with the mothers of Union and Confederate troops. In fact, Anna Jarvis, who pushed for the idea for Motheraposs Day to be celebrated in the US as part of the national calendar, eventually criticised the commercialisation of the day and lobbied to have it removed. Jarvis was the daughter of Ann Reeves Jarvis, who had set up work clubs for mums to come together. Anna had originally campaigned to have it as part of the national calendar and President Woodrow Wilson officially added it in .

However, she tried to use the toilet as the branch was shutting down but was left “fuming” after she was told it was store policy not to let anyone use them after the tannoy had sounded.The chain apologised to the -year-old, and insisted that she should have been allowed to use it,Teesside Live reported .Instead of letting Ms Smith use the toilet, she was forced to endure an uncomfortable hour-plus long drive home before she could finally go to the toilet. She slammed the decision as “daft” not to let her go and that she was “full of tea”.  She said: It wasnapost like we had just come off the streets, we were actually in the shop and paying customers”. After she had splashed out in the city centre restaurant she was flabbergasted that staff wouldn’t let her go to the toilet. She said: We came out the restaurant having tea and cake, so three of us said aposWe have to go as the shopaposs closingapos. “So we got up and walked towards the toilet, around  yards away on the same floor, and we saw this lad in his Hi-vis coat. As we walked towards the toilet, a couple of girls came out and then the Tannoy announcer said aposThe shopaposs closing in ten minutes, can you make your way to the checkouts.’ “But when we got to the toilet he said we couldnapost come in once they made the ten minute announcement.At the time we were so polite, but we should have said aposDonapost be so daftapos and walked past - what would he have done  But we didnapost because we are too nice. But I was fuming, absolutely fuming - and busting. To help her, her daughter tried to take her to a public convenience, only to find that it too had shut. They said it has marred what had otherwise been a “lovely” day, and when she made it home she fired off a complaint to MS. However, the national chain didn’t reply until Teeside Live raised her concerns with the high street giant. Since then ,a spokesperson for the firm claried that the toilets should always remain open to customers as long as the store is.  We were sorry to hear about Ms Smith’s experience. At MS we hold ourselves to the highest standards of customer service and our toilets are available for customers to use whenever our store is open., they added. We are contacting Ms Smith directly to apologise and our store manager would like to offer her some flowers next time she visits the store.” And Sue also claims that, days later, the firm eventually did reply - and also offered her a £ voucher. However Sue said she spoke out about her experience not for some freebie, but to point out the poor experience she had - and to make sure it doesnapost happen to anyone . If we had just come off the street and asked aposCan we use your toiletsapos, Iaposd understand itthey said we couldnapost as the shopaposs closing. That would be a bit cheeky. But we were already in there.

Courtney Webber has shared her heartbreak that little Oscar and Theo are expected to live short lives but continue to have the biggest smiles. When Oscar was bone, Courtney knew something was wrong when she noticed tremors in his head and yes.However, she was told not to worry, she demanded tests and the now-three-year-old was found he had Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease, reports Staffordshire Live.Mrs Webber was pregnant with her second son Theo at the time and invasive tests showed he also had the condition.The -year-old mum was given the agonising option to terminate the pregnancy, but she says she knew in her heart it was the right decision to keep her boy. Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease is a rare le-limiting brain condition, affecting only one in , children in the UK. It causes progressive deterioration and the boys have been given a prognosis of around  years. Mrs Webber said: Oscar has the biggest smile in the world - he just lights up the room. Heaposs created the most beautul bond with my nine-month-old. Weaposre watching them grow and flourish together. Itaposs an awful situation weaposre in, but weaposre making the best of it. Iaposve always said there are two roads that you can go down - the dark and dingy road or making the best of the situation. Itaposs how you deal with it - and I always go down the positive path. Itaposs how I am with everything. You could be anxious and stressed all the time, but we do what we can to give them the best quality of le so they can enjoy their childhood. People say Iaposm strong, but I donapost know where I get it from - I guess having children gave me that instinct. We live with this situation and have never had an able child, so weaposve not experienced that. What we know is how to care for children with disabilities. Itaposs about having the right mindset and attitude. It can feel isolating as we are dferent to everyone . We can go to a childaposs party and theyaposll be the only disabled children there. People will look and watch, which they wouldnapost do to any other child. It can be a very isolating feeling so we want to raise awareness of this condition. The boys also have a very special bond with their nanny, Maura Rivers, and sheaposs always there with help and support. The couple had been trying for a baby for three years when they found out they were expecting Oscar not long after getting married. A test at  weeks found they were on the cusp of being a high-risk pregnancy, but it was not until Oscar was born the tremours were noticed. It was not thought to be anything signicant at first, with many doctors telling the couple the same thing, but then they got a call from Birminghamaposs Childrenaposs Hospital after a genetic test - and Oscar was found to have the rare condition. It comes from the X-linked gene and is carried by the mother.If the mum has the gene, then there is a   chance the x-gene will go into the male child and they will inherit the change. Mrs Webber had no idea she was carrying the condition and has urged other parents to keep pushing for answersthey have concerns over their childaposs health. The couple then found out Theo would also be born with the condition. They had to make a devastating decision no parent should be faced with. Mrs Webber said: We were faced with the decision of do we continue with the pregnancy and we had to make it quickly. If we decided to go through with the termination, Iaposd have had to take a tablet to stop the heartbeat and the doctor would deliver the baby. I knew in my heart I had to have Theo. He had as much right to live and we knew weaposd give that baby the world and the best quality of le possible. It was also so Oscar didnapost feel isolated as someone had the same condition as him and they were in it together. Itaposs created that strong bond. I feel for parents whose children have this condition and they donapost know. Iaposd urge them to follow their instincts, as,they donapost, no-one  will. We donapost know how much time theyaposve got, but weaposre glad we know, as we can deal with it. Little Oscar walks with a frame and has a wheelchair, but no problems with talking and cognitive development. He currently has physiotherapy and water therapy to help his movement and there are adaptions around the house to help him.  His family knows his health will deteriorate over time, as will Theoaposs as he gets older, and he will not be able to walk when his muscles become stfer. He may also struggle to swallow his food and will lose basic skills, but his parents are doing all they can to give him the best chance. Mrs Webber has had to give up her job as a property manager to become a full-time carer for her children. She said: It is isolating sometimes but you try to do the best you can. Yes it is heart-breaking but where we are from  months ago is completely dferent. Our mindset is completely dferent and we can talk about it now.The family have been fund-raising so they can create special memories and days out with their sons, while helping with the cost of treatment not covered on the NHS.

Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, said the coronavirus pandemic could delay diagnosis and treatment, meaning more undetected cases.Her warning comes after provisional data revealed , cases of TB were recorded in England last year.While Dr Laura Cleghorn, of the University of Dundee warned there is a pressing need to develop new treatments for the illness which some wrongly think of as a disease of yesteryear.The bacterial infection is spread through inhaling tiny droplets from the coughs or sneezes of an infected person.Treatment for the illness has come a long way but it is still a potentially serious condition which needs to be cured using antibiotics, according to the NHS website.Have you tested positive for TB during the Covid pandemic  Let us know at webnews@mirror In , worldwide deaths due to TB ranked second only to Covid, in terms of infectious disease.Dr Harries told the BBC: It is important to remember not every persistent cough, along with fever, is Covid-.A cough that usually has mucus and lasts longer than three weeks can be caused by a range of other issues, including tuberculosis.Meanwhile, campaigners fear the pandemic and conflicts, including the war in Ukraine, have set back crucial funding to halt the spread. Todayis World Tuberculosis Day, with charity the Stop TB Partnership calling for an urgent and substantial increase of funding to fight TB in order to meet the goal of ending the disease by . Dr Lucica Ditiu, the organisationaposs executive director, said:We simply cannot continue to stand on the sidelines and watch while people around the world fall ill and die from a preventable and treatable disease.We also cannot continue to accept what we accepted for years - every year having less than % of the funding need for the TB response. Now we are facing a disastrous funding shortfall, bigger than what we had expected. We not only need to step up efforts to meet targets set at the  UNHLM on TB, but the TB response must also recover from the devastating impacts of the Covid- pandemic. The Stop TB Partnership also warned the Ukraine invasion could have devastating impacts on health services, including the war-torn nationaposs TB treatment programme. The charity is urging all countries taking Ukrainian refugees to put the correct provisions in place to treat those who need it. Last year, Ukraine treated , people with TB including , with a drug-resistant form of the illness. In Britain, a requirement for Ukrainians to take a TB test before arrival has been waived for those on the family scheme visa - though such people will get medical care and testing from GPs.

Cloisters Gulf Petrol Station in Cha, west London made headlines in October when it sold out of unleaded petrol - despite selling it for £. a litre. At that point that was double the national average price. Five months on the upmarket fuel dispensary has started shting the combustible liquid for £., p more than its price three weeks ago. The sky high price tag puts it in the running for the most expensive petrol in the UK. Do you have a petrol station near you that tops Cloisteraposs prices  Email webnews@mirror  The signicant cost of fuelling up at Cloisters was clocked the day after Rishi Sunak attempted to address the increasingly unaffordable nature of filling up a car. The Chancellor announced a p cut in fuel duty, effective as of yesterday evening. After the announcement Asda, Tesco, Sainsburyaposs and Morrisons announced that they would be lowering the cost of their petrol.UK motorists are now being forced to pay an average of £. a litre for unleaded and £. a litre for diesel. That means Cloisters is selling petrol for p more than the typical petrol station. Yesterday RAC head of policy Nicholas Lyes warned that the Chancelloraposs decision to cut fuel duty would only help consumersretailers passed on the savings. There’s also a very real risk retailers could just absorb some or all of the duty cut themselves by not lowering their prices, he said. If this proves to be the case it will be dire for drivers. It also wouldn’t be totally unexpected based on the biggest retailers not reducing their prices late last year when the oil price fell sharply. Changes in prices at the pump are linked to the price of crude oil and the dollar exchange rate. Brent crude was trading down .% on the day at . per barrel on the day - also up  per barrel on the week. Fuel prices first started rising due to high global demand as the UK began to come out of the coronavirus crisis.

Parts of some documents in the Duke of Sussex’s claim against the Home Office will be kept secret the judge ruled as he also criticised his lawyer. Shaheed Fatima QC, for the duke, took full responsibility. The Duke of Sussex is bringing a claim against the department after being told he would no longer be given the “same degree” of personal protective security when visiting from the US, despite offering to pay for it himself. The duke wants to bring his children to visit from the US, but he and his family are “unable toto his home” because it is too dangerous, a representative previously said. He is challenging the February  decision of the Executive Committee for the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures – known as Ravec – which has delegated powers from the Home Secretary.  At a preliminary hearing last month, the High Court in London heard an application by both sides for some parts of the court documents in the case to be kept private. In a judgment on Thursday, Mr Justice Swt said the bid to withhold or redact documents – including a confidential witness statement made by Harry – was allowed. The judge said: “Some of the information relied on concerns security arrangements put in place either for the claimant or for other public figures in the United Kingdom. For obvious reasons information on such matters usually remains confidential.” Mr Justice Swt said that some parts of his reasons for the decision would have to remain confidential as well. He added that editing out information from court documents would “avoid the risk that putting information into the public domain concerning security arrangements made on past occasions, and the general approach to whether andso what arrangements should be made, may impair the effectiveness of arrangements in place now, or which may be put in place in the future”. “Information about these matters would self-evidently be of interest to anyone wishing to harm a person within the scope of the security arrangements and would assist them to piece together previous practice with a view to anticipating present or future security provision,” he continued. Thursday’s ruling only covers the redaction of documents and does not decide the merits of duke’s claim against the Home Office, orit can go to a full hearing. After the judgment was made public, Mr Justice Swt criticised Harry’s legal team for breaking the embargo on the document. High Court judgments are typically provided to lawyers in the case under embargo in a draft form ahead of being made public. However, Mr Justice Swt said that a copy of Thursday’s ruling had been emailed to someone who was not a lawyer, against court rules, calling this “entirely unacceptable”. Shaheed Fatima QC, for the duke, said she and her team were unsure about whether sending the draft judgment last week was a breach, but had decided to report it to the judge on Wednesday. However, the senior judge said it was a “clear breach” and questioned why it had not been raised immediately. Mr Justice Swt continued: “It should have been obvious that what happened was a breach. At the very least, it should have been obvious that it needed to be reported to the judge, me, at as soon as possible.” “It is also unacceptable that you come without an apology to the court,” he later said.  Ms Fatima said she took full responsibility and apologised “for the fact that I didn’t think fully before the emails were sent”. At a hearing last month, Ms Fatima told the court that Harry considers the UK “is and always will be his home”. A representative for Harry previously said the duke wants to fund the security himself, rather than ask taxpayers to foot the bill. However, Robert Palmer QC, for the Home Office, previously told the court the duke’s offer of private funding was “irrelevant”. In written submissions, he said: “Personal protective security by the police is not available on a privately financed basis, and Ravec does not make decisions on the provision of such security on the basis that any financial contribution could be sought or obtained to pay for it.”Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Home OfficePrince HarryRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She was taken in by Cheddleton-based Dobermann Rescue UK after her ears had become so badly infected after the botched practice that they couldnapost be saved. The charity said it was one of the aposworst casesapos theyaposd ever seen in the country.  Dobermann Rescue UK chair Liz Price says Martha is now recovering well from her ordeal and, due to being too young to live in the charityaposs Bucknall kennels, she is currently being looked after at home by Liz before joining her new family. Liz, who has three Dobermanns of her own, said: The operation has gone really well and she is not at all fazed by it. It hasnapost slowed her down and she is recovering very well. The vet managed to save a small part of her ears and she looks like a little teddy bear now. She will go to her new aposforever homeapos on Wednesday with owners who have been on our waiting list and already have another Dobermann for her to play with. They are delighted to give her a home. Nobody wants to put a puppy through an operation and in an ideal world she would still have the ears she was born with, but it has worked out the best we could hope for. This is a very happy ending to her story. Ear cropping and tail docking is illegal in the UK and in many European countries unless it is carried out by a veterinary surgeon for medical reasons.The RSPCA recently launched a crackdown on ear cropping after recording the highest number of complaints relating to the illegal practice in  since records began in .

The pair were at a glittering state dinner at the house of Jamaicaaposs Governor-General in Kingston, where politicians and other dignitaries were invited. The black-tie event not only called on Prince William and Kate to wear some of their finest clothes, it also saw William make a landmark speech, where he addressed slavery. In the speech, William said he “strongly agreed” with his father Prince Charles’s previous declaration that Britain is forever stained by its role in the global slave trade.He said: “Slavery was abhorrent. And it should never have happened.  And knowing what an important night it would be for the couple, it seems the Queen made a supportive gesture to Kate. She loaned her some dazzling emerald and diamond jewellery to pair with his gorgeous green gown. The earrings and bracelet come from the Queenaposs Emerald Tassel Parure collection, which Her Majesty has been pictured in on several occasions.

The full set comprises earrings, a bracelet and a necklace - although Kate did not wear the necklace last night. The origins of the pieces have never been confirmed but they are thought to hail from the United Arab Emirates. Last night Kate paired the jewellery with a stunning Jenny Packham off the shoulder ruffle gown as well as her Royal Family Order and GVCO Star - although there was no tiara. Meanwhile, earlier today, William and Kate echoed the Queen and Prince Philip as they attended their final engagement in Jamaica today on day six of their Caribbean tour.The couple were at a passing out parade of the Jamaican Defence Force, where William inspected service personnel from across the Caribbean who have recently completed the Caribbean Military Academy’s Officer Training Programme. Kate looked elegant in a white lace McQueen dress with matching white heels and a hat by milliner Philip Treacy as she sat in the stands with dignitaries to watch the parade. William, who inspected the officers before joining Kate in the stands, wore the topical dress of the Blues and Royals for the event. When the event was over, they travelled away in the same open-top Land Rover that transported Williamaposs grandparents in Jamaica in . It echoed the scene when the Queen and her late husband were greeted by thousands of cheering schoolchildren on the Caribbean island  years ago as part of Her Majestyaposs Coronation tour.

The fen raft spider is making an unprecedented comeback. And while arachnophobes will be sweating at the prospect, it is positive news that an endangered species is back from the brink. It is also, thankfully, harmless to humans - and unlikely to be lurking under the sofa. An RSPB report released this week stating numbers of the semi-aquatic fen raft - which has an impressive leg span of three inches - are now into the thousands.  It is the biggest of Britainaposs  spider species. The RSPBaposs Tim Strudwick said: This is one of the UK’s rarest invertebrates, as beautul as any, and we are really proud of the part our reserve and team has played in its recovery. The females are impressive in size, but elegant and quite beautul, even to an arachnophobe .  The best chance of spotting them is in the wetland areas, such as RSPB Strumpshaw Fen in the Norfolk Broads. Tim went on to say: The spiders are only seen in the grazing marsh ditches, and are fairly shy, but they are easy to find from June to September when the mature females have their young. The fen raft spider is a striking creature with a dark body and cream stripes down the side.  It is a protected species under the Wildle and Countryside Act due to its high risk of extinction. A pioneering translocation project between conservation partners and funders - which included the RSPB, as well as the British Arachnological Society, Suffolk and Sussex Wildle Trusts, Natural England, and the Broads Authority - has helped give the species a shot in the arm. Up until  there were only three known populations in the UK, leaving the species very vulnerable and at real risk.  Two years later they were first released onto the RSPB reserve in the hopes of giving the species a chance. But itaposs taken time for a signicant impact to be felt. Nursery webs amounted to just  during the July-October  season. The recently released RSPB Ecology Report assessed the state of Britainaposs wildle, including the struggling fen raft. It showed that in  the total number of females found in the Mid Yare area of the Norfolk Broads is believed to now be in the thousands. It is now present in  one-hectare grid squares at two fens on the Norfolk Broads, the report added.

People enjoyed more sweltering weather on Thursday where the mercury once again hit C with the hottest part of the country being east Yorkshire.The high pressure system is sitting firmly over the UK and promising plenty more blue skies and sunshine for Friday and into the weekend with widespread temperatures in the high teens and reaching C. It means sun lovers are set to pack beaches up and down the country and beer gardens are likely to be bustling. Anyone looking for sun won’t need to head to southern Europe this week with it having been warmer in the UK than the Costas. But unfortunately it is to be short-lived with BBC weather predicting another cold snap around the corner.And maps from WXCharts shows lows of -C in several centimetres of snow at the end of next week in Scotland. “There are some big changes in the weather pattern on the way but not just yet,” said BBC forecaster Darren Bett. “On Thursday despite the haziness of the sunshine temperatures reached C in East Yorkshire, the warmest place in the country. It was a few degrees cooler than that in Scotland and Northern Ireland where we did see more cloud and we still have a weak weather front draped in the Northern Isles bringing some damp weather here. Otherwise it is high pressure that is dominating the weather.  With that stagnant air and no mixing we are continuing to see some poor air quality and we are going to find some high levels of air pollution again across eastern parts in particular on Friday. There is due to be a cold start to Friday before the temperatures rise as has been the case all week. Under that high pressure and clear skies we start the day on a chilly note as we have done on the past few days, said Mr Bett. Temperatures in rural areas will not be far away from freezing. There maybe a few pockets of frost and fog to start the day across Scotland and Northern Ireland but away from Northern Isles there is set to be more sunshine for Scotland and Northern Ireland on Friday. Plenty of sunshine for England and Wales.  He continued: Dry and largely sunny day and quite warm again for the time of year C maybe C for England and Wales. The high pressure is still there across the UK on Saturday. By Sunday, though, and there are set to be more clouds and the temperatures will be a few degrees cooler but still in the mid-teens. Then it is expected to get a lot colder. Into next week though and this is where we see signicant changes not least because we are going to start to see a northerly wind moving down and that will really drop the temperatures, said Mr Bett. As the high recedes early next week we have got the chance of seeing some rain and then that northerly wind arrives it will be much colder by day and also by night.” UK forecast for the next  days Staying fine and dry for most Today: Fine, dry and sunny for most and feeling warm. Cloudier for parts of Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England. Some rain developing over the Northern Isles and perhaps an isolated afternoon shower over Northern Ireland. Tonight: Dry, clear and chilly for most with some mist and haze for east and southeast England. Cloudier in far N and NW with some light rain for the Northern Isles. Saturday: Fine, sunny and feeling warm for most. Breezier in the south making it cool on some coasts. Cloudier in the north with a little rain for the Northern Isles. Outlook for Sunday to Tuesday: Areas of low cloud and patchy fog retreating to coasts on Sunday less warm across England and Wales.

And one mum is reminding everyone to take care - especially around boiling water.Salon owner Amber Bowles says she was left apostraumatisedapos after having an accident in the kitchen while rustling up roast gammon for Sunday lunch. The -year-old from Great Yarmouth in Norfolk accidentally spilt boiling water down herself while draining a pan of par-boiled potatoes and ended up aposburning offapos a tattoo. Amber says the horric accident was caused when she caught the handle of the pan on the hob grate.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here. The mum-of-one ended up pouring boiling water down her right arm as a result - accidentally getting it all over her half tattoo sleeve of a woman and a floral design.She ended up with a severe third-degree burn, with huge blisters bubbling up on a x-inch patch on her arm, causing nerve damage and aposburning offapos part of her tattoo. Amberaposs partner, -year-old salesman Zack Brown rushed her to James Paget Hospitalaposs AE department where doctors popped and scraped the blisters before applying antibacterial cream and burns dressings.Given the severity of the injury, Amber then had to visit a specialist burns hospital where was told she may need a skin graft, but luckily she healed well enough that she didnapost need one. The injury was so painful Amber found herself unable to work in her salon over Christmas - one of the busiest periods of the year for beauty treatments. Now, four months on from her ordeal back in November, Amber is urging people to be aposmore waryapos in the kitchen so they donapost go through the agonising experience she did. She said: The accident has burned the tattoo off. Iaposve got a womanaposs face and a big flower. Half her head is missing and then half of the flower and all the leaves has gone as well. The doctors didnapost think it would go that deep to take the tattoo off, they thought the tattoo would come back, but the burn went quite deep so it took all of the ink out of the skin. It went that deep it damaged all my nerve endings too. I was really traumatised by it.  Amber continued: I usually do a roast every Sunday, itaposs a meal Iaposm really good at making and something I enjoy doing. In the last year Iaposve been really trying to nail the roast dinners. I was doing roast potatoes. I peeled all the potatoes, put them in a big silver pot to boil with salt and a bit of oil before I put them in the oven. I went to pick the big pot up but the handles were too hot so I grabbed a tea towel and picked the pot up. It contained water that had been boiling for about  minutes. The tea towel then got caught and the whole of the pot went all over my right arm, hand, thumb and wrist. I just remember this excruciating pain. I donapost know how I even managed it but I managed to put the pot back down and then screamed for my partner and my mum.  I got to the tap as quickly as I could and I put it under the cold water tap. Iaposve given birth [was in labour] for  hours and that wasnapost even on par with that.It felt like my arm was on fire. As soon as I saw my arm under the cold water tap my skin was just peeling off and thataposs when I knew it was bad.My whole body went into shock and I was just screaming. Zack came down, he was just as shocked as I was. I had it under the water for  minutes and then he rushed me to hospital. Once I got to hospital thataposs when I started to get blisters, there were about eight or nine and they were big - some were the size of a £ coin. I thought it was best to leave them but they popped them and then peeled all the skin back, which was awful. It was absolutely agonising. I was there for about an hour, they were pretty quick and were really good. Amber admits that after the accident she initially didnapost cook again for a while but sheaposs now back in the kitchen and wants to urge others to be aposmore waryapos and take their time. She added: It wasnapost very nice losing my tattoo but because they thought I was going to have to have a skin graft I was trying to look at things positively. Iaposm glad itaposs taken half of my tattoo off rather than burn my face or my daughter. I couldnapost believe Iaposd done it, I still canapost. After I did it I didnapost cook for a while, I didnapost go near a hob. Now Iaposm ok but Iaposm very wary. Before I burned myself Iaposd be doing multiple things at once and rushing. Now I do not rush, I take my time and make sure my little girlaposs not there just in case. My advice to people is to be more wary when in the kitchen.Do you have a story to sell  We want to hear all about it.

The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationfound the vessel Industry beneath the waves in the Gulf of Mexico.The -foot-long ship, or what remains of it, was operated by the descendants of African enslaved people and Native Americans in one of the nationaposs oldest industries, the organisation said. Researchers found the boat at a depth of , feet. The ship was used to hunt whales across the Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico for  years.  A statement from NOAA read: It was lost when a strong storm snapped its masts and opened its hull to the sea on May , . Industry was whaling primarily for sperm whales more than  miles off the mouth of the Mississippi River. It is the only whaling ship known to have been lost in the Gulf of Mexico out of  whaling voyages from the s to the s. The crew members were reportedly picked up by another vessel, named the Elizabeth, which took them back to port.The NOAA statement continued: While the crew list for the last voyage of Industry disappeared when the ship sank, lists of crews from previous voyages describe crewmembers and officers as including Black people, Native Americans, White people and multiracial people. The brig is connected to the le of Paul Cuffe, a mariner and entrepreneur whose father was a freed slave and mother was a Wampanoag Indian.  Cuffe started whaling as a teenager and rose to become a successful ship builder, merchant, abolitionist, philanthropist, founder of an integrated public school and among the leaders of a project to settle freed Black people in a new colony in Africa. His son William was a navigator on Industry and his son-in-law, Pardon Cook, was an officer on the brig, and believed to have made the most whaling voyages of any Black person in American history. The presence of African and Native American crew members is signicant, given the widespread slavery and discrimination of both people at the time. NOAA Administrator DR Rick Spinrad said: Today we celebrate the discovery of a lost ship that will help us better understand the rich story of how people of colour succeeded as captains and crew members in the nascent American whaling industry of the early s.  The discovery reflects how African Americans and Native Americans prospered in the ocean economy despite facing discrimination and other injustices. It is also an example of how important partnerships of federal agencies and local communities are to uncovering and documenting our nationaposs maritime history. NOAA vessel Okeanos Explorer controlled a remote vehicle using a satellite link to explore the seafloor on Friday,  February. The findings have just been made public. US Deputy Secretary of Commerce Don Graves said: Black and Native American history is American history, and this critical discovery serves as an important reminder of the vast contributions Black and Native Americans have made to our country. This th century whaling ship will help us learn about the lives of the Black and Native American mariners and their communities, as well as the immense challenges they faced on land and at sea.

So, the -year-old decided to pitch the idea of the nomad lestyle, living from a van, to her fiancé, Alan, who has actually lived that way before - in a bid to see the world on a budget. The couple had been living in a small flat at the time, and managed to save enough money to buy a Mercedes Vario d minibus for £, in July , which they called aposBlue.apos  Marie said: As experienced trekkers and overall outdoor enthusiasts, we wanted a le that gave us freedom to find a place to hike, climb or kayak and just go. For someone with an adventurous background, staying indoors was a real challenge and I felt it truly impacted my well-being – both mentally and physically. I got furloughed and the lack of mental stimulation didn’t help at all. I wanted a way of le that would be more engaging than the mainstream: job, commute, flat. So, the couple packed up their things, gave up the flat and began travelling across Scotland, including the islands, in their new home Blue. But they have found themselves unable to fully satisfy their wanderlust and travel across the world so far – with the rising cost of living and fuel prices a contributing factor.  Marie continued: With fuel prices being so high at the moment, there’s more importance than having a constant adventure. Obviously the idea of being non-stop on the road is appealing, but the certainty that comes from a regular income is important. Fortunately though, the couple are still managing to save plenty of money thanks to their unique way of le. Living in the van is saving them an estimated £, a month in rent and between £- in council tax and bills. They spend £ a week on water disposal and water but are largely self-reliant – with electricity generated from solar  in the van. Despite being limited to the local area for now, the couple have still managed to turn their unusual abode into a home. Although the bus was already converted, the couple added their own touch by replacing the handles for £ and the original colour scheme for £.

She said: The previous owners of the bus already did a superb job by converting it using wood and carving details all around. We love detail and our work is more an add-on with dferent paint schemes, hardware and soft furnishings. The bus is a canvas of our lives and we are trying to craft the bus so that every corner reflects a part of our personalities and tastes. In total, they have spent £ making the vehicle feel like home and managed to keep costs low by re-using decor from their previous flat. For now, despite their lack of travel plans, the adventurous couple have no plans toto rented accommodation. Marie said: Van le makes you feel independent and more confident in yourself as it forces you to deal with breakdowns, climate and nature. You feel more engaged with your le and in a sense, more in control. It’s helped me to re-find a path and series of goals when my le hit a standstill. The positives about this way of le is a sense of freedom, which is met by daily challenges. Everything can and will break in a van, but patience, a good dose of humour and the ability to learn quickly will turn hassles into fun. It doesn’t need to be full-on straight away to be enjoyable and it can be done on a wide range of budgets. Everybody on the road has their own story and reasons to take this way of le, but I would advise anyone to start by hiring a van first for a weekend or short holiday. Get the feel for it first andyou decide to take the step, always make sure you know where your next pay check will come from. A vehicle does break more often than a house and bills can rapidly pile up. Travel slowly and take time to explore the mountains – it feels great not to feel rushed to reach the next destination.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

As the hours ticked by, the parents got increasingly worried and waited by the door for her until she eventually ed home at :am. She tried her hardest to go undetected, he said, as she quietly parked the car on the drive and opened the front door without making much noise. But of course, sheaposd been caught red-handed. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. When the couple asked her for an explanation, she answered honestly and told them that sheaposd gone over to her boyfriendaposs house after dropping her grandparents off. I told her as punishment that she is grounded for the rest of the school year and that she would not get to go to her senior prom, in spite of her already picking out a prom dress, he said. But thataposs not all. Her other punishments included: no access to the car until graduation, no iPhone, no friends, no going outside, and her prom dress will be donated. While my we agrees with most of the punishments Iaposve laid out, she does not think she should have to miss her senior prom, especially since it was cancelled last school year, he added. My least-favourite part of parenting is having to dish out consequences for undesirable behaviour, but what our daughter did crossed the line and worried us.As such, I told my we that I need to stick to my guns in every part of her punishment, but sheaposs hellbent on letting our daughter at least attend prom. He concluded his post by asking: Should we let her off of her grounding for prom, or should I stick to my word  Reddit users were quick to share their thoughts on the situation, many of which said his punishment was too harsh. One person said: Dude, [youaposre the a**hole]. Did she break the rules and acted like a complete dumba** while making you worried  Absolutely. Does it warrant a punishment  Of course, it does. Should that punishment be her missing a once-in-a-letime event that would otherwise be a fond memory sheaposd look years down the lane and will now only remember your cruel punishment  Do you really want it to be so  Punishment should fit the crime, and yours is waaaay overblown. Another agreed: One instance of breaking curfew and you go completely scorched earth. Obviously, there should be consequences but it’s not like she burnt down your house, she went to see her boyfriend. A third commented: My Dad took my prom away from me as well  I never got that experience everyone  did. Our relationship is very strained to this day. Someone  put: Soyou get a speeding ticket, are you banned from ever driving again for  infraction  If you are late to work are you fired  If you burn dinner, are you orced  This young adult will resent you for your military over the top punishment.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

There they discussed the biggest issues surrounding extra-terrestrial le, and now Nick has lted the lid - and it turns out an alien invasion will likely be a bad thing. What do you think about Nickaposs revelation  Let us know in the comments...Nick, from Calornia, spoke out during Blaze TVaposs Indistinguishable From Magic, and said: If we find aliens, or they find us, the world will change forever. With all the possibilities and all the iables, how can we know what will happen or even attempt to predict what the effects will be  As it happens, some of the deepest thinkers on the face of the planet have had detailed discussions on these very questions. Their answers may surprise you, and yet whataposs most surprising of all, is how few people know these discussions have taken place. Donapost worry, I was there.  The two meetings, held in , were called aposthe detection of extra-terrestrial le and the consequences for science and societyapos, and apostowards a scientic and societal agenda on extra-terrestrial leapos. He said one of the biggest questions asked on the day was aposhow would people react apos Nick continued: Itaposs a question that comes up again and again, relating to disclosure, and itaposs cited by many as being a reason why governments might want to cover up the truth about UIFPOs, the question is this - How would people respond   Not our political leaders, or our greatest scientists, but everyday folk - teachers, store workers, farmers, or factory workers. Would there be wonder, quiet acceptance, or might there be panic in the streets  If we discover alien le, many people think there would be mass panic -we faced an alien invasion as happens in science fiction movies such as Independence Day or War of the Worlds, clearly that would be true.  Delegates of the Royal Society suggested that an announcement that extraterrestrial le had been discovered would have little effect. Opinion polls already show that large numbers of people believe in alien le with many being certain weaposre already being visited, and further belief that our political leaders arenapost telling us everything that they know about UFOs. The bottom line is you donapost shock people by telling them something they already believe.  This is good news, the announcement of extraterrestrial le shouldnapost cause mass panic, but maybe it should - as Nick said the society also debated whether a visit from alien le would be a good thing or not. He continued: If we do find extraterrestrial le, and itaposs more than picking up a signal or finding alien microbes, will they be friendly like the lovable alien in ET, or will they be something like the aliens in Independence Day - coming here to exterminate us  Views at the Royal Society were split.

Our trying to find aliens, some believe, would be like the Aztecs seeking out the conquistadors,the cosmic phone rings, said professor Simon Conway Morris from the University of Cambridge, donapost answer. Itaposs too late of course, weaposve been a detectable civilisation for decades as our television and radio signals have leaked out into space - any civilisation capable of threatening us is already aware of us. Nick went on to quote Stephen Hawking, who wasnapost present at the meeting but was a member of the society, as saying: If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didnapost turn out well for the Native Americans.UFO Week on BLAZE commences on Monday, March , until Sunday, April , featuring new UK and Free TV premieres every single night.Indistinguishable From Magic premieres next Friday, April , at .pm on BLAZE, available on Freeview , Freesat , Sky  and Virgin Media .

Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.Jesse - who has racked up , followers on Instagram @jesse.switch.irl- said: “Being funny and sexual is something that is seriously overlooked. A kink I explore with fans involves me playing the part of a giantess.“I’m always interested in where these kinks come from and, with the giantess fantasy, it’s usually about the idea of complete surrender. She continued: They like the thrill of me looking huge and them feeling tiny, and the uncertainty of what I’ll do next. Other people like it to continue on to me crushing or eating them – having the ultimate dominance asserted. “In one video I bought a tiny figurine of a man less than an inch tall and threw it into my mouth and pretended to swallow. In other videos, fans want to be crushed by me so I’ll either stomp, stand or sit on my phone. Some people want to fantasise about being stomped or sat on, but sometimes they want to be picked up, teased, and then crushed specically between my butt cheeks or breasts. Iaposve certainly got the curves to be able to stuff a whole camera into my cleavage or my butt, so thataposs another aspect of the fantasy that Iaposm able to really bring to le.  Once, Jesse even made a video for a fan who asked her to crush everything but him, including his office, house, and gym. She then picked him up and put him in my bra, telling him I would keep him as a pet.Although some might think her work is quite extreme, Jesse says itaposs really just about being freed from responsibility and cared for, and it has given her a passion for supporting menaposs mental health. Jesse, who spends around - hours each day building connections with fans, added: “It sounds corny but I have a special connection with my fans. I have some who I never even talk about anything sexual with – one man just sends me silly dad jokes or we exchange pictures of our pets. “These are fun, kinky, romantic people, andthey can be that way with me, they can be with someone  too.

Clem Johnson, , first started sharing the pictures of his mumaposs cooking with his mates as a laugh as he found himself constantly being served bizarre dinners such as microwaved bacon, pie with cream crackers, and spaghetti with ketchup. The Liverpool season ticket holder often joked to his pals that some of the meals were unidentiable, and his friends would get involved with the banter, as one even said his dinner looked like it had been cooked in a washing machine. Clemaposs friend Owen Southwood, , was so stunned by the array of strange dishes his mate was eating that he just had to share it with the world - and posted hilarious reviews of the dishes on Twitter.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. The thread attracted more than , likes and , retweets, and Owen admitted the pie and crackers dish was among the worst heaposd ever seen. He said: He’s taking the p**s [out of the meals] with most of the pictures. I think he doesn’t mind the spaghetti and sausages but for the rest of them, he’s taking the p**s. We all just send our food in whenever we make something that looks nice, so he does the opposite. It started about two months ago with the sausages and spaghetti. His mum cooks the majority of them. Some of them caused more of a stir in the group than others.  The best-looking one is probably the curry - it looks edible and would probably taste okay. The worst one was the spaghetti with egg and bacon. We voted as a group that it was the worst meal we’d ever seen. The egg and chips weren’t even that bad really - it’s just the presentation. The pie on crackers got called worse than rations. And Clem says he lets his mum cook the dinners as he hates cooking, but he loves seeing the reaction of horried people online. He explained: Iaposve been sending them in for ages as a laugh to see their reaction. I hate cooking it’s just too much effort for five minutes to eat. I live with my mum so she cooks.  Owen said aposenoughaposs enough - it’s going on Twitterapos. All my mates have been laughing for ages. I didn’t think it’d go viral on Twitter though. The reaction onlineaposs been funny. At first, I tried to keep it anonymous but loads of people worked out it was me. I reckon chip and eggs isn’t even that bad. Pie and crackers were definitely a low. I saw that a lad donated £ to a food bank, so that’s all that matters. I don’t go hungry so all good. One of Owenaposs Twitter reviews read: Without doubt the single worst meal I have EVER seen consumed, there are starving refugees who would turn their nose up at this, the bacon was also cooked in the microwave.   While another said: This is supposed to be a fajita, the block of what looks like butter is a solid block of cheese and yes they are baked beans. .  And although Clem is in on the joke, he also took to Twitter to encourage those who laugh at his scran to do what they can to donate to food banks. He tweeted: Now youaposve all had your laugh, can I be serious  Ye my scranaposs s**t, but I’ve got something on my plate. Loads of people don’t.

Sergey Bratchuk, a spokesman for the Odesa military administration, accused the bloodthirsty colonel of ordering several devastating strikes in Mariupol, which has led to hundreds of civilian deaths. Bratchuk wrote: He ordered the bombing of a maternity hospital, childrenaposs hospital, drama theatre, and civilian homes. All who lay down their arms are guaranteed safe passage out of Mariupol.

And yet rumours of a vast private income eclipsing that of the worldaposs richest people, secret relationships and a partner hidden from view have circulated for years. Information has slowly leaked out, despite Putinaposs command to Russian media outlets that: I have a private le in which I do not permit interference. It must be respected. Here is what we known about the Russian president.  The wealth A billion mansion known as aposPutinaposs Palaceapos and a £m superyacht are believed to be highlights of his portfolio - but there are also reports he has  other homes,  planes and helicopters,  cars and a watch collection worth , The Russian president is even known to have flaunted his power through ownership of outlandish pets - including a tiger called Boris, who he released into the wild on live TV in . Speaking to the Washington Post, hedge fund manager Bill Browder estimated Putinaposs wealth was around billion USD - but his fortune is surrounded by mystery.While itaposs well-known that Putin owns several luxury properties in Russia, one particular mansion reported to belong to the Russian president has turned heads in recent weeks.The so-called aposPutinaposs Palace,apos which is thought to be worth more than  billion, was reportedly built for Putinaposs personal use.  In January nearly  photos of the lavish mansion were published by Alexei Navalnyaposs Anti-Corruption Fund, set up by the outspoken Putin critic who is now in jail. Georgy Alburov, a researcher for the Foundation, said the palace was decorated in a style similar to that youaposd expect from King Louis XIV. In , Newsweek reported the Russian president had ordered the production of a bulletproof fleet of limos in Russia, estimated to be worth  million. While Putin has no problem showing off how much money he has tied up in assets, heaposs less forthcoming about where the money came from in the first place. There have been a number of estimates about just how wealthy Putin and his family is, with one speculating he could be worth as much as up to £billion. That would make him richer than Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Ex-we  Putinaposs current relationship status is a bit of a mystery, amid speculation that he moved on very quickly after separating from his we of  years. He admitted he had a habit of leading a bacheloraposs le until it was uprooted by former air hostess Lyudmila Putina. They met in their home city of Leningrad, now St Petersburg, when a mutual friend invited Putin to see a play along with several girlfriends. Putin is said to have hidden that he worked as a KGB spy for much of their three-year courtship and they married in July . The couple had two daughters, Mariya, in April , and Yekaterina, in August , after they had moved to Germany when Putin was stationed as a Soviet spy. Working  and -hour days took its toll on his family le and in June  they announced they were separating just weeks before their th wedding anniversary. Appearing on state television after attending a ballet together, Putin admitted that rumours he and his we no longer lived together were true and she had done with her sht as Russiaaposs First Lady.In the wake of Putin’s Ukraine invasion, Katerinaaposs French holiday home in Biarritz was vandalised with the colours of the Ukrainian flag. The secret lover Over the years, Putin has been dogged by rumours of an affair, something which he has always denied.But they were compounded when political rival Alexi Navalny claimed he had wed former Olympic gymnast Alina Kabaeva in a secret ceremony.Kabaeva won a gold medal for Russia at the Athens Olympics Games in  before retiring from the sport and entering politics.Once regarded as Russiaaposs most eligible woman, the only other suitor she has been linked to by the media was a married Georgian policeman but this relationship was said to have petered out by . Rumours first linked Alina, who is  years younger than Putin, romantically to the Russian leader as long ago as  when she was a pro-Kremlin MP. Many Russians saw her as the reason for the breakup of Putin’s marriage Lyudmila and believed she had become the new Russian First Lady.  There have been frequent reports that Putin is the alleged father of up to five children with Kabaeva, who vanished completely in . One popular Russian newspaper called her the First Lady, but in the shadows. She reportedly gave birth to Putinaposs son Dmitry in , before a daughter arrived in , another alleged child in  before the birth of twin boys in . Around the time of the most recent births she was awarded the the countryaposs highest civilian medal For Merit to the Fatherland by Putin.After not being seen for two-and-a-half years, Kabaeva dramatically reappeared in public last summer to renounce Tokyo  judges after Russian star Dina Averina failed to win a gold medal in rhythmic gymnastics. The children As for Putinaposs official children, he likes to keep them away from the cameras and little is known about their lives. Eldest daughter Maria, , has a career in medical research and is an expert on dwarfism, according to reports. She is married to Dutch businessman, Jorrit Faassen, and is believed to be the mother of Putinaposs two confirmed grandchildren, who were born in  and . Meanwhile, Katerina, , goes by the family name of her maternal grandmother, Tikhonova, and is a former acrobatic dancer. She has a degree in physics and mathematic and is now spearheading a major Russian articial intelligence initiative.  Putinaposs second eldest daughter was married to Russia’s youngest billionaire, Kirill Shamalov, but they reportedly separated in . The thing is, I don’t want them to grow up like hereditary princes, I want them to grow up to be normal people, Putin told Russian TV in . If I mention ages and names, they would be identied and never left alone. One of Putin’s alleged love children was unmasked as Elizaveta Krivonogikh in November . It has been claimed that her mother Svetlana Krivonogikh, , had an affair with the strongman leader when he was head of the FSB counterintelligence service. Putinaposs alleged current partner Kabaeva, , is said to be holed up in a very private and very secure chalet in Switzerland, a source told Page Six.  The couple are thought to have had four secret children together, although there has never been any official confirmation of either their relationship or their kids. Alina has two young boys and twin girls with Putin who were born in Switzerland, the source added. The kids all have Swiss passports, and I imagine she does also. Kabaeva is now facing calls to be kicked out of Switzerland and deport her to Russia. A petition to do so has now gained more than , signatories.

Dubbed the Hwasong-, the missile is capable of hitting targets in most areas of the globe including the United States. It was the first full ICBM test by nuclear-armed North Korea since , and leader Kim Jong-Un said it was designed to demonstrate the might of its nuclear force and deter any US military moves. Edited footage released by North Korea shows Kim walking out of a warehouse alongside two military officials shortly before the missile was fired. The North Korean leader, dressed in black trousers, a black coat and black sunglasses, can be seen pointing in directions in front of him, while the footage has been slowed down to make it look like he is walking in slow motion.  The missile is being transported behind him on a road-mobile launcher. Footage then cuts to Kim and the military officials looking at their watches, all while suspenseful music is being played in the background. Kim then takes off his glasses and nods, asto give the order to launch the missile.In separate footage, dozens of military officials can be seen and heard counting down from  ahead of the missile launch, before they all shout asto give the order to fire. An official then presses a button, seemingly to launch the missile. Afterwards, many can be seen cheering and jumping for joy as they celebrate the launch. The Hwasong- is the largest liquid-fuelled missile ever launched by any country from a road-mobile launcher, analysts said. Flight data indicated the missile flew higher and longer than any of North Koreaaposs previous tests, before crashing into the sea west of Japan. Kim ordered the test because of the daily-escalating military tension in and around the Korean peninsula and the inevitability of the long-standing confrontation with the US imperialists accompanied by the danger of a nuclear war, state news agency KCNA reported.  The strategic forces of the DPRKare fully ready to thoroughly curb and contain any dangerous military attempts of the U.S. imperialists, Kim said while personally overseeing the launch, according to KCNA. The Hwasong- flew for  miles to a maximum altitude of , miles and precisely hit a target in the sea, KCNA reported. Those numbers are similar to data reported by Japan and South Korea. Unlike any of North Koreaaposs previous ICBM tests, the Hwasong- was launched directly from a transporter erector launchervehicle, photos by state media showed.  The Hwasong-aposs diameter is estimated to be between . and . metres, and its total mass, when fully fuelled, is likely somewhere between , and , kg, according to  North, a US-based programme that monitors North Korea. Its size has prompted analysts to speculate that it will be designed to carry multiple warheads and decoys to better penetrate missile defences. Since there arenapost any good targets farther away, this missile is likely about carrying more weight - in the form of multiple nuclear warheads, said Melissa Hanham, a researcher at Stanford Universityaposs Center for International Security and Cooperationin Calornia.  This makes U.S. ballistic missile defence even more dficult to achieve. U.S. officials have predicted such advancements, and last year selected Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman to compete to build a Next Generation Interceptordesigned to shoot down missiles from rogue nations such as North Korea and Iran, said Thomas Karako, the director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies . Thisgives North Korea more options, he said, noting that the longer range could also allow it to be fired at the United States using more indirect flight paths, potentially confusing defenders.

Giulia Schf is the only woman currently enrolled in the International Legion among thousands of other volunteers.The -year-old is in Kyiv fighting as a Special Forces soldier in Volodymyr Zelenskyaposs International Legion of Territorial Defence of Ukraine.Ms Schfaposs military career in Italy was cut short when she was kicked out of the Italian Air Force Academy in  after she reported alleged hazing she had suffered at the hands of eight sergeants. She made headlines two years ago when footage emerged of her being injured by colleagues in an initiation prank.  The pilot said that her head was pounded against the wing of a plane, her backside whipped and she was thrown into a swimming pool during the hazing ritual. The young woman was axed from the air force after complaining about the prank - although her military bosses claimed she was expelled for insufficient military aptitude. The day after the Russian invasion of Ukraine officially began, Ms Schf posted on Facebook that she had not seen from Europe the reaction that Ukraine deserves for the havoc wrought on them by Putin.She wrote: There is no justication for not reacting. Acting is a duty.We need to help a country that cannot defend itself, invaded by one of the worldaposs powers, among other things for ridiculous reasons... She reportedly left for Ukraine, in utmost secrecy, a few days after her Facebook post. After a few days of training Ms Schf was given her first missions, gun in hand, near the Ukrainian capital. It is currently unclear where exactly she is, largely due to security reasons, but Schf has reportedly been in touch with an Italian journalist, with whom she is said to have been friends for some years. She told the journalist: I was born for this, to help our Ukrainian brothers and to prevent the war from reaching us. She also reportedly said: I am going against the tide. While many are fleeing, I head towards the fighting areas.

Speaking to Express, Mr De Bretton-Gordon said: [Putin] is an injured lion. Heaposs lost both legs and heaposs thrashing about - so very, very dangerous at the moment I think. Heaposs absolutely underestimated his enemy, which is the worst thing a commander can do. I think he thought Ukrainians would capitulate very quickly and he thought the west wouldnapost get involved and wouldnapost be united. Secondly - his army is also just badly prepared - tanks running out of fuel, food. Not enough ammunition.  That is really terrible. Heaposs got it wrong, and itaposs very dficult to come back from that. He added: : What they arenapost doing is the basics - the basic platoon-level fighting, the integration required between infantry and tanks.  Our doctrine says that infantry and tanks must fight together. The Russians arenapost doing that - thataposs why all their tanks are being knocked out, because there is nobody to protect them. These are top of the range tanks but theyaposre being knocked out really easily.  Morale must be absolutely shocking for these people. Itaposs a whole host of things which is why I think itaposs so dangerous at the moment.Mr De Bretton-Gordon has recently published the final chapter of his book aposHow to Survive a Chemical or Biological Attackapos for free online, in order to help Ukrainian citizens understand how to keep themselves safe.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Vladimir PutinRussia Ukraine war\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Johnni DiJulius was base jumping with a large group when his parachute tore immediately after jumping off a clf. In footage captured by himself, Johnni can be seen losing control and hitting the edge of the clf moments after jumping off. As his leg bends backwards, he struggles to regain his balance and soars down the clf in an unstable manner. Johnni mutters to himself in fear, before saying: “I’ve shredded my f****** canopy. For a while, he smoothly glides in the air, but soon crashes into another part of the clf with force as his parachute gives out.He hangs on tightly to the edge and hoists himself up to recover from the traumatic ordeal.Sharing the clip on Instagram, Johnni wrote: “I was hesitant to show this, but I fortunately walked away with no injuries.“I was the last jumper on a  person party load. One of the biggest fears is a  degree turn when your parachute opens. “Things like body position, pack job or wind can cause these. “After I opened, I grabbed my toggles but didn’t turn it away in time. “When I finally fought it off the wall, I looked up and saw five of my seven cells were ripped.  “I couldn’t steer and was shocked it was still flying. “I lost too much altitude fighting off the wall, and since I couldn’t steer with a ripped canopy, I knew I wasn’t going to make it out the talus. “I hit the second clf and got hung up. At this point I knew I was not injured but wasn’t sureanyone saw me because I was the last to go. “After about an hour holding onto the side of the clf, I finally climbed down and hiked back out.”  Luckily, Johnni walked away with no injuries. The video has been viewed more than , times and has racked up more than , likes. “Damn bro, glad you’re okay,” one person commented. Another viewer wrote: “Dude glad you are ok. A scene of a horror movie. Thank God.” “Holy s***,” someone  said. One viewer commented: Damn…staying calm and collected probably saved your le. This s*** was wild.” “My boy lives to jump another day! Love ya brother,” another person added.

about what seeds to plant in the next few months.It’s a very satisfying project: dig your garden, plant some seeds, watch them germinate and nurture them into strong plants that you can harvest and eat, all in the space of a few months.These joys, though, are usually only accessible to those who have their own garden or space to grow in.That’s why Time for Change member Lix Armstrong wants to start a community food growing project in Ardrishaig, giving everyone the chance to experience the many benefits of growing their own food.The project is still in its planning stages, but will hopefully take shape in the form of allotment-style raised beds, and a shared polytunnel space to grow vegetables and fruit.Not only would this food growing project reduce greenhouse gas emissions relating to food miles, packaging and chemical fertilisers, it will also reduce food waste, as people are much more likely to eat misshapen or wonky vegetables that they’ve grown themselves.Vegetables that don’t look perfect are often left to rot in fields due to supermarket demands.In fact,  per cent of all food that is produced is wasted either on farms, in supermarkets, or in people’s homes.Not only is this a huge waste of resources, it is also a big source of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly methane.Food waste in the UK produces  million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions every year.Emissions aside, community food growing also comes with huge social benefits, such as allowing more people to access fresh fruits and vegetables, reducing their reliance on less healthy processed foods.It’s also great for both the mental and physical health of participants, as repetitive, rewarding tasks like gardening are proven to lower stress levels and help people feel connected both to the land and to the community.Gardening also provides a steady, low impact form of exercise that is more sustainable than when exercise itself is the main goal.Lix hopes that this project will link with community groups and local primary schools so that as many people as possible can share their learning and grow things together.Growing projects like Lix’s planned one in Ardrishaig could exist all over Argyll.Crucial to this project’s success, says Lix, will be the accessibility of the project to people in the area, security of land, and a willingness from the community for it to thrive as a long-term project.If you are interested in lending a hand, oryou have any skillsto contribute, Lix would love to hear from you, so send us an email at timeforchangeargyll@gmail and we will put you in touch.If you#d like to find out more about Time for Change Argyll and Bute, email timeforchangeargyll@gmail or visit the group#s Facebook page."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters another

chronotypes, have a genetic basis that controls one#s biological clock, but this can be modied by ious factors such as light exposure, age and lestyle.However, when the genetic and environmental cues are not aligned a chronic condition known as #social jetlag# may ensue.This problem is exacerbated during adolescence when chronotypes become increasingly delayed, but schools start early in the morning.This can cause sleep loss that may lead to major health and psychological problems and also affect academic performance.In a recent study scientists examined how the interaction between chronotype and school start time influenced inidual academic performance* by taking advantage of a high school system where  students had been randomly assigned to lessons in the morning , afternoonor evening .This enabled the unbiased testing of the effect of chronology and school schedules on academic performance in adolescents aged - years and - years.The results showed that among the early morning group, very few students got adequate sleep.The larksoutperformed owlsin all school subjects and this effect, which increased as students progressed through the school, was most extreme in maths.This outcome, however, was not evident in those having afternoon schooling, and the situation almost reversed in those receiving evening schooling, where students with later chronotypes performed slightly better in languages than the early chronotypes in the same group.Clearly academic performance is influenced by biological iation in daily rhythms, to an extent that has previously been underestimated.The study authors, while conceding that it is impractical to attempt to fully align school timetables to inidual chronotypes, suggest that it may be possible to, for example, progressively delay school start times during adolescence.* Goldin et al.  https:doi.org . s---."},{"url":null,"title":"craignish boat jumble sails back","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , :

NowA TV series will feature Mid Argyll as it follows seven celebrities on a pilgrimage through Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland.#Pilgrimage# follows the celebs # of dferent faiths and none # for  days as they follow in the footsteps of Saint Columba, seeking out his legacy as a key figure in early British Christianity, helping spread the faith from Ireland to Scotland and beyond.Along the way Will Bayley, Scarlett Moffat, Monty Panesar, Louisa Clein, Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen, Shazia Mirza and Nick Hewer enjoyed the hospitality of the people of Knapdale.They arrived in Achahoish on September  last year, having set off from Northern Ireland the previous day by boat.Tired and weary, the pilgrims were welcomed into South Knapdale Parish Church at Achahoish, where they met with some of the congregation and shared a meal.South Knapdale Parish Church Minister Reverend David Carruthers explained: #The programme#s producers # and the visitors # had caught wind of the fact that the church in Achahoish has been used previously by pilgrim groups passing through.#The Presbytery of Argyll#s youth workers have previously arranged pilgrim walks under the banner of the Columba Experience and the church at Achahoish was used for accommodation on two successive years.#After their meal at Achahoish, the group started to share with one another something of their backgrounds, beliefs and faiths whilst the TV cameras rolled.After three hours of fascinating chat, the locals went home and the travellers bedded down on the church floors in their sleeping bags.Next day the pilgrims headed northwards via Columba#s Cave near Ellary, where Father Simon MacKenzie of Christchurch in Lochgilphead conducted a short act of worship.The celebrity pilgrims began their journey in Donegal before travelling to Argyll. From Knapdale, they headed up the west coast, sailing to Lewis and Harris before arriving at their final destination, Iona.Covering almost , miles in the series, they visit places of worship, from pagan stones to an early Christian cave and a contemporary mosque and Sikh temple. The journey tests the pilgrims not just spiritually, but physically too.TV celeb and comedian Scarlett Moffatt, , said: #At school, I spent a lot of time just reading books and on my own and so that’s how I got into faith really. It just felt calming. There’s almost a stigma attached to sort of being religious.#Whenever I would tell my friends, they’d laugh and I’d be like, #why is that funny # I believe in God, there has to be something that started all this.#I would describe myself as Christian, but not a strict Christian. I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#. The -year-old explained: #I think pilgrimage is about clearing out your mental closet by physical exertion and by spiritual conversation with yourself or,you believe it, then conversation with your God.#I know I come across as all sort of flouncy and floppy and rather cavalier, but I am capable of existing in the real world.#However, I don’t think I’ve walked so far not wearing Cuban heels.#Pilgrimage: The Road to the Scottish Isles will be screened on BBC Two and iPlayer in the spring with three one-hour-long episodes, and is a CTVC production."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week march 11 2022","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Who am I  What am I  Where am I  How am I  – questions of identity and some of the questions I was left asking when I left a recent meeting.That meeting was part of a world-wide movement – a movement that calls the peoples of the world to pray.Similar questions of identity were raised when I was asked to write ‘a piece’ for this newspaper.

winners.Experience aside, the Inveraray side still contained five players under  and one -year-old.A competitive and hard-fought game started at a good pace with Strachur-Dunoon showing good hitting and a willingness to chase down balls.Inveraray struggled for cohesion and had to wait until the th minute to find the breakthrough, Allan MacDonald scoring with a shot from distance.This settled the visitors and in the nd minute after some hard work by Ryan Pugh, the ball broke to Ewan Donnan, who struck from the angle to find the net.No sooner had the dust settled than Inveraray found themselves three ahead when Craig Taylor found space to put the ball past Dunoon keeper Nathan Ross.The second half was a closely-fought affair with both teams playing good, clean shinty.Inveraray had to step up a few gears to keep Strachur-Dunoon at bay, bringing on Colin Campbell, John MacKenzie and Allan Cameron to ensure composure throughout the team.Good second-half performances from all the Inveraray youngsters ensured the game was safe before Inveraray#s Allan Cameron finished the scoring in the th minute.This was the first competitive match for Strachur-Dunoon, and with a number of players missing # others having not met before the game # they showed plenty of determination, which bodes well for the future.Kyles Athletic#s away tie with Kilmallie in the Mowi Premiership was a Saturday morning postponement.The Kilmallie squad had already planned to attend the funeral of club chieftain Hugh #Shep# MacIntyre ahead of the game as the club paid their respects to one of their stalwarts.In Mowi South Division One, Kyles Athletic juniors drew -

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom. Expect the inevitable April showers but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn.It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors.

This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

We believe we must take positive action now to tackle these and other challenges by helping schools to work more effectively together.#By making these changes, we believe we will protect our schools, enhance the education of our pupils and build a stronger team of educators.#But this view is challenged by parent councils across the region # and they also question the process.The council is consulting on a #proposal in principle#, and this worries parent councils representing schools in Mid Argyll and Kintyre.In a joint statement they said: #Parents and communities need to be clear that the proposal in principle does not carry any technical detail. This will only be worked out once the decision has been made to progress the model # all subject to change.#Not only can [the education authority] give us no evidence of this model working but it has not provided us with any risk assessments or proof that this will do no harm.#To make valid feedback we have to hear both sides of the story.#The statement added that when the plan was first presented to the council#s community services committee in June , it was already clear that parents opposed school clusters.#It is extraordinary that the education authority has now spent time and money using a marketing company to #sell# the same model to parents rather than thinking it worthwhile to engage parents with possible alternative models for discussion,# the statement continued.Mid Argyll councillor Dougie Philand endorsed those concerns, saying: #I believe the authority needs to listen to our communities who are clearly saying this proposal is one they do not support.#Fiona Hoad, chair of Ardrishaig Primary School Parent Council, said: #Trying to distil this down has been a process and a half.

Also standing by was the steamer Brora, which was bund for Belfast.The conditions were so bad from the point of view of visibility that the leboat had to receive bearings from the Brora and other ships by means of the Aldis signal lamps while ships’ searchlights assisted them in getting into position. For a time the ships could only see each other on the radar screen.Coxswain Duncan Newlands, who knows this dreaded part of the estuary like the back of his hand, edged his leboat in astern of the coaster and proceeded to begin operations, but at .am came this dramatic message over the leboat’s radio: ‘Arrived alongside casualty at .hours got rope aboard and commenced towing at . hours.‘Rope now parted.

Baby young cod are not caught in prawn creels. The scientists at the Rural Affairs Committee meeting on March  said that there was zero evidence for creels to be included in the ban, and that the previous evidence cited on the Scottish Government website had now been removed.Our MSP represented to the creel fishermen in Campbeltown that she would:.    Seek a relaxation of the ban to enable the creel fishermen to continue to work as per the scientic evidence advice..    Seek compensation for the creel fishermen for almost three months loss of income.However, in the event she VOTED.    To keep the ban in place.    Against compensation.This is absolutely duplicitous.

This confirms that the timber has been grown in sustainable forests where young trees are replanted to replace the mature trees as they’re harvested.This is particularly important with hardwoods – unfortunately, there are still foreign governments who allow their rainforests to be cleared without replacing the trees that are so important for our global environment.Being a natural, organic material, part of the beauty of timber is seeing it mature. It will absorb water when it rains and dry out when the sun shines and the fibres of the timber will change, expanding and contracting as moisture levels y.Customers often worry when they see this movement but it is natural and what you’re seeing is simply part of the ageing process that all living organisms undergo. If it doesn’t affect the structural integrity of your furniture, there’s no cause for concern!The lespan of timber furniture ies greatly. Some pine benches may last a few years whilst a good teak piece can last in excess of  years. As with all furniture, much will depend on how you care for it, ensuring it doesn’t sit for prolonged periods in water, protecting it from the worst of the elements, especially over winter.Treating wooden furniture is often an aesthetic choice, whilst many customers prefer to see the timber mature naturally.Metal FurnitureAmongst the most common metals used in garden furniture are cast iron, stainless steel and aluminium. Whilst each metal may y in quality , you’ll generally find that cast iron is cheapest, with aluminium the most expensive.Cast iron tends to be very heavy and has a ‘chunky’ look, reminiscent of lovely old-fashioned garden furniture. Its weight makes it very stable in the garden but it does require maintenance to prevent corrosion as that could eventually weaken the structure.Stainless steel is lighter than cast iron and is valued for its strength, robustness, durability and resistance to corrosion. It’s often used as the frame of the furniture rather than the finished, outer coat.Although generally the most expensive, aluminium is an ideal metal for garden furniture. Lightweight, strong, robust and long-lasting, it withstands the elements well and requires minimal maintenance.Rattan or wicker FurnitureSynthetic rattan or wicker has overtaken the use of their natural equivalents because they are longer-lasting, easier to maintain and available in a wide range of colours, textures and shapes.There’s an enormous iation in quality and price but a quick look at the warranty is usually a good initial indication of what you’re being offered.Another factor affecting the price of rattan furniture is the size and shape of the weave.There are three main profiles – flat, half-round and round – with the flat generally being cheapest and the round being dearest.Depending on the look you want, the half-round and round profile will offer texture and depth to your furniture, whilst the flat weave offers a smoother, more even surface.Rattan can fade and deteriorate from the UV rays in the sunlight and the UV warranty of the product is also an important indication of quality.WarrantyNow you’ve chosen your perfect furniture, take a moment to check how the manufacturer recommends you care for your furniture – it is an investment and certainly worth taking care of!Remember that furniture can be made from a combination of materials and each component – for example, the frame and cushions – are likely to have dferent warranties.Finally…In this column we’re only able to offer a quick overview of some of the things to look for when choosing your garden furniture, but staff in reputable garden centres will be able to advise you in more detail and help you choose the best solution for you and your family.The internet is a handy way to start considering your options and indeed you’re very welcome to have a preview of our garden furniture online at merryhattonHowever, we strongly recommend that you always see the products in-store to get a feel for the comfort and quality before buying.That’s the best way to make an informed choice – and avoid an expensive mistake!More information is available at merryhatton"},{"url":null,"title":"tesco-clubcard-holders-can-claim-mothers-day-treat","story":"In perfect time for Mothers Day, Tesco has shared how customers and users of the Clubcard Reward Partners can get exclusive discounts to a range of exciting activities. From visiting historic grounds to a relaxing spa getaway and even discounts on loads of great products. Soyoure a holder of the Tesco Clubcard then you are in luck as you could treat your loved one and save money too. \" alt\"East Lothian Courier: Mothers Day is March . \" class\"editor-image\"Mothers Day is March .If you or someone you love are a history buff then you can use your rewards card to save money on some days at iconic English Heritage locations. From Hadrians Wall, Stonehenge, or the medieval Dover Castle to name just a few.Plus even better shoppers can get one complimentary adult entry with one full paying adult when booking online and entering the promotion code at checkout, as well as saving % in the on-site café.And theres no need to worryyou cant decide which great site to visit, instead, you exchange your Clubcard vouchers for an English Heritage annual membership.The pass offers you unlimited access to castles, gardens, historic houses, abbeys, and more for the rest of the year, with a £ savingIf you rather have a relaxing day then Tesco has that covered with vouchers offered with SpaSeekers. At SpaSeekers you can choose from one of their many locations across the country and enjoy great food, gorgeous setting, pampering, and more. You can even buy some extra treats for yourself too, with the reward points, from at-home cocktail kits or some luxury jewellery from Goldsmiths. The choices are endless with the Tesco Clubcard and its a great way to save some hard-earned money."},{"url":null,"title":"brunton-country-music-orchestra","story":"An afternoon with Royal Scottish National Orchestra is a treat for mums this Sunday, March , at pm.After a three year break, the orchestra s to The Brunton with one of the greatest of all symphonies, Tchaikovskys th, with its fate theme surrounded by rich music.

For me, it’s not just about doing something on the issue of climate change, important as that is. It’s also about extending and caring for a wood, which for me is a sacred place.Butterdean isn’t actually a remnant of ancient woodland, but parts of it have that atmosphere. It’s a planted wood but has been in existence for hundreds of years. There are references to it from the th century and earlier.It has changed over this time because parts of it have been felled and replanted, and some of the trees look like they have been coppiced. It has clearly been a woodland resource for many centuries.Its survival in itself is part of its remarkable story, of which I have previously written. But the dferent phases of management of the wood have left it with a fascinating character. Dferent parts of Butterdean Wood have dferent types of trees and atmosphere.In some areas, native deciduous trees dominate, such as silver birch, oak, hazel, ash and rowan. In others, there is a preponderance of tall non-native coners, although all over the wood there are also some wonderful examples of native Scots pine. There are also many towering beech trees, the queen of the forest. The undergrowth is lush in the deciduous sections, while the tall coners create a forest floor perfect for kids to play. I’ve met people in the wood who are lost, as there are around km of pathways crisscrossing each other.One of the special features of the wood are the old trees which can be discovered everywhere. It’s asthey had been forgotten or overlooked when their siblings were felled, or have grown quietly and unnoticed by the tree-fellers and somehow survived. We have our favourite old oak tree, for example, hidden in a corner of the wood, and the beech which still has been our umbrella for family picnics since my grown-up kids were toddlers. And now, with the careful management of the Woodland Trust, the wood is regenerating itself into an increasingly important native natural habitat.In this week’s sunny weather and lighter evenings, we were all finally able to have a weekday afternoon walk, a perfect way to unwind after a day in school. It was actually warm, with rays of sunshine streaming through the still-leafless but budding branches of the trees spring has well and truly arrived. I love such days, relish such moments in a wood.I have been called a tree hugger by some, and it is a label I accept and take as a compliment. The term may have its origins in India. In , the ruler of the Jodhpur area wanted to build a new palace, so he sent his soldiers to cut down the forest which was close to a village named Khejarli.The villagers regarded the forest as sacred because of their Bishnoi faith, but also because of what the forest gave them. They defended the trees by literally hugging them. The protest was initially led by a local woman called Amrita Devi, but hundreds of poor villagers were part of the tree-hugging protest.It was an act of incredible bravery, for Amrita, as well as  fellow villagers, were brutally killed as they hugged the trees, trying to protect them. Three of Amrita’s daughters were among the martyrs.This protest became the inspiration for the later Chipko movement in the s, when women in Uttar Pradesh likewise hugged trees to protect them from felling Chipko means ‘to embrace’.So I am proud to call myself a tree hugger, although I fear I would not have the courage or dedication to protect my sacred trees in the way Amrita and her fellow villagers did. Yet many of those currently protesting the destruction of forests and woodland all over the world, and indeed much closer to home, often have their spirit. We need many more modern-day tree huggers.But all we need to do on Saturday is head off regardless of the weather, be prepared to get a bit muddy and help plant some native trees. In doing so, we honour the dedication of those early tree huggers, in our own way, and make a dference. If you want to be part of the tree planting, please book by emailing kirstyduncan@woodlandtrust.org.ukIt will likely be busy, so please park at Alba Trees nursery rather than the usual car park.

That ideological dream was never going to be realised due to the fact that engineers may be capable of looking  years ahead, but investors look for much faster s and politicians only look as far as the next election. The result has been  years during which there has been no national energy plan.Recent events have brought this situation into sharp focus and to kick-start some strategic thinking in Scotland I would make an urgent plea for the SNP Government to realise that its perfectly reasonable opposition to nuclear weapons does not need to be accompanied by stubborn opposition to nuclear generation of electricity.

I wonderthe research breaks down whether such uninformed tenants are all from the pre-December  era, before the Scottish Government’s Private Residential Tenancy Agreementswere introduced. Surely they could not be from the current PRTA era given the wealth of information with which they are deluged before a new tenancy is set up.A typical PRTA extends to some  pages, with a couple of helpful introductory pages entitled \"Know your rights\", followed by a useful index to the PRTA’s three sections, Section  being an essential Glossary of Terms and Interpretation without which the hapless parties to the agreement will not be able to understand the  clauses which comprise Section . Wading through all that eventually brings the weary parties to about page , the remaining -odd pages comprising “Easy Read Notes for the Scottish Government Model Private Residential Tenancy Agreement”, the Easy Read Notes being so easy to read that they also start with a definition of \"Agreement\" to mean \"the tenancy agreement for the property which is being leased\".The tenant must of course be given a full copy of the PRTA in prescribed form, with all its attendant notes, so one wonders why any tenant in the PRTA era could possibly be unaware of their rights. Could it just be that swamping a tenant with such information overload is a sure-fire way to guarantee that only the most diligent prospective tenant with a penchant for perusing y legal documents will ever actually read the stuff  Sometimes less is indeed more.Campbell Fullarton, Kilmarnock.MYRA AND ME  PERISH THE THOUGHTDOUG Marrsays that his last passport photo \"bore a startling resemblance to a th century serial killer\".

The day is open to all ages and sexes, so please bring your kids along also.”Previously, Orkney enjoyed success in the North of Scotland Cricket Association.Mr Rae continues: “If we can get back to that level, it’d be a huge bonus.

After Easter — from April  — we will stop recommending that people who don’t have symptoms, should test for COVID.“This change will apply across the population — including in most workplaces and in early years centres, schools, universities and colleges.“Then, at the end of April, routine testing will end — even for people who have symptoms.“At that time, physical test sites will close — although some mobile testing units and capacity will be retained for possible future use. Contact tracing will also end.“Free testing will not generally be available to the wider population. Instead, our advice will be thatyou have symptoms of COVID — or indeed symptoms of the flu, or any other infectious illness — you should stay at home in order to aid your recovery.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The identity of a person could undoubtedly be forged by the place of their birth and the community of that place, particularly at a time in the past when populations were less mobile.The traits of a person’s parents manest in their physical appearance their spirit, likes and dislikes, and sometimes even interests or inclinations might appear hereditary – not just from mother and father but perhaps from an ancestor remembered only by name and special characteristic, like poesy or craft skill..The failure by clan chiefs and other landed gentry to recognise this customary right held by the people since time immemorial underpins the Clearances, while demands for its recognition echo through much of the collective action undertaken against this violence, trauma, and dispossession. as far back in history as I can.The world and society these people lived in was so dferent to ours today, making context crucial to understanding the words being used and the philosophy from which they derive.Aside from the multitude which are in still in use today, there are published proverb collections as well as countless sound recordings, many digitized and made easily accessible by Tobar an Dualchais.By their nature proverbs cut across boundaries of class and gender, their survival relying upon oral transmission, on being commonly known in a community and thus reflecting its values.

The Minister announced that a more targeted approach to testing will be introduced on a phased basis from next month, with the focus on supporting and protecting those at highest risk of serious illness. Testing will continue to be available for those eligible for COVID- treatments. Under the new policy, PCR testing will cease for most people with symptoms from  April - however free lateral flow tests will continue to be available to the public to use should they develop symptoms of COVID-. Lateral flow tests will also continue to be available free of charge to support those living in, working in or visiting a higher risk setting such as a care home until the end of June, with further review then. The policy covers testing and contact tracing and takes effect from  April. No changes will be introduced until that date. The policy will be kept under review during the period of transition up until the end of June. The Health Minister stated: “The new policy reflects the new realities of the pandemic. While the prevalence of the virus remains at a high level, the risk of serious illness has been signicantly reduced - thanks in no small measure to our vaccination programme and the use of innovative COVID- treatments. “The risk posed by the virus at the present time does not justy testing and isolating large swathes of the population at the levels that we have seen to date in the past two years. Test and trace will continue to have a key role and will be used in a more focused and targeted way to support and protect our most vulnerable. This will be kept under very close review and we will have contingency plans in place so that we can scale up should it be required.” A range of changes will take effect from the  April: PCR testing will no longer be recommended or available for most people with symptoms. It will still be available to support the small group for whom it is recommended for clinical reasons. The PCR home ordering service will remain available for the general public to support those for whom PCR is recommended.Publicly accessible COVID- testing sites will close. Local Health and Social Care Trusts will continue to provide PCR testing to support clinical care.Those with symptoms will be advised to use lateral flow devicesto test instead of booking a PCR. This will be kept under review and could remain in place up to the end of June depending on disease trajectory.Routine asymptomatic testingwill continue to be advised for those living, working and visiting health and social care settings including hospitals and care homes and other high risk settings in line with public health advice. This will be kept under review.Asymptomatic LFD testing for the wider population will cease. Access to free LFDs for this purpose will cease.Routine asymptomatic workplace testing will cease.Routine asymptomatic testing in most educational settingswill cease at the Easter break.Asymptomatic testing in special schools will continue after Easter and will be kept under review. It may continue until the end of June .Routine population contact tracing will be phased out between mid-April and the end of June.  Chief Medical Officer Professor Sir Michael McBride said: “We will continue throughout the transition phase to support and protect our most vulnerable. After these changes are introduced from  April, I would urge people to check on NI Directtesting remains recommended for them - for examplethey are eligible for new treatments. In the coming weeks, the Department will also be working to provide advice and support to those eligible for treatments. It is particularly important that those who are at higher risk of serious illness follow the guidance on getting tested.” The Chief Medical Officer added: “The tools at our disposal to protect people who are at higher risk from COVID- have advanced considerably since the early days of the pandemic. Alongside the vaccine and booster programme, new COVID- treatments continue to be used by patients in Northern Ireland and new treatments are in development. “As the amount of testing across society reduces, our behaviour and actions have an even more important role in preventing transmission and keeping others safe. I urge everyone to continue to follow the public health guidance including continuing to wear a face covering in enclosed settings like public transport and when visiting hospitals and care homes.” The changes do not take effect until  April, and current testing provision will continue until then. Please keep following the latest public health advice as set out on NI Direct."},{"url":null,"title":"if he hadnt got covid hed be doing well he had a good few years ahead of him","story":"Tyrone’s All-Ireland victory in  was bittersweet for the Bell family, just months after super-fan Laurence passed away and his brother James at a Tyrone game.

Members of the public are free to ignore guidance and make their own decisions.“It has always been my position that once regulations are removed we should move back to meeting in public. I think there are some sections of the public sector who are too comfortable and don’t want to go back. They like Zooming in and out. That’s fine for them, but for us the best place to do business is in person across the chamber.“The cost is unacceptable. If you want to reach the public, do a live audio stream, which would reduce the costs. All of our meetings are recorded anywayyou want to listen back. So we don’t need a plethora of video cameras looking down our throats, just so we can get close ups during the meetings.”DUP councillor Stephen McIlveen noted that some councillors and staff “are vulnerable, and we shouldn’t be using ourselves merely as examples. We should be taking consideration of other people”.“Where some members may feel comfortable going into public meetings, I know there are some who are very reluctant, and they will force themselves to do it. But we shouldn’t be in a position where we are forcing potentially vulnerable people into potentially dangerous situations,” he said.“Similarly we should not be potentially excluding people from meetings, who don’t feel comfortable enough to attend. I think we should be looking at something that is a bit more flexible.”​​​​​​​​​​​​​​The DUP, Alliance, the UUP and one Independent councillor supported the council officer’s recommendation for the plan, while one TUV elected representative and two independent unionists voted against it.Related topicsUlster Unionist PartyAlliance PartyTraditional Unionist VoiceMost ReadNorth Belfast residents shocked by sudden collapse of wall of Chinese takeaway: ‘It could have been fatal’Outrage as schoolboyis victim of ‘sectarian attack’ in north BelfastMum of Belfast man Joseph Ritch pays tribute to her ‘lovely boy’ who died following assault in ArdoyneSinn Fein MLA Emma Rogan absent for almost  committee meetingsWe live in fear, says mother of boy attacked ‘for being Protestant’Top VideosPlayVideo: Wall collapses in north Belfast\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming be .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming be .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayCharles and Camilla visit CS Lewis Square in east Belfast PlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentLatest Northern IrelandSecurity alert halts Simon Coveney speech during Belfast peacebuilding eventSecurity alert at peacebuilding event in north Belfast with Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney in attendanceAnother  Covid- linked deaths in latest weekly update in Northern IrelandPoots introduces emergency pet travel rules for Ukrainian refugees arriving in NINorthern Ireland unable to back Euro  bid currently, says Stormont ministerLatestQC to investigate possible union collusion in blacklistingKim Kardashian on her s: It’s OK to choose to do what makes you happyCo-op appoints first female boss in -year historySecurity alert halts Simon Coveney speech during Belfast peacebuilding eventTottenham’s derby at Arsenal in WSL postponed due to coronavirus,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Colm O’ReillyEdwin Poots. Credit: Brian Lawless FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueCase: Dr Tamara Bronckaers. Credit: Colm O’ReillySam McBrideTwitterEmailMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailAfter being asked five times for a copy of a civil servant’s register of interests, a Stormont department has refused to allow the public to see it — claiming that it cannot release the information because of a court case.Six months ago, an employment tribunal unanimously found that Tamara Bronckaers, a senior vet at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairswith an “exemplary performance and record”, had been treated appallingly and effectively sacked because she blew the whistle on potential fraud and animal suffering.Despite the Executive’s repeated pledges of transparency, the department has been unusually reluctant to respond to requests for even basic details in relation to the case. DAERA is now using taxpayers’ money to attempt to overturn the devastating employment tribunal judgment that raised serious concerns about Northern Ireland’s chief vet and one of his deputies — but is refusing to say whether that was approved by the department’s minister, Edwin Poots.Unless the department succeeds in persuading the Court of Appeal to overturn the ruling, the public could be forced to pay £m to compensate Dr Bronckaers, along with huge legal bills.In a ,-word judgment, Employment Judge Ó Murray repeatedly criticised the whistleblower’s treatment by two of her senior colleagues — line manager Julian Henderson and chief vet Robert Huey.At the heart of the case was Dr Bronckaers’ desire to pursue enforcement action against Ballymena Livestock Market over alleged suffering caused to animals and animal movements being electronically deleted from DAERA’s much-vaunted computer system meant to track all livestock moves to ensure traceability of meat.Dr Huey told her he knew the manager of the market personally and also knew its chairman. Both he and Dr Henderson discouraged her from pursuing enforcement, with Dr Bronckaers left in tears after an encounter with Dr Huey.

After multiple requests, the department eventually replied to say that because Dr Huey is a member of the departmental board his declarations were available at a page on its website.However, it did not respond in relation to Dr Henderson, a grade five senior principal veterinary officer who — according to the judgment — was heavily involved in undermining Dr Bronckaers after she attempted to enforce the law.After five requests, the department eventually responded to say: “As this is a court matter, the department will not be commenting any further.”The tribunal found as a matter of fact that Dr Huey knew the manager of Ballymena Livestock Market “personally” and that “he knew the owner of the market who was chairman of the Markets Association”. The tribunal found that Dr Huey acted in a way which discouraged Dr Bronckaers from enforcing the law against Ballymena Livestock Market.Whilst there is no suggestion that there is was any formal connection between Dr Huey and Mr Henderson and Ballymena Livestock Market, it is unclear from the judgment what Dr Huey meant when he told the tribunal that he knew the manager “personally”.There is no reference to anyone at Ballymena Livestock Market in Dr Huey’s register of interests. When asked about that, the department said: “As this is a court matter, the department will not be commenting any further.”Related topicsDepartment of Agriculture, Environment  Rural Affairs - The Executive OfficeEdwin PootsMore On \" class\"-as:\"Department of Agriculture, Environment  Rural Affairs - Stormont department criticised for building Derry park-and-ride which breaches planning rulesPlanning system is chronic failure, says Stormont watchdog PremiumSam McBrideOpinionMystery about quiet hardening of the Irish Sea border – and who ordered itIFEX: , people due to attend hospitality event PremiumNew Civil Service chief silent over whistleblower caseMost ReadNorth Belfast residents shocked by sudden collapse of wall of Chinese takeaway: ‘It could have been fatal’Outrage as schoolboyis victim of ‘sectarian attack’ in north BelfastMum of Belfast man Joseph Ritch pays tribute to her ‘lovely boy’ who died following assault in ArdoyneSinn Fein MLA Emma Rogan absent for almost  committee meetingsWe live in fear, says mother of boy attacked ‘for being Protestant’Top VideosPlayVideo: Wall collapses in north Belfast\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming be .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming be .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayCharles and Camilla visit CS Lewis Square in east Belfast PlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentLatest Northern IrelandSecurity alert halts Simon Coveney speech during Belfast peacebuilding eventAnother  Covid- linked deaths in latest weekly update in Northern IrelandPoots introduces emergency pet travel rules for Ukrainian refugees arriving in NINorthern Ireland unable to back Euro  bid currently, says Stormont ministerBelfast Giants winger Lewis Hook is now reaping the benefits of playing to his strengthsLatestQC to investigate possible union collusion in blacklistingKim Kardashian on her s: It’s OK to choose to do what makes you happyCo-op appoints first female boss in -year historySecurity alert halts Simon Coveney speech during Belfast peacebuilding eventTottenham’s derby at Arsenal in WSL postponed due to coronavirus,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Zivica KerkezLisa SmythTwitterMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailNorthern Ireland’s Children’s Commissioner has said she believes some primary schools are too afraid to promote the Covid- vaccine to parents.Koulla Yiasouma said she is aware of cases where staff in secondary schools endured “awful intimidation and harassment” after students were given information on the Covid- vaccine.As a result, Ms Yiasouma, who has herself received abuse for her comments on teenagers receiving the vaccine, said she does not blame any schools that do not want to become involved vaccination programme.And she also said she does not envy parents who are trying to decide whether to vaccinate their young children against the virus.It comes after it emerged that less than % of children aged between five and  in Northern Ireland have received a Covid- vaccine.In December, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationrecommended that the vaccine be offered to five to -year-olds deemed at particular risk from the virus and those who live with someone who is immunocompromised.Then, in February, it recommended that the programme could be extended to all children in the age group.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up However, only , doses of the vaccine have been administered to children between the ages of five and .Ms Yiasouma said: “I think there are a number of issues at play here and I’m not sure safety is the biggest concern.“The Public Health Agencyhas put quite a lot of information on the safety of the vaccines on its website, but I think it would be betterit was being made more available to parents.“There are questions over the benefits of the vaccine to children and parents might not see the point in going to the trouble of finding out more.“It’s not even as though the vaccine is being administered in the school setting, parents have to go and make an appointment themselves, yet they aren’t clear about the benefits of the vaccine.“What I’m also hearing from parents is that they aren’t sure about giving the vaccine to their child simply for the benefit of the community.“We are seeing children getting it where there is a vulnerable family member but where that isn’t the case, there is more hesitancy from parents.“I don’t envy parents having to make the decision and I wouldn’t say they should or shouldn’t.“What I would advise is that they read up all the information from the PHA and make their own decision.”The Department of Health has acknowledged the low uptake in children between the ages of five and  and said the PHA has been working with a range of organisations to increase the number of doses administered in the age group.These include the health trusts and Education Authority, however, Ms Yiasouma said schools are reticent to become involved in the delivery of the programme. She explained: “I spoke to secondary schools where staff were threatened, there was awful intimidation and harassment, which I think has made primary schools very, very reluctant to be seen promoting the vaccine.”Ms Yiasouma also said there is a perception that a younger child having to isolate after testing positive and missing a week of school is not as harmful as when it happens to teenagers preparing for exams.However, she warned that children in primary one and two have suffered substantial harm as a result of the pandemic.“They have missed out on the preparation to ensure they are ready for school and we’re seeing them coming in and they don’t have the language skills or other skills required,” she continued.“Aside from children with special educational needs, who suffered the most harm throughout the pandemic, it is those children at the start of the school career that we’re most worried about.”Rachel Spiers, Immunisation and Vaccination Programme Manager at the PHA, on Thursday night said vaccination remains “one of the most important things” parents can do to protect children against ill-health.“Evenyour child has already had Covid-, it is still important to get them vaccinated, as being fully-vaccinated can offer them the best protection from the virus and severe disease, as we have seen that it can be possible to develop Covid- more than once,” she explained.While most children aged five to  will have mild diseasethey contract Covid-, some may experience symptoms which last longer than just a few days.“Vaccination of children in this age group has been shown to help prevent the small number of hospitalisations and intensive care admissions that can occur in this age group,” said Ms Spiers“It has also been shown to help provide short-term protection against non-severe disease. “When you look at the risk of Covid- against the risk of the vaccine, it’s more beneficial for children to receive the vaccine.”Related topicsDepartment of HealthMore On Department of Health‘A good day for fairness and equality’ as Bill to end religious discrimination in recruitment of teachers is passedUkraine President Zelensky accepts invitation to address Irish ParliamentFresh calls for urgent increase in mileage expenses for domiciliary health workersCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Five deaths and , new cases recordedAdoption Bill which puts children at centre of decision-making reaches ‘signicant’ milestoneMost ReadNorth Belfast residents shocked by sudden collapse of wall of Chinese takeaway: ‘It could have been fatal’Sinn Fein MLA Emma Rogan absent for almost  committee meetingsMum of Belfast man Joseph Ritch pays tribute to her ‘lovely boy’ who died following assault in ArdoyneOutrage as schoolboyis victim of ‘sectarian attack’ in north BelfastLoyalist paramilitaries couldn’t back ceasefires now: PUPTop VideosPlayVideo: Wall collapses in north Belfast\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming be .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming be .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayCharles and Camilla visit CS Lewis Square in east Belfast PlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentLatest Northern IrelandSecurity alert halts Simon Coveney speech during Belfast peacebuilding eventAnother  Covid- linked deaths in latest weekly update in Northern IrelandPoots introduces emergency pet travel rules for Ukrainian refugees arriving in NINorthern Ireland unable to back Euro  bid currently, says Stormont ministerBelfast Giants winger Lewis Hook is now reaping the benefits of playing to his strengthsLatestCo-op appoints first female boss in -year historySecurity alert halts Simon Coveney speech during Belfast peacebuilding eventTottenham’s derby at Arsenal in WSL postponed due to coronavirus‘We are calling time on cheap milk’, says Arla boss as farmers’ costs soarAnother  Covid- linked deaths in latest weekly update in Northern Ireland,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Kelvin Boyes PresseyeGarrett HarganTwitterEmailMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Department for Infrastructurehas been strongly criticised for building a second park-and-ride facility on the outskirts of Londonderry in breach of planning conditions.The River Faughan Anglersgroup spoke out after Stormont’s Public AccountsCommittee said in a scathing report that it was “alarmed and appalled” at the abysmal performance of, and lack of transparency in, the planning system.In August , the DfI park-and-ride facility beside the A bridge over the River Faughan was damaged by flooding. Cars were swept into the river and people were rescued from the rising waters.It was then discovered it was operating without planning permission or environmental assessments.Read MoreWe live in fear, says mother of boy attacked ‘for being Protestant’Council rapped for spending £k on ‘fancy cameras’ for zoom meetingsThis was because what permission it had was temporary, and a condition required the facility’s removal and the restoration of the site by , a full year before the flooding struck.

In addition, the NIEA, along with the department’s consulting advisors and dedicated environmental team, were on site extensively during construction,” they added. “During this period, they did not raise any concern or issues relating to either the environmental controls or working methods adopted.”The local council confirmed it was aware of an alleged breach of conditions. A spokeswoman said: “A report of an alleged pollution incident was received. The council engaged with the DfI, the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs and NIEA officials on the matter.”Related topicsDepartment for InfrastructureNorthern Ireland AssemblyRachel WoodsDepartment of Agriculture, Environment  Rural Affairs - More On Department for InfrastructurePlanning system is chronic failure, says Stormont watchdog PremiumLong delays for major planning applications ‘costing jobs and prosperity’ in Northern IrelandBelfast taxi driver fears any rise in fares could drive customers awayNorthern Ireland taxi journeys set for further increase following last year’s .% rise in maximum faresCareless driving set to become £ fixed penalty notice offence in Northern IrelandMost ReadNorth Belfast residents shocked by sudden collapse of wall of Chinese takeaway: ‘It could have been fatal’Sinn Fein MLA Emma Rogan absent for almost  committee meetingsMum of Belfast man Joseph Ritch pays tribute to her ‘lovely boy’ who died following assault in ArdoyneOutrage as schoolboyis victim of ‘sectarian attack’ in north BelfastLoyalist paramilitaries couldn’t back ceasefires now: PUPTop VideosPlayVideo: Wall collapses in north Belfast\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming be .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming be .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayCharles and Camilla visit CS Lewis Square in east Belfast PlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentLatest Northern IrelandCouncil apologises to family after grave isn’t dug in time for funeralAnother  Covid- linked deaths in latest weekly update in Northern IrelandPoots introduces emergency pet travel rules for Ukrainian refugees arriving in NINorthern Ireland unable to back Euro  bid currently, says Stormont ministerBelfast Giants winger Lewis Hook is now reaping the benefits of playing to his strengthsLatest‘We are calling time on cheap milk’, says Arla boss as farmers’ costs soarCouncil apologises to family after grave isn’t dug in time for funeralAnother  Covid- linked deaths in latest weekly update in Northern IrelandJonathan Rea’s fired up to get back on top of the world after disappointment of losing titleChina battling ‘severe and complex’ Covid- outbreak,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There are a number of slogans.Anyone who has been following the frantic goings-on in the Assembly can only assume our MLAs have finally heard them. Either that or there’s an election coming up. You decide.Then again, considering what’s being done today, could it not have been done yesterday Looking at the raft of bills flowing through the chamber these past few weeks, particularly related to education, perhaps MLAs have adopted the trait of the typical student. Last-minute cramming ahead of the summer exams.With the Assembly about to wrap up its current mandate, and elections due on May , a new to-do list will emerge. Whether a great big tick can be placed beside what needs to be done, depending on whether an Executive can get up and running, is unknown, butpast experience is anything to go by, in five years there’ll be another rush of last-minute legislation.There was a to-do list five years ago. Yes, Covid will have curtailed progress on some major issues, but the reality is that MLAs have had five years of scratching their Private Members# Bills.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up You do wonder where the urgency was in . Did the itching start so suddenly at the beginning of  Instead, there has been an extensive list of bills being rushed through, some under accelerated passage which, of course, would not have been needed had the process started earlier in the mandate. And rushed legislation isn’t always for the best. Some things need y consideration.Perhaps the biggest, and certainly the most contested, was the Integrated Education Bill from Alliance MLA Kellie Armstrong, which took six years of work to get to the Assembly.But in the last few weeks there has been the Flexible School Starting Age Bill, a bill to introduce CPR training as a formal part of the NI curriculum which was finally adopted as a ministerial directive, a bill on providing period products, a bill on removing the teacher exemption from fair employment legislation, and a bill to grant the Education Minister powers to dissolve the dysal General Teaching Council. That’s just within one department.And you could say, as MLAs reach the end of their five-year stint at Stormont, it’s election rush hour.In the space of a few hours, legislation on the free availability of period products, hospital car parking charges, domestic abuse safe leave from employment, the preservation of documents relating to historical institutions, safe access zones for abortion services and the fair employment of teachers were all speeding past in a blur.Sighs of relief for those who have worked to get their bills through for Royal Ascent, but maybe they made things a little harder for themselves than they needed to. Every Assembly mandate starts with the best intentions. The next one will be no dferent.While we should at least be grateful that important decisions are being made, it does all arrive with a little regret that the achievements were not being celebrated by cheering MLAs some time ago.Perhaps we should have elections more oftenwe want to get things done  Now there’s a worrying thought, but it is amazing what can be achieved when the spirit moves you.As elected MLAs reassemble, in whatever form of government the election brings come May, it would be refreshing to see the enthusiasm and the urgency to actually get things done that have been a hallmark of the final days of the current crop, bear fruit in the early days of a new administration.Last-minute winners can be more enjoyable and they do say all good things come to those who wait, but there are vital things Northern Ireland simply shouldn’t have to wait for.Related topicsMichelle McIlveenKellie ArmstrongMore On Michelle McIlveenPlymouth Brethren Christian Church’s schools merger plan for Northern Ireland rejected by Education Minister McIlveenNew single transfer test for P pupils in Northern Ireland to begin in November Education Minister confirms integrated status for Glengormley HighEducation Department urged to make good on promises as £m funding breakdown revealed£m for new school buildings plannedMost ReadNorth Belfast residents shocked by sudden collapse of wall of Chinese takeaway: ‘It could have been fatal’Sinn Fein MLA Emma Rogan absent for almost  committee meetingsMum of Belfast man Joseph Ritch pays tribute to her ‘lovely boy’ who died following assault in ArdoyneOutrage as schoolboyis victim of ‘sectarian attack’ in north BelfastLoyalist paramilitaries couldn’t back ceasefires now: PUPTop VideosPlayVideo: Wall collapses in north Belfast\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming be .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming be .ece AUTOCROP wh bt_KS_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayCharles and Camilla visit CS Lewis Square in east Belfast PlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentLatest PoliticsStormont’s inertia over refugees ‘puts them at risk of exploitation and abuse’Loyalist paramilitaries couldn’t back ceasefires now: PUPViewpointOpinionNot much help with cost of living crisisNorthern Ireland set for #problems and confusion# over a clash between UK and EU law, Government admits‘These people have no idea what struggling families are going through’: Northern Ireland mum hits out at Chancellor’s Spring statementLatestQC to investigate possible union collusion in blacklistingKim Kardashian on her s: It’s OK to choose to do what makes you happyCo-op appoints first female boss in -year historySecurity alert halts Simon Coveney speech during Belfast peacebuilding eventTottenham’s derby at Arsenal in WSL postponed due to coronavirus,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Ballynahinch scheme represents excellent value for money and should have been prioritised during the past two years.Mr Hazzard said more than poundbn of capital resources has been spent by the roads minister and her department during the letime of the current Assembly.ldquoIt is hugely disappointing that a small, yet strategically important scheme, such as the Ballynahinch bypass has been left on the shelf. In light of the economic impact of Covid- and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the commencement of this scheme would have been a welcome step towards improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of the local community, said the MP.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWe can only hope now that when the Executive is restored after Mayrsquos election, that the local community can have a minister in place who recognises the value of the Ballynahinch bypass and finally begins construction.Mr Casement said the bypass could help kick-start the economic regeneration of the town and provide the wider South Down tourism economy with a signicant boost. He said it was vital a start date for construction work is confirmed as soon as possible.A key member of Ballynahinchrsquos Regeneration Committee for many years alongside the late Vincent Fullam, Mr Casement has never given up the battle to secure a bypass, which was first mooted in the late s.ldquoThe bypass is included in a list of strategic projects and is effectively ready to proceed. There should be no more delays. The scheme should have been delivered years ago, he declared.ldquoWhile the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, there are many other benefits, including reduced town centre pollution.Mr Casement added: ldquoThe new road scheme will also dissuade drivers from using built-up housing areas and rural roads as unofficial bypasses and, most importantly, help kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre. We need to see work starting on the scheme now.A Department for Infrastructure spokesman said it was committed to delivering the bypass as part of a plan to aid economic recovery and community transformation, while addressing regional imbalance.He said that ldquofar from being left on the shelf, the scheme was being actively progressed much further by Ms Mallon than any other minister, with development work now substantively complete and statutory approvals finalised in July last year.ldquoThe next stage would involve commencing the procurement of a contractor but progression to procurement and construction is dependent upon the level of funding made available to the Department in future budgets, he explained.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos bid for the - budget included funds to deliver this scheme, however, the absence of an Executive means there is no agreed budget which means that delivery timescales remain uncertain.The spokesman added: ldquoThis is a priority for our Minister who remains frustrated that once again the absence of an Executive is negatively affecting both the people of Northern Ireland and our infrastructure..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Carryduff landowner helps the environment with trees  ","story":"CARRYDUFF landowner Rosanna Ballentine and her son Iain have received  trees to plant on their farm to help them enhance bioersity and create a habitat for wildle.The trees have been supplied from a partnership between Trees on the Land ndash a charity and not-for-profit project from the Green Economy Foundation ndash and SuperValu and Centra, part of the Musgrave Group.The project is part of a sustainability initiative from the retail brands which recently announced they will plant , trees across Northern Ireland over ten years.Mrs Ballentine welcomed the initiative and the assistance of SuperValu and Centra staff, along with central colleagues from Musgrave NI, who pulled on their wellies and visited the farm to help plant a mix of hawthorn, oak, birch, rowan and hazel trees.She said: ldquoWe are planting a new native hedgerow and a line of trees along the edge of an existing woodland to ide it from an adjoining agricultural grassland.

crowned Bobby Dalzell Cup champions after defeating local rivals Ardglass in the deciding penalty shoot-out at Meadowvale last Thursday.A goal on the stroke of half-time from Ardglass midfielder Stephen Deegan was cancelled out on  minutes by the close range effort of Celtic striker Jordan McCoubrey.The teams refused to be split in extra-time and following the shoot-out mdash which went well into the sudden death stages mdash Blaine Connolly converted the all-important spot kick to gt his Hoopsrsquo side the victory.A large crowd turned out in Drumaness for the St Patrickrsquos Day showpiece between the current first and second-placed sides in the Newcastle Leaguersquos Premier Division.Adding to the pressure of the occasion was the alternating weather conditions, with the teams contesting the final in periods of sunshine as well as wind and rain.Nevertheless, Celtic kicked off the affair with the blustery conditions heavily in favour of their opponents.It didnrsquot take long for the tone of the match to be set as Ardglass defender Caolain OrsquoShea launched a very physical tackle on Hoops striker Jay Gibney.Ardglass enjoyed early momentum with experienced defender Neil Teggart seeing his wind-assisted free kick from his own half trouble Celtic custodian Nathan Curran less than ten minutes in.Celtic remained calm and soon strung their passes together through clever one touch football with eventual man of the match winner Conor Doherty in the thick of these sequences.However, Ardglass remained a threat and came close when Teggart clipped a cross into the danger area, although striker Michael Magee glanced his header wide.Stand-in Celtic captain Shaun Megahey attempted to play a through ball to team-mate Gibney, but on this occasion the Ardglass defence timed the offside trap perfectly.Celtic did come close when Barry Treacyrsquos corner kick was fumbled by Ardglass lsquokeeper, Mark Armstrong, although Hoops defender Paul Brady couldnrsquot dispatch the ball quickly enough before the danger was cleared.OrsquoShea continued his earlier eagerness and picked up a yellow card for a mistimed tackle before his team-mate, Magee, was unfairly clattered at the other end of the pitch, although Teggartrsquos effort flew past the wrong side of the post.Teggart continued to be a problem from set pieces as his free-kick delivery whisked past the head of striker Magee and out of bounds.Moments later, Mageersquos misfortune continued when he was shown a yellow card for expressing his disagreement with referee, Barry Mullan.After initially allowing the match to flow freely, referee Mullan clamped down on his decisions with less than ten minutes to the end of the opening half.Celtic defender Gary Carberry was the latest to enter the book for a late challenge on Ardglass marksman Magee.Despite this hiccup, Celticrsquos Carberry kept himself in contention for the man of the match accolade after he proved pivotal in stopping potential goalscoring chances from the Ardglass opposition on numerous occasions.As the half-time whistle approached, Celtic arms were raised as they appealed for the red card to be shown to Ardglassrsquos OrsquoShea, who may have considered himself lucky to escape an early bath after he was second to the ball.Ardglass launched another attack and it looked asMagee would have a free route to goal. However, Celtic veteran Brady recovered valiantly to prove he still has plenty of miles left in his tank.With the last attack of the half, Ardglass were awarded a corner and they took full advantage of their opportunity. Midfielder, Stephen Deegan, climbed high above the rest to head his effort beyond the outstretched hand of Celtic lsquokeeper Curran to open the scoring.As the second half kicked off it was evident that both sides would refrain from going for broke. A lot of the following ten minutes contained attacks, although both sides lacked a killer instinct and the match was heavily contested in the middle of the pitch.This is where Conor Doherty earned his post-match award for his performance, as he often won the midfield battle.Goal-scorer Deegan picked up a yellow as the weather took yet another turn for the worse.Celtic joint-managers Jason Galbraith and Matthew McKenna made the first of their substitutions as the clock struck the hour mark with Sean McMahon entering the fray in place of Conaill Kerr.Ardglass opted to put  men behind the ball in order to frustrate the opposition and waited patiently for their opportunity to counter-attack.Ardglass made changes of their own in the form of Jordan Finnegan before Celtic made a second substitute with the talented Sean Ferris making his way onto the pitch.Ferris made an immediate impact, adding another string to Celticrsquos bow by spreading inviting passes into his forward line.With just  minutes left of the , these Celtic substitutions came to fruition after the ball found its way to McMahon, who lofted an inviting ball into the Ardglass box which was steered home by the boot of striker McCoubrey.Celtic continued to mix things up as Corey McCartan made his way onto the pitch and gave a good account of himself with his tireless work rate.Despite this period of succession for the Hoops, the remaining minutes of the  played out finely balanced.Ardglass never let their headsand should be commended for their effort as they cancelled out any further attack whilst continuously seeking the crucial next goal.As tempers flared, the final whistle sounded and both teams prepared for extra-time.The highlights of the first half of extra-time came in the form of Celticrsquos Treacy picking up a yellow card before team-mate Ferris crashed his left-footed effort off the crossbar.During the next interval, both of Ardglassrsquo Magee and Celticrsquos Ferris threatened but they couldnrsquot do enough to get the ball over the line and it would be penalties that would decide the final outcome.Amongst the numerous penalties which took place, both Celtic and Ardglass players were ordered to retake their spot kicks.Firstly, Celtic striker McCoubrey saw his effort denied by Armstrong before referee Mullan blew his whistle after adjudging the Ardglass custodian to be off his line as the penalty was taken.McCoubrey fired in the retake and it wouldnrsquot be long before Ardglass substitute Finnegan would go through a similar course of events after he missed his initial penalty but converted at the second time of asking.Eventually, as the penalties progressed well into sudden death, Celticrsquos Blaine Connolly remained calm and converted the deciding spot kick to send the Hoopsrsquo support into delirium as his side were crowned champions.Following the conclusion, man of the match Conor Doherty gave his thoughts on his sidersquos victory.ldquoI thought we were the better team in the first half but then they snuck a goal before half-time, he said.ldquoBut, even with the wind we started to press on, it was a long  minutes.ldquoIt was a hard hitting game but Irsquom just glad we got on the winning side of it.He added: ldquoAll the penalties were top class, it was a really good shootout.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey , B Connolly, P Brady, G Carberry, C

There are always more jobs to be carried out on the collection.However, using the images effectively, and in the way the Hudson and Newman families, and indeed all other donors, wished, requires wide knowledge of all the collections by experienced and qualied professional staff working with them on a daily basis.The photographic archive is recognised as one of the most important in Ireland and contains a wide range of images, including daguerrotypes, glass negative plates, lantern slides, black and white and colour film, transparencies as well as digital images.Understanding of all the processes involved in their making is essential to how they are cared for and used.Lesley Simpson is secretary of the Friends of Down County Museum and former Keeper of Collections at the museum..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Success at Downpatrick  ","story":"PRIOR to Sundayrsquos Randox Ulster National Handicap Chase meeting at Downpatrick Racecourse, manager Richard Lyttle stated that he was looking forward to welcoming racegoers back to the track for the first time in three years.They certainly turned up with car parks filled to capacity, packed enclosures and long tailbacks on the Ballydugan Road prior to the first race.The Randox Ulster National has been the local tracks major race of the year now for many years and the maximum  runners faced the starter for the three mile four furlong race that sees prize money paid right down to the first six past the post.A bit like the big Aintree race, there was plenty of fallers with two coming down at the very first fence and Envoi Pierji then unseating Donegal jockey Conor Orr, who had ridden Screaming Colours to success for Bill Durkan in the Midlands National at Uttoxeter the previous day.Later in the race there was more fallers at the regulation fence.With two fences to be taken the race involved four runners with the  winner Amaulino travelling like the winner under David McGrath.But this combination then faded, eventually finishing fourth for Co Armagh trainer Keith Watson.The eventual winner in the famous J P McManus Silks proved to be Spades Are Trumps, ridden by Cheltenham winning jockey Mark McDonagh, a lb claimer.Finishing second was Agent Born, ridden by Darragh OrsquoKeefe with Peaches and Cream third.Co Meath trainer Gavin Cromwell, who also had success at Cheltenham, saddled the winner and also the third past the post.

He got his chance to DJ on his own for the first time due to a double booking.He then began to DJ regularly at the Central Park nightclub in his early s, later securing a residency in The Groovy Train at the M Club in Belfast in .Paulrsquos break into radio came in  when he became a presenter with FM in Newry, part of the Q Radio Network, later becoming a breakfast presenter and eventually operations manager.He left in  and worked freelance for three years with Downtown Radio before joining U presenting the Sunday afternoon show in .In , he took on the overnight programme from midnight until am, Monday to Thursday.Paul also was a multi-award winning wedding DJ and played regularly as the recommended DJ for the Hastings Hotel Group.OrsquoHares in Newcastle paid its condolences on social media to Paulrsquos family and friends:: lsquoDJ PK was a resident here for many years and was heavily involved in the success of Central Park and Coast nightclub entertaining generations of party goers here.rsquoAfter a service at Our Lady Of The Assumption Church in Newcastle, Paulrsquos remains left for cremation in Dardistown Crematorium in Dublin..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Washed up munitions a reminder of Murlough’s military history  ","story":"THE news of a controlled explosion on Murlough beach last Thursday might sound shocking.But it isnrsquot the first time that Army bomb disposal experts have detonated a suspected WWII mortar found in County Downrsquos sands.Such ordnance washes up relatively frequently, assumed to have escaped the Beaufort Dyke trench in the Irish Sea, where massive amounts of munitions were dumped after the war mdash including  tons of four-inch mortars.But stray munitions have also been found before in Murloughrsquos sand dunes, reflecting the arearsquos rich wartime history.In fact, Murlough Nature Reserve mdash formerly known as the Dundrum Sandhills mdash has interesting history that extends far beyond WWII.The name itself comes from the old Irish word lsquoMuirbolcrsquo, meaning lsquosea-bagrsquo , and evidence of human activity in the -acre reserve extends back to around  BC.Archaeological digs in the s unearthed multiple signs of burning, hundreds of pottery shards, worked flints and even carbonised hazelnut shells that confirm Neolithic and Bronze Age activity.Much later, Murloughrsquos dunes were important for the Normans. They were used as a commercial rabbit warren when John De Courcy arrived and built Dundrum Castle in .The lucrative trade in rabbit pelts continued for centuries afterwards. Rabbits are still common today, although the population was decimated by the myxomatosis disease in the s.The s was also when the National Trust began managing the habitat on behalf of its owners, the Hill family mdash commonly known as the Marquises of Downshire.The Hill family came to the area in the late th century but had lived in Ireland since the late s, when a young army officer named Moyses Hill, originally from Devon, was posted to Carrickfergus garrison in  to command forces sent by Elizabeth I to subdue the rebellious OrsquoNeill clan and colonise Ireland.Moyses ended up staying in Ireland and marrying the sister of a local clan chief. In , he was granted land at Cromlyn, an area which later took his surname and became known as Hillsborough. His descendants then acquired Murlough in  and began using Murlough Farm as their summer residence.They built Murlough House in , which still stands today at the end of Keel Point mdash at the northern end of the beach. While built to have a spectacular sea view, stormy weather kept breaking the windows, so trees were planted around the house in , and the woodland remains to this day.In , the th Marquis of Downshire, Arthur Hill, sold the surrounding land to the National Trust and then sold the house in . The area became Irelandrsquos first nature reserve in  and remains the most extensive dune heath in Ireland .But prior to being sold to the National Trust, Murlough House and the dunes were a hotbed of military activity ndash particularly during WWII. The house was a base for the US Armyrsquos st Armoured Division and the th Tank Destroyer Battalion.They built several firing ranges in the dunes, including, allegedly, a mortar range. Spare bombers and fighters were also hidden there as Murlough Farm had its own landing strip, called lsquo Satellite Landing Groundrsquo .Murlough beach itself was dotted with anti-aircraft and anti-invasion posts mdash whose rotting remnants are still visible today. They were dug-in when a full-scale German invasion was a threat in the early s.They were part of a counter-invasion strategy that centred on slowing or stopping the enemy at certain locations until other forces could be mustered and deployed. This involved constructing a so-called lsquocoastal crustrsquo along beaches and inland lsquostop-linesrsquo along rivers, canals and high ground.With Northern Ireland being prime invasion territory, a coastal crust was set up from Magilligan in the north-west to Newcastle in the south-east, alongside an inland stop-line along the route of the River Bann. Anti-aircraft landing posts, like those at Murlough, were important in preventing aircraft or boats from landing, but another type of defence was the centrepiece of this strategy: pillboxes.When events at Dunkirk in  sparked invasion panic, the Directorate of Fortications and Works at the War Office was created to construct defensive systems around the UKrsquos beaches. The Royal Engineers and civilian contractors erected over , pillboxes by in a matter of days ndash including on eight of Northern Irelandrsquos beaches.Such structures can still be seen at Magilligan, Portrush and Portstewart. County Down also has intact examples in Bangor, Donaghadee and on the Strangford shore between Comber and Newtownards. Beaches at Minerstown and Tyrella also had multiple pillboxes, as did Murlough. They were spaced to have interlocking arcs of fire, so invaders had little unchallenged space in which to land.One of these pillboxes is still visible in Newcastle, on the beach just below the outdoor swimming pool. The remnants of the other are still visible at the northern end of Murlough, next to the inlet that feeds Dundrum Bay. Yet all that is left are large slabs of reinforced concrete as this pillbox was supposedly destroyed in the early days of the Troubles to prevent it being used to attack the nearby Ballykinlar Army Camp.But these remains are now also under attack from erosion. They are gradually being absorbed by the sea. With this stretch of coastline losing five to ten metres of coastline a year, the remnants of the pillbox, originally built at an elevated height in the dunes, is even starting to be submerged at high tide.What was once a reflection of an indominable spirit is now an unassuming pile of rubble used only as a seat for resting walkers ndash most of whom are unaware of its history. Soon, it will be completely forgotten and the only reminder of this stretch of coastlinersquos rich military history will be the occasional washed-up ordnance.Ben Acheson spent seven years deployed to Afghanistan, including stints as Director of NATOrsquos political team and as Political Adviser to the EU Special Representative.

Welcoming the emergence of such an image, Mr Allister said: “Why a portrait of the man who allegedly ordered the murder, Michael Collins, is just round the corner from where Sir Henry Wilson’s now hangs is less easy to determine.” That is to put it mildly. It is entirely wrong that there is painting of Collins on display or one of Eamon de Valera. These are men who wanted to destroy the very concept of a Northern Ireland. Mr de Valera continued after NI was agreed to try to shatter the deal that had led to partition.Many people will defend the permanent display of such men at Stormont on grounds of parity of esteem. But it is more than that — it is the latest subtle attempt to interpret equality to mean nothing has primacy in NI, not even the symbols of the country that was created, Northern Ireland, or of the state in which it was to stay, the UK, or the people who fought or led for the fact of such a place on this island.While the Republic of Ireland proudly celebrates its history and does not display unionist leaders on a par with its own founders, NI has to behave dferently and let nationalists think that the principle of consent, leading to UK sovereignty here, is a fact of le without consequences.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Phoney and absurd because minority rule dictates that Sinn Fein has an unchallenged ability to control Executive decision making. It is unworkable when government revolves around the approval of a party dedicated to destroying the influence of the majority pro-union community and undermining its very existence.People have had their fill of the hard won peace from terrorism being disturbed by political upheaval. They have had enough of being denied normality and the harvest of social, economic and political stability.The union itself might be safe but unionist tolerance of interference in Northern Ireland’s internal affairs by Dublin, Brussels and Joe Biden’s Washington has worn thin. The relentless orchestrated pressure on the UK over matters such the NI Protocol and legacy is in fact part of the campaign to “get the Brits out of Ireland” that is being played on Sinn Fein fiddles.Time to remind them and London also that Northern Ireland is not in, and is not a part of, Ireland.Time, therefore, with an election forthcoming, for unionists to decide do they want to negotiate new devolved arrangements or walk clean away from the battering ram of the intransigent Irish republican agenda.David McNarry, Ex UUP and Ukip MLA, ComberThe scrapping of Stormont in  set the tone for London’s approach to Northern Ireland——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe surgery was earmarked for closure after the property was sold on by the doctors who owned it.Patients registered at the surgery have been re-allocated to other surgeries in Penarth and Dinas Powys.This has prompted calls from some residents as to why the Welsh Government and the health board did not step in to save the surgery.Local MS and economy minister Vaughan Gething - who is also a former Welsh Government health minister - is the main target of blame from some residents.Max Wallis, a former patient, said: \"The health board and the former health minister are to blame - the health minister for setting up a system in which this could happen.\"Helives near the surgery, could see what was happening and did nothing to stop it.\"But, saying \"I understand the signicant disruption\", Mr Gething said that \"neither the Heath Board or Welsh Government could force the sale of the building to them\".Mr Wallis had met with ious officials to see what could be done about the surgery, including proposals to move it to another site.However he said he had been told by the Primary Care Team that they had not been looking at alternative premises as it was not their job.\"They pretended they were trying to do something about it and then said were doing nothing and wash their hands of it,\" said Mr Wallis.\"A complete failure by public authorities.\":Another former patient who opposed the closure of the surgery, Max Scott-Cook, also blames Mr Gething for the situation.Mr Scott-Cook said: \"Mr Vaughan Gething,you were the health secretary, and you were the MS of the of the people in the surgery, why did you not know and why was something not done .remove\"You promised me for three months to get in touch and you havent done.\"You should have intervened and kept that surgery there.\"Mr Scott-Cook also spoke of how some people, though assigned a new surgery, may not be able to attend their new surgery.He also claims there has been a lack of responsibility taken for Albert Road Surgery and said \"it seems to me that it was a situation that no one wanted to take on\".However, despite the anger that follows the surgery being closed, Mr Scott-Cook praised the staff at the surgery.He said he believes the staff there were exceptional, especially Dr Leppik, and did all they could to help the patients they had while the surgery was open.Mr Gething said: \"I understand the signicant disruption caused to patients as a result of the closure of the Albert Road practice.\"I myself have also been a patient at Albert Road.\"I have engaged with the health board, councillors and members of the public through an unsettling time. \"Former partners decided to sell the building and neither the Heath Board or Welsh Government could force the sale of the building to them.\"I would like to thank Dr Leppik and the team for their service in dficult circumstances.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The Junior Ministers, who are joint chairs of the task force, were presented with the report today by High Street Task Force members Glyn Roberts, Retail NI Seamus McAleavey, NICVA and Cathy Reynolds, SOLACE and paid tribute to the work carried out and the collaboration involved from both inside and outside of government. Junior Minister Gary Middleton said: “Our high streets have experienced constant and increasing change, particularly in recent years. “We want to empower people and communities to reshape and repurpose their local villages, towns and cities, to create a more erse high street - high streets that are clean, green, family friendly destinations that are welcoming for everyone. “I want to thank the High Street Task Force for bringing forward this report which has been developed to prioritise those actions that can drive delivery and build momentum. “A joined-up and collaborative approach must continue over the coming years to deliver high streets, village, town and city centres that are fit for the st century and this report provides the next steps for the new Ministers in the next mandate to take forward work to revitalise our village, town and city centres.” Junior Minister Declan Kearney said: “We want to see our cities, towns and villages regain and retain their vibrancy, purpose and sense of place. High streets of the future should be safe and attractive gathering points for whole communities, where people can live, work, shop, learn, do business, use public services and enjoy their leisure time. “The High Street Task Force report provides a long-term focus on addressing the transformation of our high streets and recognises that there will be a requirement for a number of short, medium and longer-term interventions. “I want to thank Task Force for their hard work and commitment to date and commend the joint-working and co-design roles played by departments, retail and other business organisations, trade unions, local councils and the community and voluntary sectors. “I believe this report and its recommendations can play a vital role in revitalising our high streets.” Glyn Roberts, Retail NI Chief Executive and Chair of the High Street Task Force – Influencing Policy and Strategy sub-group, said: “This report sets out proposals for a five year reconstruction plan for our high streets, reform of our business rates and the need to improve our retail planning policy. “We hope that an incoming Executive after the election will hit the ground running with this plan and begin the long road of recovery for our high streets.” Seamus McAleavey, Chief Executive of NICVA and member of the High Street Task Force – Developing Capacity sub-group, said: “It is obvious change is happening. We are in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it has speeded up during the Covid pandemic by necessity. Online commerce is the norm and communities need to re-invent there town centres. “Only a new vision will work as the past is the past. Communities are the heart of the city, town and villages centres. We can build vibrant high streets places people want to work in, shop in and enjoy themselves in. It is achievable.” Cathy Reynolds, Director of City Regeneration and Development, Place and Economy Department, Belfast City Council, and representing SOLACE , said: “Our high streets have experienced signicant change and challenges over recent years and it is critical that there is a focused effort to address these challenges and build on opportunities to ensure the future sustainability of our towns and cities. “A long term sustained approach is required to ensure high streets are supported to thrive and most importantly survive.” The High Street Task Force report and its recommendations will be subject to consideration by the next Executive who will determine how it can be aligned with the future Programme for Government.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_edcabbbbddd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_faecdaaaecedf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1640789015225.jpg--pcr_testing_to_come_to_an_end_for_most_people_from_next_month.jpg?164078901500","title":"pcr testing to come to an end for most people from next month ","story":"Testing will continue to play a vital role in Northern Ireland’s response to the COVID- pandemic over the coming months, Health Minister Robin Swann has emphasised. The Minister announced that a more targeted approach to testing will be introduced on a phased basis from next month, with the focus on supporting and protecting those at highest risk of serious illness. Testing will continue to be available for those eligible for COVID- treatments. Under the new policy, PCR testing will cease for most people with symptoms from  April - however free lateral flow tests will continue to be available to the public to use should they develop symptoms of COVID-. Lateral flow tests will also continue to be available free of charge to support those living in, working in or visiting a higher risk setting such as a care home until the end of June, with further review then. The policy covers testing and contact tracing and takes effect from  April. No changes will be introduced until that date. The policy will be kept under review during the period of transition up until the end of June. The Health Minister stated: “The new policy reflects the new realities of the pandemic. While the prevalence of the virus remains at a high level, the risk of serious illness has been signicantly reduced - thanks in no small measure to our vaccination programme and the use of innovative COVID- treatments. “The risk posed by the virus at the present time does not justy testing and isolating large swathes of the population at the levels that we have seen to date in the past two years. Test and trace will continue to have a key role and will be used in a more focused and targeted way to support and protect our most vulnerable. This will be kept under very close review and we will have contingency plans in place so that we can scale up should it be required.” A range of changes will take effect from the  April: PCR testing will no longer be recommended or available for most people with symptoms. It will still be available to support the small group for whom it is recommended for clinical reasons. The PCR home ordering service will remain available for the general public to support those for whom PCR is recommended.Publicly accessible COVID- testing sites will close. Local Health and Social Care Trusts will continue to provide PCR testing to support clinical care.Those with symptoms will be advised to use lateral flow devicesto test instead of booking a PCR. This will be kept under review and could remain in place up to the end of June depending on disease trajectory.Routine asymptomatic testingwill continue to be advised for those living, working and visiting health and social care settings including hospitals and care homes and other high risk settings in line with public health advice. This will be kept under review.Asymptomatic LFD testing for the wider population will cease. Access to free LFDs for this purpose will cease.Routine asymptomatic workplace testing will cease.Routine asymptomatic testing in most educational settingswill cease at the Easter break.Asymptomatic testing in special schools will continue after Easter and will be kept under review. It may continue until the end of June .Routine population contact tracing will be phased out between mid-April and the end of June.  Chief Medical Officer Professor Sir Michael McBride said: “We will continue throughout the transition phase to support and protect our most vulnerable. After these changes are introduced from  April, I would urge people to check on NI Directtesting remains recommended for them - for examplethey are eligible for new treatments. In the coming weeks, the Department will also be working to provide advice and support to those eligible for treatments. It is particularly important that those who are at higher risk of serious illness follow the guidance on getting tested.” The Chief Medical Officer added: “The tools at our disposal to protect people who are at higher risk from COVID- have advanced considerably since the early days of the pandemic. Alongside the vaccine and booster programme, new COVID- treatments continue to be used by patients in Northern Ireland and new treatments are in development. “As the amount of testing across society reduces, our behaviour and actions have an even more important role in preventing transmission and keeping others safe. I urge everyone to continue to follow the public health guidance including continuing to wear a face covering in enclosed settings like public transport and when visiting hospitals and care homes.” The changes do not take effect until  April, and current testing provision will continue until then. Please keep following the latest public health advice as set out on NI Direct.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bdffcdaddee   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_feafebbea   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
