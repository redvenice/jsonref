The medieval street also features in one of Stacey Aumonier\u0027s short stories           ‹ Slide me ›    The Crystal Palace (left) was a cast-iron and plate-glass building that was originally situated in the capital\u0027s Hyde Park to host the Great Exhibition of 1851, which took place from May 1 to October 15 that year and showcased products from around the world. Designed by the architect, gardener and member of parliament Joseph Paxton, the structure was relocated to Sydenham Hill in 1852 before a fire in 1936 saw the building destroyed.

Leopold and Debonnaire\u0027s son, Nikolai von Bismarck (left), a photographer, is expected to join the throng, with his girlfriend of four years, supermodel Kate Moss (right), who is due to fly in todayAnd when one potential investor said he had flown over the island in his helicopter and liked what he saw, Tennant told him to take his chopper and his architectural drawings elsewhere. Mustique\u0027s most famous resident was undoubtably Princess Margaret — currently being played in season three of The Crown by Helena Bonham Carter. Margaret conducted much of her affair with Roddy Llewellyn on the island.On her engagement to society photographer Tony Armstrong-Jones (later Lord Snowdon) in 1960, Tennant had asked her if she would like \u0027something in a small box from Aspreys or a piece of Mustique\u0027. She chose the land and even made a detour to inspect it during her honeymoon on the Royal Yacht Britannia. Snowdon always resented the gift and ever after referred to Mustique as \u0027Mustake\u0027.Margaret\u0027s house Les Jolies Eaux, (Beautiful Waters) was built on the plot high above Gelliceaux Bay. It was the only home she ever owned and, according to Basil Charles \u0027it meant more to her than a hundred palaces\u0027.In her book, Lady in Waiting: My Extraordinary Life In The Shadow Of The Crown — which was serialised in the Mail and became a best-seller — Lady Glenconner, Tennant\u0027s widow and Princess Margaret\u0027s Lady in Waiting, says the reason Mustique is still so popular among those who can afford it is because \u0027it has kept Colin\u0027s distinctive bohemian spirit\u0027.There are no electric gates or barbed wire no armed security (although a former British policeman and his team ensure there\u0027s zero crime) no advertising hoardings, no golf course, no marina, no water skiing and heaven help anyone who tries to smuggle in a jet ski.That bohemian spirit reached its zenith at Tennant\u0027s 50th birthday celebrations in 1976. They lasted a week, culminating in a gold-themed party on the white sands of Macaroni Beach, at which locals formed a guard of honour wearing gold-painted codpieces made from coconut shells, their bodies glistening with oil.Guests — including Mick and Bianca Jagger (he wore a battered \u0027Southern boy\u0027 straw hat she sported a gold creation reminiscent of Gone With The Wind), socialites Sabrina Guinness, Emma Soames, and photographer Robert Mapplethorpe — walked through arches of gold palms, with flaming torches lining the route to the beach.\u0027It was Princess Margaret who, as guest of honour, stole the show in a gold-sequinned turban and kaftan, with her skin darkened. She looked out of this world,\u0027 says Charles, who Tennant had put in charge of the party logistics.One of Princess Margaret\u0027s favourite beaches was Lagoon Bay. She regarded it as the perfect spot for picnics and loved to swim in its clear, gentle waters.Perhaps if Boris is feeling especially romantic at the start of a New Year, then this would be the perfect place to propose. There surely could be only one answer.As Basil once told me: \u0027People ask where I\u0027m from and I say, \u0027I don\u0027t know where heaven is, but I live just next door.\u0027 \u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Red blob suddenly appears radar maps coast New Zealand","story":"Share this article In 2014, a stronger marine heat wave caused mass destruction between Hawaii, Alaska and California.The heat wave, dubbed \u0027The Blob\u0027, had a devastating impact on seal and sea-bird populations in the area and also caused coral to bleach.           Climate Researcher Professor James Renwick said the red blob was a normal ocean event and was not linked to climate change Professor Renwick said the heat wave could cause problems for local marine life if it penetrated beneath the ocean\u0027s surface. He said it was more likely the shallow layer of warm water, potentially up to 50m below the surface, would likely fade and dissipate in coming weeks as it heads towards South America. The coldest seas are in Antarctica and the Arctic Ocean where water freezes at -2C. A marine heatwave is defined as when surface seawater temperatures are warmer than 90 per cent of past measurements for at least five days in a row.The \u0027hot blob\u0027 off the New Zealand coast: All you need to know -

Most have made a long-term habit of only making minimum payments each month, which often masks underlying financial troubles.It is difficult to predict how many customers may end up having their credit cards suspended as a result, but it is understood that banks are still contacting thousands of customers as the first 36-month period comes to an end. An account suspension could affect a user’s credit scores.Credit card companies have been ordered to send at least three letters to customers, warning them to raise their payments or risk having their credit card suspended. Firms have been offering alternative ways of repaying their debts more quickly, usually over a period of three to four years. That could include transferring a credit card balance to a personal loan with lower interest.The rules are expected to cut into revenues for credit card companies, but the FCA said it will save customers up to £1.3bn per year. “Furthermore, consumer stress and related financial difficulties would be reduced by resolving debt problems sooner. The total cost savings were expected to have reached between £3bn and £13bn by 2030,” the watchdog said in its original policy paper.Barclaycard said it had sent monthly letters since September 2018, offering customers personalised four-year pay-down plans. It said it would reach out to the remaining customers for a final time in February 2020 before taking action later that month.“Barclaycard is a responsible lender, committed to helping customers manage their borrowing effectively,” a spokesman said. “As a result, we have been writing to customers in persistent debt to let them know what actions they need to take to get themselves out of persistent debt over the coming months.”But if customers are unlikely to keep up with payments for those alternative plans, firms will have to show “forbearance,” which could include reducing, waiving or cancelling any interest or charges. “We would expect firms to suspend the cards of customers that have been shown forbearance, and those who do not respond,” the FCA policy document explained.RBS sent its first batch of letters to customers in May 2018, but is understood to have started the 18-month clock in September that year. It means Natwest and RBS customers could also have credit cards suspended by February next year.TSB said it could increase customers’ minimum payments if it reasonably believed customers were in a position to keep up with the added costs. However, it still has the power to stop customers from using their cards altogether.A spokeswoman for the industry lobby group UK Finance said: “In some circumstances, where a suitable repayment option is not agreed, and in accordance with the new rules, cards might be suspended, so it is really important that customers do not ignore letters received – they should read them carefully to understand their options and contact their credit card provider at the earliest opportunity.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53dfa8f2e1dffa79333178df2fcfe7fd6083a506/0_44_3357_2015/master/3357.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9e44d3b748352f51e2cf45f2774d118","title":"brexit end english official eu language uk brussels","story":"Though the UK is leaving, English is likely to remain a lingua franca in Brussels. Just don’t expect it to stand stillNow that we know that Boris Johnson will “get Brexit done” by the end of January 2020, what are the implications for English as an official language of the European Union and in the European parliament? Could it stop being used when Britain leaves?In 2016 Danuta Hübner, an MEP and chair of the European parliament’s constitutional affairs committee, was quoted as saying, “If we don’t have the UK, we don’t have English.” But is it as simple as that?Until the 1990s, the dominant language of the EU was French. When the EU was the EC (European Community) and the official language policy was defined, Dutch, French, German and Italian were identified as the working languages. However, as more countries joined, many of which had English as a second or additional language, the number of English speakers grew until English became the majority common language.Currently, the EU lists 24 official and working languages. The UK is the only member country that gives English as its official language. There are a few member countries that commonly use English but have nominated a different language as their EU official language. For instance, the Republic of Ireland gives Irish Gaelic as its official language, and Malta gives Maltese.When Britain withdraws from the EU (and leaving aside possible negotiations with Scotland or other territories), in order to remove English as an official language, as clarified in a statement on behalf of the European commission in Ireland dated 27 June 2016, there would have to be a unanimous vote in the European parliament in favour of doing so. Speaking at the time of the referendum, in 2016, the German EU commissioner Günther Oettinger explained, “We have a series of member states that speak English, and English is the world language which we all accept.” So, even if there was the will to do so, getting rid of English wouldn’t be straightfoward.Even if it did come to that, would it be a knock-down blow for the language? Historically, English has weathered a number of storms. When colonies of the British empire sought to gain their independence, it may have seemed logical for English – the language of the oppressors – to be rejected at the same time. The fact that this did not happen, and that English is used as an official first or second language in more than 70 countries worldwide, points in part to its developing socioeconomic and political status during the 20th century. The number of speakers for whom English is an unofficial second or foreign language is greater than all other English language speakers, and continues to grow. With the decline of the British empire came the rise of the United States, which has English as its official language. Prof Lynne Murphy from the University of Sussex believes the US saved the English language. From the perspective of its use as a global lingua franca, she has got a point.In fact, in some postcolonial situations, English is regarded as a more or less neutral language. In India, for example, English was supposed to be phased out post-independence in 1947 in favour of Hindi. However, as not everyone in India speaks Hindi, and many do not want to for various cultural and political reasons, English continued to be used, and is now an official language of India. In Hong Kong, English is still an official language despite the return of the territory to the People’s Republic of China in 1997. As Hong Kong is an international hub for trade and finance, this makes pragmatic sense, but there is also evidence that Hong Kong people feel that the English language is part of their identity – something that makes Hong Kong distinctive from mainland China. Singapore has speakers of Malay, Chinese (various dialects) and Tamil, among others in this context, English is a unifying language.But these Englishes are not “British English”, or even “American English”. The Englishes spoken around the world have developed their own vocabulary and grammar Euro-English is no exception. English simply does not belong to traditional “native” English speakers any more: it belongs to everyone who speaks it, and it will develop and change depending on the communicative needs of speech communities. Brits and Americans need to bear this in mind when using English in international settings, as they cannot assume they will be understood by every English speaker.So, will English cease to be a language of the EU? Probably not in the short to medium term, either in conversations between EU member countries, MEPs, or in EU interaction with other countries around the world. One Swedish MEP even suggested that communications in the EU could be fairer in English, as it will be everyone’s second language. In the long term, however, the continued dominance of English as a global language may depend on its political and socioeconomic fortunes. As it is so well-established and widespread, I believe it is likely to be used as a global lingua franca for some time. But situations and languages change. I think it was Andy Hamilton who pointed out that, once Latin was everyone’s second language, it was no longer anyone’s first.• Jane Setter is professor of phonetics at the University of Reading"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f1314024538f8449ff732e089df245236ec060c/256_0_5587_3353/master/5587.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a4a8f497746fa4667242ab757f3010a","title":"britain churches cathedrals anglican","story":"While parish church attendance continues to fall, cathedrals are becoming much-needed cultural and therapeutic hubsAs a church-lover but not church-goer, I despair at the looming presence in the centre of almost every city, town and village of what the radical bishop of Worcester, John Inge, deplores as “locked mausoleums marginal to the lives of their communities”. A quarter of the 15,000 Anglican parish churches now have fewer than 16 worshippers, with a large and historic building at their disposal left empty six days a week. That building was paid for by the tithes of local people. The government rightly prevents it from being demolished, as embodying local identity, memory and craftsmanship. The prospect is of these churches going the way of medieval castles, to become barricaded vacant ruins, as Philip Larkin wrote, “A shape less recognisable each week  A purpose more obscure.”I cannot believe they are beyond reuse. One avenue might be termed traditional. It lies in a recent survey of GPs who complained that they were becoming “the new clergy”. Ever more people have no symptoms beyond loneliness and despair. They say, “Doctor, I’m not sure there is any point to all this.” Doctors dare not prescribe churchgoing even for devout patients, though I am told some do have a priest on call. One practice in Cumbria is even a joint vicar’sdoctor’s surgery: “The vicar will see you now.” I once visited a council estate in Leeds, where the vicar told me he was the last professional person living anywhere nearby. Teachers, doctors, social workers, police officers had all fled. His door was an all-purpose port of call for those in distress. He was alone on the frontline where the welfare state was in retreat, his priestly duty of dispensing comfort and support overlapping with that of the therapist and care-worker. For many people, there must be some complementarity between faith and healing. One thing to be said for the established church is that, unlike much of social care, it has not all but given up.Another clue lies in the experience of cathedrals. Sanctity as such is clearly no barrier to popularity. While a few, such as Peterborough and Guildford, are in financial trouble, most English cathedrals are doing fine. Everywhere they offer catering, shopping and a performance stage. There has been golf at Rochester, skateboarding at Gloucester, a helter-skelter at Norwich. Liverpool is never still. St Albans is the cultural focus of its city.Somehow, cathedrals have contrived to snap free of the sectarian exclusivity of the parish church. They answer to a longing for congregation and communal space. Their key is a quality unfashionable to social analysis, the offer of solitude with beauty. You need not to be of faith to sit quietly and contemplate the loveliness of a cathedral. As a dean once hinted to me in a whisper, “Here we don’t bang on about God.” The sociologist Grace Davie described a cathedral as “vicarious religion”, somewhere an inidual can be private, undisturbed and uplifted by architecture and music. To Davie cathedrals catered to “a desire for anonymity, the option to come and go without explanation or commitment”. They are psychotherapy in glass and stone.This quality of therapy through meditating beauty should apply to most churches. But like cathedrals they need to offer more than that. As shopping streets collapse and village and town centres decline, many churches will be the last place of congregation left standing. Some are already branching out as concert halls, meeting rooms, coffee shops, schoolrooms, even post offices, though desperately few. None to the best of my knowledge is a pub.There is no reason beyond determination – and over-rigid planning – why churches should not revert to what they were in the middle ages: one-stop shops for every local service, for advice, therapy, support and company for those in need. This applies especially in rural areas, whose residents are increasingly elderly.I am familiar with the objections. The Church of England must hold a world record for institutional negativity. That is why these buildings must be freed from their present “nationalisation”, and move into the control of parochial councils, trusts or social enterprises, as in Germany and Scandinavia, where they can levy an (optional) local church tax. They must have a primarily secular future.There will always be churches. Those who want them for worship need not fear. Reviving in them a sense of both wonder and purpose might even lead some people from Christmas back to God."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6105aab575f6535f80f785c47b00a90ccab7b6e/0_196_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b9e82ecc3e00c3e54feec1e96dc18ff","title":"compare corbyn labour michael foot neil kinnock","story":"After the disaster of the general election, Labour figures of a certain age started pointedly sharing on social media a video of a conference speech. It is of course Neil Kinnock, in 1985, attacking the “rigid dogma” leading to the “grotesque chaos” of Liverpool’s Labour council, then under the heavy influence of the Trotskyist Militant tendency. The implication didn’t even need to be stated: this is what needs to happen now. A centrist leader such as Kinnock is going to purge you Trots, tack back to the centre and then win an election … in 12 years.It’s history repeating itself, they say. An ineffectual pacifist who didn’t genuflect enough to patriotism – Michael Foot then, Jeremy Corbyn now – led the party to oblivion, and allowed in a horde of far-left “entryists”, who brought the party into disrepute. But who are the entryists today, and who should be purged? The first to name names is a Corbyn-sympathetic figure, Paul Mason, who has already argued that Corbyn staffers Andrew Murray and Seumas Milne are “Stalinists” who must be forced out. “Stalinists” is generally shorthand for ageing trade unionists unable to get with the times with the same ease as ex-Trotskyists such as Mason.But isn’t Momentum just like Militant, you may ask? The latter was a tightly organised Leninist party: a small sect based mainly in Merseyside that collectively joined Labour almost unnoticed in the early 60s it took 20 years for it to control the party’s youth wing, take over several constituency Labour parties and elect three MPs. Following Kinnock’s mass expulsions, Militant had a major role in the campaign against the poll tax, but after its abolition disappeared back into the margins.It’s hard to imagine a more different beast to Momentum – a massive, unwieldy coalition. Its activists tend to be long-term party members – often, like its chair, Jon Lansman, with backgrounds in the post-1968 new left. The new left in Labour – which produced figures as disparate as Ken Livingstone and Margaret Hodge – were much more committed to anti-racist and feminist politics than Militant’s shop-floor Leninism, and saw no need for centralist structures. This meant they never broke the party rulebook in the same way. This can be seen now in the way that Momentum is a strange amalgam of a PR agency, a decentralised activist network and a media organisation, without a deep connection between each part.Momentum has faced its own entryism spats, but they are of a very different cast to those of the 1980s. It’s an open secret that the pro-People’s Vote wing of the Labour left is dominated by members or ex-members of Trotskyist groups such as Mason’s old outfit, Workers’ Power. Lansman at one point had to change Momentum’s entire membership structure to prevent these groups from leading the organisation. But in this case “the Trots” are actually allies of Labour’s centre, and are deeply associated with its questionable second referendum policy.In fact, it makes more sense to compare Corbyn to Kinnock rather than to Foot. Both took over after the dominant wing of Labour had lost a second consecutive general election – 1979 then 1983, 2010 then 2015. Both were subject to horrendous press hate campaigns. Both led – more enthusiastically in Kinnock’s case – campaigns against Labour local authorities, for illegal spending to build council houses in Liverpool, and for planning to sell off council houses in a property boondoggle in Haringey. Both of them aimed to adapt to “new times”, acknowledging, respectively, that in the 1980s Thatcherism had dismantled the old Labour class coalition, making the young, working population likely to vote Tory and that the 2008-09 financial crisis had made Blairism’s giddy bubble economics extremely implausible.Both conclusions were bitterly resisted by the old guard, but their attempts to seize the leadership – Tony Benn in 1988, Owen Smith in 2016 – were swatted away with ease, as they had no new ideas, and could easily be told “we know where that leads – defeat”, whether the “longest suicide note in history” or the “Ed Stone”.Most of all, it seems Kinnock and Corbyn share the fact that each losing two consecutive elections themselves didn’t lead to their total discrediting within the party. This has led to surprise outside Labour, but it’s logical – both Kinnock and Corbyn, though both avoiding any major rulebook changes (unlike, say, Blair) were overwhelmingly popular with most members, even after their defeats (though Corbyn never had it from the parliamentary party). As the positioning of MPs such as Keir Starmer and Clive Lewis has already made clear, most candidates in the upcoming leadership election will stand as post-Corbyn, not anti-Corbyn – just as all serious contenders after Kinnock were his conscious heirs.None of this means that some Tony Blair of the left is around the corner to lead Labour to glorious victory. Though Kinnock was radical compared with Blair or Gordon Brown, and faced the vitriolic wrath of Rupert Murdoch because of it, Corbyn’s politics, both imputed and real, were considered a genuine threat to the British state, and his successors will be under enormous pressure to buckle accordingly.Even though, by 1997, a general election victory seemed an open goal for Labour, just to make sure of it the new leader ingratiated himself with the media that had destroyed his predecessor. It is unlikely that any of the current leadership candidates will be able to be quite so ingratiating but what could yet be the same is the crushing of lives and hopes that led to that 1997 Labour government, when it finally arrived, standing on a platform that continued most of the Conservatives’ policies.• Owen Hatherley is an author and the culture editor of Tribune"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3f952fc23e6219aa9793cc73e694e2e1e4fbd03/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=474c0e8b52d1a06e0790bcfce55f558a","title":"union survived decade labour scotland snp","story":"In 2010, Labour’s hold on Scotland looked unshakeable. Ten years on, the SNP dominates and the union is in crisisDespite the rise of nationalism, Scottish politics in 2010 could still resemble old and familiar patterns. I remember the response that Labour canvassers got in a council estate on the outskirts of Coatbridge, a constituency that the sitting MP, a 69-year-old local man, Tom Clarke, had every expectation of winning for the eighth time.Such a complete rout for Labour in 2019 – and such a calamity for unionism – had not been easy to foresee. If anything, the portents in the 2010 election had pointed slightly in the other direction. Gordon Brown, whatever his troubles south of the border, was a name that met a mainly agreeable response on the doorstep. Labour had been 13 years in power, but its vote in Scotland actually went up by 2.5 percentage points. The SNP had managed only six seats – the same as five years earlier – but the arrival of the Cameron-Clegg coalition in Westminster and the start of austerity meant that an old, pre-devolutionary argument could be resurrected: Scotland had a government – and government policies – that it hadn’t voted for. In 2011, the SNP won an outright majority at Holyrood for the first time with a manifesto that, among other things, recommitted the party to a referendum on independence.The riots in London (and in a few other English cities, on a smaller scale) erupted later the same summer.Alex Salmond, then Scotland’s first minister, complained about the needless damage to the tourist industry caused by broadcasters describing the disturbances as “UK riots” when they were confined entirely to England. His unionist critics accused him, quite rightly, of “gloating” and cheap point-scoring, but other people in Scotland had a different reaction. His remarks confirmed a suspicion that England was becoming problematic in an entirely new way: not as the cause of nationalist anger and grievance but as a troubled society to feel sorry for and be separated from.This pitying, uncomprehending view of England spread quickly throughout the world after the EU referendum result in 2016, not least in England itself. But it was on a Hebridean island in 2011 that I first noticed that the traditional nationalist position on the union – that it was oppressive – had been changed to the subtler question of what good it did. Economics and public finance apart – an admittedly large exclusion – the question became harder and harder to answer after 2016. It was, my late Scottish colleague Deborah Orr observed, “like being tied to a man wearing a suicide vest”.This was true, but it ignored the uncomfortable fact that the duke and Alexander were now on the same, unionist side and that the SNP, particularly its deputy leader, Nicola Sturgeon, now framed independence as the most pragmatic route to social justice rather than the best means of preserving and encouraging national identity. No longer could it be labelled a party of “Tartan Tories”. Labour support among the urban underprivileged, particularly in the party’s old strongholds in the western Lowlands, such as Coatbridge, began to collapse.That the unionists won the referendum was little thanks to places such as these, each with their equivalents, just as brimming with disenchantment, in the English Midlands, south Wales and the English north. David Cameron’s too-quick reaction to victory, promising counterbalancing English reforms to those the unionist side had promised Scotland, had its consequences in the SNP’s near total victory – 56 seats out of 59 – in the general election of 2015. But how was deindustrialised England to find its cure or get its revenge? The answer came soon enough, in the form of Brexit and Nigel Farage. In 2014, Alexander had rooted the appeal of both Salmond and Farage in their easy blame of “the other” – Brussels in Farage’s case, and Londonausteritythe ToriesWestminster (“choose your descriptor,” said Alexander) in Salmond’s.Another similarity, not easily predicted, was how the fantastical version of English history embraced by English nationalism would equal and then overtake the Caledonian delusions that the SNP was beginning to shed. It had lain dormant inside the fog of British history since Empire Day was last celebrated, but now sprang angrily to life. There had been claymores in the north there would be Spitfires in the south.The feeling of Britishness began to wither in many of us during this decade, though unionism, its constitutional cousin, should never be written off. The obstacles to Scotland’s success as an independent state, inside the EU but outside the customs border of what remains of the UK, are forbidding, and nationalists tend towards the non-arguments of Brexiteers when confronted with them (“Oh, it’ll work somehow, you’ll see”). The principal friend of the union is exhaustion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b65208bd01b908ac9c816652646bbf0833e027b7/758_80_2057_1235/master/2057.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e5f76cdccfa5345cbcf60b41e1aeffe","title":"moral of the story 2019s boldest culture asked what it means to be good","story":"At a time when deceit is trumping decency, artists from Kanye West to Greta Gerwig and Phoebe Waller-Bridge have taken it upon themselves to pose questions about virtue and privilegeIn Greta Gerwig’s new adaptation of Little Women, a haughty publisher dismisses Jo March’s stories as unfashionable. “Morals don’t sell nowadays,” he tells the aspiring author. “People want to be amused, not preached at.” Hopefully the statute of limitations has expired on spoiling a 151-year-old story: March – an avatar for her creator, Louisa May Alcott – proves him wrong. As has Gerwig, reviving Little Women in a year where a great deal of culture has considered the question of what it means to be good when the answer is less clear than ever.A decade of consciousness-raising via Twitter and Tumblr has complicated the issue, often by using culture and its makers to arbitrate issues of morality, from cultural appropriation to micro- and macro-aggressions. Even the concept of cancel culture ended up getting … cancelled: debunked by critics, often of colour, who pointed out that nobody who had been cast aside for their infractions had gone away or lost much as a result. If so-called cancel culture was actually effective, then Donald Trump’s history of sexually degrading comments (and alleged sexually degrading behaviour) and racist business practices would have impeded his path to the White House – an idea that seems increasingly like a fairytale as the far right mount a successful pushback that has resulted in a moral void in world leadership. Politicians and lower-level scammers have proven that deceit seldom gets in the way of success or power. It’s fallen to children to hold adults to account for the decades of irresponsible, selfish consumption that has accelerated the climate crisis.Art became a space where these matters could be litigated, and tangible change could be reassuringly felt. It was inevitable that the question would resurface in culture, a longstanding concern pressed into new shapes as artists reach for the certainties of family, religion, self-respect and nature. The problem is that there appear to be diametrically opposed views on what constitutes goodness, who sets those standards and who benefits from them. At the start of 2018, New Statesman critic Anna Leszkiewicz wrote about what she called “morality TV”, exploring why “characters on screen are more anxious, guilty and self-hating than ever”. The protagonists of shows including Search Party, Bojack Horseman and The Good Place were obsessed with whether they were good or bad people, she wrote. Almost two years later, that binary has become infinitely granular: not about being good or bad per se, but more the existential consideration of those qualities. At the start of series two of Fleabag, Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s character offers a supercut of the virtuous things she’s done to get her life back on track: exercise, smoothies, sobriety. She is a better person than the mascara-smeared mess who sort of killed her best friend in series one. But – surprise! – all the “new year, new you” tropes can’t fill her cavernous existential holes. Fleabag’s second coming asked that great Russian novel question: how can you live a good life at a time of great suffering when there may or may not be a God?The essays in New Yorker staff writer Jia Tolentino’s debut collection Trick Mirror turned over the complicated motivations behind contemporary performances of virtue – a question that found perhaps its definitive manifestation in Kanye West’s turn towards gospel this year. Critics asked whether his religious awakening was merely a cynical attempt at redemption after a distinctly troubled period that saw him endorse Trump and describe slavery as “a choice”. Admittedly it was difficult to accept West slut-shaming his wife in the name of the Lord on his album Jesus Is King, and to take his invite-only Sunday Service worship sessions – complete with merch including a $50 pair of socks and a $225 sweater – as a sign of a true believer, rather than an untrammelled god complex. But in an episode of the New York Times’s Popcast, gospel critics said the community was welcoming of his forays into the genre. If the Christian response to West is one of forgiveness and acceptance, then cynicism itself becomes suspect.That dynamic, where unexpected circumstances challenged a character’s long-held ideas about what it meant to be good, played out on screen. The two proud nerds of Booksmart are contemptuous of their hard-partying classmates until they learn that the bad kids are, in fact, matching their grades and having fun. Being good has only held their lives hostage. A more X-rated version of that revelation drove in HBO’s Mrs Fletcher. Kathryn Hahn’s titular character, a feminist mother and orcee, is appalled by her teenage son’s degraded sexual politics. But when he leaves for college, she develops a heavy porn habit that offers her unprecedented liberation.Artists further questioned who set the rules around morality and who actually benefits from adhering to them. At the end of Big Little Lies’ first series, it was Bonnie’s decency that drove her to run at Perry as he was strangling his wife, Celeste, pushing him down a flight of stairs and to his death. That sense of virtue returns in series two: no matter that she killed Perry to save Celeste, Bonnie still killed a man, and she falls apart under the pressure of lying. Meanwhile, her wealthy, white peers conceal the deed beneath the veneer that covers their lives, and carry on as before. The outward appearance of being a good father leads readers to sympathise with the newly orced protagonist of Taffy Brodesser-Akner’s novel Fleishman Is in Trouble – until his estranged wife finally enters the frame and offers a sucker-punch perspective flip.Even straightforward matters of justice acquired new wrinkles. In Marielle Heller’s film Can You Ever Forgive Me?, Melissa McCarthy portrays Lee Israel, a biographer on her uppers who resorts to becoming a successful literary forger. It’s a Robin Hood tale: as the breadline recedes into the distance, deception comes to look like a legitimate survival tactic. In Succession, meanwhile, a whistleblower threatens to overthrow Waystar Royco, and we watch Cousin Greg toy with whether to play his ace in service of financial reward or moral fortitude. His privilege – a young white man who has swiftly become accustomed to newfound wealth – means this hapless antihero slyly finds an option that combines both.It’s a rare circumstance. In Rian Johnson’s Knives Out, a wealthy family that telegraphs its liberal credentials through New Yorker subscriptions and conspicuous wokeness becomes outraged when it transpires that the late patriarch, a celebrated author, has left his entire estate to his Latina carer. Marta, the daughter of an undocumented immigrant, appears to have killed him by accidentally and becomes embroiled in the whodunnit. But as his family members are revealed to be conniving and varyingly complicit, Marta exonerates herself – and reveals the true culprit – by always doing the decent thing. She inherits the estate. But the film acts as a sort of reverse Get Out, the rub being that the “good” immigrant can never win: not even model citizens are safe from racist attitudes and immigration policies.Delving into the March sisters’ later lives, she touches on Amy March setting up a foundation to support ambitious women. Gerwig’s film is a comparable yardstick: it’s a testament to her own ambition – to the depth of her research, her renowned care and respect as a director and collaborator – and a film whose politics, success and critical acclaim should create more opportunities for women film-makers in Hollywood. Gerwig has done everything right – and yet she’s been overlooked at the Golden Globes, which generally pave the way for the Oscar nominations.

His models wore them over pleated tutus and bell-shaped suit-dresses, accessorised with papier-mache-looking football helmets, broken umbrellas and headbands in the red, white and blue of the US flag.Browne used the item as a focal point for his show, which revolved around sexual identity. “The codpiece is a whimsical representation of masculinity,” he said. And at the height of its popularity in the 1540s, the item indicated machismo to its Renaissance audience.Victoria Bartels, the author of What Goes Up Must Come Down: A Brief History of the Codpiece, said: “The interesting thing about 16th-century male fashion is the way in which it reveals what was important to men at this time: their preoccupation with masculinity, military prowess and virility.”And it was about signalling power to other men, rather than being a symbol of fecundity. Henry VIII wore it in several portraits, including Hans Holbein the Younger’s Portrait of Henry VIII, c 1536-1537.“I think that they were intended to induce awe,” he said. The book also talks about the fraudulence of the codpiece as an item that promised more than it delivered and contributing to a fabricated, fictionalised version of the male body.“It encouraged concentration on the organ of generation, as if to prove at a stroke or a single overwhelming thrust, and beyond doubt, that man was a mighty and unstoppable factory and machine,” he wrote.This idea of signalling masculine power in the absence of real substance is something that has been used by modernist practitioners of the codpiece, from Blackadder to Darth Vader and Michael Jackson, whose dance moves focused on his crotch even when he was not wearing his golden codpiece.“He was a particularly sad case of self-reconstruction,” Glover said about Jackson. “Every bit of him, from nose to skin to groin, had to be made brightly anew for fandom’s sake.”Shakespeare also picked up on the codpiece. He referenced its dual properties of deception and braggadocio in King Lear and Measure for Measure. In The Two Gentlemen of Verona, Lucetta makes a male costume as a disguise for Julia and says: “You must needs have them with a codpiece, madam … A round hose, madam, now’s not worth a pin unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.”Glover said: “Shakespeare was the great, instinctive etymologist. He knew how words tricked with their double and triple meanings: ‘cod’ as scrotum, ‘to cod’ meaning to cheat.”The current revival in menswear for this 16th-century piece follows the womenswear trend for “Renaissancecore”. The era has been mined by designers from Alexander McQueen to Vivienne Westwood and Simone Rocha. Explaining fashion’s obsession with the era, the designer Gareth Pugh said: “The Tudors were the first power dressers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08d4af9aff09afaa18a8a1496d99a9822d36a9a9/0_338_5315_3189/master/5315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6c8d01020a9676e5b094c3c91e700b0","title":"anna karina catherine deneuve how movies malign women by calling them muses","story":"Male directors have often diminished the highly creative women who inspired them. Will the rise of female film-makers revolutionise the role of ‘muse’?Amid tributes to Anna Karina, who died earlier this month, the word “muse” recurred. As in “the muse of Jean-Luc Godard” or “Karina served as a cinematic muse to Godard”. And in nearly every homage and obituary, you could sense the writer making a valiant effort to acknowledge that Karina was more than just a passive repository of a male auteur’s creativity: that she appeared in films by other renowned directors, starred in a TV musical (Anna) with songs by Serge Gainsbourg, made albums, did theatre, wrote and directed two films, and wrote four novels.But it is Godard’s attempts to define and contain Karina’s allure that gives his early films much of their appeal. Time and again, the performer transcends her material, giving it that extra je ne sais quoi even when the writing leaves something to be desired. (Godard seems to have trouble conceiving that the female experience revolves around anything other than prostitution, duplicity, or wanting babies.) It is symptomatic that during the Madison dance scene in Bande à Part (1964), when the male narrator – Godard himself – voices Odile’s inner thoughts, he informs us she is thinking about her breasts. (According to male authors, we think about our breasts all the time, as satirised by the much-quoted meme: “She breasted boobily to the stairs, and titted downwards.”)The dictionary reminds us the Muses were sister-goddesses who inspired learning and the arts. The “muse” came to represent artistic inspiration in the abstract, and was then popularly incarnated as the female model or lust object of a male artist. Only now is it being acknowledged that the creative achievements of celebrated muses such as Kiki de Montparnasse or Dora Maar, as artists in their own right, were overshadowed by famous male artists’ portrayals of them in paintings, photographs or films. Maar currently has a retrospective at Tate Modern in London.Likewise, the relationship between muse and film-maker has traditionally been regarded as that of a male auteur and his female acteur fétiche, often an offscreen lover, over whom he wields a Trilby-like influence. For The Blue Angel, Joseph von Sternberg transformed an actress he reportedly found “bovine and charmless” into one of the most iconic presences of the 20th century, but in the seven films they made together, Marlene Dietrich learned so much about lighting and camera angles that it is no longer possible to tell where one’s contribution ends and the other’s begins.François Truffaut once said of Catherine Deneuve: “I wouldn’t compare her to a flower or a bouquet, since there is a certain neutrality in her that leads me to compare her to the vase in which all the flowers are placed.” He meant that her reserve and air of mystery enabled spectators to “fill the vase” themselves but the history of male film directors and their female muses is also a history of vase-filling: men translating their erotic fantasies into cinematic terms while failing to get to grips with the women themselves, who are invariably depicted as quixotic and inscrutable, even dangerous.But while it is the male film-makers who are hailed as creators, actors such as Karina, or Monica Vitti for Michelangelo Antonioni, have creative agency, too, even if their contributions tend to be dismissed as some mysterious life force, or “naturalness”. The history of male auteurs and their female muses is essentially a history of “othering” women, even if the flower arrangements can be bewitching in themselves in their presentation of the self, the creation of a persona, the playing around with behaviour and appearance and pose.There are partnerships that are recognised by critics as collaborations of equals – that of Gena Rowlands and John Cassavetes, for example – but the mythology surrounding the male gaze still holds sway. It’s the man who is the artist, while the woman provides the empty vase. Conversely, if it’s a male actor filling a muse-like function for his male director, it’s considered a meeting of best mates in which the performer is perceived to have creative parity, like Robert De Niro remoulding himself for a Martin Scorsese film, or a clash of alpha-male egos – such as Klaus Kinski and Werner Herzog threatening to kill each other.With a rising number of female directors, I wonder whether we will see a corresponding proliferation of male muses. Of the three films Joanna Hogg made with Tom Hiddleston, it’s only in the first, Unrelated, that he is presented as an object of desire, lolling sun-kissed and shirtless in the Tuscan landscape. But the torch was passed to another actor, the excellent Tom Burke, for this year’s The Souvenir. Perhaps there would have been more onscreen heat in the stubbornly unsexy Fifty Shades of Grey if director Sam Taylor-Johnson had been able to cast her husband, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, as Christian Grey. It may never happen: female auteurism is likely to develop along lines very different from the male version. More collaborative, and less flower arranging."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5251a949d2511635dd68c9958129c9c51feb3542/0_124_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=960d5efb183a3579c360218690d27a48","title":"decade in cinema hollywood monsters netflix auteurs motion smoothing movies daytime tv","story":"Hollywood’s monsters were exposed, streaming services embraced auteurs and ‘motion smoothing’ made the movies look like daytime TVThe long decade closes with no consensus on what we were supposed to call it (the “teens”?) nor about what ground has been gained or lost in the big cinema debates of the past 10 years. Steven Spielberg warned of a colossal evolutionary crisis in theatrical distribution, whereby the film business becomes over reliant annually on three or four big “tentpole” movies that will then crash, leaving us with the movie equivalent of 2008 or even 1929. And the tentpoles that everyone is betting on are the superhero films, which Spielberg warned will go the way of the western. Well, this hasn’t happened yet.So a new herovillain has arisen: Marvel Studios, which has enjoyed a staggering explosion of box-office popularity, blessed by cinema chains for providing surefire hits, but increasingly loathed by cinephiles for dumbing down the movies. Martin Scorsese, in his widely shared New York Times article, expanded his personal view that superhero films are just glorified theme-park rides without the inidual artistry and humanity of real cinema.But Scorsese created a controversy of his own by taking his new film to Netflix. Two of the best films of the year, Scorsese’s The Irishman and Noah Baumbach’s Marriage Story, are Netflix products, released in cinemas for a short while and then absorbed on to the site to attract new subscribers and gratify existing ones.And it’s not just Netflix. One of the best films of this year – and the decade – was Beanpole, by the brilliant young Russian director Kantemir Balagov it had a handful of big-screen showings at the London film festival, then went straight to Mubi streaming. It’s an awful shame, although the streaming sites offer large-scale viewer access and hospitality to newer, younger film-makers. (And for independent arthouse films to exist only briefly in cinemas is nothing new.)As for superhero films (Gen-Z westerns), there is no doubt that many studio executives are mesmerised by their bankability and less likely to take a punt on other genres of film. I have, however, written about tendencies that are more worrying: high frame-rate and “motion smoothing” on new TVs that can make films clearer, but flatter and blander, like daytime TV. As for cinema admissions, they are holding pretty steady at 170m annually in the UK, helped by the investment in the cinema-going experience – although the novelty of getting food delivered to your seat is surely a step too far.In this decade, Hollywood woke up, or was rudely awakened, to issues of ersity and social justice by the #OscarsSoWhite and #MeToo movements, driven by social media. Voting membership of the Academy has also been changed to bring in a younger generation, women and people of colour. Harvey Weinstein may be about to reach a deal in the civil courts, to the outrage of many, but Roman Polanski has faced a resurgence of discontent with his reputation. His new film, An Officer and a Spy – although favourably received on the film festival circuit – has had no UK showing.The question of ersity (so long disputed by men of a certain age who wish to be congratulated on their courage in rejecting “quotas”) is far from answered, but new voices are emerging in Britain with fascinating and brilliant films. There is outstanding work from female British film-makers such as Carol Morley, Joanna Hogg, Clio Barnard and Rungano Nyoni – and elsewhere, great directors such as Kelly Reichardt, Anna Biller, Lucrecia Martel, Chloé Zhao and Debra Granik.As for auteur cinema, some commentators have found it too bound up in male privilege. But great – even historic – work has come from Jessica Hausner, Mia Hansen-Løve and Martel, as well as established silverbacks such as Quentin Tarantino, Yorgos Lanthimos and Paul Thomas Anderson, whose most recent film, Phantom Thread, was the curtain-call for that extraordinary acting talent, Daniel Day-Lewis. From Asia, Hirokazu Kore-eda, Jia Zhangke and Bong Joon-ho have continued to produce dazzling work. But if there is a big auteur whose stock is a bear market, it has to be Abdellatif Kechiche, whose multi-part epic of sexiness, Mektoub My Love, is increasingly baffling.The decade’s other great issue is Brexit – and it is remarkable how movies in the UK have failed to address it (although the new romcom Last Christmas, for all its ickiness, does mention the B-word and attempt to dramatise its attendant issues). From within the industry, producers such as Eric Fellner and Jeremy Thomas are railing against the woeful ision that it is opening up, especially with regard to the free movement of people and equipment across the Channel. Brexit burdens film with a bureaucratic nightmare.With the decade coming to an end, I am optimistic about many of the issues I wrote about to mark the half-decade, especially the way digital technology has enabled young film-makers to get their work made, and raise money for new work, through sites such as Indiegogo and Kickstarter. I am less happy about the state of documentary. Five years ago, we were in the middle of a “surge” now I am seeing documentaries that feel lightweight, sometimes almost negligible, often taking refuge in postmodern self-reference about the chaotic difficulties of making documentaries. Perhaps there are – at present – too many documentarians chasing too few genuinely strong subjects.Britain has endured austerity for the past 10 years, so it is extraordinary how documentaries have not reflected this. It has been left to the eightysomething veteran Ken Loach (in partnership with the screenwriter Paul Laverty) to tackle the issue directly and simply with I, Daniel Blake and Sorry We Missed You.Perhaps the other issue is the nature of criticism itself. It is tiresome and self-pitying for critics to complain about social media – especially as social media has done so much to galvanise and invigorate criticism – but in the teens there was more retrenchment, more abuse. Along with a handful of other critics, I disliked Joker, the new origin myth movie for Batman’s great villain, starring Joaquin Phoenix. But whatever that film’s problems, it is incomparably more interesting and intelligent than its online fanboy trolls and hatebombers, though I was spared the misogyny that women writers experienced on this subject.What is extraordinary is how threatened people still are by dissenting opinion, an aggressive neurosis that is probably intensified by the bizarre consensus machine Rotten Tomatoes and its meaninglessly pseudo-scientific ratings that paralyse the idea of considered analysis. Inidual critical voices are what count what count even more are inidual film-making talents."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/933aa40080dfdce96d2e9082dff29228c07ba389/0_28_1955_1173/master/1955.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a92d9c919fbf4c75a18334d1d84c4264","title":"veganuary food ideas meera sodha meal plan recipes","story":"’s vegan columnist has plant-based tips for breakfast, lunch and dinner, plus snacks to stop you falling off the ‘vagon’When I first started my vegan column, I gave myself a month before I’d have to hand in my notice. As an omnivore (admittedly one that ate little meat but a lot of dairy and eggs), I just couldn’t imagine writing recipes week after week with such a strict set of rules, let alone enjoy eating plant-based food on a regular basis. But then, something wonderful happened.Taking meat, fish, dairy or eggs out of cooking became a catalyst for creativity, forcing me, and many other chefs and food writers, to think in new and interesting ways about how to extract the most flavour and pleasure from the same old characters in the vegetable drawer.I discovered that the Asian larder, replete with its fermented and pickled ingredients such as kimchi and miso, could add flavour to meals in an instant. I reacquainted myself with the thrill of pulses and turning dry beans into nourishing meals, and I realised that cakes can be just as rich and fluffy and velvety without dairy and eggs.During the two and a half years that I’ve been writing the column, the innovation in plant-based food in recipe-writing, restaurant menus and even ready meals has been of an unprecedented breadth and scale. Vegan food is an exciting, easier and more delicious way to eat than ever.I am doing Veganuary this year in the main because I want to show you how enjoyable it can be. But also, because what we choose to put on our plates undeniably impacts the world around us. You, however, might be doing it because you feel bloated after the annual Christmas meat-fest or because it’s cheaper than eating meat, for reasons of animal welfare or just because Natalie Portman does it.For whatever reason, I’m here to help you through the next weeks with my meal plans.A few tips. The best advice I can give you is to make a plan of all the things you want to eat. Perhaps write them down here then make a shopping list based on that. If time is not on your side, focus on dinner. Breakfast could be cereal and lunch a throw-together affair involving pitta bread, jarred antipasti and a dollop of hummus. And finally, if a piece of ham should accidentally fall into your mouth this week, get back up and keep on going.I can’t promise a new you after a week, but you might think, like I now do, that plant-based is both achievable and delicious – and that thought may give you the freedom of choice over what you eat, which might just make you feel alive, well and hungry for more.Breakfast is easy – just be sure to stock up on some good vegan milk. My preference is for Oatly because it’s great in tea, coffee and porridge. Anna Jones has your back with this DIY instant porridge (below) or if you’ve got no time in the morning, try making Felicity Cloake’s bircher muesli the night before. Or else, buy granola. No one’s judging and besides, Dorset Cereals make a great one.On the weekend, try a tofu scramble, which is not by any means a substitute for egg, but a serious contender. Yotam Ottolenghi has a harissa recipe and I have a Parsi-style akuri, made using tomatoes, chilli and ginger.These days, every supermarket, food chain and cafe has as many chickpea wraps, soups and salads as you can shake a celery stick at. But if you want to make your own, the easiest route is to make extra at dinner and pack leftovers. Or, for a quick from-scratch throw-together option, consider Rosie Birkett’s broccoli and peanut noodles or her orzo and roast cauliflower salad.I’d suggest starting with a big pot of delicious beans so there’s something in the fridge this week. Try either my Iraqi white bean stew or this satisfying coconut dal with lime kale and some boiled rice alongside.During the week, you need meals built with speed in mind, but without compromise on flavour. How about this wild mushroom ragout with ziti by David Tanis, or Nigel Slater’s purple sprouting broccoli with cashews and tofu?Feeling the need for something fresh? This rice noodle salad with cucumber and poppy seeds ought to do the job.Friday night is curry night in the Sodha household. Might I recommend my Thai green curry? Feel free to play around with the vegetables, and don’t let the list of ingredients fool you – most get thrown into a blender and whizzed up into a quick curry paste.Welcome to the weekend. Treat yourself to these Anna Jones instant tacos and pop Ottolenghi’s ultimate tray bake ragu in the oven.Sweet tooth? This carrot, apple and orange cake from Gaz Oakley looks perfect, or these raspberry and coconut thumb print cookies from Ruby Tandoh.Now sit back, relax and congratulate yourself for getting to the end of the first week.

But, not for the first time this season, they lacked sangfroid in the heat of this extraordinary battle and that cost them dearly. It is, in fairness, very hard to stay cool when being attacked by this excellent Wolves team – and when trying to chase down Liverpool, who are now 14 points clear of City with a match in hand.Given the size of that lead, Pep Guardiola says his team’s most realistic ambition is to reclaim second place from Leicester. He said if they relent in their pursuit, they risk missing out on the top four. “We cannot prioritise cup competitions because if so, next season we will not be in Europe,” he said. “We have to think about Leicester. We have a chance to recover second position.”For a while it looked like City would triumph here with the aid of VAR and over remarkable adversity, including self-inflicted wounds. Ederson was sent off in the 12th minute for clattering into Diogo Jota outside his area, then Raheem Sterling had the same contentiously awarded penalty saved twice by Rui Patrício. Yet still 10-man City established a two-goal lead. First Sterling rolled in the rebound from his retaken penalty, then he scored in the second half to move tantalisingly close to victory.But not close enough. Wolves, again inspired by the phenomenal Adama Traoré, came storming back with three exquisite goals in the last 35 minutes. Traoré scored the first of them before creating an equaliser for Raúl Jiménez, who later played a beautiful pass to tee up Matt Doherty for a winning goal that ignited wild celebrations at Molineux. And, no doubt, on Merseyside.Guardiola’s plans ran into a complication even before kick-off here, as illness afflicted Gabriel Jesus and forced City to draft in Sergio Agüero. An aristocrat’s problem if ever there was one, but City had wanted to ease their record goalscorer back into action after a thigh injury and would have preferred not to make this the match in which he made his first start for over two months.As it turned out, Agüero was invited to rest up again after only 12 minutes, as Guardiola had to sacrifice him to introduce a replacement goalkeeper following the dismissal of Ederson. The referee, Martin Atkinson, ordered the keeper off after he charged out of his box and brought down Jota, who beat him to a pass over the top by Conor Coady. In came Claudio Bravo for his first Premier League appearance since November’s defeat at Liverpool. João Moutinho’s free-kick made for a comfortable reintroduction. Neither manager grumbled about the red card, nor would they offer their views on what happened in the 22nd minute – but the home crowd were not coy about expressing their anger at the decision to award City a penalty when Riyad Mahrez fell spectacularly in the box following contact with Leander Dendoncker. The infringement was not apparent to most people in the stadium but this is the age of mass surveillance: VAR spotted Dendoncker treading on the Algerian’s foot.Patrício saved Sterling’s penalty but then, again on the recommendation of VAR, the referee ordered it to be retaken due to encroachment. Patrício made another save but was helpless to stop the relieved Sterling from stroking in the rebound. A few bozos in the stands vented their anger by flinging objects on to the pitch. The Football Association has opened an investigation.City did well to protect their lead until half-time. Guardiola replaced Mahrez during the break with 18-year-old Eric Garcia as City buttressed their defence. Wolves soon showed the tempo that the youngster would have to get used to, as Jiménez and Jota cut through City’s backline with wicked finesse. Jota flicked the ball over the bar after running on to the Mexican’s lovely looped pass.Soon Sterling produced an even finer chip. After being released by Kevin De Bruyne, Sterling ran into the box and did what he had been unable to do from the penalty spot, beating Patrício with a deadly dink.That gave City an extra cushion but they could not sit comfortably for long. Five minutes later Sterling lost possession in midfield to Rúben Neves, who helped the ball on to Traoré, whose devastating directness City have learned to dread. After scoring twice at the Etihad, he slashed City’s lead here by ramming a long-range shot into the bottom corner.Wolves attacked in waves after that. Traoré almost found a way through them again but was foiled by Bravo. City enjoyed a let-off as Romain Saïss nodded wide from six yards. Then Rodri made a critical intervention at the back post to deny Doherty.As City clung on, Benjamin Mendy tried to shepherd the ball out of play near the byline, a decision that Traoré soon made him regret. The Spaniard shunted the defender aside before crossing for Jiménez to slide the ball into the net from close range. Doherty then struck a superb winning goal, running in from the right and exchanging slick passes with Jiménez before firing into the net.In the dying seconds Sterling struck a free-kick against the crossbar. There was to be no happy ending for City. “We have to adjust mentally to the situation and prepare the next games,” said Guardiola."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73fa1ca74d980d851c59b2c30308bab41d04b65a/560_32_1992_1195/master/1992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=824d74c19a098f501bd9c24c45876216","title":"wolves v manchester city premier league live","story":"Wolves came from two goals behind against 10-man City to leave Pep Guardiola’s side’s faint title hopes in tattersPep Guardiola has popped up.

Bye!Here’s the beaming Wolves manager Nuno Espírito Santo:As well as Wolves played, City ultimately paid the price for Ederson’s sending off in the first half. Wolves are a difficult team to face with 11 men but with 10 men for 79 minutes, there was always going to be a tired error in that City defence. Wolves got better as the game wore on. Traore was immense and Jimenez was so good in all aspects of his game. His hold up play and clever touches held Wolves’ play together. Wolves face Liverpool at Anfield next. One imagines this game will have taken too much out of them to cause another shock but you never know. With the Champions League places only two points away they will find energy from somewhere. Adama Traore, who really is a thorn in City’s side, speaks: This team is amazing. We fight till the end. Whatever the occasion, whatever the difficulty. Every one of us has been working so hard and believing.So Manchester City are 14 points behind Liverpool, who have a game in hand. Leicester remain second by a point with City in third. Molineux is a madhouse.There are huge cheers in Molineux (and Merseyside) as the final whistle blows. What a match! 90+3 min: Jimenez is substituted as Wolves look to see out the clock. There are olés from the Wolves fans as their players keep possession. Steady now …90+2 min: Sterling curls a delicious effort over the wall but the ball clips the bar. 90 min: There’ll be four minutes for City to try and salvage a point from this. Traore barges into Sterling and gives away a free-kick on the edge of the box. It’s 20 yards out in a central position. Where’s De Bruyne when you need him? It looks like Sterling will hit it …They’ve only gone and done it! Doherty plays a one-two with Jimenez on the edge of the box. Otamendi lunges in and misses and Doherty passes the ball into teh far corner with great composure. Is that City’s title challenge well and truly knacked? 88 min: Otamendi goes down after an innocuous challenge. I imagine he’s trying to take the wind out of Wolves’ sails. 86 min: “Traore is captivating to watch. A dazzling array of step overs, shimmies and dummies before laying off a simple five-yard pass. Imagine being out for a meal and asking him to pass the salt - 15 minutes later you’re still waiting as he somersaults round the restaurant with the cellar between his bum cheeks,” writes Stephen Carr (probably before Traore played a simple cross in for Jimenez’s goal). I get where you’re coming from though Stephen. It’s like he has to do a moonwalk before everything else he does. 85 min: At least Otamendi and Bravo can say it wasn’t them. 84 min: The question now is will Wolves go for the winner? Traore certainly wants to. He’s pleading for the ball whenever his teammates get it. Oh Mendy! The full-back tries to shield the ball as it is drifting out of play but Traore nudges into him and scoops the ball from beneath his legs before zipping a low cross into the six-yard box for Jimenez to tap home. Guardiola will be furious with Mendy. He should have cleared it. 78 min: Traore slaloms his way past Bernardo Silva and bursts towards the City box but Doherty mis-controls as Traore finds him coming up in support to his right. It’s like Traore is running on a different operating system to his teammates. He’s too quick for them. 77 min: It’s another wonderful cross into the six-yard box that Saiss gets to again, flicking the ball towards Doherty on the back post … but a touch from Rodri on to Doherty’s head prevents the Wolves defender from nodding it into the gaping goal. That was fine defending by the City midfielder. 76 min: Sterling drags Jota to the floor over near the corner flag. Moutinho is set to deliver another dangerous cross. 73 min: Wolves go so close! Moutinho whips in a delicious ball that Saiss flicks across goal and past the far post by an inch. Bravo was rooted to his line. Wolves are building up the pressure. 71 min: City are defending admirably. Wolves’ only real outlet is Traore. He’s not a bad outlet, mind. He’s just whipped in another cross but it’s too deep for Jimenez. Walker gives a free-kick away on the left. It’s a decent position five yards in from the corner flag. Jonny is taken off and Vinagre is on. 69 min: Saiss has a pop at goal from distance and then Traore dances inside his marker and makes room for a shot at goal with his left foot that he buries into Bravo’s belly. 68 min: City have used all their substitutes. Kyle Walker’s bum is probably getting twitchy. He’ll be praying that Bravo behaves himself. 67 min: And that’s De Bruyne’s last action of the match. Gundogan replaces him. De Bruyne looks miffed and Guardiola looks to be explaining that they have another match in about seven minutes. 66 min: De Bruyne fakes to do a dragback and then knocks the ball out his feet to make the space to shoot. But, and you’ll never believe this, he drags his shot wide like any ordinary Joe might. 64 min: Traore has got his dancing shoes on now. He shimmies past two City players and dinks a cross into the box … but City clear. 63 min: Dendocker fires a shot at goal from 25 yards. It bounces in front of Bravo but the goalkeeper gets two solid gloves on it and keeps hold. 62 min: Beep! Beep! Beep! That’s the sound of City’s defence reversing. Wolves are pop, pop, popping passes around the edge of City’s area. They work the ball out to Traore, who delivers a fine cross to Jimenez at the back post but after the striker brings the ball down with a feather-toed touch, his shot is blocked60 min: Otamendi swipes at Jota and sends him into the air near the touchline. It’s a clear foul and a booking to boot. Moutinho whips in the free-kick but this time Fernandinho heads clear. 59 min: Moutinho whips it in and Otamendi heads into the air for Bravo to collect. De Bruyne wants an early throw from Bravo so City can break but the goalkeeper’s having none of it. 58 min: Wolves win a free-kick wide on the left. It’s a lovely angle to curl one in from. 56 min: A moment before that goal, Jimenez fired wide by a couple of inches. It’s wide open now. We’ll be seeing more goals. I’m sure of that. Sterling is loose in possession. Traore picks the ball up just outside the box and drives at goal before hammering home across Bravo and into the far corner. That was an unerring finish. Game on! 52 min: Jota goes down after a coming together with Walker in the box. Jonny hits the deck a moment later after feeling a push from Rodri. There’s a VAR check on both but “No Penalty” is the decision. I think VAR is right but who knows these days. What a goal this is! Rodri drops deep to collect the ball in midfield. He turns and slides the ball towards De Bruyne, who slices the Wolves defence open with a first-time pass behind Dendoncker to Sterling. The forwards scurries into the box and lifts the ball over Rui Patricio with nonchalant ease. Fantastic! 49 min: City enjoy a spell of possession before Otamendi gifts the ball back to Wolves with an errant punt forwards. 47 min: Jota stabs over the bar after Jimenez scooped a delightful ball over the defence and into the little forward’s path. He had to hit it on the half-volley so it wasn’t easy but he was only 15 yards out and Bravo was beaten if he’d controlled it. What a chance! 45 min: The 18-year-old defender Eric Garcia is on for Riyad Mahrez. This could be a slog of a second half for City, who will likely play 5-3-1 now. Justin Kavanagh is back for more! “Scrap the Christmas Carol narrative, Gregg. What with Pep’s team now getting a taste of its own weekly medicine (having to defend for 90 minutes), this has turned into A Tale of Two Cities. And we’ll see just how good the other one is now.” To be fair to them, they have been very solid but I fancy there will be an Oh Claudio! or Oh Nicolas! moment before the game is done. “Earlier this season Jefferson Lerma stepped on David Silva’s foot in the penalty area and VAR looked at it and decided it wasn’t a penalty. Great job all around!” writes JR in Illinois. “But really, you’ve got to laugh at the way VAR has been rolled out. I really shouldn’t be surprised considering the own goal of Brexit that y’all have inflicted on yourselves but yet somehow still am. (And I also understand that no one from the US should be laughing at anyone else considering what we’ve got cooking over here).”“When Pep said earlier today that replacing Aguero would be a tough task, I think nobody would have put a penny on Claudio Bravo being the man,” honks Admir Pajic.“What a thankless task you have, in simply trying to describe a football game that many of your readers don’t have the benefit of watching,” writes Charles Robinson. “I’m not sure if Peter Adams had his tongue in his cheek earlier, but was Ederson’s contact on Jota minimal? Yes, but he clipped his shoulder, and it was a sending off. Was the contact on Mahrez from Dendonker minimal? Yes, but he trod on his foot, so it was a penalty. Should the penalty have been retaken? Yes, because two Wolves players were in the box when Sterling took it. Was the decision, as you describe it, ‘overly fussy’? Perhaps, but it was still correct. All the key decisions from VAR have so far been spot on, and you’ve called it right.” I think Peter’s tongue was firmly in cheek, earlier, Charles.“Since encroachment is a technical offence and doesn’t really put off the taker, it seems harsh to award another penalty. Maybe an indirect free kick from where the defender makes the clearance would be fairer,” writes Tom in New Zealand. Well, that was eventful. City have defended with Benítez-like efficiency since being reduced to 10 men. I’ll be back with your half-time missives when I’ve made a cuppa. 45+7 min: City play the free-kick deep. Wolves win the ball back but play a long ball into the corner that runs out of play – and that should be that for this half. 45+6 min: Moutinho slides in and brings Sterling down and City should get the chance to survive until half-time. 45+4 min: Traore scuffs a shot wide from the edge of the area and then Jota tries to dribble through the City defence but is stopped by Otamendi. City are clinging on for half-time. They’re just hoofing it clear when they regain possession. Back come Wolves …45+2 min: Bernardo chests the ball and is penalised for handball out by the touchline on the right. That was never handball. What a ridiculous decision! Moutinho floats the free-kick in and City clear. The ball is knocked back in towards Coady on the back post but he can’t stretch to reach it. 45 min: Neves bangs a shot at goal from somewhere near Birmingham and Bravo saves easily. That was a waste. It’s like he hit that out of anger at everything that has gone before it in this evening’s game. There’ll be seven minutes of injuryVAR time. Yikes! 44 min: Moutinho curls a delicious ball forwards to Jimenez’s feet. The striker takes a touch and creates space for a curler, but his shot doesn’t have any venom in it and floats into Bravo’s grateful gloves. 43 min: Jonny dinks a cross in towards Jimenez from the left, but Bravo collects comfortably. 42 min: “On Wolves, every time the commentator says ‘Here’s Jonny’ I chuckle to myself, especially when you consider the dark mood at Molineux at the moment.” Ciaran Boland lightens the mood. 40 min: Wolves are increasing the tempo and making it very difficult for City to keep possession. Even De Bruyne struggled to find his way out of a tight spot then. Doherty hooks a cross into the box, it’s hoofed into the air by Otamendi and then is scrambled away. Jonny curls a cross in from the left that Traore volleys into a City defender and then City clear. Back come Wolves, though. They’re building up a head of steam …37 min: Wolves have appeared a little shellshocked since the penalty incident. They haven’t been able to get going. City’s shape has been very good, mind. I think Wolves’ best chance of getting back in this game will be committing to a high press. There’s a mistake in Otamendi and Bravo. 35 min: “So just to be sure Gregg it was minimal contact on Jota and a definite red. It was minimal contact on Mahrez and it’s harsh penalty. Does that Wolves shirt you got for Christmas fit well?” scolds Peter Adams. It’s a bit small Peter. I might have to take it back. I think the difference is that Dendoncker appeared to be running in step with Mahrez and not deliberately challenging him. But I do understand why it was given. Had his heel not been clipped he wouldn’t have fallen over. 32 min: Bravo has just had a wobble. Jimenez put the press on the substitute goalkeeper, who walloped the ball out of play. There’s also been confirmation that a drinks container was thrown at Sterling after the City forward scored.

Jack Monroe thanks the calm, reassuring presence who has helped her through 10 years of motherhoodIt’s been nearly 10 years now, and I’ve never really managed to put into words what I’m about to say, because the words are so big, and so small, and there are so many to choose from, unspoken, unbidden, I never really know where to start. So I’ll start from the beginning.I still remember the first day we met, at the Basildon coffee shop we worked in. I was new and you were laughing as you showed me the ropes: how to froth the milk differently for a cappuccino and a latte how to pour the coffee so the crema on the top was just right. You were patient with my clumsiness, and everybody respected you, and more importantly, enjoyed your company. Little did we know, then, how it would all turn out. “I think that cream is off”, you furrowed your brow, holding out a frappuccino for me to test. As I leaned in to sniff it, you dunked my head in. I flicked it at your face, and mayhem ensued.A few years, and many more practical jokes later, I nervously told you I was pregnant. You didn’t hesitate. “Anything you decide to do, anything you need, I’ll support you,” you said. I was so frightened, and you were so strong and steadfast. It’s been that way ever since. Our patchwork family – mother, father, our partners, your additional children, your parents, my parents, our partners’ parents, sisters, cousins, and everyone in between, have all helped to raise this small boy between us.We don’t fight. I don’t recall a single argument we co-operate without drama or disarray. I’ve done some stupid things in the past 10 years and you have quietly picked up the pieces each time. At every new school, after every failed relationship, you have been there with your silent reassurance. I’ve been a mess, but I’m doing OK now, and one of the threads holding this whole damn scruffy tapestry together is you.I know this may slightly embarrass you, because you are modest and humble, but I want to thank you for the last decade, as we look to the next one and whatever it holds and for the greatest gift of all – our son – who grows more like his father every day, with his big blue eyes, his ability to hold a room and make everyone feel special his generous heart. I know we don’t really do feelings, but I bloody love you, and I couldn’t have done any of this without you. I am still frightened of motherhood, but knowing that my co-pilot on this journey is you is very reassuring. You’re the best, bravest and most decent man I’ve ever met, and I consider myself lucky every single day to be raising a son with you.Merry Christmas and, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for everything."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee77c3e6c9df9ababe78e44be27ebc05fe7c6283/0_2129_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0463c5d89a9c2049d4c5c3b46447324","title":"learn how to do nothing","story":"Rather than filling every spare moment with distractions, could I find a way to be at ease in my own company?When I gave up alcohol four and a half years ago, I found I had a lot of extra time on my hands. Hours that would otherwise have been spent in the pub, slumped drunk in front of the telly or nursing a hangover were now full of opportunity. In the first six months of sobriety I started a new business, launched a slew of new projects, saw a therapist once a week, a personal trainer twice a week, trained for and completed a half-marathon, read most of the self-improvement shelf in Waterstones and really upped my flossing game.On reflection, I had simply replaced drinking with other distractions. I burnt out, got better and tried to chill out. But craving distraction remains a problem. These days, I am unable to confront even natural breaks in the working day without preplanned ersions. A walk from one meeting to the next has to be filled with a playlist or podcast. I have had to start keeping my phone in the boot of my car to stop me checking my emails at the lights.I have always found the late December void we are currently enduring to be discombobulating and stressful. I’m neither at work nor am I on holiday. I am supposed to just relax and do nothing. It sounds nice in theory, but by midday on 28 December, usually while watching Mrs Doubtfire on Channel 5, I tend to slip into an existential crisis. When my wife and kids are out of the house, and I have no pressing work deadlines, I become anxious: the nagging thought that I really should be doing something productive but can’t think what, the pressure to absorb myself in something genuinely relaxing. I start half-watching a documentary about veganism on Netflix, while idly scrolling Twitter on my phone and, with my other hand, inexplicably researching the 1980s band DeBarge on Wikipedia on my laptop. Eventually, I go upstairs to lie silently on my bed, having a small panic attack.This is a real thing, a condition recognised by psychiatrists as relaxation-induced anxiety. A recent study at Penn State University found that naturally anxious people were more likely to feel anxious while being led through relaxation exercises.A 2014 research project by the University of Virginia asked iniduals to sit alone in a room and entertain themselves with their own thoughts for 15 minutes. Should they find the task too difficult, they had the option to distract themselves with a small electric shock. Across 11 separate studies, most people said they hated being left to think. Two-thirds of men and a quarter of women chose to electrocute themselves at least once, just to alleviate the boredom.When I tell people about my inertia aversion, they always say the same thing: “Have you tried meditation?” Yes, I have, I tell them, and I was rubbish at it. Meditation takes persistence and patience, the exact qualities I am currently lacking. It’s a vicious cycle.What I’m looking for is something even less exhaustive than mindfulness: an ability to be at ease in my own company. No tricks. No mantras. No incense. I just want to learn how to do nothing.I get in touch with Timothy D Wilson, a professor of psychology and one of the authors of the self-electrocution study. He and his team published recent research suggesting that regular “thought breaks” in the day can reduce stress and might help make you more productive. “Meditation often asks you to clear your mind of thoughts, but I prefer to fill my mind with the right kind,” says Wilson. “You need to learn to fill your mind with pleasurable and fulfilling thoughts. It is another tool in the mental tool box.”I like the sound of pleasure and fulfilment, but what are the right thoughts to have? In Wilson’s study, people were encouraged to turn their minds to friends and family rather than boring, practical stuff like scheduling.I am in a hotel room, alone, on a work trip. I am sitting on the bed, writing emails. I have an hour before my next appointment, so I run a bath. I’m usually more of a shower person, but baths seem to be a big part of the relaxation industry. As I lower myself into the warm water, I remember to breathe slowly and deeply. Breathing is part of the relaxation industry, too. I try to clear my mind but it is, of course, impossible. The more silence and stillness in a room, the more scope my brain has to flit about, searching for things to worry about: I have some invoices to submit I need to catch a 6am train the next morning and book a taxi to get me to the station in time I am behind on several deadlines (including for this article – it’s hard to find the time to write about doing nothing when you are tied up with trying to do nothing). Thinking about family is stressful. I miss my wife and kids. Other relatives have done various things to irritate me. I get out of the bath. Baths take ages. Now I am worried about being late for my appointment. I am no good at taking thought breaks.Why can’t I focus? I call Guy Burgs, founder and chief tutor at the Art Of Meditation, which organises silent retreats in the UK, and tell him about my struggle. “When we have nothing to do, all we are left with is how we feel,” he explains. “So we distract ourselves from our unsettled feeling. At some point, we need to learn how to be at peace with those feelings, and we can’t do that if we keep consuming all the time. I use the water analogy. It won’t reach a calm state if you keep throwing things into it.” I search “how to do nothing” on Google. I find an author called Jenny Odell, who actually wrote a book called How To Do Nothing: Resisting The Attention Economy. I call her up in Oakland, California. “We are obsessed with being goal-orientated. I suggest doing things that are not goals-driven or results-based,” she says. Odell is a bird-watcher. She took it up as a hobby to help rest her mind. “People become too streamlined in what they pay attention to,” she says. “Changing your perspective can give your mind a break.”I am strongly attracted to this idea. In winter, robins often land in my back garden. I watch them from the window when I am waiting for the kettle to boil, first thing in the morning. I wonder what they’re up to what’s their agenda for the day? Odell is right: it’s restful to switch perspective in this way. But can I do it to order? It is easy when my mind is only half operational, and the rest of the family are still waking up. It is harder when you have to press pause on your day and start actively searching for a passing robin.I shut my laptop and stand at the back window, examining the tree tops for flapping wings, like a predatory cat. Five minutes pass. No robins. “That’s the thing about bird-watching, you have no control over it,” Odell warns. “Learning how to release control over a situation is really important.” I become annoyed with the local bird community. They are too unreliable.Perhaps a more radical approach is required. Burgs tells me his silent retreats and meditation courses are a form of aversion therapy, whereby people can confront their fear of doing nothing until it eventually dissipates.“Doing nothing won’t be comfortable at first, however you try,” he says. “You must deliberately put the time aside to do nothing, and have the discipline to get through it, even when it is boring or creates anxiety. You have to sweat it out and gnash your teeth doing nothing for a while, until you learn to cope. The only person you have to live with 247 is yourself, so you might as well learn how to do it.”I am a self-employed dad, and I can’t really justify disappearing to Wales to sit in silence for a week. Isn’t there a fast-track approach? “On a more simple level, you should get used to doing activities that have no end goal and don’t offer instant gratification,” Burgs says. “Like starting a jigsaw you know you won’t have time to finish.”I don’t want to do that, it just seems silly. “The halfway house is finding something we can get completely absorbed in without distraction,” Burgs says. “Cooking, reading or creating.” An afternoon of careful, contemplative cooking sounds great. But there is work to do and kids to feed by 6pm. Slowly peeling runner beans all afternoon looks lovely when you see an old Greek woman doing it on one of Rick Stein’s TV shows. My reality is more about hurriedly boiling some pasta while arguing about homework.There is no point contriving artificial situations. I realise that what I really need is a way of doing nothing that won’t disrupt my busy schedule too much. It sounds like a contradiction in terms, but might just be possible. I get in touch with psychologist Sandi Mann, author of The Science Of Boredom: The Upside (And Downside) Of Downtime, for advice on how I can learn to embrace being bored. “Most people don’t have an hour to spare to do this stuff, but you don’t really need it,” she says. “When you are standing in line at Tesco, or waiting to pick up the kids, resist the lure of your phone and just let your mind wander a bit. See what you might notice around you. You can achieve a great deal in short bursts of inactivity.”Author and former SAS sergeant Chris Ryan learned to channel his thoughts in this way during the course of intensive interrogation training. When I call him he is walking his dog in the Florida sunshine, but he remembers his training experiences vividly. “We would be forced to stand in the stress position for 48 hours, deprived of sleep, with white noise blaring out of big speakers,” he tells me. “I would think: ‘Right, I’m stuck here and there is no choice, so I might as well accept it.’ Then I would start to plan a big project in my mind, like building a house. I would draw the plans, then start ordering materials, calculating costs and laying foundations. I would do everything in detail, step by step, in order to distract my mind from what I was actually going through.”Two days after this conversation, I find myself on a train from London to the Yorkshire town of Thirsk, for work, a journey of roughly two-and-a-half hours. Usually, I would take the opportunity to plug in my laptop and catch up on emails, or get some writing done. Instead, I challenge myself to follow Ryan’s mental survival techniques. This is not quite SAS interrogation training, but it’s close enough: my carriage is packed, my seat is uncomfortable, I am engulfed by a cacophony of other people’s chat, and the air is filled with the smell of fast food and lager. I leave my laptop in my bag, switch off my phone, close my eyes and try to disappear to my happier place.I have had this place since I was about nine years old. It is an alternate footballing universe where my imaginary team, AFC Thameside, have all the best players and pretty much always win. There are other clubs, too, each of them created meticulously over the past three-and-a-half decades during idle moments just like this one. Until recently, I was too embarrassed to talk about it. Now I realise it is more than just a childish fantasy I failed to ditch in adulthood: it is a sophisticated and powerful psychological tool. It certainly helps me through my train journey (I fall asleep for the last hour, which is sort of cheating, but still). When I arrive at Thirsk, there is a pleasant lightness to my mood. My mind is clear and I feel refreshed (Thameside beat local rivals City of London FC in a 4-3 thriller, in case you’re interested).Later, on the phone, I explain all of this to Wilson at the University of Virginia. There is a silence as Wilson, sitting on the other end of the line, tries to comprehend the pretend soccer team that exists inside the brain of a 44-year-old man-child in England. Eventually, he says: “I think you’re on to something. Jerome L Singer is considered the godfather of daydreaming research. He had an imaginary baseball team from childhood that he used to distract his mind. It doesn’t matter what you think about as long as it gives you pleasure and takes you away from everyday strains.”Satisfied, I resolve that I have discovered the mental health equivalent to high-intensity interval training. I practise the same technique on the return journey from Thirsk. I used to spend long train journeys drinking cans of lager. I spend this one with my eyes shut thinking about the imaginary 32-time winners of the fictional All-Star Eurocup. It is not quite the stuff of the Dalai Lama, I admit. And I am not perfect. But it is one more step on a lifetime journey towards – one day – doing nothing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41c668761df427984507ce1b8ffcf0500177be62/0_286_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b770c9b7dc7c2841d7a7e4b54a519e67","title":"2010 2019 a decade in pictures","story":"’s picture editors take a look back at some of the news photography that has defined the past 10 yearsFrom the earthquake in Haiti at the start of 2010, the decade was defined by successive international refugee crises, natural disasters and conflict.

Having spent the last few years botching album rollouts, cancelling projects and indulging in post-release alterations, West delivered on the planned Christmas Day release of Jesus Is Born, his second strongly Christian record of recent months and first to be credited to his Sunday Service Choir project. Jesus Is Born fully realises the ambitious Sunday Service shows the collective has been performing in churches and other venues for months now. Whatever fans make of West’s transformation into a paragon of religious devotion, they can’t accuse him of failing to put in the time.While Jesus Is King saw West absorb a heavy Christian influence into his singular hip-hop style, its follow-up trades solely in traditional gospel. Fans uninterested in his religious rebirth will find little to love here (most of the Sunday Service Choir’s vocals are a variant on this bar from More Than Anything: “I love you, Jesus  I worship and adore you  Just want to tell you  Lord, I love you more than anything.”) but the album certainly fulfils its prayerful remit. Though West’s fingerprints are harder to detect than ever before, Jesus Is Born is more full-bodied than its predecessor, which often felt like a collection of unfinished sketches. Sometimes it can sound less like a studio album than audio snatched from a publicly funded evangelical TV station, but the power of the choir is captured in these recordings and the live feel of the compositions place the listener in Kanye’s own house of prayer.Most interesting to West fans will be the new versions of older songs. Ultralight Beam is whittled down to the choir section that helped power the original. The new version of Father Stretch My Hands (simply titled Father Stretch) develops the rap song’s gospel overtures, while Follow Me – Faith reinterprets Fade. Most songs follow a similar pattern – the choir, led by a solo male voice, is backed up by a small number of live instruments – but still there are obvious highlights. Rain is one of the album’s quieter moments, led by a languid guitar line that would catch the ear of Frank Ocean. That’s How the Good Lord Works leans on a jazzy piano riff, and Souls Anchored is one of a few numbers to feature vocal leads reminiscent of 90s chart R\u0026ampB.Gospel isn’t for everyone but the excellent recent compilations World Spirituality Classics 2 and No Other Love revealed the power of Christian music when it’s driven by sober truths: that life can be a struggle, the will of man is frequently weak, sin is inescapable. The message of Jesus Is Born ­– that God is perfect and Christianity is the answer ­– will play well to the converted but its not going to move agnostics.For all the album’s artistic successes, it’s hard to imagine non-believers listening and catching the holy spirit. Delivering the same message in the same style for 84 minutes, it sometimes feels like mass does to a six-year-old. Yet the Sunday Service Choir have helped West deliver a pretty well-executed genre album. Just don’t compare it to the rest of his mighty oeuvre. Should Kanye’s interest in gospel music prove temporary, this is likely to be remembered as an oddity rather than a baptism."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32573a29faa9ce05d1e3aea4130aa850a1bd75a4/0_43_1494_896/master/1494.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2b62635d5e42fdf7cc780ce9c1230c2","title":"abandoned at sea the cargo crew adrift without wages fuel or supplies a look back","story":"This week we are returning to some of our favourite episodes from 2019.

A woman in Sweden called to ask what she should wear to an event she was due to attend at Windsor Castle.Another inquiry from a caller in Nigeria concerned a request for British officials to pass on the telephone number of the New York-born rapper 50 Cent.Other missives were less unlikely, if similarly ambitious. One person asked whether consular staff in France could call a hotel where they had been staying to retrieve a pair of headphones, while a woman emailed the consulate in Texas asking to buy 30 sheets of A4 paper as she could not find any.One man rang to seek consular assistance to replace a broken television in the hospital ward where his friend was staying in Australia.The FCO said the list was issued in the hope of reminding people what embassies and consular services can do, such as issuing emergency passports, helping Britons overseas who are in hospital or jail, or providing details of local services such as lawyers and doctors.“While we can’t hand out famous rappers’ phone numbers, collect your lost property or advise on Windsor Castle’s dress code, our dedicated consular staff are there to help Brits who run into trouble when they’re abroad,” a spokeswoman said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/511df09a0aa3c5c2a2a99f732d7892849c832e70/216_329_3603_2162/master/3603.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f77d55d6fed695ef93416ed5f470d2e","title":"richard iii and a roman rabbit the finds of the decade","story":"Historic England reveals its 10 most significant archaeological discoveries of the 2010sBritain’s earliest rabbit, the remains of London’s first successful Elizabethan playhouse and a famous shipwreck are among the most significant archaeological discoveries of the past decade, according to Historic England.The public body hailed the items unearthed in the last 10 years that have “helped transform our understanding of how people who came before us lived their lives”.Duncan Wilson, the chief executive of Historic England, said: “This has been a truly remarkable decade of landmark archaeological discoveries. The past never ceases to surprise us. Over the past 10 years archaeologists have learned where Richard III was laid to rest, about what kind of food our Bronze Age ancestors on the Fens ate, and how medieval villagers in Yorkshire mutilated corpses to prevent them rising from the dead. There is always more to learn and I look forward to the next 10 years of amazing discoveries.”In 2012, researchers and archaeologists found the skeleton of Richard III, the Plantagenet king who was killed at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. They came across his remains under a car park in Leicester.Their work also revealed Greyfriars, the Franciscan friary in which the king was buried, which had been lost for over 400 years. In 2017, Greyfriars was granted protection as a scheduled monument, considered “one of the most important sites in our national history”.Among the highlights from the decade, according to Historic England, was the discovery of the Must farm bronze age settlement in Cambridgeshire. In 2015 a major excavation revealed the remains of the settlement, which was remarkably intact and included timber roundhouses raised on stilts.Another discovery was the Elizabethan playhouse where Shakespeare’s Hamlet was premiered, built in 1576-7 and known as the Theatre, the earliest known example of a polygonal playhouse in London.Between 2014 and 2015 the shipwreck of the London, which blew up in 1655 off Southend-on-Sea, was excavated and an array of items were found, from musket balls to leather shoes. A rare and well-preserved wooden gun carriage was also brought to the surface.More unusual findings in the last decade include Britain’s earliest rabbit, which was found in Sussex. A fragment of a rabbit bone was identified, believed to be from the 1st century AD, at Fishbourne Roman Palace. Rabbits are native to Spain and France and it had been thought that they were a medieval introduction to Britain, but the new discovery showed they arrived 1,000 years earlier.In Norfolk in 2016 archeologists uncovered an Anglo-Saxon burial site containing more than 80 rare wooden coffins that were preserved in the wet ground at Great Ryburgh.A major Roman settlement was discovered in Yorkshire in 2017, which predated settlements in York and Carlisle by 10 years. It made historians realise that the Romans probably expanded their occupation into northern England earlier than previously thought. A range of personal objects were found, from shoes and keys to a snake-shaped silver ring.In the last decade, there have been many advances in research methods used to understand past civilisations, according to Historic England. These include improvements in the accuracy of radiocarbon dating. It is now easier to narrow down dates of sites from centuries to decades.Historic England said these changes mean that Neolithic sites, which they had previously dated at between 4000 BC and 3500 BC, can now be narrowed to a  of 25 years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b1b59008487eea00d744431828c80e5b68c8a43/205_170_3425_2054/master/3425.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=859086cb97c84f0c19073bfa7851a5d4","title":"england jofra archer beamers south africa first test","story":"Two leading figures of a frantic contest, Joe Denly and Vernon Philander, agreed about most things but not everything. Both acknowledge they are not playing on a batsman’s paradise but we may have guessed that after 15 wickets fell on the second day.Philander has also spent a fair amount of time batting at Centurion. “Once the bowler hits a good area it’s very tough to score out there.” Then he mentioned the same number as Denly. “A lead of 300 plus out there and you are in the safe zone.”Where these two seemed to differ was in their interpretation of Jofra Archer’s final two deliveries of the day: two attempted knuckleballs to the nightwatchman Anrich Nortje, both of which ended up as beamers with the batsman falling to the ground to avoid being hit. Philander gave the impression that both Archer deliveries should have been called for no‑ball, which would have meant he was unable to bowl again in the match. This also seemed to be the impression of the South Africa management at the close of play.“There was a little bit of a conversation going on after the game,” Philander said. “For me it’s plain and simple, we’re playing a game and we’re setting an example for the rest of the people coming into this game. You’ve got to make the right call. Are we going to tolerate it at another game or are we going to put a stop to it right here – it’s in the hands of the umpires.”This version of events was confirmed afterwards though Archer must now be careful for the rest of the innings. Another transgression and he will be removed from the attack.“More prosaically – except for those residing in the West Country – Philander confirmed that he would be joining Somerset next summer “on a year-by-year basis”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d224041845933a4befa9479dcd900216e0459d3c/0_265_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0fb2b460ebb5756195679eb13e587e51","title":"australia v new zealand boxing day test day three live","story":"42nd over: New Zealand 102-6 (Latham 42, Santner 1) Big spin and considerable bounce from Lyon, who has bowled his own lovely spell leading into the lunch break. He beats Latham with one that goes a long way, taken tidily by Paine. The opener finishes the session positively, getting down the track to drive a single. 41st over: New Zealand 100-6 (Latham 41, Santner 1) Such good bowling, in keeping with the theme of the morning for all three Australian quicks. Latham isn’t giving it away this close to lunch, the strike returning to Santner. The short ball arrives to finish, whacking him on the arm. This has been a nasty spell. They will get one more in, Lyon racing around to give his hat to ump to make sure of it.40th over: New Zealand 100-6 (Latham 41, Santner 1) Probably Lyon’s last over before lunch, with fielders around the bat including a silly point. Warne makes the good point that he rarely has a man under the lid on the off-side. He’s getting him in the game with ample flight, Santner leaping forward to defend. There’s enough turn there to beat the edge once, the left-hander doing well not to follow it. 39th over: New Zealand 100-6 (Latham 41, Santner 1) There are still plenty of Black Caps fans in the MCG and they give it big when the the 100 is brought up by Santner, off the mark (and out of the Starc firing line) in the process with his tuck behind square. Latham is well set, refusing to give an inch to the Australians.Strong from Ricky Ponting. When he talks, people listen.38th over: New Zealand 99-6 (Latham 41, Santner 0) Lyon does his job, sending down a tidy over that gets Santner back on strike for Starc next up.37th over: New Zealand 97-6 (Latham 39, Santner 0) The end of a successful over that should have been a double-wicket maiden for Starc. As Ian Smith clears up on telly, if there is a sweatband on the glove, it is part of the glove. That’s conclusive - it was, therefore, his glove. It’s beyond belief how often we are seeing mistakes in the third umpire’s booth in Test cricket.The wicket from earlier in the over.NOT OUT! Unbelivable decision from Aleem Dar. It clearly hit Santner’s glove wristband. You can see it move!IS SANTNER CAUGHT SECOND BALL? Starc’s bumper came off something before landing in the cordon. About five players convince Paine to have a pop upstairs.Nup, he couldnt do it. de Grandhomme prods at the first ball of Starc’s fresh over, staight into the hands of Warner at gully. No footwork. Poor cricket. 36th over: New Zealand 97-5 (Latham 39, de Grandhomme 11) Latham is setting in for a long stay - if he can find someone to ride shotgun, that is. Here, against Lyon, he plays inside a huge turning off-break before getting well forward to drive beautifully down the ground - shot of the morning. But then when de Grandhomme is at the business end, he nearly holes out to midwicket. Yes, the all-rounder is built to biff but he’s not at all convincing so far so he has to support Latham by getting himself to lunch - not hitting out.35th over: New Zealand 89-5 (Latham 32, de Grandhomme 10) Latham’s turn for a Starc working over. But after getting underneath both the bouncers - coming from the first two balls - he’s able to watch from the front foot for the rest of the set.34th over: New Zealand 88-5 (Latham 31, de Grandhomme 10) Lyon is already bowling with serious flight and drift. He’s going to be a handful here. Kerry O’Keeffe says that he spoke to the spinner last night and he was excited to be bowling on an MCG track with some bounce. The last time he had one of those here, for the 2013-14 Ashes Test, he picked up a six-wicket bag in the second dig. 33rd over: New Zealand 85-5 (Latham 29, de Grandhomme 9) Starc wants in on this, attacking Latham’s stumps with the opener getting his bat down just in time through an inside edge for a couple. There’s the bouncer at de Grandhomme we’ve been waiting for - a fast one, ducked. They will come at him constantly with this.32nd over: New Zealand 80-5 (Latham 26, de Grandhomme 8) Nup - one and done: Wade is off, Lyon is on. He misses his mark first up, Latham taking full advantage with an easy sweep for four, fine of the man on the 45. Sure enough, he’s right on it thereafter, flighting his stock delivery beautifully. By the middle of the set he’s appealing for leg before wicket when the opener misses a clip after dancing at him. 31st over: New Zealand 76-5 (Latham 22, de Grandhomme 8) Starc had to wait a full hour to get his go this morning so he’s had plenty of time to limber up, shown by how fast he’s already sending them down. Early in the over he hits de Grandhomme on the pad before twice beating his inside edge. Oh, make it three! The all-rounder is nowhere near it so far in this innings. Will Wade continue?“Hi Adam.” G’day, Graeme Thorn. “I think the argument should be that the ICC should get teams to concentrate on getting their 90 overs bowled in the six hours before more are crammed in to allow four-day Tests.”Yep, that too. Look, I see merit in four-day Tests if it means getting an extra fixture into series that would otherwise be one or two. Take the disgraceful way Australian administrators have treated Bangladesh, a nation they haven’t hosted in Test cricket since 2003. If four-day affairs can help with that, well, it’s worth a look. Tim Wigmore has written passionately on this point, one that New Zealand officials are keen on for similar reasons. But should bad behaviour be rewarded?30th over: New Zealand 76-5 (Latham 22, de Grandhomme 8) Ummm, Matthew Wade replaces Pattinson for the first over after drinks. As I’ve said before on the OBO, he takes a lot of scalps bowling in the nets, routinely making life difficult for players as capable as David Warner. Even so, it didn’t feel like this was the next move after such a relentless first hour for the home side. Latham takes full advantage, twice carving shorter balls behind point, the second of those beating Lyon to the rope. It’s a no-ball, too. He gets half an over at de Grandhomme, which is a better match-up for his away-swingers. The all-rounder obliges, driving at the first of those, stopped in Wade’s follow through. There’s no stopping the square drive that follows though, a second boundary from a ball well wide of the off-stump. He’s furious at himself. 13 runs from it but New Zealand still trail by 391.Cummins talks to TV at drinks. He’s very polite and positive. “At the moment it is all going to plan.” It sure is. Three wickets in that first hour, very much Australia’s. 29th over: New Zealand 63-5 (Latham 16, de Grandhomme 2) Starc replaces the captivating Cummins, who now has 137 Test wickets in his 29th Test. A reminder that he’s only 26. He has 57 of those scalps at 19.82 in 2019, by far the best in the world. de Grandhomme is in strife here when the left-armer brings a full ball back at him, the inside edge his saviour. There’s no let up with this attack. DRINKS! 28th over: New Zealand 63-5 (Latham 16, de Grandhomme 2) de Grandhomme doesn’t settle here, beaten by Pattinson to begin then hacking when he should have been defending. Crucially, he gets off strike. Latham has to deal with another rapid short ball, ripping his bat out of the way at the last possible moment.27th over: New Zealand 62-5 (Latham 16, de Grandhomme 1) Another Andrew Samson gem on SEN, with respect to Tom Latham, who is on for carrying his bat here. He already has the highest ever score when acheiving that feat - 264 not out. The lowest total for an opener not out at the end of a completed innings is 26, from 1889. History: we’ll take it where we can get it. His edge is found by the final ball of this Cummins over, albeit on the bounce to Warner at gully. He’s playing well as these wickets fall around him, comfortable ducking the short stuff too.26th over: New Zealand 62-5 (Latham 16, de Grandhomme 1) All of a sudden, that follow-on mark has to be in the frame. You don’t normally expect that at the MCG but they have only been out there for 25.2 overs - with a sleep in between - as de Grandhomme walks to the middle. He’s off the mark first ball behind square. Latham has a crack at a bumper now that he’s back on strike, pulling in front of square for three. Nicely played. Pattinson is all over the new man with the two balls he has to come, beating him outside the off-stump them crashing into his front pad with an off-cutter. These two have been quite magnificent this morning. Kevin Roberts was on SEN radio this morning, the main news point that the CA boss is very keen on four-day Tests, saying they will “seriously consider” them. I’m far from convinced. Yes, you can point to the number of Tests that would have finished in four days if applying the extra overs but the rhythm of the game changes entirely when that fifth day is taken out of the equation. Not for me. Outstanding bowling, Pattinson angling in at pace, Watling edging to first slip from the shoulder of his bat. He tried to keep it down but there was too much going on. 25th over: New Zealand 57-4 (Latham 12, Watling 7) Cummins keeps the cordon jumping, hitting Latham on the arm with a short ball that he can’t get out the way of. Next up, showing his class, the off-cutter finds the inside edge and nearly deflects back onto the woodwork. Andrew Samson reveals on SEN radio that Nicholls wicket was the first lbw decision Cummins has won for 70 dismissals! 24th over: New Zealand 56-4 (Latham 11, Watling 7) Another testing Pattinson over, Latham playing a short ball early in the over with both feet off the deck. Plays it well. Ooh, less so later in the over when wafting at a ball outside the off-stump. There have been a stack of those already this morning. Deserves a scalp.23rd over: New Zealand 55-4 (Latham 10, Watling 7) Good again from Watling, playing carefully through cover with the movement of the ball, taking a couple. That shape is there again next up, beating his outside edge. Once again, there isn’t a lot he could have done about that. Cummins has 10-3-16-3. What a bowler.“Good morning from a 25C beach shack in northern Tasmania,” reports Tom Lewis. “With that and OBO, my day is set.” Great to have you with us. “You suggest that ‘technology confirms that was the right call’. Could it be instead that technology hintedindicatedpostulated ... etc.” I’m Team Technology, mostly because it pits me against the dinosaurs and that’s usually the right lane to be in.22nd over: New Zealand 53-4 (Latham 10, Watling 5) Smith DROPS LATHAM! It was going straight down the throat of Burns at first slip but Smith decided to e right in front of him from second and put it down. That should have been three wickets in eight balls. Disappointing for Pattinson, who has been just as good as Cummins this morning. It’s hard to understand why Smith went there. It’s different going the other way when the ball isn’t going to carry but that was not an issue there. He ran down to apologise to the bustling quick at the end of the over.21st over: New Zealand 51-4 (Latham 9, Watling 4) Watling is off the mark with a crisp off-drive for four. It’s a rugged time for him to be walking out, but if we’ve learned one thing about the Kiwi stumper it’s that he’s unflappable. Here’s a replay of that first Cummins wicket. WATLING DEFENDS THE HAT-TRICK BALL. He had to play and did it well. That’s the fourth time in four Tests this summer an Australian has been on one. Oh, that’s out! It’s hitting leg stump, Cummins having beaten the inside edge from around the wicket on the angle. Superb bowling. He’s on a hat-trick! An Australian man hasn’t taken one in a Test since Siddle - on his birthday - in November 2010.CUMMINS IS ON A HAT-TRICK! So long as DRS agrees that Nicholls is lbw first ball. He was given on the field and looked very, very good. Taylor dropped by Labuschagne but is caught on the deflection by Burns at first slip! Miller and Tavare, anyone? Such good bowling. Taylor never settled.20th over: New Zealand 46-2 (Taylor 4, Latham 9) Wheels from Pattinson to begin from the Great Southern Stand end, where he will be well supported today. Into Taylor, he thumps into the back thigh pad then beats the outside edge with a lovely little bit of movement away from the bat. He has three slips, Labuschagne setting up nice and close at third. Taylor is a cool customer and responds with a neat tuck, behind square for one. Latham’s turn now, who has a couple to get through. He’s forward defending the first of those with a nice, straight bat but he’s beaten on the angle to finish. That wasn’t far away at all. Two tip top overs to begin for Australia’s big, bad right-arm fast bowlers.19th over: New Zealand 44-2 (Taylor 2, Latham 9) Cummins is right on it to Taylor, finding the outside half of his bat. The Black Caps veteran gets down the other end for his first run of the day from the fourth ball, pushing to mid-on. He requires 49 further runs today in order to overtake Stephen Fleming as New Zealand’s highest Test runscorer. We’ll keep an eye on that. Latham plays and misses his first delivery of the day, an excellent offering from around the wicket cutting away off the seam after angling in. Not a lot he can do about it. A huge shout from the Australians to finish the over! Cummins has beaten the inside edge and he wants an lbw decision the fielders around the bat are also interested in whether it hit an inside edge on the way through before landing in Warner’s ing hands at gully. They elect not to review and technology confirms that was the right call - the lbw was going over the stumps and the sound was bad on pad, not ball. Great over.The players are on the field! Cummins, the world’s best quick, will be starting us off from the Members End. Ross Taylor is on strike. This should be good. PLAY! Another from Tim Paine last night. He said that Travis Head was always playing and commentary from the skipper about potentially playing five bowlers ahead of this Test was strategic misdirection of the New Zealanders via the media. Hmm. I know there’s a lot of distaste for cricket reporters and plenty of conspiracy theories about us concocting our stories, but, yeah, I’m not sure about this.It’s becoming one of the great midsummer traditions. Backyard cricket, the Boxing Day Test and questioning the ball-tracking technology used by DRS. Tim Paine played his part at stumps last night, saying he’s lost faith in the system. Back to the MCG, where solar panels are on the way. Good get this, from Andrew Wu at the SMH. It follows an Australian Conservation Foundation report yesterday, which detailed some serious challenges for the Boxing Day Test. Speaking of the England team, did you catch the highlights overnight? Crazy scenes from start to end at Centurion. As one colleague noted, it can sometimes be quite a lot of fun watching two teams who can’t bat. Delicious fast bowling, too. Eoin Morgan CBE, Ben Stokes OBE... and so on. Joe Root, Jos Buttler, Trevor Bayliss, Alan Knott! Sir Clive Lloyd. Colin Graves is in there too, of course. It must be the New Year Honours list! Good morning to you all. Day three, or moving day as we cricket writers call it when there’s no better introduction to go with than ripping something off from golf. But for New Zealand, this is survival day first and foremost. At different periods through this series, the the visitors have found something from nothing. Having lost Kane Williamson, their skipper and superstar, not long before the close last night, they now need plenty to go their way if they are to withstand the inevitable Australian surge. In simple terms, they have to bat all day. With Ross Taylor, there is always hope of such a feat. Yes, he was lucky to survive a compelling leg before shout when James Pattinson was steaming in just before stumps, but the veteran is in form and has the patience for the task. Tom Latham, Henry Nicholls and BJ Watling have also achieved this often enough in Test cricket. The real quiz here is whether they can do so on this much bigger stage.For the home side, their quicks were swaming last night in the best traditions of a bowling group who had their feet up for nearly two days. It being Saturday, there’s every reason to think there’ll be another 60,000 Melburnians in to urge then on - especially Pattinson, the home town boy who has been waiting for an MCG return for eight years. With a hint of volatile bounce on show already, the dice is loaded their way. The Kiwis, of course, are still 223 away from the follow-on. Eeek.But let’s be positive. Let’s hope the Black Caps can show some of the backbone that has elevated them to the second ranked team in the world. Let’s hope we’re sitting here in seven hours with a serious contest on our hands. And if not, let’s enjoy the world-class Australian bowlers going to work. And whatever the case, enjoy it with myself and JP Howcroft. We’re looking forward to your company."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e6b5d085e9e6e1fa3b8fafe93b6bb71499637bb/0_1495_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=766abf6df8b7b31eef9e2d30c32bf36a","title":"delightful sausage funniest things","story":"Sketch comedy double act Amy Gledhill and Chris Cantrill on the things that make them laugh the mostChris Cantrill: Cancel all your plans and seek out the undisputed queen of character comedy, Anna Mann.Amy Gledhill: We got tickets to watch our spirit guides Vic and Bob last year recording Big Night Out and I haven’t washed since.Chris: Modern Toss – A Decade in the Shithouse is a heap of dysfunctional fun.Chris: Probably my Insane Clown Posse T-shirt.

Back in October, a family left a production of Motown the Musical at Sunderland Empire after being asked to refrain from spiritedly singing along to its Berry Gordy hits. Your thoughts on that probably depend on whether you, too, can’t help belting out a big chorus, or whether your worst nightmare is an off-key hum coming from the seat behind you.The urge to join in is definitely getting stronger. After the success of singalong cinema events – The Sound of Music, Grease, The Greatest Showman – you can now go to special karaoke versions of hit musicals Six and Waitress, where you can sing along during the show, or get on stage afterwards with live musicians and belt out your favourite tunes.In the West End of London, feelings about more ad-hoc participation are mixed. I’m at the Aldwych theatre for Tina, the brilliant rollercoaster life story of Tina Turner pinned to infectious songs such as Proud Mary and Private Dancer. The pre-show welcome announcement reminds the audience to switch off their phones, then follows that by asking them to refrain from singing during the show. The man in the seat next to me groans. “You come to a show like this because you like to sing along,” he tells me. A woman in front turns around to say that she was nearly thrown out of another musical for singing.A coach party from Hayling Island in Hampshire have come on their annual trip to let their hair down. “This is the first time we’ve been told not to sing,” says Beverley Donaldson. “At We Will Rock You, everyone was singing along. It’s a shame really.” But Janice Esteban, queuing for the ladies’ in the interval, thinks differently. “I want to hear the performers,” she says. “If someone sings as badly as I do, it would ruin it. I wouldn’t inflict that on anybody. And if everybody stands up – my husband can’t stand up so he can’t see anything. You go to a concert to rock,” she says, “you go to the theatre to watch.”Back in the auditorium, as Tina’s second act ramps up with more 80s hits, I hear pockets of humming every time a chorus comes, and when the intro to Simply the Best kicks in, and Tsemaye Bob-Egbe appears as Turner in that red leather dress, the coach party can’t hold back. It’s only a minute later that the show turns into a mini-concert, and Bob-Egbe launches us all to our feet, now sanctioned to belt and bop freely. Maybe all the better for having had to hold it in.Up the road, the auditorium of the Shaftesbury theatre is packed for \u0026amp Juliet, a larky, high energy, occasionally lame but massively fun Shakespeare spinoff. It’s a jukebox musical based on the songs of Swedish pop maestro Max Martin. Even if you think you’re not a fan of ’NSync, Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears and the rest of his roster, you somehow know all the songs – this is perfect singalong territory.Behind me in the stalls, Brian Westbrook, in town from the US for a conference, is clapping, laughing and having a great night. “You have to be respectful of everybody else, and if you’re singing off-key maybe keep it down,” he says. “But if you’re having fun and enjoying it and the crowd’s going with it, I don’t see a problem.”“Part of theatre is what happens on stage but it’s also what happens in the audience,” he says. “A show like this was clearly written to be enjoyed. I think it’s completely appropriate to be dancing and having a good time.”Charlotte Bamford and David Bishop, in the bar in the interval, agree that the show itself sets the tone. “They interact with you from the beginning,” says Bamford. “I sang along the whole way through,” admits Bishop. “Sometimes I feel a bit nervous about participating, I don’t really like those audience engagement-type shows, whereas here I actually was singing along. We’re in the back row but I felt like I was in the front row.”The back row may offer some anonymity. In the actual front row, Anna Levanen and her friends are sticking to lip-syncing. “I wouldn’t sing along,” she says. “I think it’s disrespectful to the performers. It is a bit different in this kind of event where you really know all of the songs, but we are here to hear their voices.” Although the volume coming out of the speakers is so high, she points out, you probably wouldn’t hear her if she did sing.As we get to the finale, the crowd are revved up, and for the last couple of numbers the performers start egging us on to get up and join in. But now you can feel that stubborn English reserve. Even with so much energy buzzing in the auditorium, some bottoms take a long time to leave their seats. At which point I think: perhaps rather than sanctions on singing, it’s permission to let loose that we really need."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/073101bc58ae77e5251a7c09da4f31737e9e37bb/0_49_5724_3434/master/5724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ddcb53e1bea46108dd43805843fabe9","title":"the decade that broke me could anyone keep up with tvs golden age","story":"Forget prestige television – the real glory days were back when there was nothing on. No wonder people fib constantly about what they watch. Here’s how to do it convincinglySpeaking as someone who writes about television for a living, the 2010s have absolutely broken me. It all used to be so simple. There were five channels, three of them good, and you watched whatever they decided to show you. It didn’t matter if it was rubbish, either. Soap operas. Game shows. So many documentaries about the British Transport Police you’d call me a liar if I tried to list them all. We watched it all, because that’s what was on.In retrospect, it was a golden age. Because now when you sit down to watch television, you basically have to choose between every single thing that has ever been made. The channels are still going, just, but they’re outgunned by streaming platforms with libraries that swell by the day. Netflix throws a new original series out every few days, plus a bank of buzzy imports. NowTV keeps you up to date with all the shows that get recapped by the sites you like. Amazon isn’t easing off either, especially now that competition comes in the form of Apple and Disney and Facebook and Snapchat.It’s too much. No wonder people are lying about what they watch. I do. I do it all the time. Not in print, of course, but socially. “Isn’t The Good Fight amazing?” a friend will ask me. What choice do I have? Of course The Good Fight is amazing. I know it’s amazing because people won’t shut up about how amazing it is. But that doesn’t mean I’ve watched it. I keep promising myself I’ll get around to it, but I know I never will. Whenever an opportunity to watch The Good Fight arises, I’ll immediately find myself wedged in a bottleneck of newer drama. I’ll never watch The Good Wife. I have already said my goodbyes to it. But my friends don’t need to know that. “Yeah, it’s amazing”, I’ll lie in response, knowing I’ll be able to bluff my way through the next two minutes of vague interrogation by praising the actors and the premise before grabbing the conversation back by telling everyone how much I preferred Braindead, Robert and Michelle King’s little-watched Good Wife predecessor. Nobody watched Braindead. I am the only person in the entire world who watched Braindead. So now it’s my friends’ turn to feel inadequate.The list of shows I haven’t watched this decade is vast. I dipped out of The Walking Dead after a season, The Affair after a season, Divorce after a season. I couldn’t convince my wife to try Rick and Morty, so I’ve only seen a handful of those. I still haven’t – and I shudder to admit this – seen all of The Wire.There isn’t anything wrong with failing to keep up with the flood of television. Being honest about not watching something is admirable. But sometimes it just isn’t possible. So in the spirit of end-of-decade good will, please allow me to share my top tips for lying about television you haven’t seen.This is usually the safest bet. You are a person on the internet in the year 2019, so you will have been exposed to all kinds of tweets or reviews of things you’ve never watched. Use them. If people talk about Shrill, tell them that you think the casting of Aidy Bryant was alchemical (Emily Nussbaum, March 2019), then use that as a tangent to talk about a SNL clip you just saw on YouTube. If they talk about The Deuce, tell them the characters were more impactful than the political statements (Alan Sepinwall, October 2019). If they’re talking about After Life, tell them it’s mawkish and bad (Stuart Heritage, March 2019). This will probably be enough to get you by.This is trickier, but it can be done. If people are discussing a show that’s been on for a while, you can get away with claiming that one specific season is your favourite. As a rule, pick an earlier season if it’s a drama (because that will be when the premise was still intact) and a middle season if it’s a comedy (because they were still working out their patterns in the first season). Never, ever tell anyone that the final season of a show was your favourite. What if they’re talking about Dexter? You’ll look like a maniac.When in doubt, go obscure. If they’re talking about a show you haven’t seen, hit them back with a show they haven’t seen. Tell them how much you loved Crossing Lines or Dix Pour Cent or Kidding. But be careful if your friends are a certain type of person, they’ll volley back by singing the praises of an even more obscure show, and you’ll all end up discussing something nobody has ever seen. I believe this is the only reason why people ever talk about Sorry For Your Loss."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d758eb617b88c8cd46021974b18a77dadca00c8/0_169_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=847d1f8ac3474ba5dcd01ee70b57e4a2","title":"amlo mexico bolivia diplomats morales","story":"Comments further stoked diplomatic row between Mexico and Bolivia, which has descended into personal insultsMexico’s president has called on police in Bolivia to stop harrassing diplomats at his country’s embassy in La Paz and allow nine former officials holed up there – all allies of former leader Evo Morales – to seek asylum.“The right to asylum has to be guaranteed,” Andrés Manuel López Obrador said at his daily press conference on Friday. “We hope they act sensibly and they don’t invade our diplomatic representation in Bolivia. Not even Pinochet did that.”His reference to the late Chilean dictator further stoked a diplomatic row between Mexico and Bolivia, which has descended into personal insults, rallied political bases in both countries and sharpened Latin American’s left-right ide.Amlo – as the Mexican president is known – has championed a foreign policy of non-intervention. But his government has been outspoken on Bolivia, where Morales was forced from office after being accused of rigging his re-election 20 November.Mexico offered Morales asylum and sent a jet to fly him out of Bolivia, although he has since relocated to Argentina. Just before Christmas, Mexico accused the interim Bolivian government of surrounding the Mexican embassy in La Paz. It later announced plans to take Bolivia to the International Court of Justice.Bolivia responded that Mexico requested the police protection and said it would defend itself in court. Arrest warrants have been issued by Bolivia’s rightwing government against five of the nine officials in the Mexican embassy, according to media reports.Tensions ratcheted up further on Friday when police prevented two Spanish diplomats from entering the embassy, the Mexican foreign ministry said in a statementThe Mexican foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, tweeted a Boxing Day call for “national unity” after a former Bolivian president unleashed a barrage of “adjectives and insults toward Mexico and its president”.The former Bolivian president Jorge “Tuto” Quiroga called Amlo “submissive to Trump, Castro and Maduro” – a reference to the Mexican leader’s dealings with Donald Trump and willingness to crack down on migrants to avoid US sanctions.The historian Harim B Gutiérrez said previous Mexican governments “maintained legitimacy at home while making big concessions to the United States” by staking out independent positions such as not breaking relations with Cuba after the 1959 revolution.“It serves (Amlo’s) purposes to challenge the Latin American right at this time,” said Gutiérrez, a professor at the Autonomous politan University in Mexico City. “That allows the López Obrador government to have something to compensate for its subordination to Trump’s migration policies.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ef0b55b69832f76bec4484f0125a00ccbdd098b/46_47_908_545/master/908.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4864f913ca8c4e6afe57481d2a102bd","title":"archaeologists discover remains of vast mayan palace","story":"Ancient building found 100 miles west of Cancùn estimated to be more than 1,000 years oldArchaeologists in Mexico have uncovered the remains of a vast Mayan palace over 1,000 years old in an ancient city about 100 miles west of the tourist hotspot of Cancún.The building in Kulubá is 55 metres long, 15 metres wide and six metres high, and appears to have been made up of six rooms, said Mexico’s National Institute of Anthropology and History.It is part of a larger complex that also includes two residential rooms, an altar and a large round oven. Archaeologists have also uncovered remains from a burial site, and hope forensic analysis of the bones could provide more clues about Kulubá’s Mayan inhabitants.The palace was in use during two overlapping eras of Mayan civilisation, in the late classical period between AD600 and AD900, and the terminal classical between AD850 and AD1050, said Alfredo Barrera Rubio, one of the lead archaeologists at the site.“We know very little about the architectural characteristics of this region, the north-east of Yucatán. So one of our main objectives, as well as the protection and restoration of cultural heritage, is the study of the architecture of Kulubá,” he said in a video made on the site.“This is just the start of the work. We are only just uncovering one of the largest structures on the site.” He hopes that as the work continues, it will become a natural attraction for visitors to the region.The Mayans built one of the greatest civilisations of the western hemisphere, which flourished across central America including what is now southern Mexico, Guatemala, Belize and Honduras.Their cities featured pyramid temples and huge stone buildings, and they used agriculture and metalwork, developed sophisticated irrigation systems and invented a hieroglyphic writing system.But Mayan society suffered a precipitous and mysterious decline between AD800 and AD1000. Scientists have suggested war, climate, disease and politics as possible causes, although cities including Chichén Itzá – which the archaeological dig suggests controlled Kulubá – flourished longer.The conservation team are considering bringing back some of the forest cover – which was cleared during earlier excavation work at older parts of the site – to protect some of the more delicate buildings from the elements.“One option which the site offers is using vegetation for conservation,” said Natalia H Tangarife, part of the conservation team.“This would mean reforesting specific sites so that trees can provide protection from direct sunlight, wind and other elements, for those structures which still have some of the original paint colours.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/757950b3c6bc1dba3307d1964371b1c62b5e8cc8/0_182_2736_1642/master/2736.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a1fc2a3ab66cbfea3a83890c3163b0c","title":"cabin crew union calls three day germanwings strike","story":"Walkout to demand improved wages and benefits at Lufthansa subsidiary to begin SundayA German cabin crew union has called a three-day strike at Lufthansa subsidiary Germanwings, plunging passengers into turmoil over the busy end-of-year holiday as it ramps up a bitter row over pay and conditions.The UFO union said on Friday that Germanwings employees would strike from 11pm GMT on Sunday until 11pm GMT on Wednesday as talks with bosses remained deadlocked. The strike period covers New Year’s Eve and the 1 January public holiday.“We are deliberately announcing the strike early so that Germanwings passengers have a chance to book flights with other airlines or make alternative travel plans,” the UFO vice-chairman, Daniel Flohr, said in a video message.The union stopped short of announcing a fresh stoppage at flagship carrier Lufthansa itself, but warned that more strike calls could follow from 2 January.Flohr said the UFO took stoppages at this time of year – when many people are travelling to meet friends and family – “very seriously”. But Germanwings management had “given its employees no clear options for the future”, he argued.A Lufthansa spokesman had earlier condemned the union’s latest strike threats, saying, “This is no way to resolve the conflict.”Board member Detlef Kayser said in a statement that “UFO has refused for weeks to put concrete demands in writing”.Lufthansa and the UFO have for months been locked in an increasingly bitter dispute that has triggered repeated walkouts. A 48-hour stoppage of the main Lufthansa airline led to 1,500 cancellations at German airports in November, affecting 200,000 passengers. A one-day warning strike in October prompted several dozen flight cancellations at Lufthansa subsidiaries Eurowings, Germanwings, SunExpress and Lufthansa CityLine.As well as demanding higher wages, especially for entry-level jobs, the UFO union is seeking better benefits and easier routes into long-term contracts. Lufthansa for a long time refused to discuss the demands, claiming the union no longer had the right to represent its 22,000 cabin crew employees owing to an internal leadership struggle.The company even challenged the UFO’s legal status in court. But the group changed its stance during November’s strike, agreeing to arbitration with UFO leaders and two mediators. The UFO union on Sunday said those talks “had failed”.Both sides have agreed to keep details of the talks confidential, but German media reported that they could not even agree on which topics should be covered by the arbitration.As well as pushing its demands for better pay, the UFO is reportedly seeking assurances that certain staff members will not face disciplinary action over the strikes.Lufthansa said it was putting its hopes in a fresh round of talks proposed by the mediators for January, but the UFO denied that a new date had been agreed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d57e0d16f87bc7c9c08b725d3e9a0c2288071a6/0_603_6461_3877/master/6461.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f64c00abd2e4049d8124bede92d3dc3b","title":"more than 235000 people have fled idlib region in syria says un","story":"Displacement follows two weeks of air and ground assaults on rebel strongholdMore than 235,000 civilians have fled their homes in opposition-held areas of north-west Syria in the past two weeks, the UN has said, after attacks by Syrian government forces intensified.Syrian troops and their foreign backers are targeting the towns of Maaret al-Numan and Saraqeb in Idlib province, which sit on a highway connecting Aleppo with the capital, Damascus.There are an estimated 3 million civilians living in the province, including many who had already fled violence in other parts of Syria during the country’s long civil war.A wave of aerial bombing began around 16 December, followed by a ground offensive from 19 December, a statement from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.Kana’an al-Ahmad, a field commander with the National Front for Liberation (NFL), said: “The regime is trying to besiege the city of Maaret al-Numan from three sides but we are still repelling it.“We were planning to launch a counterattack but the weather conditions didn’t help us so our plan was cancelled. But we are preparing for another in the coming days. Many reinforcements from other rebel groups have also arrived to fight alongside us.”He said the fighters were hindered by their limited equipment. “Because regime is using modern tanks, we can’t destroy them with the old missiles we own.” He claimed both sides had sustained heavy losses.Much of the area is dominated by the country’s former al-Qaida affiliate, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, whose leader this week urged jihadists and allied rebels to head to the frontlines and fight the “Russian occupiers” and the government.The scale of the December exodus prompted Donald Trump to call for a halt to the fighting in a tweet from his Mar-a-Lago resort. “Russia, Syria and Iran are killing, or on their way to killing, thousands of innocent civilians in Idlib province. Don’t do it! Turkey is working hard to stop this carnage,” he wrote.With the Turkish border closed, aid groups are warning of a humanitarian crisis as waves of displaced families are pushed into ever-shrinking rebel territory.“The capacity to absorb people in need may surpass available places given the scale of displacement,” the UN said. “Many of those who are displaced as a result of the most recent intensification of hostilities had been displaced previously, some of them multiple times.”Even inside Idlib, the UN estimates that a previous wave of attacks displaced around 400,000 people between April and August. The areas targeted in the latest offensive are said to be almost empty.“I left the city three days ago. The sky was raining bombs and rockets,” said Omar Basher, 25, from Maaret al-Numan, who worked for a local charity until it closed around a year ago.“I never thought I would leave my home forever, but now as the regime is advancing and it’s getting closer to the city, I have the feeling that I will never go back.“I am with my parents and my two brothers and are still trying to find a house, but everywhere the houses are already full of displaced. We might go to Turkey although the borders are closed and it’s pretty dangerous to try to cross the borders.”In al-Atarib, in the countryside west of Aleppo, residents have organised a scheme to support the latest wave of people fleeing violence, called “be generous with them”, funded by donations from the community.“Someone from the town donated farmland to set up tents for the displaced, many people donated money, clothes, blankets, mattresses, foodstuff and bed covers, also we made makeshift toilets for them,” said Ali Obeid, a spokesperson for the group.“We are still receiving new arrivals, we had 20 families yesterday but today we have 50 families. So we are trying to get more tents and plastic sheeting to protect from the rain. We have also secured batteries and LEDs to light their tents.”Obeid said one of the biggest concerns was that the camp would be bombed. “The regime and Russia have done this many times in many areas,” he said.Attacks on the area have repeatedly targeted civilian infrastructure including markets and medical facilities. The Syrian American medical society said 71 hospitals or clinics had been hit between April and December.Unicef said children were bearing the brunt of the intensifying violence, with at least 65 killed or injured in December. By the end of the month nearly 50,000 were in urgent need of education support, excluded from school by violence and displacement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cf0d9c44ec67fea80ac7866080b97c02264c614/0_85_3457_2074/master/3457.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=901b3c34586e8b921791fa3190b108f1","title":"religious traditions and our common humanity","story":"It was good that your leader looked at an issue that has been too long ignored (The rise of Christian-nativist populists is a worry for all, 26 December). It needs to be addressed seriously by asking the question that the philosopher Jürgen Habermas has long posed to German society: “What is missing?” That is, what is missing in the current secular climate which makes some people turn to a religiously based rightwing politics?I suggest that this should result first of all in affirming the profoundly moral view of what it is to be a human being in society held by secular humanists. This is the equal worth and dignity of every human being. Second, it would mean affirming, as several major books have done recently, the profoundly Christian foundation underpinning this in western culture. The problem at the moment is that the decisive shaping influence of the Christian faith in our history, literature, art, music, law and culture is too often simply disdained or whitewashed out.This is not to downplay the real political differences between some Christians and some progressives, or the philosophical ones between those for whom belief is fundamental and those who reject it. But the present secular climate is very “thin”. If its moral and spiritual depths were more to the fore, it would better resonate with those who now feel alienated by it and who, not feeling at home, turn to an unhappy union of religion and rightwing polemics.Richard HarriesCrossbench peer, House of Lords bishop of Oxford 1987-2006• How about a story of God being on the side of slaves, and freeing them from their oppressors? Or punishing kings who abuse their power? Or inspiring men to decry the evils of their society by warning the people to treat others well?This is the (Hebrew) Bible – that which Jesus would have imbibed as part of his Jewish childhood in that particular religious milieu. It is composed of various texts spread over millennia and has within it material far less lofty, but much other material no less aligned with the marginal, the maligned and the poor.Paul himself is a troublesome character: his writings about women and their place are vile, his attacks on the prevailing traditions of the time unpleasant, and his knowledge of any historical Jesus clearly lacking.All of our religious traditions contain wonderful and inspiring teachings about humanity, and, with respect for each other, we should strive to live up to the highest ideals in what we believe.Rabbi Dr Barbara BortsNewcastle upon Tyne• Your editorial on the rise of Christian-nativist populists offers an excellent exposition of Paul and the Gospel, but underrates a bad effect of the Enlightenment. If it promoted the separation of church and state, it also encouraged the assumption that religion has nothing to do with politics and so created a vacuum that Christian populists like Trump and Orbán have been quick to exploit.In the last century two great Christian thinkers in Oxford, AD Lindsey and Nathaniel Micklem, found it hard to decide whether to become ordained ministers or members of parliament. Both seemed to them equally important Christian vocations. Lindsey opted for politics but based his resistance to Hitler’s tyranny on his Christian faith, as in his I Believe in Democracy. Micklem, as a theologian and principal of a theological college, argued in his Theology of Politics that “all political problems are at bottom theological” because they raise questions about our relation to God, other human beings and all creation.As you urge, such convictions need to be more powerfully shared.Rev Dr Donald W NorwoodOxford• Thank you for your Boxing Day editorial. According to George Lakoff in his book The Political Mind (pages 117-118), cognitive science has shown that there is a biological basis for empathy, cooperation and community. We are born to empathise and cooperate. I suggest it is not merely a coincidence that the tenet to love our neighbours as ourselves is written into the formative holy books of all the major faiths.Lakoff contrasts the strict father with the nurturing parent as metaphors of government. We are all susceptible to messages from both metaphors. Rightwing narratives are about the strict father. In the UK they implement policies preventing adults looking to the government for assistance lest they become dependent. Alternatively we could promote the the empathetic metaphor of government as a nurturing parent responsible for the health and wellbeing of every UK citizen. We need a moral narrative that could end the indignity and humiliation of homelessness for families and iniduals.Rev Paul NicolsonTaxpayers Against Poverty• It is absolutely correct that all liberals – whether religious or nonreligious – should come together to oppose populism (whether Christian populism or not), but your leader falls into the same Christian exceptionalism as the populist in asserting that human equality and dignity begin with Christianity. To fight fire with fire is never productive, especially when it involves such historical revisionism. Accepting the reality that modern human rights are built on a blending of human traditions and rooted in our common humanity is the best path to the outcome of progress and solidarity that we should seek.Andrew CopsonChief executive, Humanists UK• Having outlined the disastrous consequences of the rise of religious identity politics, it is bizarre that you then suggest that US Democrats “wearing their faith on their sleeve” is a happy circumstance. The fact that they too “have begun to play this game” is beyond depressing. All the evidence points to the fact that religion only exacerbates ision and discord in society. Keeping all religion and associated sectarian ideology out of the political sphere is the only way of uniting “liberals of goodwill … across the religioussecular ide in 2020”.John DillonBirmingham• Re your excellent editorial and Mark Redhead’s letter (26 December), on Christmas Day, following our morning service, two young Muslim men arrived to wish us a happy Christmas, to offer chocolates to everyone and to offer a free Christmas Day taxi service to older people.

The plan was eventually dropped. File photograph: Joe O’ShaughnessyAn expert group on direct provision is to examine how communities are consulted when centres are to be opened in their localities following a series of protests around the State over the planned arrival of asylum seekers.The group, which is being chaired by former European Commission secretary general Catherine Day, will report to the Government on potential long-term approaches to accommodating asylum seekers by the end of next year.Former National Asset Management Agency (Nama) chairman Frank Daly, former Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) director Frances Ruane and former Department of Social Protection secretary general Niamh O’Donoghue are also participating in the initiative.Minister of State in the Department of Justice David Stanton said the group would look at how best to engage with communities where it is planned to house asylum seekers.“We have seen at first-hand the concerns of communities when new accommodation centres are first mooted in their areas,” he said.In recent years there have been objections raised to the opening of direct-provision centres in a number of Irish towns.These include Roosky, Co Roscommon, where plans for a centre were dropped after arson attacks on the hotel earmarked for the project Lisdoonvarna in Co Clare, where a centre opened this year and Oughterard in Co Galway, where locals protested against the proposed conversion of a local hotel into direct-provision accommodation.Protesters raised concerns about matters such as the lack of consultation with communities before plans to open direct provision centres were put in train and the strain that the arrival of groups of asylum seekers would put on local services such as doctors and schools.Mr Stanton added: “While we have recently had successful outcomes in opening new centres in Borrisokane, in Ballinamore and in Ennis, the expert group will look at how we can engage more effectively with communities so that we can work together to respond to the needs of asylum seekers and of local residents. This is essential for successful integration opportunities.”‘Learn from each other’Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan said the group would identify good practice used in other European countries in relation to the provision of support to those seeking international protection.“This is a complex issue for all EU Member States and there is no doubt that we have just to learn from each other,” Mr Flanagan said.“While substantial improvements have been made to our reception system in recent years we are constantly looking to better our service. In particular, I want to see better medium- and long-term planning embedded in our thinking.“Dr Day’s experience as secretary general to the EU Commission is particularly important and valuable, and the group will engage with Member States as well as the European Asylum Support Office to identify systems and practices that could potentially be used here.”Other members of the expert group include former CEO of Limerick City and County Council Conn Murray, Fiona Finn of Nasc (the Migrant and Refugee Rights Centre) and Bulelani Mfaco of the Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4116915.1576768012!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"john bowman 1989 a calm year in anglo irish relations","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Margaret Thatcher with taoiseach Charles Haughey on the steps of 10 Downing Street, London, in May 1980. Photograph: KeystoneGetty ImagesIt was not a high-profile year in Anglo-Irish relations. Everything seemed becalmed in 1989. Yet Charles Haughey was constantly being asked questions in the Dáil on whether he had any plans for a dedicated Anglo-Irish summit meeting with Margaret Thatcher. His response, that such meetings could readily be arranged if needed, scarcely hid the reality that neither of these leaders had much to say to one another that year.Thatcher was, by now, fretting that she had signed the Hillsborough Agreement with Garret FitzGerald in 1985 and Haughey, who had belittled that nationalist breakthrough, was now reduced to being its reluctant custodian.Not only did Thatcher and Haughey just meet face to face for a mere 60 minutes in total in 1989 but they then spent more time discussing European politics than Northern Ireland. In advance of the European Council summit in Madrid in June, the British ambassador in Dublin, Nicholas Fenn, informed the taoiseach’s department that Thatcher was “particularly concerned” about the Social Charter which, were it to be implemented, “could price Europe out of world markets and damage employment” Fenn said that, on anybody’s definition, the EU’s Social Charter contained “a lot of codswallop”.Fenn – clearly wooing Irish support for the British approach – added that Thatcher often felt “a mite lonesome” in making her case at European Council summits. Government secretary Dermot Nally’s record of the Haughey-Thatcher meeting in Madrid characterised it as “discursive and friendly”. ‘Airy fairy talk’After the preliminaries, Thatcher remarked that there was “a lot of airy fairy talk” about European Monetary Union, much of it quite uninformed. Thatcher believed that a community where three members contributed and nine were net beneficiaries “just wouldn’t survive”.Such pronouncements chimed with what many saw as her messianic final period as prime minister. Messianic was indeed was among the epithets used by diplomat Richard Ryan to describe Thatcher in a memo the previous year from the Irish embassy in London.This memo had advised Haughey to take Thatcher on and tell her that his government’s stake in the North was “many times greater than hers”. And so critical was Haughey’s letter to her that it had triggered a much lengthier encounter at the next European Council summit than was the normal half-hour allotted to such meetings. Haughey had also told her that he was tired of having Irish efforts belittled at these encounters: he could no longer accept her ballyragging. His reproach seems to have realigned their relationship, though there is no trace of the substance or merits of Haughey’s scolding in the chapter covering Northern Ireland in her autobiography. This chapter was almost certainly ghosted for her by her foreign policy adviser Charles Powell and is clearly written with the benefit of early access to the official records. And she signed off on a text which is self-serving, myopic and leaves readers with a one-dimensional perspective on the complex Anglo-Irish relationship.Both Thatcher and Haughey had first come to power some 10 years before. But while Thatcher had enjoyed continuity in office since 1979, Haughey had as often as not been in opposition and had had to endure the accolades being heaped on his arch-rival Garrett FitzGerald as he signed the Anglo-Irish Agreement with Thatcher in 1985.Haughey had initially stranded himself by dismissing the agreement as partitionist and treasonable. When returned to power he had no option but to embrace it by executing a slow incremental U-turn with as much grace as possible. Small talkWhen he met Thatcher in the margins of the European Council summit in Strasbourg in December, Haughey opened with some small talk he told her he had seen her recent television interview with David Dimbleby on BBC’s Panorama, adding that she had “come off best”. Her reply was that Dimbleby “had deserved it”. This refers to a tetchy interview in which she was reluctant to discuss her weakening grip on the Conservative leadership.It may be observed that she shared with Haughey a reluctance to become available for such interviews, save in the circumstance of a leadership “heave” when they would each adopt a “business-as-usual” tone aimed solely at calming the nerves of flaky back-benchers.On the EU Heads of State conference itself, Haughey reassured Thatcher that her contributions had been “very reasonable”. Thatcher for her part said she could go along with most things except the Social Charter. It was a misnomer, being merely “a charter for unemployment”. Haughey said it was only a declaration but Thatcher reckoned the commission would build on it “to implement measures which would put up costs and destroy employment in Europe”.They agreed to differ on the Birmingham Six case, Haughey insisting that arguments for re-opening it were now “unanswerable”. Thatcher said they had to continue the battle on security, regretting there had not been “many successes recently”. Thatcher commented that the Anglo-Irish Agreement seemed “to be alright”. She told Haughey that “we are going to have a go at devolution once again”. She did not seem optimistic. The politicians would, she said, “talk forever” but when it came to “a point of action they disappear and the whole thing breaks down”.They also discussed the fall of the Berlin Wall and a united Germany – to which Thatcher was opposed. She complained that attitudes were becoming “more and more Germanic”. Chancellor Helmut Kohl was “like a bulldozer”. East Germans were “flooding into his country”. Haughey allowed that the whole situation was “very tricky”.Thatcher also complained about “this wretched European Monetary Union idea”, reckoning that it would trigger inflation. “Then the European Parliament will also be looking for a say. Nobody gives a damn about the European Parliament. It is not a parliament at all. It is an assembly.”Thatcher had had no fixed policy on Northern Ireland: it had constantly frustrated her it had cost Airey Neave and Ian Gow, two of her closest political allies, their lives and she had herself been shaken by the IRA’s attempt to murder her at her in Brighton in 1984.In the Iveagh House files, there is testimony that after that experience, she no longer believed she would die in her own bed, fearing the IRA would some day be successful.In truth, Thatcher had little understanding of Irish complexities she was a chameleon, far too taken with the latest opinion to which she had been exposed. It could even be said she was “unreadable” on Northern Ireland: she had described it as being as British as her own constituency of Finchley she had also toyed with the idea of redrawing the border further north and – on one occasion at least, in July 1983 – she had asked her then Northern Ireland secretary James Prior whether he believed Britain should organise a “tactical withdrawal”. After a decade wrestling with the issue, Thatcher believed she was without success. Although many would credit her Anglo-Irish Agreement as transformative concerning the “totality of relationships within these islands”, she herself had disavowed it and even seemed to think it could be reversed.Her retrospective verdict is best revealed in her memoir The Downing Street Years. In this account, she reverts to regarding Northern Ireland as essentially a security issue, claiming successive British governments had “studiously refrained” from any security policies which might alienate Irish nationalists “in the hope of winning their support against the IRA”. And she reduced the Anglo- Irish Agreement to being “squarely in this tradition”.Alienated UnionistsBut she complains the policy had only alienated Unionists without winning the level of security co-operation which the British “had a right to expect”. She concluded that in the light of such experience it was “surely time to consider an alternative approach”.There was one other dimension to her Northern Ireland policy which she did not mention in her memoirs. It was she who replaced Tom King as Northern Ireland secretary with the much more sophisticated and creative Peter Brooke. When Brooke’s name was first mooted to Dublin, the London embassy did not even consider it necessary to mention her name: it was sufficient to say he would be a “no-nonsense man” and that he enjoyed “her strong confidence”.Brooke himself reveals, in Charles Moore’s final volume of his brilliant biography of Thatcher, that she had made it clear when appointing him to the post that “she didn’t want anything happening, except keeping the place on an even keel”.This underestimated Brooke’s creativity and his interest in making a difference. It is to the British records – long since in the public domain – that one must turn to discover just how tentative Brooke was at the start of his important exploration of what changes in British policy might entice Sinn Féin towards the talks table.He did write to Thatcher in March 1990 telling her there was discussion within the IRA concerning “the circumstances when violence might come to an end”. Her drawing of a wiggle under that phrase was a sure indication of scepticism. Brooke won a rebuke from her for his efforts which he henceforth underplayed, well appreciating just how irascible and fickle she could be on Northern Ireland.He continued his efforts – but below the Thatcher radar – and was well-placed to help nudge the incipient peace process forward when Thatcher was replaced in 1990 by John Major. Her initial choice of Brooke could be listed as among her positive achievements on her Irish policy, even though she would not have considered it so.Highlights from the government archives and records from 30 years ago."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4116865.1577489921!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"state papers russian jewels hidden in dublin chimney breast","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIrish Republican and Sinn Féin politician Harry Boland in New York in 1919. Photograph: Topical Press AgencyHulton|ArchiveRussian jewels smuggled into the US and later hidden in a Dublin chimney breast sounds like the plot of a spy movie, but newly-released State files show it really happened.The papers show that Harry Boland, a close associate of Michael Collins, received four jewels from a Russian envoy in April 1920 as collateral for a $20,000 loan he gave to the Russians on behalf of the Irish Government. Under the agreement, the jewels would be returned when the loan was repaid.Boland brought them home and gave them to Collins, but in the course of a heated discussion about something else, Collins threw them back at him, saying they were bloodstained.Boland brought them home to his mother’s house in Marino, where they were hidden in the bottom of the stove in the kitchen. It was summer so the stove was not lit, but when winter approached, they were moved and hidden behind a brick above it.The issue resurfaced in 1988 when Boland’s niece Eileen Barrington sought the help of the Department of Foreign Affairs to trace the whereabouts of the Russian jewels so that she and her sister may finally see them.Asked by The  about the events, Mrs Barrington, who is now 90, said she had been interested in travelling to Russia to see the jewels but tracking them down proved impossible.Her mother Kathleen was Harry Boland’s sister. When he had been shot and lay dying in 1922, he told his mother and Kathleen to keep the jewels until Éamon de Valera returned to power and the Republic was established. They did this, handing the jewels to de Valera in 1938.The file documenting the affair contains the letter from LK Martens, representative in the United States of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic, acknowledging receipt of the $20,000 loan.A Government memo notes that de Valera had received “four jewel brooches” from Mrs Barrington’s mother.Selling them at Christie’sThe memo said the minister for finance was considering selling them at Christie’s without disclosing the government’s interest in the transaction, but also wondered if the Russians should be given a chance to get them back by repaying the loan.But there was a twist – the jewels were not as valuable as first thought. A memo for government in 1948 notes they were valued by a leading firm of London jewellers and by Christie’s. “The former valued them at about £2,000 and the latter at £1,600.”It was decided to seek the money back from the Soviet embassy. In August 1949, the USSR embassy wrote to the Irish High Commissioner in London, noting that, while “this transaction has not been done in the proper way”, the Soviet government recognised the loan and would repay the $20,000.A letter from the ambassador of the USSR acknowledged the return of the jewels: “Received this 13th day of September, 1949 from the Government of Ireland, through his Excellency the High Commissioner in London, four Russian jewels on my repayment to the Government of their loan of twenty thousand Dollars,” he wrote.Mrs Barrington grew up in the Marino house but she knew nothing about the jewels until they were mentioned during an election campaign in 1948. She read about them in the Irish Press, which was posted to her when she was au-pairing in France. She wrote home to express her indignation at not being told this news and her mother replied she might well have traded them for comics if she had known about them.“And she was probably right,” Mrs Barrington said.Her parents told her the jewels were moved from the kitchen and placed in the toe of one of Boland’s riding boots “I remember seeing Uncle Harry’s boots in the bottom of the wardrobe but had no idea what they were hiding.”‘Very mystified’Her efforts to track down the jewels were futile. “I went to the Russian embassy with my sister and they were very mystified by the whole story,” she said. “They looked at us like we had horns, to be honest.”Mrs Barrington also asked the Department of Foreign Affairs to make an official representation to the USSR government on the family’s behalf.In response to a recent query from The , counsel for the Russian Embassy in Dublin Andrey Nikeryasov said the jewels were now in the State Diamond Fund in the Kremlin. This museum, which is open to the public, is said to have one the world’s most valuable collections of jewels, after the collections of crown jewels in the UK and Iran.He said the museum moved around exhibits from time to time so he could not say if they were on display, or in storage.The State Diamond Fund did not respond to queries.Mrs Barrington said the information had come a bit late for her. “I’m 90 now so I’m not likely to go trotting off to the Kremlin at this stage in my life but maybe someone in the family will be interested. I would love to see a picture of them,” she said.“My mother said they were pretty ordinary-looking, for jewels.”Highlights from the government archives and records from 30 years ago."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4119060.1576660840!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"state papers veil of secrecy lifted on confidential government documents from 1989","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCharles Haughey: The public will be able to read for the first time about what was actually said at private meetings between the then taoiseach and British prime minister Margaret Thatcher in 1989At the beginning of January each year, the National Archives lifts the veil of secrecy on thousands of boxes of documents from Government departments dating from 30 years beforehand.The 30-year rule allows the public – and scholars – to view confidential documents generated at Government level for the first time, albeit three decades after the event. So, for example, this year the public will be able to read for the first time about what was actually said at private meetings between taoiseach Charlie Haughey and British prime minister Margaret Thatcher in 1989, how the Irish government reacted to the murder of Belfast solicitor Patrick Finucane, and how it responded to the high-profile miscarriage of justice cases of the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six. Documents should in right be released from all Government departments and agencies. However, because of a lack of storage spaces and staff shortages, the National Archive was in a position to release only a fraction of the papers this winter. Documents are available for only four of the 61 agencies and departments covered by the Act and the remainder will not be available until the difficulties are resolved. Moreover, the Government has been trying to reduce the time  of confidentiality from 30 years to 20 years. The National Archive Act was amended in 2018 to reflect changes in Britain, where a new 20-year rule is already being phased in. That has resulted in state papers on Anglo-Irish relations from the North and London being made available years in advance of Ireland. In the new year, British papers from 1995 and 1996 will be released.

Should the legislation, which the Government regards as a priority, come into force, it is understood that An Bord Pleanála would be responsible for granting permissions for offshore wind farms with local authorities in coastal areas also having a role.A period of public consultation and stakeholder engagement on the proposals is to take place early in the new year. It is hoped the Bill can go forward for pre-legislative scrutiny in February and that this would take into account any issues raised during the consultation period. A source said the proposed regime would be “radically different” and would involve a “single consent principle” to remove some of the duplication that exists in the current planning process.Offshore and foreshoreIn an interview with political correspondents, Mr Varadkar said Ireland has “fallen behind where we should be on offshore wind because our planning system, for offshore and foreshore, just doesn’t work”. “So it’s a new planning system, a little bit like the land planning system working with An Bord Pleanála and that will allow us to have what I believe will be a revolution in terms of offshore wind energy,” he said. “And we need to do that. We’re going to get from 30 per cent renewables now to 70 per cent by 2030.“That’s much harder than people might think because there’s rising energy demand, and rising demand for electricity and the more data centres we have, the more electric vehicles we have, the more people we have who heat their homes with electricity rather than oil or gas or solid fuels, the more electricity we’ll need. So we’re going to need a huge level of investment in wind energy, and solar too, and we’re going to need to make sure that happens.”Minister for Climate Action Richard Bruton said in November that, under current laws, only offshore renewable energy projects within the limits of the foreshore, 12 nautical miles, can be licensed.‘Legal lacunae’The new Bill is expected to address what has been described as a “legal lacunae” in relation to the State’s inability to regulate such offshore projects.Mr Varadkar said that, under the Government’s climate action plan, there would be “more investment in renewable energy, in public transport, in cycling and charging points, insulating homes and buildings, and greener agriculture and bioersity”.The Government has also approved the main points of the Climate Action Bill, which brings into effect the governance mechanisms around the climate action plan.The Taoiseach said carbon budgets were being put in place as well as plans to enshrine in law a 2050 target for climate neutrality, a goal to offset emissions of greenhouse gases by planting trees or through carbon-capturing technologies.Mr Varadkar, who has previously admitted that Ireland is a “laggard” in terms of reaching EU targets on renewable energy, said these moves would “make sure that this government and future governments have to deliver on climate action”.

File photograph:  Damon WinterNew York Times Politics is increasingly likened to sport in its tribal allegiances. This is to do sport an unconscionable disservice. The authentic fan is healthily cynical about their own team, after all. Scathing, even. Blind enthusiasm tends to be the mark of the try-hard newcomer. No, a political party is capable of inspiring a kind of mob loyalty – a credulity – that is well beyond a mere Manchester United or New England Patriots to arouse.The point was made again last week, when the US House of Representatives voted almost exactly along party lines in the impeachment of President Donald Trump. As for the public, from whom politicians take their cue, surveys record almost all Democrats supporting the action and almost all Republicans opposed. A voter’s political priors are the best predictor of their judgment on this question. The balance of evidence matters less, as does the president’s near-confession in front of television cameras when the Ukraine scandal first broke.The depth of American partisanship is well understood. The reasons for it are not. We know that supreme court nominees are confirmed by narrower, bitterer margins than in the days of cross-party unanimity. We know that no president has won 400 electoral college votes since 1988. We know that Republicans once renounced their own president, Richard Nixon, in a way that is hard to imagine 45 years later. Right-wing noiseWe just do not know why. Explanations come as grand as the absence of a geopolitical threat to bring Americans together since the fall of the USSR. They come as small as the deregulation of broadcast media in the 1980s, exposing Americans to Fox News’s right-wing noise and the too-easy liberalism of the Daily Show.As another partisan decade winds down, I wonder if the ultimate answer is simply the human need to belong. As politics was coarsening in the 1990s, the Harvard academic Robert Putnam was recording the collapse of associational life in the US. Americans, who had once found meaning and togetherness in trade unions, bowling clubs and other voluntary groups, were less and less likely to belong to such things. The US had a giant market and a formidable state, but not a textured civil society to fill the space in between. And this was before the decline in religious affiliation that constitutes perhaps the single most important social trend since then.Seen from this angle, political tribalism starts to make more sense. Perhaps it is nothing so much as a substitute for these vanished forms of human contact. It allows an atomised inidual to plug into a kind of fellowship. It sets up an Other against which one might define oneself. What it might lack in face-to-face intimacy, it makes up for with an enclosed world of partisan media, in which a person need never leave the (virtual) company of the like-minded.Notice the unimportance of ideological content here. Trump overturned a generation of laissez-faire economics and interventionist foreign policy and Republicans still cherished him over dozens of politicians of superior doctrinal purity. If he reverts back again – and he has, a bit – they remain with him yet. What matters is his aggression on behalf of the tribe. People crave the fellow-feeling, not the substance.Social fragmentationIt is hard to establish a causal link between atomisation and political tribalism. As with other theories for the rise of partisanship, all we have to go on is historic correlation. The social fragmentation that Putnam documented took place between the mid-1970s and the millennium. America’s bipartisan politics broke down over more or less the same period, from the (relatively) cross-party ousting of Nixon to the hardened tribes of 1990s Washington. Last week’s impeachment vote is the terminal point of at least three decades of my-party-right-or-wrong. Reversing this baleful trend will require a clearer understanding of why it emerged in the first place than any leading politician has demonstrated so far.In a debate with fellow Democrats this month, Joe Biden showed his nostalgia for the collaborative Washington of his early career. Such sweetness of intent explains his national popularity, but it also leads him to underrate the problem at hand. The former vice-president tends to imply that the old dealmaking culture faltered through a lack of goodwill among political elites or something equally fixable in short order. His rival Pete Buttigieg is another who sets huge store in conciliatory leadership as the way to a more unified America. The deeper structural and even psychological forces behind partisanship, the possibility that elites are merely channelling an animus that already festers in the country – these are missed in the haze. Source of identityFor millions, politics has become less a means to an end than a source of identity and belonging that used to come from other things. If this is right, then the US will not overcome partisanship by refining the manners of its political class. It will need to revive the associative life that used to provide citizens with those spiritual essentials. One of these tasks is easier than the other.In 1974, Republicans could turn against one of their own because Republicanism was not the basis of their entire identity. That is true of fewer conservatives in 2019, and fewer liberals too. The extent to which people now build their sense of self on their political affiliation is grim. But in the absence of other collectives in which to subsume themselves, it might also be entirely natural. The human impulse to associate takes whatever outlet it can find. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Hawaii tourist helicopter disappears with seven people on boardTrain companies should be rewarded contracts based on benefit to local economies, new report findsForeign Office reveals odd enquiries from 2019, including a request for 50 Cent\u0026#39s phone numberNew poll finds the BBC is less trusted than ITV amid concerns over biasHuman Rights Act is being misused and should be overhauled, leading Oxford academic claimsThousands of blue badges handed to people with \u0026#39hidden disabilities\u0026#39 including anxietyGrease star Olivia Newton-John celebrates her British ancestry with a New Year honourDuchess of Cambridge pays tribute to \u0026#39tireless\u0026#39 UK midwives after shadowing them on roundsQueen rewards right-hand man for guiding her through \u0026#39bumpy\u0026#39 year of Brexit and Prince AndrewSolheim Cup captain Catriona Matthew among Scots on New Year\u0026#39s Honours ListFormer chief prosecutor Alison Saunders rewarded with damehood despite series of scandalsIain Duncan Smith leads political honours with knighthoodComment: The Jonathan Fletcher I knew was tall, dark and handsome - but we know abusers don’t all have bad teeth and dirty macsMother claims something was \u0026#39wrong\u0026#39 with Spanish resort pool where father and two children diedAbusive minister writing intimidating letters to victims telling them he is \u0026#39praying for them\u0026#39, it is revealed Czech spies wrote how to guide for targeting Labour MPs choosing those who wanted to live the high lifeComment: The new Government can restore and revive some of our beloved traditionsPrincess Anne attacks \u0026#39risky\u0026#39 health and safety cultureComment: The Labour Party\u0026#39s patriotism problem goes back much further than Jeremy CorbynWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/12/23/TELEMMGLPICT000218181475_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwSrXQAD_WS9MbUDhaE03OjE.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"could bbc get christmas carol wrong","story":"Guy Pearce as ScroogeYou know what’s been really good this Christmas?

The 71-year-old, who was born in Cambridge but emigrated with her family to Australia at the age of six, is being recognised for her services to charity, cancer research and entertainment.In a statement, she described herself as “excited, honoured and grateful beyond words”. She also paid tribute to the “esteemed group of women” who have received damehoods in the past and spoke of her pride in her British roots. Newton-John, who has also won four Grammy awards and had three UK number ones, is a prominent advocate for breast cancer research and other health issues, having lived with the disease herself, on and off, since 1992.Following her first diagnosis she had a partial mastectomy and reconstruction. She remained cancer-free until a recurrence in 2013, and in September 2018 Newton-John revealed she had been diagnosed with cancer for a third time. Australian singer and actress Olivia Newton-John and American actor John Travolta as they appear in the Paramount film \u0026#39Grease\u0026#39, 1978In 2008, she founded the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness and Research Centre near Melbourne, Australia, which provides medical research and the latest cutting-edge treatments and now spends much of her time raising funds for the facility. Talking to The  earlier this year, the actress revealed the wide range of measures she has taken, aside from conventional treatment, to fight the disease. “I\u0027ve been vegan and macrobiotic and I went for many months without sugar,” she said. But she added that she had recently changed her approach.I\u0027ve never seen cancer as a fight or a battle. In fact, over the decades I\u0027ve kind of befriended it - and right now I\u0027m asking it to leave. Because instead of picking a fight with my body, I would rather keep calm. She also revealed how she almost turned down her career-defining role in Grease because she was worried the film would flop and, at 29, thought she was too old to be playing the 17-year-old goody-goody student who falls in love with John Travolta’s Danny Zuko. Studio publicity film still from \u0026#34Grease\u0026#34 Olivia Newton-John, John Travolta 1978It was only when Travolta, an old friend, visited her personally and convinced her to do it that she changed her mind. “And when I asked for a screen test to see if we had the chemistry needed, that test cemented it,” she added. “Because we did have it. Lots of it.Newton-John\u0027s career in entertainment started when she formed a girl group with classmates called Sol Four at the age of 14, before winning a talent contest on Australian TV show Sing, Sing, Sing, bagging a trip to the UK.She went to the UK on the advice of her mother and, once there, she recorded her first single in 1966, Till You Say You\u0027ll Be Mine.Newton-John then formed a partnership with a friend from Melbourne, Pat Carroll, touring army bases and clubs throughout the UK and Europe as the double act Pat and Olivia.Olivia Newton-John in Beverly Hills at the Julien\u0026#39s Auction of the memorabilia, from her famous movies Grease and XanaduHer second single, a cover of Bob Dylan\u0027s If Not For You, reached the top 10 in the UK and Australia, giving her an early taste of success before her next single, Banks Of The Ohio, topped the charts in Australia.In 1974 she represented the UK at the Eurovision Song Contest with the song Long Live Love, coming in fourth place in the year Abba won with Waterloo.Newton-John experienced further pop music success in the years following Eurovision, before the career-defining role in Grease came in 1978.The film, powered by songs such as You\u0027re The One That I Want, Hopelessly Devoted To You and Summer Nights, was an instant success and the film’s soundtrack remains one of the best-selling albums ever.Newton-John has also starred in a number of other films, including musical fantasy Xanadu, and enjoyed success with the title song from that movie and the 1981 hit Physical.Earlier this year, her black leather jacket and skin-tight trouser combo from Grease’s closing scene fetched more than £300,000 at an auction, with proceeds going to her wellness and research centre.Hawaii tourist helicopter disappears with seven people on boardTrain companies should be rewarded contracts based on benefit to local economies, new report findsForeign Office reveals odd enquiries from 2019, including a request for 50 Cent\u0026#39s phone numberNew poll finds the BBC is less trusted than ITV amid concerns over biasHuman Rights Act is being misused and should be overhauled, leading Oxford academic claimsThousands of blue badges handed to people with \u0026#39hidden disabilities\u0026#39 including anxietyDuchess of Cambridge pays tribute to \u0026#39tireless\u0026#39 UK midwives after shadowing them on roundsQueen rewards right-hand man for guiding her through \u0026#39bumpy\u0026#39 year of Brexit and Prince AndrewSolheim Cup captain Catriona Matthew among Scots on New Year\u0026#39s Honours ListFormer chief prosecutor Alison Saunders rewarded with damehood despite series of scandalsIain Duncan Smith leads political honours with knighthoodComment: The Jonathan Fletcher I knew was tall, dark and handsome - but we know abusers don’t all have bad teeth and dirty macsMother claims something was \u0026#39wrong\u0026#39 with Spanish resort pool where father and two children diedAbusive minister writing intimidating letters to victims telling them he is \u0026#39praying for them\u0026#39, it is revealed Czech spies wrote how to guide for targeting Labour MPs choosing those who wanted to live the high lifeComment: The new Government can restore and revive some of our beloved traditionsPrincess Anne attacks \u0026#39risky\u0026#39 health and safety cultureComment: The Labour Party\u0026#39s patriotism problem goes back much further than Jeremy CorbynComment: Give Northern regions the power to cut taxes and they can thriveWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/12/24/TELEMMGLPICT000217347874_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVFtQMSn7ZYEgFkbAp9DEg4eKJZAPd6r6jcTrhbcVw0.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"love gavin stacey much remind us","story":"\u0026#39Over the years, the sit-com\u0026#39s cast of idiosyncratic characters have come to feel like family\u0026#39Why oh why do we love Gavin \u0026amp Stacey so?

Only Canada comes close to the UK, with a threefold increase in average property prices.\u0026nbspHouse prices in the UK have also risen substantially faster than incomes. Average house prices are now almost twice as high relative to a measure of average household disposable income as they were 40 years ago.Andrew Bailey faces a host of challenges as next Bank of England chiefChronic undersupply of housing in the UK has frequently been blamed for pushing up prices but David Miles and Victoria Monro at the Bank of England found this has not been a significant driver.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The researchers compared house prices, which have risen sharply, with rents, which have remained relatively stable compared to incomes.They concluded that if the main cause of rising prices was lack of properties then rents would also have increased sharply – but this has not happened.According to the bank, UK homeowners currently have a record £1.6 trillion of outstanding home loans.The latest research suggests the\u0026nbspproperty market\u0026nbspwould be vulnerable to sustained interest rate increases – despite the stress tests that loan applicants take to estimate whether they could afford rising monthly mortgage payments in the event that interest rates go up.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Someone who watches a streaming show in the morning could see a carton of orange juice within a character’s reach, while a different viewer watching the same thing in the afternoon could see a can of soda.Created with Sketch.The 40 best films of the decade Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.140 40.

With every click of the remote, viewers tell the services something about themselves, information that can be used to determine which products might appeal to them.This supercharged version of digital product placement is being developed at a time when the marketing business — which bet big on TV commercials for decades — needs new tricks to grab the attention of ad-hating cord-cutters.Beringer, the head of Mirriad, said the current digital product placement technology has been successful enough to suggest that a bespoke version is a logical next step.“Viewers have been educated to look away from advertising,” he said. “But we’re putting something in that contextually makes sense. If you do it well, and it’s not annoying, it can work.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some of the data is collected by the platforms themselves, others by outside data companies. And now streaming services are mulling how to make use of that information to create tailored product placements.“Just like there’s no reason that all viewers of a program need to see the same advertisement, there’s no reason that they all need see the same brand integration or crossover campaign,” said David Schweidel, a marketing professor at Emory University.Streaming platforms are trying out other advertising innovations, too. Hulu, a platform controlled by the Walt Disney Company, has ads that appear when a viewer hits the pause button. Last week, it rolled out specialised ads for people who are bingeing on three or more episodes of a show, with commercials for Kellogg’s, Maker’s Mark and Georgia-Pacific.This year, Walmart-owned streaming service Vudu enabled so-called shoppable ads on internet-connected televisions. With a click of the remote on the words “Add to Cart,” customers are able to drop an advertised product into their Walmart queue.On the Roku Channel, a streaming channel on the company’s digital media player, viewers can click on certain commercials to request an email or text with details about the product on display.

In another scene, a phone’s broken screen suddenly appears fixed.“Consumers are so much more empowered today to flip the dial, to change the channel, and many of the things they could switch to don’t have advertising at all,” said Scott Rosenberg, a senior vice president at Roku. “It’s incumbent on platforms and apps that are ad-supported to work harder at how they put ads in front of the consumer.”Virtual product placement companies like Mirriad and its rival Ryff said they are talking with streaming services about using data to customize product placements to viewers. Mirriad and Ryff would not name their potential partners.Product placement is appealing to streaming services because it allows them to work with companies without interrupting a show with commercials. Hulu, which comes in a low-cost ad-supported version and also has a commercial-free option for subscribers willing to pay more, said that so-called brand integrations on its platform have been far more effective than 30-second commercials at raising viewers’ interest in products.Some skeptics say virtual product placements based on viewer preferences may turn out to be one of those innovations that does not catch on. A few well-placed TV commercials and billboards are likely to reach the same number of people with less trouble, said Joe Maceda, an executive at the media agency Mindshare.“It’s hard to know if the juice is worth the squeeze,” he said.The possibilities of inidualised product placement were on display in Bandersnatch,\u0026nbspan extended installment of the Netflix series Black Mirror,\u0026nbspa speculative fiction show that specialises in horrifying tales of invasive technologies and exploitative digital companies.Bandersnatch was interactive. Viewers determined how the story, set in 1980s Britain, unfolded by clicking on choices presented to them at various forks in the narrative road. Early on, the film asked viewers to choose between two breakfast cereals, Sugar Puffs or Frosties. Their selection determined which one would appear in a commercial shown on a TV set in the background of a scene later in the film.The most hilarious product placements in cinemaSugar Puffs and Frosties were not included as part of an ad, Netflix said, but rather as a way for the Black Mirror\u0026nbspcreators to enhance the film’s 1980s setting. Netflix was not paid by the cereal companies.But all those remotes clicking on one cereal or the other provided Netflix with data on its subscribers’ preferences. Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, cited Bandersnatch\u0026nbspduring a webcast timed to an earnings report this year. Holding up two boxes of cereal, he announced that 73 per cent of Bandersnatch viewers had selected Kellogg’s Frosties.The other executives on the webcast chuckled.“The most critical data point of the quarter!” joked Spencer Wang, a vice president.Netflix, which does not run commercials, said it would not use the information it had gleaned from Bandersnatch,\u0026nbspsaying in a statement that “the privacy of our members is a top priority.”But marketing executives like Ricky Ray Butler, chief executive of product placement company Branded Entertainment Network, are enthusiastic about the possibility of inserting brand-name products into streaming shows based on data generated by interactive programming. Actually being able to do so, he said, may still be a long way off.“The world’s not ready for it yet,” he said. “We’re just at the tip of the iceberg.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

APTaking Harry Belafonte’s 1956 hit “Mary’s Boy Child” and singing it in medley with new song “Oh My Lord”, Boney M’s No 1 hit combined Christmas carol-like harmonies with Euro disco, steel drums and a reggae sensibility. It might sound disastrous – but somehow it works. AP“He’s gone2,000 milesIs very far,” sings Chrissie Hynde, above a twanging guitar riff in “2,000 Miles”, her serpentine melody stretching each syllable into several. You could easily assume it’s about two separated lovers, but it was actually written for the band’s original guitar player, James Honeyman-Scott, who died of a drug overdose a year earlier at the age of 25. The song is desperately bleak – as is the case with all the best Christmas songs – but with a note of festive hopefulness too. “The children were singingHe’ll be back at Christmas time.” AP418 15) Rockin\u0027 Around the Christmas Tree – Brenda LeeBrenda Lee was just 13 years old when she made herself a rockabilly legend thanks to the recording of this party classic. It always reminds me of scenes in The Santa Clause (one of the best ever Christmas films) where the jaunty number was heavily featured, along with seminal holiday movie Home Alone. RO518 14) Let it Snow! Let it Snow! Let it Snow! – Dean MartinFew Christmas songs are as cosy as this one. Dean Martin’s smooth, rich voice is as warming as a good glass of whisky paired with sweeping, romantic strings and a chirpy flute, “Let it Snow!” conjures up images of stockings hanging up over the chimney, a Christmas tree glinting with baubles, and a frost-tinted window with snow falling outside. RO618 13) Walking in the Air – The Snowman  Peter AutyThough Aled Jones tends to get the credit for this haunting masterpiece, it is actually the voice of choirboy Peter Auty that appears in the climactic scene of the wordless 1982 animation The Snowman. He wasn’t credited though, and when his voice broke and Jones’s version reached number five in the UK charts, he was almost written out of history. In truth, though, whichever version you hear, the song’s sweeping grandeur is goosebumps-inducing. AP718 12) Peace on Earth Little Drummer Boy – David Bowie Bing CrosbyRecorded for Bing Crosby’s TV special Merrie Olde Christmas, and framed around a strange scripted exchange of banter between the two, this mash-up only came about because Bowie hated the song, “Little Drummer Boy”, that he had been asked on the show to sing. So songwriters Ian Fraser and Larry Grossman, alongside the show’s scriptwriter, cobbled together “Peace on Earth” to serve as a counterpoint, while Crosby performed the intended song. They recorded the resulting medley after less than an hour of rehearsal, and five weeks later, Crosby died. AP“Eartha Kitt is the sexiest woman in the world. You don’t write Christmas songs that are sexy. How are we going to do that?”This Mel Torme composition was originally written, according to Torme, with Bob Wells as a mind-over-matter attempt to stay cool during a stifling summer day in 1945. It’s one of Cole’s most enduring hits, and one of the most beloved of all Christmas songs. RO1018 9) I Believe in Father Christmas – Greg LakeThis Mel Torme composition was originally written, according to Torme, with Bob Wells as a mind-over-matter attempt to stay cool during a stifling summer day in 1945. It’s one of Cole’s most enduring hits, and one of the most beloved of all Christmas songs. RO1118 8) It\u0027s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year – Andy WilliamsAndy Williams’ classic brings to mind the kind of big, brash Christmas’s you see in American films – lots of presents, blazing fireplaces and a huge feast – but also plays heavily on the importance of spending time with your loved ones. It consistently appears in the top 10s of Christmas song rankings, and more than 50 years in, the 1963 staple shows no signs of wearing out. RO1218 7) \u0027Stop the Cavalry – Jona LewieIt was “just another anti-war song” until Jona Lewie threw a kazoo into the mix. The English singer-songwriter never intended “Stop the Cavalry” to become a Christmas single, but the festive mention in the line “I wish I was at home for Christmas”, along with the addition of a Salvation Army brass band and tubular bell, was enough to convince listeners.1318 6) Driving Home for Christmas – Chris ReaIn 1978, Rea thought it was all over. His record contract was done, and his manager had just told him he was quitting. Rea wanted to get home from London’s Abbey Road studios to Middlesborough, but his record company wouldn’t pay for a ticket.Sinatra’s version of this classic Christmas song opens on his isolated vocals before gradually introducing the swooning choir and tender strings section. And the lyrics: “Have yourself a merry little ChristmasMake the Yuletide gay  From now on your troubles will be miles awayHere we are as in olden daysHappy golden days of yoreFaithful friends who are dear to us  Gather near to us once more.” RO1518 4) All I Want for Christmas is You – Mariah CareyGeorge Michael wrote, performed, produced and played every single instrument on this song, where the narrator looks back with sadness on a past relationship. As with “Fairytale of New York”, you have an upbeat, cheerful rhythm and chirpy instrumentation, against the melancholy of unrequited love in the lyrics, with the suggestion that it was given away too hastily (“This year, to save me from tearsI’ll give it to someone special”). RO1718 2) Fairytale of New York – The PoguesSome of the best songs combine uplifting instrumentation that contrasts with lyrics that can be downright miserable, and such is the case for “Fairytale of New York”. It has none of the sickly sweet sentimentality of Mariah Carey’s “All I Want For Christmas Is You” or Wham!’s “Last Christmas”.Richard (Dick) Smith was suffering from tuberculosis, an illness which had plagued him since a child, from his bed in a sanatorium in Philadelphia. Gazing longingly out of his window at the snow, he wrote a poem describing all the things he would do when he was well again. He was inspired by the views of people playing in the park across the street from his family home on Church Street, where he’d lived with his mother, brother and two sisters. His father had died when he was a child. 118 18) Happy Xmas (War is Over) – John Lennon and Yoko OnoThere’s a caveat to the optimistic message of the song’s title. “War is over,” sing a choir of children over festive tambourines, but only, they add, “If you want it.” Having analysed the success of his previous single, “Imagine,” the former Beatle noted, “Now I understand what you have to do: Put your political message across with a little honey.” On this, an anti-Vietnam war protest song wrapped up in sleigh bells, strings and an anthemic melody, he does just that.

RO1018 9) I Believe in Father Christmas – Greg LakeThis Mel Torme composition was originally written, according to Torme, with Bob Wells as a mind-over-matter attempt to stay cool during a stifling summer day in 1945. It’s one of Cole’s most enduring hits, and one of the most beloved of all Christmas songs. RO1118 8) It\u0027s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year – Andy WilliamsAndy Williams’ classic brings to mind the kind of big, brash Christmas’s you see in American films – lots of presents, blazing fireplaces and a huge feast – but also plays heavily on the importance of spending time with your loved ones. It consistently appears in the top 10s of Christmas song rankings, and more than 50 years in, the 1963 staple shows no signs of wearing out. RO1218 7) \u0027Stop the Cavalry – Jona LewieIt was “just another anti-war song” until Jona Lewie threw a kazoo into the mix. The English singer-songwriter never intended “Stop the Cavalry” to become a Christmas single, but the festive mention in the line “I wish I was at home for Christmas”, along with the addition of a Salvation Army brass band and tubular bell, was enough to convince listeners.1318 6) Driving Home for Christmas – Chris ReaIn 1978, Rea thought it was all over. His record contract was done, and his manager had just told him he was quitting. Rea wanted to get home from London’s Abbey Road studios to Middlesborough, but his record company wouldn’t pay for a ticket.Sinatra’s version of this classic Christmas song opens on his isolated vocals before gradually introducing the swooning choir and tender strings section. And the lyrics: “Have yourself a merry little ChristmasMake the Yuletide gay  From now on your troubles will be miles awayHere we are as in olden daysHappy golden days of yoreFaithful friends who are dear to us  Gather near to us once more.” RO1518 4) All I Want for Christmas is You – Mariah CareyGeorge Michael wrote, performed, produced and played every single instrument on this song, where the narrator looks back with sadness on a past relationship. As with “Fairytale of New York”, you have an upbeat, cheerful rhythm and chirpy instrumentation, against the melancholy of unrequited love in the lyrics, with the suggestion that it was given away too hastily (“This year, to save me from tearsI’ll give it to someone special”). RO1718 2) Fairytale of New York – The PoguesSome of the best songs combine uplifting instrumentation that contrasts with lyrics that can be downright miserable, and such is the case for “Fairytale of New York”. It has none of the sickly sweet sentimentality of Mariah Carey’s “All I Want For Christmas Is You” or Wham!’s “Last Christmas”.Richard (Dick) Smith was suffering from tuberculosis, an illness which had plagued him since a child, from his bed in a sanatorium in Philadelphia. Gazing longingly out of his window at the snow, he wrote a poem describing all the things he would do when he was well again. He was inspired by the views of people playing in the park across the street from his family home on Church Street, where he’d lived with his mother, brother and two sisters. His father had died when he was a child. The offending lyric was not removed from the song in the recent\u0026nbspGavin \u0026amp Stacey\u0026nbspChristmas special, with many viewers complaining after Ruth Jones and Rob Brydon’s characters sang the word.Jones defended the use of the word, arguing that the moment “stayed true to the characters”.She said: “Characters in Gavin \u0026amp Stacey are kind and big-hearted, I believe. So I think no one is going to be intentionally hurtful.“But by the same token, they’re not necessarily going to be completely politically correct or be aware of political correctness.”Last year, MacGowan\u0026nbspsaid he was “absolutely fine”\u0026nbspwith radio stations bleeping the word out.Fairytale of New York\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspGavin and Stacey\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Few dead horses have been more flogged, but if you stretch your mind back enough, it is possible to remember a series with a fantastic premise that kept us guessing for 12 whole episodes. The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost.

Mr Coban founded charity My Life My Say, which aims to make democracy accessible for young people.He said: “My parents always instilled into us to give something back to our community, so for one of their children to receive an MBE for the work he has done with his community – that will be huge.”Some well-known civil society figures have also been given top honours, including damehoods for Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizen’s Advice, and Julia Unwin, the former chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.

Only Canada comes close to the UK, with a threefold increase in average property prices.\u0026nbspHouse prices in the UK have also risen substantially faster than incomes. Average house prices are now almost twice as high relative to a measure of average household disposable income as they were 40 years ago.Andrew Bailey faces a host of challenges as next Bank of England chiefChronic undersupply of housing in the UK has frequently been blamed for pushing up prices but David Miles and Victoria Monro at the Bank of England found this has not been a significant driver.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The researchers compared house prices, which have risen sharply, with rents, which have remained relatively stable compared to incomes.They concluded that if the main cause of rising prices was lack of properties then rents would also have increased sharply – but this has not happened.According to the bank, UK homeowners currently have a record £1.6 trillion of outstanding home loans.The latest research suggests the\u0026nbspproperty market\u0026nbspwould be vulnerable to sustained interest rate increases – despite the stress tests that loan applicants take to estimate whether they could afford rising monthly mortgage payments in the event that interest rates go up.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailAs people headed to the polls, Mr Saar told reporters that Israel needed “a new path ... to form a strong and stable government that will allow us to unite the people of Israel”.He was widely expected to lose.But Mr Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, still fought a fierce battle, dismissing Mr Saar as inexperienced while talking up his own security credentials and diplomatic prowess.Mr Netanyahu’s supporters, meanwhile, sought to paint Mr Saar as a backer of the corruption case and being part of what the prime minister calls a “political witch hunt” to force him from power.The prime minister, who currently heads up a caretaker government, has also faced mounting criticism for his handling of the security crisis with Gaza.Over the last year and a half, there have been several fierce cross-border exchanges of fire between militants in Gaza and Israeli’s security forces.In fact, as the prime minister campaigned in the southern city of Ashkelon on Wednesday, he was forced to flee the stage when a rocket fired from Gaza set off sirens.\u0026nbspNetanyahu’s personal lawyer to be charged with money launderingIsrael in limbo as Netanyahu charged – conflict is the only certaintyIsraeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu charged with briberyThird Israel election looms as Benny Gantz fails to form governmentNetanyahu’s gamble with Gaza may save his career but spark a warIt was the second time he has been bundled off stage due to incoming fire – he was rushed to a rocket shelter in the nearby city of Ashdod in September.Mr Gantz responded to the primary results, saying Blue and White must win the upcoming elections.“It appears that the defendant Netanyahu, who is leading the State of Israel down a path of corruption, will continue to lead Likud,” he said.“The state of Israel must set out on a new course. To make that happen, Blue and White must achieve a decisive outcome that will extricate us from both political deadlock and a path of corruption.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He arrived with his mother and father and his eight brothers and sisters after two days of walking. He recalls seeing many dead bodies lining the sides of the tracks that led to Uganda’s northern border. The family were fearful of abduction by rebel groups or becoming caught in crossfire between the government and militia groups. David enjoyed school immensely in South Sudan but said his school had closed due to conflict. He attends Alaba School at Bidi Bidi Refugee Settlement. David dreams of a better life for his family.Sarah, 14, arrived to Kigeme refugee camp from DRC in 2012. Her parents, now unemployed in Rwanda, worked as rag traders. They made the decision to flee the fighting for the safety and relative calm of Rwanda. They were made to feel very welcome by the host community. Sarah is enrolled in class, three years behind where she should be, due to conflict, and she really enjoys her schooling. GS Gasaka school, run by Education Above All Foundation and UNHCR, is providing her the environment to allow her to dream one day of becoming an accountant so she can help her family live a better life.Nakato 19, was born and raised in Yumbe, Uganda. A graduate from Aruma High School, she has aspirations of becoming a journalist. She is actively involved in a movement called “Raise up and Talk” to help empower the younger generation to share their experiences and stories as a form of therapy, to help process the trauma from a life in conflict. Forestal, nine, is in second grade at Marescot School, Haiti. The school is funded through the partnership between non-profit buildOn Haiti, and Educate A Child (EAC), who have constructed 58 schools, as well as training 959 teachers. Forestal explains how she was given up by her father after the death of her mother. She now lives with her auntie as a “restavek” (child in domestic servitude) where she performs chores around the house for at least two hours a day including laundry, sweeping and mopping floors. She can only recall seeing her father once in her entire life. “It was only for one day, but it was really great, we had so much fun,” she says. Forestal hopes that she can see him again – but he lives and works in Port Au Prince, more than three hours away by car.Furaha, six, attends Buremba Primary School. She is a member of the Batwa “Pygmy” tribe, forced out of their native home in the Bwindi Forest to make way for a national park protected as a Unesco World Heritage Site. She lives in Kitahurira settlement camp, about 2.5km and a three-hour walk from her school. The construction of schools and training of teachers in remote areas of challenging geography ensures those hardest to reach have a right to education. Building Tomorrow Uganda through its partnership with Education Above All Foundation has enrolled 53,373 out-of-school children back into quality primary education in Uganda.Niyosenga,12, arrived from Kiyiri, DRC, in 2016. Her mother was killed in the fierce fighting which swept through towns and villages. She made the journey with her father and grandmother to the relative safe haven of Uganda to join the 1.2 million refugees. Niyosenga remained out of education in DRC until the age of nine as the long walk to school was too dangerous with roads closed by police or rebel militia.To help pay for Niyosenga’s school fees her father grows maize while her grandmother, 72, weaves baskets.Jasme, 10, is enrolled at a buildOn school in Perigny. Her two brothers and three sisters all attend the same school. Unlike the reported 300,000 restavek children that live away from their biological parents, Jasme lives with her family.Esperence, 10, goes to Perigny school. Seated on a bench at the end of a long dark corridor, overcome with emotion, he explains how he was given up by his biological parents at the age of eight. He now lives with his auntie and is a restavek child. The term restavek comes from the French rester avec, to stay with. Discussing the work around the house he has to complete as part of his daily chores, he explains: “I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs.”Yean, six, lives in Phnom Penh. Yean’s mother, a widow, feels helpless as she simply cannot earn enough to support her family. Today, Yean lives with her 80-year-old grandmother Khzm Men in Sensok 5, a settlement in the village of Kohmouta on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The settlement was relocated from one of the capital’s inner city slums areas. Yean attends public school on the periphery of the settlement but due to the informal school fees system in Cambodia, she is forced to consider dropping out due to lack of funds. Yean is desperate to continue her education to fulfil her dreams of becoming a nurse, but without assistance her dreams seem out of reach.Charles, 16, lived with his mother and father in DRC. The Marekera family were forced to leave because their son was persecuted for being an albino. His father was repeatedly beaten after refusing to sell Charles to witchdoctors, who believe teeth, fingers and eyes brought good luck to those who bought their body parts. The transition for Charles arriving in Uganda from DRC has left him with large gaps in his education. Leaving as a senior in secondary school, he now finds himself back in primary school – and facing a similar stigma as an albino in Uganda. His long walks to school are interrupted by strangers attempting to lure him away to profit from the sale of his body parts. Charles explained: “I will never feel safe, however my safety now is less important to me than getting an education. I am determined to get my diploma and have a job where I can help protect the rights of other albinos.”Athar, 21, a beneficiary of Al Fakhoora, a programme of the Education Above All Foundation, was the youngest member to join the writers’ association, aged 14. She stressed the importance of explaining what is happening to the Palestinian people. Five years ago the conflict changed her life forever. She said: “The house was full of our relatives, suddenly everything went dark. I tried to get out of the house, I felt a pain in my leg and there was so much blood. I lost consciousness and woke in the ambulance. Hospitals ran out of anaesthetic so doctors stitched injuries I sustained without it, it was incredibly painful. I heard the news that my father was killed. Losing him was incredibly difficult for me as we were so close.” As a child, Athar had dreamt of becoming a writer or a poet. She said: “My father was my inspiration, encouraging me to write, since his death I have struggled to write anything. For me education is like food or fuel, an energy that gives me power to keep going.”Moza was born and raised east of the Tigris river that ides the city of Mosul. Her parents and five siblings have lived in a two-room concrete dwelling for 10 years. Farhan, Moza’s father, works as a labourer carrying blocks on construction sites across the city. He is in need of a hernia operation, which will cost £200, and finds work extremely difficult. He can’t afford six months off work to recover. The family income is only £62 per month, which barely covers bills. They are forced to take credit from shops to be able to eat. Moza is due to enrol back into schooling. However, at present, she cares for her mother who suffers respiratory problems due to a lodged bullet in her lung after being caught in crossfire during the conflict. She doesn’t know what to expect as she has never set foot in a classroom. Two years beyond the normal enrolment age of six, she still has great dreams of working with NGOs to help residents displaced from the city.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Ali, nine, a Syrian refugee family from Deir ez-Zur district in eastern Syria arrived in Lebanon in 2011. They fled their home with several neighbours by bus toward a safer haven in Lebanon at the outbreak of civil war, which tore through their country. Heavy shelling bombarded their bus and the remainder of their journey had to be made on foot. Nine-year old Ali Ahmed’s father, an agricultural labourer explained that life in Lebanon was hard as they struggle to pay basic bills such as food and rent. As with most Syrian refugees, they are in debt to their landlords and to local shops owners. The collective family income is barely enough to cover any of their bills. Ali, one of the family’s 10 children, attends school 10km from home and dreams, one day, to be able to return home with his family to Syria.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Owen, 16, has been enrolled in Buremba Primary School since 2007 and is one of eight siblings. Now in older years at school, he must pay more money. His parents are peasant farmers and work the land digging and picking tea, this means they must work most days to be able to keep up the payments. Buremba School is one of 60 new schools constructed under the Building Tomorrow and Educate A Child programme in Uganda.Afat, 12, left his home in Deir ez-Zor, Syria six years ago, forced out by the civil war which displaced millions of people, in his case to the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. He is one of the thousands of Syrian refugee children sat in doorways of Lebanon’s many tents, shelters and makeshift homes dreaming of an education. Instead, he works 11 hours a day collecting scrap metal which he sells for around £2.50. He knows he has a right to education, but he is concerned to help provide for his family. He dreams of one day being able to return home to Syria with his family, to a better life.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added: “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Ikiriza, 5, Kamwenge District, Uganda. Ikiriza who is five years old lives in a small house with his nine brothers and sisters. His parents can’t afford school tuition fees for all the children, leaving Ikiriza with little choice but to fund his own education by working weekends carrying plastic jerry cans of water from the lake for various households of the neighbourhood in Kamwenge district. For this, he earns the equivalent of 5 US cents a day, which helps contribute towards his school fees at Bisozi Primary. He dreams of one day becoming a doctor so that he can help his father who suffers from ill health.Rami, six, lives at Beach Camp, on the sea front amongst the heart of the fishing community al-Shati in the northern Gaza Strip. Rami walks amongst the rubble of shelled buildings, a reminder of past and present conflicts. Restriction to employment and travel have meant many Palestinians are confined in Gaza. Some bright lights still shine as Rami attends grade P1 in school and dreams of becoming a footballer one day.Abdul 10, with his gaze to the floor, wrapped in blankets, huddles by the family stove. His father, Muhammad, emerges from the black of the adjoining room clutching an armful of medical documents written in French, a language he cannot read. His son is two years overdue a heart operation that would save his life. Srey, three, lives in a small dark room with her parents, siblings and relatives. A total of eight people live in a cramped, damp space in a makeshift barn of corrugated metal on the edge of the railroad tracks in the urban slums. The CYMCA Facility drop-in centre, funded in partnership between EAA and Aide et Action, provides emergency education to around 80 children in the area.Joender, six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela arrived in Ipiales, Colombia, after a 33-day journey mainly on foot. He is one of 3.5 million Venezuelan refugees that have left their homes following a catastrophic economic meltdown of his country leaving its citizens starving with no access to food, employment, medical services or education. He holds a packet of crackers, a kind donation from one of the many generous Colombians offering support to the Venezuelan people.Kennedy, 13, displaced to Uganda. He is another statistic of the 2.3 million South Sudanese refugees that fled the outbreak of civil war. Uganda alone shouldering 800,000 refugees. Kennedy was denied a normal childhood and instead became a witness to violence, torture and death in war. Not surprisingly, Kennedy’s family were unwilling to send him to school with threat of armed attack, abduction or recruitment by militias. On arrival in Uganda, Kennedy was still held back from attending school and fulfilling his dream of becoming a doctor. His parents were simply unable to afford the cost of a pair of shoes required for enrolment.“The canvas Billingham bags which carry the tools of my trade. They have sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world listening with me to every word of every story. I feel torn staring at them, joy at returning to my loved ones and the heartache of those I had to leave behind. Now they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up and lined up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away.….”David, 13, arrived in Uganda in July 2016 fleeing the civil war that broke out in South Sudan. He arrived with his mother and father and his eight brothers and sisters after two days of walking.

He is in need of a hernia operation, which will cost £200, and finds work extremely difficult. He can’t afford six months off work to recover. The family income is only £62 per month, which barely covers bills. They are forced to take credit from shops to be able to eat. Moza is due to enrol back into schooling. However, at present, she cares for her mother who suffers respiratory problems due to a lodged bullet in her lung after being caught in crossfire during the conflict. She doesn’t know what to expect as she has never set foot in a classroom. Two years beyond the normal enrolment age of six, she still has great dreams of working with NGOs to help residents displaced from the city.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Ali, nine, a Syrian refugee family from Deir ez-Zur district in eastern Syria arrived in Lebanon in 2011. They fled their home with several neighbours by bus toward a safer haven in Lebanon at the outbreak of civil war, which tore through their country. Heavy shelling bombarded their bus and the remainder of their journey had to be made on foot. Nine-year old Ali Ahmed’s father, an agricultural labourer explained that life in Lebanon was hard as they struggle to pay basic bills such as food and rent. As with most Syrian refugees, they are in debt to their landlords and to local shops owners. The collective family income is barely enough to cover any of their bills. Ali, one of the family’s 10 children, attends school 10km from home and dreams, one day, to be able to return home with his family to Syria.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Owen, 16, has been enrolled in Buremba Primary School since 2007 and is one of eight siblings. Now in older years at school, he must pay more money. His parents are peasant farmers and work the land digging and picking tea, this means they must work most days to be able to keep up the payments. Buremba School is one of 60 new schools constructed under the Building Tomorrow and Educate A Child programme in Uganda.Afat, 12, left his home in Deir ez-Zor, Syria six years ago, forced out by the civil war which displaced millions of people, in his case to the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. He is one of the thousands of Syrian refugee children sat in doorways of Lebanon’s many tents, shelters and makeshift homes dreaming of an education. Instead, he works 11 hours a day collecting scrap metal which he sells for around £2.50. He knows he has a right to education, but he is concerned to help provide for his family. He dreams of one day being able to return home to Syria with his family, to a better life.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added: “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Ikiriza, 5, Kamwenge District, Uganda. Ikiriza who is five years old lives in a small house with his nine brothers and sisters. His parents can’t afford school tuition fees for all the children, leaving Ikiriza with little choice but to fund his own education by working weekends carrying plastic jerry cans of water from the lake for various households of the neighbourhood in Kamwenge district. For this, he earns the equivalent of 5 US cents a day, which helps contribute towards his school fees at Bisozi Primary. He dreams of one day becoming a doctor so that he can help his father who suffers from ill health.Rami, six, lives at Beach Camp, on the sea front amongst the heart of the fishing community al-Shati in the northern Gaza Strip. Rami walks amongst the rubble of shelled buildings, a reminder of past and present conflicts. Restriction to employment and travel have meant many Palestinians are confined in Gaza. Some bright lights still shine as Rami attends grade P1 in school and dreams of becoming a footballer one day.Abdul 10, with his gaze to the floor, wrapped in blankets, huddles by the family stove. His father, Muhammad, emerges from the black of the adjoining room clutching an armful of medical documents written in French, a language he cannot read. His son is two years overdue a heart operation that would save his life. Srey, three, lives in a small dark room with her parents, siblings and relatives. A total of eight people live in a cramped, damp space in a makeshift barn of corrugated metal on the edge of the railroad tracks in the urban slums. The CYMCA Facility drop-in centre, funded in partnership between EAA and Aide et Action, provides emergency education to around 80 children in the area.Joender, six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela arrived in Ipiales, Colombia, after a 33-day journey mainly on foot. He is one of 3.5 million Venezuelan refugees that have left their homes following a catastrophic economic meltdown of his country leaving its citizens starving with no access to food, employment, medical services or education. He holds a packet of crackers, a kind donation from one of the many generous Colombians offering support to the Venezuelan people.Kennedy, 13, displaced to Uganda. He is another statistic of the 2.3 million South Sudanese refugees that fled the outbreak of civil war. Uganda alone shouldering 800,000 refugees. Kennedy was denied a normal childhood and instead became a witness to violence, torture and death in war. Not surprisingly, Kennedy’s family were unwilling to send him to school with threat of armed attack, abduction or recruitment by militias. On arrival in Uganda, Kennedy was still held back from attending school and fulfilling his dream of becoming a doctor. His parents were simply unable to afford the cost of a pair of shoes required for enrolment.“The canvas Billingham bags which carry the tools of my trade.

I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away…Here I have compiled a collection of photographs and memories, comprising the stories of some of the most marginalised children in the world.Winter: Abdul, a Syrian refugee aged 10, is seated in a makeshift shelter, perched high among\u0026nbspthe rugged snowy mountain caps of Arsal, Lebanon. He holds his father’s hand as they both huddle\u0026nbspby the stove for warmth. He has the haunting stare of a boy who knows he is\u0026nbspgoing to die, an expression that cuts through the paraffin haze of the dark room as temperatures fall below zero. Mohammed, his father, gaunt from grief, explains\u0026nbsphis son is two years overdue for an operation that could save his life.\u0026nbspWith no means to finance it, he raises\u0026nbsphis hands to the sky in hope that his prayers would be answered.\u0026nbspI remember waiting to see my doctor as a child.

All the while, their president publicly feasts\u0026nbspin lavish establishments. Roughly 3.5 million Venezuelans, among them doctors, lawyers and teachers, have left their country, out of starvation and fear.Joender, aged six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela, arrived in\u0026nbspIpiales, Colombia, exhausted and hungry. He was offloaded with his family from a galvanised lorry like cattle, after a 33-day journey, mostly on foot, where they were forced to beg for food to survive. His cupped hands are\u0026nbsprewarded with a packet of biscuits donated by a local in the town. He clutches\u0026nbspthe packet like a prize. Having never begged for food myself as a child, I could not begin to understand the internal dialogue in doing so.

The feeling of being abandoned proves\u0026nbspto be too much for him. Standing in the kitchen and washing dishes, he simply shrugs his small shoulders, and one by one the tears roll\u0026nbspdown his face.

Abandoned by her parents along with her siblings, she now lives with her grandmother at the mercy of abject poverty. In a dark room in remote north western Tanzania, she explains\u0026nbsphow not going to school saddens\u0026nbspher. But she nonetheless still dreams that somehow she could become a teacher to help others like her with no access to education. I didn\u0027t have a choice.\u0026nbspI had to go to school. Mamoke didn’t have a choice, but that was because the right of education was unavailable to her. I realise I have taken so much\u0026nbspfor granted in my life. Children around the world live with no access to healthcare, displaced from their home, going to sleep hungry, growing up in conflict and with no\u0026nbspeducation.I did not choose my career any more than I chose my life.

But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.Jo said: Now we know what it is like to live on nothing, we have got used to going without.We have sold everything that we can possibly sell to keep ourselves going, but we just dont know how long we can last like this.At the minute, it looks like we will just be having sandwiches this Christmas, because we cant afford anything  after making sure that our kids have presents and are well cared for.This comes as another young family were forced into debt and had to rely on handouts after having a five-week wait to receive Universal Credit.A spokesperson for North East Lincolnshire Council said: We are in contact with Centre and have met a number of times to explain that we need to make up for the loss of the sports pitch.We have explained this position several times and what we’re doing to try and resolve it.The Council is supportive of the farm, and as landlord would be agreeable to the proposal.However, any sub-lease or change of use is subject to the necessary permissions and whilst we are doing our utmost to resolve the situation, there is a process to follow when someone wants to change the use of a sports field.We are working with Sport England to try to resolve this to allow their objection to the plans to be lted.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. Universal Credit claimants could have Christmas benefits slashed  bosses pay wages early this month.Meanwhile, a five-week wait for Universal credit payouts has pushed a young family into debt and forced them to rely on handouts.And with changes coming into force in  around how Universal Credit works - find out how they will affect your payments.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But her lawyer says a prosecution and potential jail term is “not a proportionate response”.Britain is not a banana republic.Our justice system is as advanced as America’s. It is for our courts, not a suspect or her lawyer, to decide what is proportionate.Accidents can have consequences.Mrs Sacoolas will not want to leave her kids.Neither should she want them living with the knowledge their mum killed a young man and fled into hiding.Our Government must pursue extradition and the US must grant it — as we doubtless would were the roles reversed.ED Miliband won’t need long to diagnose the cause of four Labour election defeats in a row.He was behind three of them.Brown, the hapless oaf, lost in .Miliband then took the party to the left, gting the Tories their  winAnd Ed was just getting started.He sold party memberships for £ and the hard-Left piled in, made the toxic fool Corbyn leader and two more defeats followed.Who would now bet against a fth, given the new leadership candidates The latest, Islington snob Emily Thornberry, has a distaste for working-class people which is mutual — as White Van Man Dan Ware makes clear today.And in branding our PM — newly elected by million voters — a “feckless, lying charlatan”, Thornberry promises five more years of the same juvenile abuse putting millions off Labour.Not learning much, are they THREE years of furious political ision.Wasn’t it fantastic when it stopped To all Sun readers — Left or Right, Leavers or Remainers — have a fabulous Christmas! Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But sadly the newest member, ArchieHarrison Mountbatten-Windsor, won’t be there.He will be with his parents Harry and Meghan somewhere in Canada, celebrating away from the royals.That’s a real shame, because with his upbeat presence Harry would have got the Queen laughing over the turkey.I watched the boys grow up, and you couldn’t then get a cigarette paper between them.It will sadden the Queen that Harry is not there and that he doesn’t seem to get on with his brother any more.As a nation, we have huge rts to heal over Brexit. In her traditional Christmas Day speech the Queen will ask the country to come together and heal the wounds.I’m sure one of her priorities in the New Year will not only be to unite the country, but to bring together her beloved grandsons and their wives.But it’s the Epstein outrage that did most to threaten the House of Windsor this year.The Queen must have been horried to watch the car- crash interview Andrew gave to the BBC.With his arrogance and lack of preparation, Andrew — a Falklands War hero — turned what he hoped could have been his redemption into a nightmare.The Queen, with the advice of the Prince of Wales, acted swtly. Andrew was stripped of his royal duties. The institution has to be protected at all times.Of course, it would have been hard for the Queen to do all this, but she did it with calm and with grace, the hallmarks our redoubtable, -year-old monarch.We should not forget this. This remarkable woman continues to serve us when many would have crumbled.You will not hear the slightest grumble from our Queen.Thank heavens for that.While it seems the royals can do no right, the Queen carries on as normal. She rides her Fell pony most weekends and watches the racing on TV and gets excited when she picks a winner.Her family looks to her at times of ision and uncertainty — and so does the nation.The country is polarised over Brexit and one of the things the Queen wants to see is the isions healed and for people to come together in the New Year.Since he retired, the Duke of Edinburgh has lived in Sandringham, so the Queen is rattling around in her apartments with just servants to talk to. She can’t confide in them like she can the Duke. The scandal that has engulfed Prince Andrew will have saddened her so much. But she won’t abandon her son. She loves him.All families face rts and scandals at one time or another. The Windsors are no dferent. Their story is all about continuity, both for the nation and the Royal Family.So the Queen will have loved the recently released new photographs of herself with the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge and Prince George preparing a Christmas pudding for charity.It was a royal flush, the Monarch with three generations of heirs. I will be at Sandringham at am tomorrow to photograph theQueen and her family as they arrive at St Mary Magdalene Church.She will pray for the strength to carry on through what are likely to be bumpy roads ahead.And bumps there will be. The Andrew scandal is far from over and  could be a pivotal year for the Duke, who has yet to face the FBI.So when you watch the Queen give her Christmas message tomorrow afternoon, spare a thought for someone who has served this country so dutully and for so long.An amazing woman of true decency and honour.We remain lucky to have her.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Don’t underestimate the strength of feeling against unlimited immigration, BoJo. Andyou reduce immigration you won’t need to pave over half of our remaining countryside to build new houses.

How low-carbon can you go  Reduce meat and dairy consumption, as beef and sheep livestock have a high carbon footprint. If you’re not ready to go completely without, try Meat Free Mondays Grow your own: You don’t need a big garden. Salad leaves, chilli and herbs are just a few of the things that grow well in containers. It’s a low-cost way of reducing your reliance on super-market fruit and vegetables. Switch off when idle: Leaving TVs, games consoles, the washing machine and microwave on standby eats energy. Some appliances draw energy even when they are not being used and phone chargers are among the worst culprits. “Vampire power” costs each house up to £ a year, according to the Energy Saving Trust. Use energy-saving lightbulbs: LED bulbs can last up to , hours, while some newer models are good for double that. As they use far less energy, you will quickly see impressive savings on your energy bill each month. Which  magazine puts the annual cost of running an LED lightbulb at £., compared to £. for a CFLtype and £. for halogen. Over the course of an LED bulb’s very long letime, it can save you around £. Be a careful cook: Only use as much water as you need and cover your pans so you save energy. Overfilling your kettle is a waste of electricity so only boil as much as you need. Lose the plastic packaging: This wrapping is energy-intensive in its production and causes serious damage to habitats. Choose items that are light on packaging, and refill as much as possible. There is no reason to buy tomatoes on a plastic tray which is also wrapped in plastic. A loose tomato tastes just as good. Find out more about the supermarkets’ war against plastic. Go low: Set the washing machine at C or even C. Doing the laundry at C instead of C can be one third cheaper on energy. For lightly soiled clothes, try C. And make sure that your machine is full. Get free water-saving devices: Moving water around the country and treating it requires huge amounts of energy, so get in touch with your water company to find out what gadgets you can get for free, such as low-flow shower heads which use less water. Make your home cosy: Draught-proof your doors and windows, install secondary-film glazing, top up your loft insulation to cm and get your boiler serviced. Accord-ing to the Energy Saving Trust, loft insulation for a semi-detached house will cost around £, with £ savings a year, while insulating a mid-terrace house will cost around £ and save £ a year. Turn down radiators in rooms you are not using: You don’t need to heat a room you’re not in, so use radiator controls to adjust temperature. Slow down on fast fashion: We buy more and more clothes each year. So choose vintage items, rent something for those special occasions and don’t forget charity shops. Oxfam has a great online shop. For outfit rentals, try websites like byrotation, hirestreetuk and mywardrobehq. If you do really want to buy new clothes, look out for certications of sustain-ability. Use the Good On You app to find out which shops are reducing their impact on the environment. Watch super-market air miles: Potatoes do not rack up air miles like imported rice. Likewise, dairy has a high carbon footprint, so swap a latte for a regular coffee. Look for the Red Tractor symbol on food supplied by British farmers. Buy strawberries, for example, from Norfolk, not Morocco.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But there is still work to do.Top-down control over who gets a chance to be a candidate is demoralising and messy.And they are still outnumbered by Labour’s membership. It’s time to ride the Boris wave and add , new members to the blue ranks.If Labour keep telling themselves Magic Grandad is perfect, and blaming the voters, then this is a chance for the Conservatives to steal a march.WHILE this dwindling decade was stuffed full of exciting political events, it was not a vintage era for decisive majority ­government.There have been thrills — from voters defying Project Fear to free our country from the EU, through to Boris ­Johnson’s crushing victory over Corbynism.And there have been spills — David Cameron’s abrupt exit from power, Theresa May’s loss of her majority, and the hijack of the Labour Party by the far Left. But there have been only a few moments — mere months in the past ten years — of certain, stable, clear government.We have had two hung parliaments, the uncomfortable alliance of the coalition, and a slim Tory majority which was swtly erted by the EU referendum.At Westminster’s worst, a Remainer Commons — helped by a self-indulgent Speaker — trapped a minority Government in office while denying it the power to do anything.It’s all been very entertaining, but entertainment value is not always a sign of great governmentToo often, hung parliaments and paralysed ministers proved unable to make urgent decisions.Important calls were postponed or fudged out of necessity, because the votes to get on with the job were simply not there.Smashing that obstacle to decision-making is one of the many things about the election result to celebrate.Getting Brexit done should only be the start of the changes made by a Government that at last has the chance to be radical and ambitious.Not everybody will be cheering, however. Obviously, the Opposition aren’t happy. And I expect we will soon see some signs of unhappiness from the upper ranks of the civil service, too.Why  First, because theof majority government is a rude intrusion into the lives of civil service chiefs after a decade in which they got used to getting their own way.The absence of clear authority under May, and before that the many tensions and fractures of the coalition years, offered plenty of opportunity for determined mandarins to manage things just as they liked. No longer.Second, because the days in which the civil service was truly neutral, from top to bottom, have sadly ended — and a troubling number of officials seem to feel it is their role to promote a particular view.Brexit has exposed that bias. In the referendum campaign, public bodies which should know better allowed themselves to be used to pump out Remain propaganda, damaging their reputations.The agenda — to try to delay, disrupt and deny Brexit — was obvious. The election result has at last convinced all but the most diehard EU fans that we really are going to leave.But this is not the only issue on which the Government and parts of officialdom disagree.From Michael Gove’s criticism of experts, to Downing Street’s belief that Whitehall is overdue for radical restructuring and reform, there are changes on the way which will disrupt a state of affairs that rather suited a lot of senior people.If the New Year sees whole departments abolished or merged, and a new culture of ministers challenging the sacred cows of Whitehall thinking, then the machine will fight back, hoping to undermine change and keep things the same. There are three ways for ministers and their advisers to defend against that assault.First, steel themselves for a bumpy ride. They’ll be briefed against by past masters of the targeted Whitehall leak who have little to lose. They must not let themselves be knocked off course.Second, they must find allies. For every hidebound part of the civil service, there are others chafing to see things done better. Bring them on board.Third, they should make full use of their power to make public appointments.Labour stuffed the ious quangos and commissions with like-minded people, with similar principles and priorities.Why wouldn’t they  It would be bizarre for a government to appoint its opponents to wield state power against its agenda.And yet that is exactly what the Tories have too often done, apparently through a misguided sense of fair play.It’s time to realise that the other side neverthe favour. Boris and his team know that the election was the start, not the end, of their job.They have to deliver the change that they promised, to fulfil the trust voters put in them. There are battles ahead to make that happen, and wrestling Whitehall will be one of the biggest. Christmas truce will not last long.THE anti-democratic effort to block Brexit cost time, but it also cost money.Fine, ious big businesses might prefer we had voted Remain.But we didn’t.After the referendum, the private sector stood ready to do what it does best: Adapt and get on with le.But what businesses really dislike is not change so much as uncertainty.And Parliament made uncertainty an art form in the past three years.Now that we’ve got a new deal, a new Commons and a new Government, we should see new investment unlocked.Including money and decisions which were shelved during all the political hurly-burly.Let’s get Brexit done, and get Britain booming.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Anthony Teasdale, political adviser to Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe in , told Richard Ryan, a diplomat in the Irish Embassy in London, that he was “very struck” by the rapport between the two leaders. Ryan and Teasdale met for lunch on January that year, just weeks after Thatcher and Haughey held a meeting on the fringe of a European Council summit in Greece.  In his report back to Dublin about the lunch - marked confidential and stamped “Seen by Taoiseach” - Ryan said Teasdale told him “unprompted” that he was “very struck” by a report of the Rhodes meeting. The report was written up by Charles Powell, Thatcher’s private secretary and adviser. “They were clearly both talking seriously, frankly and constructively about the same thing,” Teasdale said.  The affinity between the pair contrasted sharply with a separate meeting Thatcher had with the Belgian prime minister Wilfried Martens at the same summit, during which they “hardly shared a common subject”, suggested Teasdale. “Martens was totally ineffectual in his replies and just tried weakly to repeat arguments which she had already chewed up,” Teasdale told the diplomat Thatcher “terminated” the meeting by saying: “We have nothing further to talk about, you and I.” According to Teasdale, she then “grabbed her handbag and stormed out” leaving the Belgian prime minister “sitting there”.  At the time, relations were strained between Ireland, Britain and Belgium over the delayed extradition of Fr Ryan - an Irish priest wanted in London for alleged connections to the IRA - who was flown to Ireland after the Belgian government refused to extradite him to Britain. Belgian police had arrested Fr Ryan in June  and found large quantities of cash and bomb-making equipment in his home. Thatcher had pulled back from her outspoken criticism of Ireland over the affair and “felt she regretted as having gone over the top”, Teasdale told Ryan. “She saw the Irish to a real extent as victims of the Belgians and she wanted this to get across to the Taoiseach,” he added.

Iain Duncan Smith  Tory MP Iain Duncan Smith- the architect of cruel welfare reforms including Universal Credit has been given a knighthood in the Queen’s New Years honours.The former Tory leader resigned from his post as Secretary of State for Work and Pensions more than three years ago but many are still feeling the impact of his reforms.Despite resigning in protest at then Chancellor George Osborneaposs plans to cut disability benefits in  he is largely blamed for many of the hated reforms.

Stuart Newton, , was repeatedly stabbed and left for dead near SonFest in Southport during the summer. He says he was just four minutes away from death as he was rushed to hospital pouring with blood from stab wounds to his neck, stomach and spleen.Stuart told the Liverpool ECHO he was so traumatised he initially refused treatment - despite being told by doctors that he was dying in front of their eyes.He claimed it wasnapost until he heard the horror in his mumaposs voice that he agreed to have five hours of emergency surgery. The Maghull, Mserseyside stabbing victim recalled: The doctors told me Iaposd had eight pints of blood pumped into me in the ambulance in about  minutes. I said aposoh my God Iaposve never had eight pints in my le that fast!apos I was trying to make a joke of it because everyone looked so concerned. There were dozens of people in the room I think - doctors, surgeons and nurses. In my head I just thought it was my neck - I hadnapost realised my other injuries because I never checked my own body.

He was cleared of the more serious charge, but also convicted of possessing a bladed article in a public place, after a three-day trial at Liverpool Crown Court last week.Howard, who was remanded in custody, will be sentenced on January  next year.  Stuart said: I remember people screaming saying aposyour neck, your neck!apos I moved my hand up to my neck and it was like I was wearing a red glove. But I didnapost realise I was stabbed that many times, I think it must have been the shock and the adrenaline just kicks in. The dad had a punctured lung too. He recalled the doctors urging him to let them treat him: They said youaposre four minutes from death, youaposre stood in front of us dying and youaposre saying you are okay and you are refusing treatment.  It wasnapost until I heard the horror in my mumaposs voice begging me saying it is that serious. We were only on the phone a few seconds but she said apostake the treatment now, realise how serious this is, you are minutes from deathapos, so I said aposokayapos. During the five-hour operation, Stuart said he had to have his spleen removed, which helps the body to fight off infections. This means he will be more susceptible to catching infections in the future and has to have injections for the rest of his le. Stuart said it was a miracle how well he recovered, but he will be on antibiotics for the next two years.  He said: They ripped me open and took out my spleen, that was the only way to save my le. So I have no immune system now and Iaposll have to have injections for the rest of my le to stop me from catching things like the flu and menigitis. My family were absolutely devastated.

Alexandra Hajipaulis, , was on a Ryanair flight to Crete with her daughter Jaideen when she suffered an ischemic stroke. It is thought to have been caused by a bubble of air in a vein which travelled up to her brain when the air pressure changed during the planeaposs ascent. Brave Jaideen noticed her mum was unconscious and alerted an air hostess. Thankfully, a doctor sitting behind Alex recognised her symptoms as a stroke and ordered staff to land the plane, where she was then rushed to hospital in a coma. Alex, from Wolverhampton, is now paralysed completely in both legs and her left arm - but is grateful that her little girlaposs swt actions saved her le. Her mother Lorna Hajipaulis, , has moved back to the UK from Crete to care for her daughter and two grandchildren full time. Alex said: Jaideen saved my le - she knew something was wrong, she got me help even though she was only six years old at the time, Iaposm so proud of her. Before her stroke, museum worker Alex was a happy and healthy mother of two living in Wolverhampton. On  July , she boarded a plane to visit her mother Lorna at her home in Crete, Greece, taking her Jaideen with her. Halfway into the flight, Alex collapsed in her seat - leaving her six year old daughter to alert an air hostess to her unconscious mother. The flight made an emergency stop in Italy where Alex was rushed to hospital immediately from the airport in a coma. She underwent hemicraniectomy surgery the next day where a large flap of the skull is removed and the dura is opened to give space for the swollen brain to bulge, reducing the intracranial pressure.  The young mum was then in a coma for  days while Lorna travelled to Italy. Lorna said: I heard from Alex that sheaposd boarded the plane and then just a few hours later, someone rang me from the hospital to say sheaposd had a stroke. I couldnapost believe what I was hearing, but before I knew it, I was on the next flight to Italy and racing to the hospital. We didnapost knowsheaposd pull through, and everybody was speaking Italian and telling us it was going to cost thousands to save Alex. I had to reach out to relatives and even set up a GoFundMe page to raise the £, needed to get Alex home to the UK. Alex didnapost have the right kind of insurance that would cover what happened to her, and so we had to suddenly raise all this money to get her home safe. Alexaposs stroke is thought to have been caused by an air embolism secondary to a bronchogenic cyst. This is where a previously undetected lung cyst ruptures inside the body due to air pressure rapidly changing, such as in a plane or a submarine. The rupture of the cyst causes an air embolism to travel to the brain and leads to sufferers experiencing either a stroke or a coma. Alex spent a month in the hospital in Italy before she was repatriated to ITU at Queen Elizabeth Hospital on  August . Due to the nature of her stroke, Alexaposs flight home had to be at a lower level than normal to reduce the chances of her having another stroke. She stayed at the hospital for six weeks before she was moved to a rehab centre in Wolverhampton in October . Lorna then moved Alex home for nine months before she was offered a place at a care home in September this year, where she remains. The stroke has completely changed my le - itaposs ruined my le, Alex said.  I canapost walk any more, Iaposm stuck in bed, I canapost work, I miss being a mum to my girls. Before this happened to me, I was having two showers a day, but I havenapost even had one since my stroke and that was  months ago. I was completely unconscious on the plane and then for the whole time I was in Italy so I canapost remember what happened. I didnapost even speak until six weeks after my stroke, I was completely out of it. Lorna added: Alex has been left feeling disabled and suicidal following her stroke and the care she has received. Itaposs been  months since Alex had her stroke and sheaposs deteriorating both physically and mentally rather than being on the road to recovery. The care homes that she has stayed at havenapost had the facilities needed to wash someone of Alexaposs size properly, so she hasnapost had a bath or shower in a year and a half. Sheaposs only getting under an hour of daily physiotherapy Monday to Friday where sheaposs staying right now and itaposs just not enough to help get her back on her feet which is what she wants to do. I did pay for some private physiotherapy which was amazing, we couldnapost afford to keep it going although I wish we could have. I just want someone to help my daughter, sheaposs just been left to suffer after her stroke and Iaposm so angry to see her being reduced to living like this.

The incident was captured by Sheffield Hunt Saboteurs, a group who protest organised fox hunts and ensure dogs are not being used to kill foxes - in line with the Hunting Act . In this yearaposs Boxing Day action, the group drove across North Yorkshire, stopping at the Badsworthaposs meet. While still in their vans, one of the activistaposs captured the hunt supporter running towards the vehicle carrying a dead fox. He then begins using the fox as a weapon, battering the vanaposs windows with the animalaposs leless body while covering his face to protect his identity. The man, with a prominent tattoo on his right hand, repeatedly hammers the car to the horror of those inside. A man in the vehicle can be heard saying: f**k, theyaposve got  dead fox, theyaposve got dead fox. Another woman screams stop it before they car drives away. Pictures of the van after the attack show the windows covered in the blood and innards of the fox. The protesting group took to social media to share footage of the scum who launched the attack. They said: We decided to spread festive cheer across North Yorkshire.  First, we stopped off at the Badsworthaposs meet at Kirk Smeaton. Though they are now merged with the YAS and Bramham Moor, they still have separate Boxing Day meets. The Badsworth went for a bit of a trot. The local scum were clearly unhappy not to see some actual hunting, so decide to be aggressive and block vehicles in and smash our window with a roadkill fox whilst also smashing bits off our vehicle. Social media users were horried by the footage, branding the man scum of the earth for his actions. One Instagram user user said: Desperate psychopaths.

Kate worked with community midwives on their daily rounds last month and has penned an open letter praising “the humbling work you do day in, day out”. She is launching a project to highlight how what we experience between birth and reaching five affects the rest of our lives. To learn more she spent two days at the ­Kingston Hospital Maternity Unit in London. The Duchess said: “I accompanied ­community midwives on their daily rounds and was welcomed in to people’s homes. “I was truly touched by the trust that people placed in me, sharing their experiences and voicing fears openly. I also spent time in hospital clinics and on postnatal wards. No matter the setting, I was continually struck by the compassion that those of you I spent time with showed, and the­ incredible work ethic you demonstrated on behalf of your entire profession.” Her tribute included reference to her own experiences of the “care and kindness provided by midwives” during the births of her children. She suffered from extreme morning sickness during all her pregnancies when carrying Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.  Her open letter added: “The Early Years are more critical for future health and happiness than any other moment in our letime.Even before we are born, our mother’s emotionaland physical health directly influences our ­development and by the age of five a child’s brain has developed to % of its adult size.Your role at the very start of this period is therefore of ­fundamental importance.” Kensington Palace released images of her time with the midwives.  She added: “You don’t ask for praise or for recognition but instead unwaveringly continue your amazing work bringing new le into our world. “You continue to demonstrate that despite your technical mastery and the advancement of modern medicine, it is the human to human relationships and simple acts of kindness that sometimes mean the most.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA skier has defied odds to survive five hours buried under an avalanche in Austria in what is being dubbed a Christmas aposmiracleapos. The -year-old, who has not been named, was dug out of the snow by a team of rescuers after they picked up signals from a transceiver he was wearing. Police were first alerted to his disappearance at pm local time on Christmas Day after three avalanches swept the area, as well as the Swiss resort of Andermatt. A man, who had phoned police to report the skier had gone missing, got through to his phone, but only heard crackling noises on the line. The skier was located around two hours later thanks to electromagnetic signals being transmitted from his transciever. A huge rescue team then began the operation to try and get him out. The skier was suffering from hypothermia but was otherwise unharmed. Stefan Schröck of the Styria mountain rescue service told Austrian public broadcaster ORF: You canapost move under a blanket of snow like this. The man was extremely lucky he had a big enough air pocket under the blanket of snow, so he had oxygen too and was able to breathe. Surviving for five hours under an avalanche happens only every  years in the Alps, according to Mr Schröck. If you are not found within  minutes of an avalanche your chances of survival are slim. If you are to survive beyond an hour you need a source of oxygen.  Yesterday, rescuers were searching for a number of other skiers feared buried alive. At least two people were injured in the landslide that hit the Austrian ski resort of Ankogel and one at the Swiss resort of Andermatt. After a large avalanche spilled onto the piste at Andermatt, two people were pulled from the snow and taken to Uri hospital with minor injuries, Swiss police said. Four more were retrieved unhurt, but it was unclear how many others could be buried under the snow, a police spokesman said, adding that a large rescue squad was on the site. Reto Pfister, state police spokesperson in the Swiss canton of Uri, told NBC News: “We believe there are more people buried but we can’t say how many.Anne Jehn, director of Andermatt Ski Academy, was on the scene just after the avalanche hit and worked with her students to rescue a woman from the snow. She was ash gray. Shocked. But I guess sheaposll be okay, Ms Jehn said, NBC News reported.  Meanwhile, danger for the area had been at level three on a scale of  five, according to the Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research , which said fresh and wind-drted snow was the main threat. In Austria, three avalanches came down in Ankogel in the province of Carinthia, police said.

Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause. We had a total of  people in attendancewhich is our best ever turnout.The best part though was how much everyone enjoyed what was a night of some of the best original music Argyll has to offer # and you can#t put a price on that. Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban. He was just starting on the incline out of Kilmore so the black tarmac was his background.It was his moving right foot on the pedal I noticed. At first I thought it was a dog on the road until my headlights picked him up.Tom Cullen, Dunskeig, Ardfern.We would like to invite readers to nominate a deserving carer for a chance of going on a free holiday, while the person they care for comes on a free break with us, Revitalise, through our new Grace Award for Caring.Carers save the economy £ billion per year, which is more than the NHS budget.

Freddie Paterson came forward to take the penalty but put his shot past the post.The game started flowing from end to end and Freddie Paterson made amends for his earlier miss when he found the back of the net on  minutes. Half-time came giving a much-needed break to the players and spectators.Eilidh Cameron obliged with her customary goal a minute into the second half, however, Ardnamurchan replied  minutes later.The game was in the balance but Eilidh Cameron got the decisive goal on  minutes.The play continued to flow from end to end and at full time both teams had good reason to hold their heads high after providing such entertaining shinty for the crowd.Euan McMurdo, Shinty Regional Development officer, said: #Credit has to go to the players and coaches for providing such an entertaining match at a time of year when most people want to stay warm indoors.

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd. Pupils were given the chance to watch the game and they made their voices heard and, spurred on by the crowd, Euan MacArthur was next on the score sheet and once again MacKay converted the try.The first half finished - to the home team.The second half started with Boclair coming back at SAS and, after some good running, they pulled a try back.SAS found themselves under sustained pressure and soon Boclair had a second try. Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line. No try and the pressure was on again. Minutes later, after some great forward work to turn the ball over, McArthur again went over for South Argyll#s fourth try. Another two points from MacKay made the score -.After the restart Boclair went all out to get another score. Great defensive work from the SA backs kept Boclair out for a sustained period of attack until, with only seconds to go, the scored their fourth try.As the conversion attempt fell short the final whistle blew and South Argyll celebrated a hard-fought win.While South Argyll didn not get out of the group stages they can be very pleased with third place,only one point behind second spot."},{"url":null,"title":"a garden of festive delight","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNot your common or garden evening of entertainment, a special festive concert will be held next week near Minard.Friends of Crarae will present their annual carol concert at Crarae Garden on Thursday December .The evening will feature Cumlodden choir and guests and the audience is welcome to sing along.Festive refreshments and a raffle will be available at the concert, which opens at .pm for a .pm start.Tickets will cost £ on the door, and the National Trust for Scotland shop will be open for those last-minute gts."},{"url":null,"title":"no need for stress shop local in festive lochgilphead","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNow there is need to rush out on your lunch break, or even break your neck heading into town before the Big Day # Lochgilphead retailers are opening late, so you can relax while getting your Christmas shopping finished.A #shop local# initiative is being promoted around town, encouraging shoppers to support local businesses by purchasing their Christmas gts and festive feasts locally.On Thursday December  many of Lochgilphead#s shops will be open late, including The Square Peg Marmalade Deli Danny#s Ironmongers Fyne Tackle Argyll Book Centre Breagha R  S Stovecraft Love Dove Studio The Sweetie Jar West Coast Home Fyne Living Bluestone Argyll Pharmacy Mary#s Meals Argyll Gt Company The Archway D  D Wool and Crafts and The Mail Box, including the post office, will also be offering the usual postal servicesyou have any gts still to send off.Rumour has it that some shops will also be offering festive nibbles and drinks, plus promotional offers and discounts."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 5 the nineteenth hole","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWelcome to Episode Season  Finale # Join presenters Stephen Day, George Graham and Keith McIntyre for more golfing chat about Bob and other golfing fun # with additional material from David McPhee, Bruce McNab, Neil Armour, and Charles Spreadburry.This week they discuss more golfing terminology, look at some stats and even answer a listener#s question.You can listen and or download all Episodes of The BOBcast below"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 13 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsNever mind the general election, with its deep isions and rancour, let alone the circumstances which brought it about.

This year’s winner, picked by the skipper, was Robert ‘Grinch’ MacBrayne.The day started off as expected, pretty cold with a few light showers. Fishing was slow at first with roughly an hour passing before the first catch came aboard, but after that it was non-stop until lunchtime.The quality of spurs and whiting was better than expected with very few undersized caught. Most made the measure and on average spurs hit the -cm mark with a couple of decent ones coming in at cm tipping the scales at lbs oz.As the day progressed the weather deteriorated with heavy showers, hail and really strong gusts spinning the boat leading to the inevitable Etive tangles.A decision was made to cut the day short and lines up was called at pm.Given the conditions everyone coped well and at the end of the day four species, spurs, whiting, lsd and pouting, added to the tally of  counting fish.Highlight of the day were the two sea eagles that flew in quite close on the hunt for food but they had their work cut out with so many greedy gulls around. Food wasn’t an issue for the boys though with homemade soup, tablet, shortbread and ginger wine all hitting the spot.Back ashore and the scores tallied up, the winner of this year’s Christmas Shield was Gordon Law with Robert MacBrayne in second place.

Golden Eagle Project being launched almost two years ago it was believed that there were only two-to-four breeding pairs left across the whole area.Conservationists had identied enough habitat spread across the two rural local authority regions to comfortably cater for as many as  birds.Eaglets were taken from nests in the north of Scotland by ornithologists to prepare for release in the south.In early  five custom built aviaries were constructed in the Southern Upland hills to allow the first of the eaglets to become accustomed to the new territory.While the work of bringing a new generation of golden eagles to the Borders continued, outreach officers staged school and community visits to provide education on the endangered species.This month, with four eagles now successfully introduced to the south of Scotland, bosses at the project revealed that , people have now supported their work by either volunteering or taking part in the outreach sessions.Philip Munro, community outreach officer for the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project, told us: ldquoIt is fantastic to see so many people are so passionate about protecting this iconic species in the south of Scotland.\"We are absolutely delighted with the support, which plays an absolutely vital role in protecting golden eagles.\"We need to keep building on this so that we can ensure that we can see even more of these magnicent birds across the south of Scotlandrsquos skies for generations to come.Funded by Heritage Lottery and LEADER Scottish Borders and DG, the project aims to bring together all countryside users

the Scottish Rural College, largely for her work on the project.Charlotte Martin, a Countryside Management student at SRUC, first heard about the Project when Philip Munro delivered a talk at the college.She said: ldquoHaving previously worked in areas where golden eagles were part of the fabric of the area and very much accepted and admired, alongside my career in farming with employers who

Burnley Campbell, and others also extended a cordial welcome, the men being cheered as they marched with the colours to headquarters.The cadre was entertained at a civic luncheon in McColl#s Hotel in the afternoon.Those present said they were delighted to welcome home the local battalion. Throughout the war they had watched with pride the heroic work performed by the battalion, and they would remember with gratitude the sacrices that had been made.Maclachlan of Maclachlan mentioned that the total casualties of the  th Argylls during the war were  officers and  other ranks.The honours of the regiment received were one V.C., two D.S.O.#s, many M.C.#s and M.M.#s, and other lesser honours.Major Lockie, who commanded the cadre, acknowledged the cordial welcome they had received.A day of remembranceThe King#s desire that the first anniversary of the Armistice should be observed by a two minutes silence in reverent remembrance of the glorious dead was fulfilled all over the country on Tuesday.In London wreaths were laid on the Cenotaph in Whitehall. These included one from the King and Queen, one from President Poincaré and one from the Prime Minister.The scenes in the streets of Glasgow were full of solemnity, when all traffic stopped and the crowds stood in reverent silence as the clocks stuck eleven. Work ceased in the Clyde shipyards and on the shipping in the river.In Campbeltown the signal was given by the sounding of three long syren blasts from H.M.S. Thames, and the fallen were honoured by the uncovering of heads.Of course in a comparatively quiet country town the tribute lacked the impressiveness that characterised it in busy cities.In the Grammar School the scholars assembled in the large room at .a.m., when the rector gave a short address on the meaning of the celebration, read the King#s message, and explained shortly the aims of the League of Nations Union.A hymn as then sung, the two minutes# silence observed, and after the National Anthem had been sung, the pupils were dismissed for the day.In Dalintober School the period of silence was similarly observed and the scholars were afterwards dismissed."},{"url":null,"title":"leader november 15 2019","story":"Remembrance is one of the main topics in this week#s Courier.We increasingly rely on our youngsters to keep the memory of the First and Second World Wars alive as those who experienced them first-hand # and second-hand # fade away.Renowned First World War poet Wilfred Owen, who was himself killed in action in , wrote of #the old lie# # #Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori#, which translates from Latin as #It is sweet and proper to die for one#s country#.Remembrance should not be about glorying war, but remembering the horric atrocities which are committed in its name so that in future they may be avoided.The four young people who took part in the service at Glenbarr War Memorial are direct descendants of men from the area who fell in battle.

I think the going rate was £ per day, quite a sum in , and I believe there was quite a queue, unfortunately I couldn#t sign up as I was working at Jaeger.It was quite an event and some friends who were taking part told me later about their experiences with fake blood and bandages etc and others getting kitted out with Russian army unorms and weapons. Several of the buildings around the airfield were flying the Hammer and Sickle and painted up with Russian signage etc to suit the situation.If I remember correctly the premiere of the finished film was shown in Campbeltown and those watching who had ever flown into the town on normal domestic flights could easily recognise the approach to the airport and runway with the loch beyond. With a few patches of articial snow here and there it could well have been in Siberia. There were great hoots and laughter at the showing whenever those in the audience recognised their pals in unorm with rles at the ready or being carried in on stretchers. Great memories.I also remember the scrapped jet engines from the wrecked airliner lying in McFadyen#s yard in Glebe street for a long time.

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years. They need to take swt action to properly prepare AE departments before winter sets in. A good place to start would be publishing the integrated workforce plan that staff were told would be out last year. Another broken SNP promise.Yours,Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll  Bute.Connected nationSir,Before I address Alan Reid’s comments on superfast broadband , it ought to be remembered that this is the same ex Liberal Democrat MP who propped up the Tories and imposed years of toxic austerity measures on Scotland, shrinking the UK economy by £ billion, imposing Dickensian social policies # like the Bedroom Tax # on the poorest in society, and voluntarily choosing to make Tory cuts possible.The Liberal Democrats are deeply stained by austerity and they will remain, rightly, untrusted as the Tories little helpers.Mr Reid berates the SNP government for alleged failure to deliver superfast broadband. Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

It came after representatives of the local industries which discharge their waste effluents into the main sewage system indicated that they would be willing to co-operate in the neutralising of the acids in their effluents.Without neutralising the acid would prove damaging to the pumps envisaged for the new scheme.The motion calling on the council to give the go-ahead on the project was made by Dean of Guild William Stevenson, and seconded by Councillor N. S. McCallum, who said: #I think health comes before money in this respect.#Fears were expressed about the effect the scheme would have on the rates. Councillor Alastair McKinlay said: #It might be that in years to come we, as a council, will be blamed for putting the rates up.#Provost Daniel McKinven said that the efforts made in the past to secure the new sewage system for Campbeltown were #joint efforts#. The Provost said that the council had #done this for the good of Campbeltown# and that they would #see to it# that local labour is employed on the actual scheme.Mr W. P. Scott, the representative at the meeting of Messrs. Crouch and Hogg, the firm of consulting engineers who will be employed on the project, said that the pumping main would probably be laid along under the Low Askomel road.Mr Scott commented that the most expensive part of the scheme will be the actual laying of the pipelines.Hon. Treasurer George Halbert and Town Chamberlain, Mr William B. Allen, calculated that the rates may have to be increased by s d to cover the cost of the scheme. But Mr Halbert pointed out that the increase may be considerably more.The final calculation will not be made until Messrs.

It is a scary premonition.ldquoYoursquore just getting old, was a recent diagnosis from a family member! It was said with affection, of course, yet the ring of truth gave it an unhelpful sting. Age, of course, is just a number and state of mind and I have much to keep me youthful.What did help was meeting up with an old friend last week. As we sat together sharing memories of our youth and the shenanigans we got up to  years ago, I had a disorientating sense of time. It seemed impossible that so many years had passed since the moments we remembered had taken place. Those moments were so present for us. As another clicheacute says, it was asit was yesterday.We both complimented each other on how young we looked but I think this was because we both saw the younger person underneath the wrapping made by time. Society judges so much by appearance, we all do. But when we meet an old friend, even when we have not been in touch for many years, we see the person we knew, eventhe exterior has changed. As the philosopher Henry David Thoreau once said: ldquoItrsquos not what you look at that matters, itrsquos what you see.Who can say honestly they have not judged someone because of what they look like  I am as guilty as anyone . As I said, we all do it on the bus, in the queue at the supermarket while we wait our turn, everywhere. We glimpse at people, avoiding eye contact, but making immediate judgement on the way they look. Sometimes itrsquos negative, sometimes envious, sometimes positive and admiring but always superficial. And I know, like everyone , I too am likewise judged.Itrsquos a human habit, perhaps a primeval instinct in which we must quickly judge people for our safety. But of course outward appearance gives no clue to someonersquos character and real qualities. We must know something of that person first before we can judge on that.And this means seeing beyond what we look at. And to do this we need eye contact, a smile, a friendly gesture and the exchange of some words. We need to connect to the person inside. And the irony is, while there are more of us than ever sharing ever-bigger spaces, we are ever more disconnected from each other.The truth Irsquove come to realise is that you donrsquot have to be an old friend with someone to see their inner self, you just need to see beyond what appears to you. We have another primeval instinct and that is to detect the warmth of a character. But we cannot do thatwe only see what we look at and make no attempt to connect.My resolution, even before New Year, is to do this more often. To smile, say some friendly words and not judge or assume things. I think we actually all need more of this, with people we donrsquot know as much as those we do.As someone once said, a stranger is a friend you havenrsquot met yet. Well maybe you have, but you just havenrsquot spoken to them or really seen them for who they are."},{"url":null,"title":"hometown-clubs-special-honour-golf-star-catriona-matthew","story":"They gave Catriona, who is from the town, the membership in celebration of her victorious Solheim Cup captaincy at this yearrsquos competition, which was held at Gleneagles in September.Stuart Martin, golf operations manager at North Berwick Golf Club, said: ldquoThe club was absolutely delighted when she was given the [Solheim Cup] captaincy.ldquoEveryone was delighted for her when she won the Solheim Cup, especially since she has been related to North Berwick Golf Club for so many years.ldquoGiving her the honorary le membership was a no-brainer ndash everyone was delighted for it to go through.Catriona has been a member of North Berwick Golf Club since , when she was just  years old.On Catrionarsquos reaction to being given the honorary le membership, Stuart added: ldquoShe was just delighted and thanked everyone for being there.ldquoShe talked a little bit about her history growing up playing on the West Links, which led to her going on to do bigger and better things on the European Tour and her experience at the Solheim Cup.The club also announced it was renaming its East Lounge, located on the top floor of the clubhouse, the Catriona Matthew Lounge.Mr Martin added: ldquoShe was a little bit shocked to hear we were renaming the lounge after her.ldquoShersquos quite a private person and keeps herself to herself but she was delighted to receive both of these recognitions."},{"url":null,"title":"consultation-proposed-transport-hub-haddington-branded-shambolic","story":"Protests are expected to take place outside Haddington Town House on Monday evening when the proposals are put to the public.And angry business owners are also planning to place banners outside the townrsquos General Election polling station at the Aubigny Centre today .In recent weeks, East Lothian Council has repeatedly changed plans for a public consultation on a controversial proposal for a new car park east of the town centre. One business owner accused the local authority of trying to ide and confuse people so they did not attend.It comes after the council:Haddington Business Community Partnership had asked the council to postpone the public consultation until the start of the new year because it believes the local authority has breached Scottish Government guidelines stating that consultation exercises should not be launched during local or national election periods.A spokesperson for the council has denied this is the case and insisted it is a normal part of pre-consultation process.Community councillor Pat Lemmon said the decisions of the council were disappointing.She said: ldquoIt does not encourage feelings of trust for everyone working together. The ground rules change by the day.And she said the councilrsquos handling of the proposals had caused major distrust among residents, particularly when it came to the independently produced Haddington Vision document officials use to support their case.She said: ldquoThe Haddington Vision strongly said any changes had to be looked at by all the stakeholders, by everyone concerned, to avoid any ill feeling, to make everyone feel they had been consulted as part of proposed plans.ldquoThe statement made that East Lothian Council hopes to be in a position to implement a decision by March  indicates to me that there appears to be a race on to secure funding for the transportation hub.ldquoIf this is the case, is this the right decision given the strong views for and against any proposed hub in the town and the proposed town centre plans currently being discussed by the steering group ldquoTo have such a meeting so close to Christmas, and the stakeholder consultation at a time when many people are working, seems to me to be a bad decision.ldquoI am very disappointed that such a decision has been made.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council previously confirmed that the drop-in event would run -pm, with a public notice in the Courier of November  confirming that was the case.The event was to give local residents and businesses ldquothe opportunity to discover more about the proposals for a transport hub in Haddington.She said: ldquoThey will also be able to see the progress and history of the project to date, including the consideration of  dferent sites across the town.ldquoComments can be recorded as part of this consultation which will help inform the future development of the proposal and will be followed by another consultation in the New Year.However, the public section of the event has been reduced to just  minutes.When asked why the format of the event had been changed, the spokeswoman said: ldquoDue to a combination of level of interest and availability of staff, a stakeholders meeting will be held at pm and invitees include local business owners, schools, community council, sports clubs, transport companies and accessibility and active travel interests. [The] public event will start at pm.Other sites considered for the car park and dropped for ldquoious reasons include the field between West Road, Park Lane, Pencaitland Road and Letham Drive, and the site of the former Haddington Nursery School Annexe, off Meadowpark, which has also been earmarked for a housing development.The plans for Whittingehame Drive, which were drawn up following a series of closed door meetings, came under fire from a number of Haddington residents.Concerns ranged from the loss of green space on the site, which is beside the townrsquos skate park and G sports pitches, to the potential for accidents with youngsters playing next to the car park.The transport hub, which would include a car park with somewhere between  and  spaces, could also include ldquobus connections, bike hire opportunities and new pathways.According to East Lothian Council, the facility,approved, has ldquothe potential to free up parking spaces in the town for short-stay use, making it easier for people to access local businesses, essential services and tourist attractions.However, business owners were among those raising concerns about the proposals.George James, who runs the East Lothian TV and Video Repair Centre on High Street, felt that the last-minute changes were an attempt by the council to ide people.He said: ldquoIt is clearly isive and an effort to stop people attending the public consultations.ldquoWe are a local business and have been told we cannot attend the stakeholdersrsquo meeting as we are not considered stakeholders.ldquoWe are encouraging as many people as possible to join a protest at the Town House on Monday evening we are determined to ensure they do not get away with this approach, which appears shambolic.Karla Green from the shop is handing out leaflets advising people about the public meeting but the times have changed so much even her leaflets are now out of date.She said: ldquoThey still have pm on them so we have to tell everyone that the time has changed ndash again.Project consultants WYG will be in attendance on Monday and will have a number of display boards showing the extent of proposals.Council transport officers will also be in the Town House and people will have the opportunity to ask questions.A council spokesperson said: ldquoThe public lsquodrop-inrsquo part is now -.pm and it has been extended

It has also previously been identied that the Coastguard site could potentially provide parking for any new flats in the Assembly Rooms.A metal staircase linking the car park to the adjacent Church Street and the town centre is also included as part of the proposals.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, had mixed thoughts on the scheme.She said: ldquoLargely, there is a demand for parking.ldquoHowever, these car parking spaces would require traffic to move past a very small group of cottages that have enjoyed a degree of privacy in effectively a cul-de-sac all the time they have been there.ldquoInitial messages I have had from residents are of horror.ldquoThe prospect is that green space will be tarmacked over and become a pretty signicant car parking lot.The spokeswoman for the local authority highlighted the proposed car park was part of a wider project surrounding parking in the town.She said: ldquoThe project that transportation is considering has nothing to do with the Assembly Rooms but rather a straight forward look at available space to act as long stay and to change Abbeylands parking to short stay.ldquoThe council is currently negotiating with Transport Scotland and Network Rail to increase the capacity of the rail station car park to stop indiscriminate parking on local streets. This site provides an opportunity to add some additional supply into the town to encourage parking behaviour that is more appropriate.Councillor Norman Hampshire, who represents the Dunbar and East Linton ward, was unable to comment on the specics of the proposals as he is convener of the councilrsquos planning committee. But he said but said there was a need to address parking problems in the town.He said: ldquoThe old part of the town, the narrow streets around Church Street and Castle Street, is very congested with the number of cars parked there because of the restrictions on the High Street. Traders and people who work in the premises park on the surrounding streets and they are very congested.There is definitely a need for more parking in the town centre.Councillor Paul McLennan, who also represents the town, is not part of the planning committee and welcomed the possibility of a car park being created.

Her wee brother Pavel was having lots of fun. She waved at him and he waved back, throwing a snowball at the window, then rejoining his friends.Marcela ed to her book. She loved reading, it was her escape into other worlds. She could not enjoy the snow like her wee brother, for she had been in a wheelchair for all her le and the chair would stick in the snow.It was possible to go outside with help, especially when her father was home, butshe tried it herself the front wheels would stick in the snow and ice.It was humiliating so she preferred to stay inside with her books and imagination. But she read by the window, watching her brother and class mates having fun.Then a robin landed on the window sill. It seemed to stare at Marcela. She looked at the wee bird and smiled.ldquoLucky you she said ldquoI wish I had your freedom and that I could fly like you.The little birdrsquos head turned to its side asit was saying something. Then it flew away.Soon after it was December , the day Christmas was celebrated in these parts, and presents were given. There was not a pile expensive gts, but a few simple ones and always one specially unusal present for each child.The family were poor, but anticipation of what the unusual gt would be was always a highlight of Christmas.Pavel opened his first. As he unwrapped it his eyes gleamed with excitement.ldquoYes! he called out, hugging his mother and father. It was a huge bottle of ketchup, the real stuff! That may not sound such a present, but it was not easy to get this kind of ketchup in the village and he had always had to use it sparingly. Now he had this bottle all to himself.Then Marcela open her unusual present. She smiled as she held two unusual looking carved short planks of wood, unsure initially what they were. Then she smiled.ldquoAw perfect, bookends for my shelf.ldquoThere are not bookends, said her father. Marcela looked at them again. ldquoOh, what are they then Her father took them and went to her wheelchair. He connected them to the front wheels of the chair.ldquoThey are wheelchair skis, he said, ldquoI made them. Marcela was overwhelmed.Within ten minutes, Marcela was wrapped up and ready to go out. She nervously wheeled her chair onto the snow covered front path. Usually the wheels would stick within seconds, but this time her chair slid effortlessly along the path.Soon she had got the hang of manoeuvring the chair in the snow. She had snow ball fight and was able to spin around and chase her schoolmates while storing lots of ammunition on her lap.Then she decided she wanted to sledge down the hill. With some help from her brother she got to the top of the hill and peered down the slope. Her classmates had gathered round her wonderingshersquod really do it. She edged forward and then reached the point of no . The wheelchair slid down the slope, faster and faster. Marcela raised her hands like wings crying out ldquowheeee look at me.Then the chair slowed as it approached the bottom on the hill and wobbled to and fro. A bank of snow toppled the chair throwing Marcela out and she fell face first into the snow, arms outstretched.Her brother ran to her and helped her back into the chair. Marcelarsquos face was red with the cold and her eyes tearful. They were tears of joy and laughter.ldquoLook, she said pointing to her shape in the snow ldquoIrsquove made a snow angel!All that Christmas day, Marcela played in the snow with her brother and classmates, even making new friends. She became expert at flying down the hill in her chair.That night Pavel tried to take his bottle of ketchup to bed with him. But he was persuaded the fridge would be a better idea.And as Marcela was falling asleep, the little robin reappeared in the moonlight on her window sill. She smiled at the bird.ldquoIt was the best Christmas ever, she said.ldquoI got my freedom and today I learnt to fly."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-resident-starts-christmas-kindness-campaign-help-others","story":"Demi-Lee Taylor, , of Bayswell Road, started a kindness campaign called The Peoplersquos Christmas Miracle, which aims to support families, the elderly and the homeless in East Lothian at Christmas.She asked people to donate clothes, baby items, toys and food to help those in need.The mum-of-two was moved to act in light of her own experiences and from hearing of the problems faced by others.Demi, who is a le coach and an author who writes books for the terminally ill, said: ldquoI have been approached by parents in the school playground who say their children are having to go into school without breakfast some are being bullied because they canrsquot afford to go on school trips.ldquoI hear the elderly limit their food and heating and the homeless are left out in the cold.ldquoI donrsquot believe anyone should suffer, especially at Christmas time.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the Innovation Park.ldquoQMU chose to move to East Lothian partly because of the opportunities to work with employers to develop the land immediately adjacent to the new campus.ldquoThe decision is the

had caused a ision between neighbouring community councils and saw nearly  objections lodged with East Lothian Council.And at a meeting of the local authorityrsquos planning committee last Wednesday, the proposal was rejected against the advice of council officials after planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire branded the development a ldquobad neighbour.Mr Hampshire told fellow committee members that he was concerned that allowing Skyrora to test rocket engines on the land, which is central to the councilrsquos future economic plans, could put other investors off.He said: ldquoThis is not a good neighbour ndash it is a bad neighbour development and my concern is this may deter potential investors from taking on development at the Cockenzie site.Skyrora had lodged an application to create a rocket engine testing site on the land, which is owned by the local authority, with plans to carry out five -second tests each month.But while it applied for temporary use of the site for five years, Skyrora told the planning committee that it envisaged the possibility of not just expanding its presence in the community but potentially bringing a manufacturing facility, described as the size of an Ikea store, to the area.And while Prestonpans Community Council supported the move as offering potential for jobs and the economy, neighbouring Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council objected.At the planning committee meeting last week, Bryan Hickman, chairman of Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council, recalled a public meeting in the summer which attracted several hundred people.He said: ldquoVirtually everyone who was there was against it ndash ranging from our youngest residents to pensioners.ldquoThe feeling, rightly or wrongly, in the community is that they do not want it.During the council meeting, residents raised concerns about the storage of key elements of fuel on the site for days prior to testing, as well as the impact of burning kerosene into the atmosphere.While Skyrora insisted that the engine tests would be a ldquoclean burn producing mainly water, resident and biochemist Dr Brian Hall told the committee that he estimated about , litres of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide could be released during each -second test.Calum Miller, on behalf of Prestonpans Community Council, urged councillors to approve the plans, pointing out that the power station site had lain empty now for six years.He told them: ldquoThe council has the opportunity with this Skyrora application to dispel the myth that we are too remote from Edinburgh to attract business.Ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell, Lachlan Bruce and Neil Gilbert did not support the application.Ms OrsquoDonnell said that the impact on local amenity would be unacceptable and spoke of the ldquohigh level of public concern from constituents about the proximity of the test site to housing ndash the nearest of which was estimated at  metres away.Councillors rejected the planning application by six votes to two.The decision was welcomed by Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council chairman Mr Hickman, who said: ldquoThe community is very pleased about the decision as expressed on social media and meeting residents as I go about.ldquoI felt that we presented a strong case against the application.ldquoThe councillors present gave a fair and balanced summary before coming to their decision. The community thanks the ward councillors who called in the application.ldquoIf this did not go before the committee, it would have been approved by East Lothian Council planning department.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said that he hoped the council would now turn attention to calls for a cruise port at the former power station site, which has been supported by his members. He said: ldquoI am disappointed that local ward councillors went against the advice of their council officers on this planning application.ldquoHopefully this will focus East Lothian Council councillors and officials on pushing forward the cruise port initiative to secure much-needed jobs in East Lothian.And his community council colleague Mr Miller criticised councillors for failing to listen to their officials.He said: ldquoIt was patently obvious that councillors on the planning committee couldnrsquot get their heads around the nuances of decibels and emissions.ldquoThey should have fallen back on advice from their own experienced officials. Instead, they repeated the junk science coming from cranks in Cockenzie.ldquoEach test would have generated the same emissions as a family car running for a year. The councillors who referenced a climate emergency in defence of their decision were only too happy to drive home from Haddington.ldquoAn ecosystem of space technology companies could have emerged in East Lothian based around the testbed.ldquoThe wilful ignorance of a few has pulled opportunity for the hands of young people in East Lothian.Derek Harris, from Skyrora, said he was disappointed by the decision of the planning committee.It is understood the company will take time to consider whether to appeal the decision.Mr Harris said: ldquoI would like to thank all the staff at East Lothian Council who helped with our application.

Like its parent ldquopolitically correct, woke is a passion of the urban left. It is PC for the age of LGBTQIA+. suggested ldquowoke as word of the year, which arguably it should be, though not for the reason it thinks. For woke has changed meaning in the last  months, and become a term of derision, referring to a style of self-righteous, right-on thinking favoured by, well,columnists. It is now used to denote the metropolitan identity politics that contributed to Labourrsquos greatest defeat since the s.:Guy Stenhouse: Time to Get Over itNo-one is sure where the word ldquowoke came from, except that it emerged from African-American vernacular for ldquostaying alert, as in ldquostay woke, brother. In recent years it was adopted by the BlackLivesMatter movement with their hashtag #staywoke ndash meaning keeping black issues uppermost on social media.It was soon adopted by white millennials to emblemise not just racial awareness but a whole identitarian outlook on le. Woke expresses the ultra-feminist, multi-ethnic, gender non-conforming culture fashionable in American and UK campuses.Woke people love people of colour and loathe ldquostraight white males, ldquogammon and ldquoboomers. They adore so-called ldquonon-binary people who claim not to identy with any gender. No-one is quite sure what non-binary means. Do they swing both ways  No, thatrsquos bisexual. Are they transgender  Definitely not, and nor are they intersex. Itrsquos one of lersquos mysteries to many folk who are less woke.Wokeness has recently taken the media and advertising world by storm. Companies eager to keep up with the zeitgeist waste no chance to wave the rainbow flag and include multi-ethnic themes. This is sometimes called ldquowoke-washing. Every TV advert from McDonaldrsquos to John Lewis now has to feature a multi-racial family, asthe advertisers believe having two white people on one sofa is racism.The BBC drama Years And Years was kind of Woke Family Robinson. Black professhysional mother, transshygender daughter, gay cousin, asylum-seeker boyfriend, disabled sister ... all fighting the good fight against the emerging fascism of Brexit Britain. This compendium of woke identitarianism came complete with a middle-aged white dad. He naturally emerged as a morally worthless, adulterous creep, fit only to be punished by losing all his money.: Mark Smith: Happy Christmas First Minister ndash here are some questions I think you should answerWoke is easy to satirise and has been, mercilessly, by the comedian Andrew Doyle with his social media creation, Titania McGrath. She is a -year-old middle-class gender studies graduate, obsessed by her imagined victimhood, who identies as an ecosexual, non-binary person of colour and fights for social justice by writing bad poetry. ldquoThe only thing thatrsquos white about me, says Titania, ldquois my skin.She firmly believes women can have penises and that people should have electronic chips inserted in their brains to report heterosexual thinking. Men who have sexual dreams are guilty of rape, according to Titania.Woke folk thought Titania was the product of the homophobic, alt-right, fascist MSMndash or did until her creator, a gay Labour voter, was exposed last year. She is one of the great satirical creations of the century, just donrsquot expect Doyle to get invited on to The Mash Report.Woke is no joke. The leftrsquos penchant for strict identity politics, and the exotic fringes of LGBTQIA+ has had political consequences. The social media assault on ldquowhite working-class Brexit voters as racists and bigots was a factor in the alienation of traditional Labour constituencies. People in Bolsover, Workington and Sedgefield donrsquot much like being portrayed as fascists. Who knew There is a sanctimoniousness and intolerance about woke culture that is itself sometimes redolent of the authoritarian right, especially its approach to language. Anyone who mistakenly says ldquocoloured people instead of ldquopeople of colour, for example, will be ostracised. Pronouns must be obeyed. Feminist academics are no-edthey question whether transwomen are biologically female.Barack Obama warned the Democratic Party to avoid this ldquowoke politics with its ldquocancel culture. This is the practice of social justice warriors on Twitter demonising anyone who fails to conform to their particular form of non-conformism. If Trump wins again, it will in part because the Democrats havenrsquot listened.There is an anti-science, quasi-religious aspect to woke. Woke biology insists that sex is not innate but is ldquoattributed at birth ndash asevery child is born transgender. During the General Election campaign, the Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson tried, with disastrous results, to defend the woke dogma that biological sex doesnrsquot exist.Woke wars are raging in the Scottish National Party and have been since Nicola Sturgeon declared her support for self-ID ndash a law change to allow transgender people to self-identy as women without the need for medical intervention or convincing evidence that they have lived as women.There has been a vigorous reaction against this from feminists in and out of the SNP. They fear womenrsquos refuges, changing rooms and prisons are liable to be invaded by men declaring themselves to be female. They also resent being called ldquocis by wokeasians, aswomen are merely a subset of their own sex.The General Election has not caused any obvious soul-searching among the woke cadres. Indeed, the verdict ofwriter Paul Mason was a pitch-perfect expression of the woke worldview. The election was, he declared, ldquoa victory of the old over the young racists over people of colour selfishness over the planet.Such is the firm belief of the morally superior who spend their lives in an echo chamber saving the world from imagined hate crimes. It will take more than a landslide defeat to persuade them otherwise."},{"url":null,"title":"issue-day-steamie","story":"The Steamie The comedy-drama is set in a Glasgow wash-house and follows the lives of a group of women as they try to get their laundry completed in the run up to the Hogmanay bells in , with their chatter at the heart of the play.A wash-house For the uninitiated, the \"steamie\" was a communal facility where the clothes were cleaned in the pre-washing machine era and on Hogmanay, it was a tradition for everything to be cleaned for the New Year ndashthe house, clothes, curtainshellipIf you are the \"talk of the steamie\" The saying lives on, meaning you are the subject of hot gossip, just as you would have been discussed by the women as they did their laundry back in the day.The play is one of Scotlandrsquos biggest theatre success stories It is now, but was initially rejected repeatedly by theatres and TV production firms. Then in stepped the Wildcat Theatre Company, which had been offered an out-of-the-blue grant for a play specically about a community and had no time to commission one.

It also featured a lot of women which was unusual. Most plays were all men with a token woman. This was all women with a token man. At the time, all of the plays about women were feminist plays.

Instead the earliest it could happen would be one to two years after the  Holyrood elections.On the mandate issue, while Nicola Sturgeon claims it is ldquounarguable, she is well aware of many potential arguments against it, not least because the latest General Election was primarily about Brexit. Equally, for many in Scotland the expectation that the result of the  referendum should stand for a reasonable period,not a generation, should not be overturned by a change in circumstancesopinion polling suggests those changes have not signicantly shted support for independence.As for whether leaving the UK would be more complex and painful than leaving the EU, no one observing the machinations of the last three years of negotiations can think it would be anything but far worse to disentangle from the much closer and deeply seated UK union.Finally, the First Minister will not want to publicly contemplate what she would dothe majority for independence in any future referendum was only slight. Would less than one per cent still be enough  Would a statistical draw be taken as justying separation  Mr Sturgeonrsquos sense of fairness would have her answer no to that, but the ingrained nationalist ambition for independence at any cost will see her avoid facing up to such a conundrum until it actually happens.Keith Howell, West Linton.THE four questions to Nicola Sturgeon in Mark Smithrsquos column go a long way to identying what doesnrsquot work with her approach to major constitutional issues in. As long as elections and referendums are based on first-past-the-post , the results will be what he describes rather too gently as ldquoan inaccurate reflection of opinion.The fundamental deficiency is that FPTP does not result in a spread of opinion in the so-called representatives which reflects the true wishes of the electorate as a whole. The votes of the PR-elected Scottish Parliament MSPs may seem more representative than FPTP, but bear in mind that  per cent of them are elected by FPTP in any case and the voters have no way of influencing the opinions or actions of the remaining list MSPs.It doesnrsquot need to be this way. There is already a clear majority in the Scottish Parliament for the Single Transferable Vote and one has to question why it has not already been enacted. Mr Smith might consider adding that to his questions. I hope he gets some answers, as I havenrsquot.Thomas GF Gray, Lenzie.STUART Waitonis right to highlight how elitism can be a downfall of a political party. However, to claim the stance of a Scottish-based party wishing to block a Brexit that the people of Scotland rejected at the ballot box during the  referendum was an ldquoanti-democratic rsquo smacks of another kind of elitism, one the Scottish people rejected on December  as it slowly wakes up to how the UK is not the vehicle in which to invest its future.The ided, uneven, dis-United Kingdom allows such views to fester, but it is this undemocratic straitjacket that the Scots find themselves in that will likely halt the SNP ision he evidently craves, until after independence, when it would not be unsurprising as his article alludes to, that some movement to other or new parties could occur.Iain Stewart, Carnoustie.ITrsquoS many years since Britannia ruled the waves, or, indeed, the air.With so much of this countryrsquos land, assets and economy under foreign ownership or control, it is little wonder that one seldom hears the use of the words lsquoGreat Britainrsquo to describe the nation.Now, with the political rhetoric employed on either side of Hadrianrsquos Wall, the accuracy of the title ldquoUnited Kingdom must be open to question.

Could. Not. Compute.After the slew of early morning shoppers, it would be relatively calm as there wasnt an awful lot to come into the city for.New Years Day, too, would be eerie on the way into work as every other shop front was shuttered. By lunchtime we would be jam packed with stragglers who had come into the city centre for a look around only to find the place a ghost town. Mostly it was tourists, holiday makers who didnt realise the entire country was also on holiday.Now, in the city centre, youre spoiled for choice on New Years Day. No need to stay home when you can head into town.My memory might be playing tricks, but around that time, Im sure, Next was a one-off for its early opening hour, which was why the sale created such a legion of annual fans. Not so now.This year Matalan advertised am opening hours for some of its stores. Yesterday at the Intu Victoria Centre in Nottingham, shoppers queued from am, their Christmas dinners still halfway along their alimentary canals. Thats barely enough time to have digested the clfhanger from the Gavin and Stacey Christmas special before heading to the shops.Marks and Spencer got in ahead of the crowd by starting its online sale at pm on Christmas Day.And this is where the annual handwringing about gross consumerism begins but now we have an added tension - the environmental impact.Of course weve long known that consumerism has a negative environmental impact but this year it cant be ignored, Greta Thunberg has made sure of that.As Australian bushfires rage out of control, as children strike for climate action and as Donald Trump ties himself in knots over what wind is or isnt, we simply cant justy the unfettered desire for stuff that washes over us come Christmas time.Yet, as the planet is dying, so too is the high street.This year Scotland has seen some of the worst sales figures on record with store after store folding and hundreds of jobs being made redundant. Sales yesterday were expected to fall by . per cent on last year in real le shops, although online sales were expected to rise by  per cent.Boxing Day, for many retailers, remains the busiest in the calendar year and, against such bleak trading conditions, who can grudge them it Not everyone making the journey to the high street will be buying an entirely unnecessary set of hair straighteners to replace the nigh-on identical set of hair straighteners they bought last year. Not everyone will be buying their seventh pair of boyfriend jeans, each pair imperceptibly dferent from the last.Some people will be buying important household items that theyve waited all year to pick up, say. Or treating themselves to an item they otherwise couldnt afford. Something they might not \"need\" but that makes them feel better.Its not fair or reasonable to tar all frantic shoppers with one brush.As long as people are making justiable choices - without kidding themselves over what they want and what they need - then fine.For once we could perhaps look to Trump as a positive example. I mean, sort of. Grudgingly and at a push. Asked on Christmas Eve what hed bought for his we, the US President said he had only bought her a Christmas card. Im sure it was the most beautul and bigliest card ever but still, when you have everything you could possibly need, a card is enough.Hopefully Melania saw it the same way and wasnt expecting diamonds on Christmas morning.

Others wont celebrate Christmas others might be lonely at the holiday season and enjoy being at work.Yet, do we really need to have retail staff on hand to serve us at am  We dont, of course not.

She now works with the team at the university researching gravitational waves, providing important insights into the origins of the universe, black holes, supernovae, gamma-ray bursts and neutron stars.ldquoDana Scully was the coolest person Irsquod ever seen and all I wanted to do was become her so I could use science to solve problems and fight aliens.ldquoI came to Star Trek later in college and Captain Janeway in Voyager kept me going through graduate school.While science fiction is not short of these strong female leads, Dr Macdonald found that real-le science is still a male-dominated field.ldquoAs a first-year undergraduate, my physics class was made up of around  per cent of women but, by the time I reached the final year, there were only  people in the class and one other woman.She first realised she could encourage others like herself into science through her love of popular culture when she started teaching in community college.ldquoI made a comparison to Star Wars and the whole class perked up.ldquoSo much of science, like quantum physics, is foreign to most people but when you can compare it to a familiar TV show or film you can help them understand.ldquoI started giving talks at sci-fi conventions, sharing my passion for the lsquoscience of science fictionrsquo.ldquoTherersquos a huge audience of people who have always loved science but never went into it, and who take any opportunity to learn more.ldquoLinking it to their favourite fandoms gives an anchor for references and makes it seem a little more accessible.ldquoI explain what can and canrsquot work in real science by exploring sci-fi devices such as travelling faster than the speed of light with a warp drive.ldquoAnd I use the Star Trek transporter to explain the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states we can never know the exact position and momentum of particles.ldquoThis rule makes a real-world transporter scientically impossible but the writers of Star Trek were clearly aware of this as there is a component in the transporter called a Heisenberg Compensator, said Dr Macdonald, who has an Audible Series, The Science of Sci-Fi, and a YouTube series, Dr Erin Explains the Universe.ldquoPeople teaching physics, maths and astronomy sometimes donrsquot know how to teach it ndash they know how it works but donrsquot understand how to communicate their knowledge in a relatable, accessible way, added Dr Macdonald, who sports tattoos of emc, Einsteinrsquos Theory of Relativity, and ldquoLive Long and Prosper in Vulcan script.Now she is planning ato Scotland to visit primary and secondary schools.ldquoI get kids coming up to me after my talks asking how they can get into science.ldquoI think popular science communicators play an important role in encouraging youngsters into STEM.ldquoAnd therersquos no doubt that dramas like The X-Files, Star Trek, Star Wars and The Big Bang Theory help make these subjects more attractive and less nerdy."},{"url":null,"title":"dunblane-teacher-fund-helps-school-arts","story":"Now the memory of teacher Gwen Mayor lives on thanks to a charity in her name supporting arts, culture, music or

Unfortunately the indications from the EU-Norway talks are that this did not happen and our fishing communities are going to feel the consequences.“Sustainability is important but we must remember that no one has more incentive to ensure sustainable fisheries than family-owned businesses and fishing communities. These groups depend on having reliable stocks now and for future generations.”He continued: “Amongst all the technical discussions and ideological debates, the direct impact on local communities who are reliant on fishing and the surrounding industries is being forgotten. Sustainable fisheries should protect the long-term success of our distinct fishing communities. I hope that the key players in these talks, and our Government, can set aside ideology and reflect on the social impact of quota changes.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Isobel Thompson from Westray has been invited to take part in the naming ceremony for Odin of Scapa and offered the opportunity of a family trip aboard the new tug.Graham Sinclair, chair of the council’s development and infrastructure committee, said: “As names that strongly reflect Orkney’s Norse heritage, these are an excellent choice for the new tugs.“Tugs operated by first class crews play a vital role at the heart of our harbour operations and have helped support the welcome growth in maritime activity we’ve seen in local waters in recent years“I am pleased we are investing in even more capable vessels, which will ensure the continuation of  years of support for the Flotta Terminal and, more recently, the signicant growth in ship to ship work # and allow us to make the most of current and future marine business opportunities, greatly benefiting the economy of the islands.”The design and build contract for the -metre tugs was secured by Sanmar Shipyards of Turkey after a competitive tendering exercise.Construction is taking place at Sanmar’s new specialist tug building facility at Altinova, about an hour south of Istanbul, where work on both tugs is progressing well # as can be seen from the latest photographs taken during a recent inspection by Orkney Marine Services towage staff.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”The government’s failure to fund the ageing inter-island ferry fleet has left Orkney’s most remote and vulnerable communities with an inferior service compared to other areas in Scotland claimed Councillor Stockan.Following a y battle, the council secured £. million in additional government funding for internal ferry services for   — described by Councillor Stockan at the time as the “most signicant financial breakthrough” made by the council in years.The air of positivity failed to last however.OIC say they need £. million to run services in the current financial year — £. million more than the Scottish Government allocation.“This is a burden that most other Scottish councils do not have to bear,” Councillor Stockan continued. “The greater the burden placed on the council to keep the ferries running, the greater the risk of severe cuts to other vital services our community depends upon.“We need a long-term commitment from the government to fully fund the cost of running the service and replacing vessels with modern, cheaper-to-run ferries of a standard you would expect on routes as important as these.”RET was also in Councillor Stockan’s sights.The tarf, which would see cheaper fares for all when travelling across the Pentland Firth, has been mired in legal proceedings with Pentland Ferries making a complaint to the European Commission.From the outset, those at Holyrood said they were committed to see the scheme introduced within the first six months of . However, there appears to be no resolution in sight as we now head into .“It is outrageous that we in Orkney are still waiting for RET and that there appears to be no urgency or political will from the Government to resolve this.“Again, this is a clear case of discrimination against Orkney and our community will find it abominable that the money the government has saved by failing to introduce RET on our routes has been spent where — when it could have been committed to supporting our internal ferry service.“This is why I have written to the First Minister and appealed for her to intervene and ensure that Orkney is treated as fairly as other coastal communities with leline ferry services.”In response, a Scottish Government spokesperson indicated that the government was committed to finding a resolution to the issues raised.The spokesperson said: “At present, Orkney Islands Council are wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.#However, the Scottish Government understands the signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities and we have made clear our commitment to Orkney internal ferry services with the provision of additional revenue funding support totalling £. million in the last two years.“We continue to discuss long term solutions with both Orkney Islands Council and Shetland Islands Council. We established a working group to examine these issues and we are now in receipt of the final report which we are currently considering.”The spokesperson continued: “It is the responsibility of inidual local authorities to manage their own budgets and to allocate the total financial resources available to them, including on ferry services, on the basis of local needs and priorities, having first fulfilled their statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities.“Ultimately, it is for locally elected representatives to make local decisions on how best to deliver services to their local communities.“Ministers remain committed to pursuing all avenues to deliver RET for Orkney and Shetland, however, the first step is to resolve the complaint that Pentland Ferries have made to the European Commission.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

At the end of January, the UK will be out. While a transition period will immediately follow, exit day will see British nationals lose their EU citizenship, UK MEPs withdrawn and British flags in Brussels taken down.Scotland has a distinct story on Brexit. Besides reaffirming EU membership in the  referendum, it decisively rejected Brexit at every subsequent democratic event. In landslide fashion,  per cent of Scotland’s new Westminster MPs support staying in the EU.Heading into the post-Brexit future, a healthy dose of realism will be required on how the EU will approach Scotland. Since the Brexit vote, the Scottish Government’s strategy towards the EU  has been one of dferentiation. It has underlined how Scotland supports EU membership and the free movement of people, in contrast to the UK overall. Those points have generated favourable sentiment for Scotland in Brussels and EU capital, but good feelings only go so far.: Path open for independent Scotland to ‘walk into’ EU membership: Why an independent Scotland in EU might not be paradise – Bill JamiesonThe reality of Brexit is that Scotland will become a peripheral actor in Brussels. When the UK moves from member state to ‘third country’, Scotland’s access and relevance will signicantly reduce. While the Scottish Government and wider society can sustain EU relationships through the links they have already forged, the challenges will nevertheless be substantial.EU will remain silentWhatever influence Scotland is able to maintain in the EU will come from two sources. One is practical cooperation on areas of mutual European interest, like renewable energy, climate change and articial intelligence. The other is Scottish participation in the big debates on the future of Europe and our collective place in the world. Success will necessitate a widening of horizons.On Scotland’s independence debate, the EU will remain largely silent after Brexit. Occasional favourable pronouncements from particular MEPs and national parliamentarians on an independent Scotland joining the EU will undoubtedly continue. But the European Commission and the EU member states – the principal decides – will have little to say.Even once the UK has left, EU decision-makers will continue to see the question of Scottish independence as an internal British matter, from which they will want to remain distant.Despite the outward disinterest, private EU opinions on an independent Scotland have notably shted since the Brexit referendum. For many in Brussels, the logic of pro-European Scotland joining the EU after the departure of Brexit Britain is compelling. It would serve as a powerful antidote to the narrative of failure and loss associated with the UK’s abandoning of the EU. But those views will remain utterly unspoken while the independence debate rages.Clear candidate for membershipIn a future independence referendum, EU officials will certainly not repeat their ill-judged and inaccurate statements on the apparent dficulties of Scottish EU membership. Such interventions around the  referendum were misguided attempts to be supportive of the UK Government, and not reflective of the reality, then or now.Whether or not a new referendum lies in Scotland’s near future, over-optimism on the EU should be checked at the door. Scotland as part of the UK will shortly become an external partner of the EU, with all the associated challenges for engaging and influencing. Were it to become independent, Scotland would be a clear candidate for EU membership, but accession would take around four to five years after formal independence.Scotland must avoid the kind of exceptionalist illusions which fostered the UK’s disconnect from the EU and led to Brexit. Its pro-EU sentiment is a valuable resource which should be channelled into practical form. After Brexit, Scotland will have to approach its EU relations with pragmatic strategy.Anthony Salamone is managing director of political consultancy European Merchants©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

In response to Ofgem’s decision, SSEN is also promising to progress preparation of the Shetland #standby arrangements# which will complement the transmission link.It is hoped the decision will provide Shetland’s renewable developers clarity about future network charges, helping them make investment decisions and provide the evidence required by Ofgem for the regulator to approve the proposed transmission link to the Shetland Isles. Commenting on today’s decision, Colin Nicol, Managing Director for Networks, said: “We welcome today’s decision by Ofgem to approve our whole system solution for Shetland, which is a positive step toward meeting Shetland’s electricity needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers than alternative options.“The proposal will support future security of supply as well as unlocking Shetland’s renewable potential.Once built, the transmission link and the low carbon output from renewable generators on Shetland will also help support the electricity needs of Shetland’s oil and gas industry and its wider economy.“Our transmission business will shortly re-submit to Ofgem an updated Needs Case for the Shetland link and we look forward to working with Ofgem and Shetland developers to progress this proposal in a timely manner.”Funny how things like this are announced during the few days between the General Election and Christmas.Last we heard was renewable energy developers crying their eyes out that the proposed MW cable was inadequate for all the wind farms they want to build on Shetland.#Follow the money#.

What exactly are we to read into #meeting Shetland#s energy needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers# There is an implied promise there, and even a threat, but no actual guarantee of cheaper bills for local residents.As for #unlocking Shetland#s renewable potential#, this looks like code for unlocking their potential to exploit the landscape and the people through environmentally harmful proposals the people will get no say in.Shetland remains in thrall to the notion that all potential economic activity is necessarily a positive development.Some developments however represent an approach to development that dlsempowers, robs folk of a say and foists solutions onto them that do not address their problems or needs.There will be opportunities for some to profit no doubt, but is is hard for the council to dispassionately manage partnership with these far larger players when they are so wowed by the prospect of cash flowing into the reserves through ground rent to the Busta estate.The SIC will do diddlysquat to ensure local concerns are considered.I do wonder what those who think wind energy is the green way forward for Shetland think about the irony of it being used to power more fossil fuel production .."},{"url":null,"title":"ninian scoops window prize for second year running ","story":"There were winners galore in Lerwick town centre on Monday as the top Christmas window was announced and the Elf trail came to an end.Ninian staff receive the trophy for the best Christmas window.

Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind. That’s all I ask, is for people to be kind to those on the street. We don’t always know the story of how or why it has come to that.”For more information on the Welcome Organisation or to donate visit www.homelessbelfast.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"young people saying yes to yeha project","story":"ESTABLISHED over ten years ago, the YEHA Project has gone from strength to strength in helping young people in North Belfast.Based in the Flax Centre and the Houben Centre in Ardoyne, YEHA stands for Youth, Education, Health and Advice.The YEHA Project is made up of a small dedicated team of five full-time staff, sessional workers and a team of volunteers.

Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone but the benefits are massive.The YEHA Project is also involved with cross-community work, alongside an organisation based on the Woodvale called Streetbeat Youth Project.Another successful project is the Carezone in Schools project, a pilot programme which is currently into its second year, based at Mercy College.Cara explained: “It is a model where we run one-to-one support within the school and have someone from YEHA project in the school daily to work with students in school.“After running a research programme, we found that over  per cent of young people would be more likely to speak to another young person about their problems rather than an adult.“We run the one-to-one mentoring service alongside a Peer Mentor programme where young people are trained up in Peer Mentoring to help support other young people on issues affecting their mental health and enables them to signpost to relevant support agencies.“It was a successful first year and last year we delivered  sessions to  pupils covering a range of issues including building coping skills and resilience, relationships, communication and social skills, health and well-being and anxiety.“We have a nice room in Mercy College where young people can come and relax and they are more likely to open up in such an environment.“It is all voluntary too, of course.”One young person, who took part in the programme, Jodie Shevlin, praised the benefits of it during the pressures of school exams.“The Carezone in Schools project is a way for pupils to distress and escape from the pressure of school work and exam,” she said.“The one-to-one work the project does is a chance for us to get worries or problems off our chest and be able to just have a more relaxed chat where we are really listened to.“It has really helped me get through my last few years of school.”YEHA ProjectFlax CentreArdoyne AvenueBelfast BT DATel:    "},{"url":null,"title":"brexit sees record 900000 applying for","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Theyre a tradition which need to be maintained.\"On a wider point, I have never seen anything wrong with hunting for control, but people who complain about these hunts are missing the point.\"Its not about killing foxes, its about people with a love of horses and tradition coming together in a colourful occasion, occasions that have been held for years.\"The League Against Cruel Sports, though, maintains more than halfof respondents to polling carried out believe hunting with dogs is already banned in Northern Ireland as it is in England, Wales and Scotland.Janice Watt, senior public affairs officer for the campaign group in Northern Ireland, said hunting and killing animals for sport might satisfy a small minority, but most people find it repulsive.She added: \"With polling showing widespread opposition to this so-called sport, its clear that hunting should be made illegal in Northern Ireland, and the league is working hard to ensure that as soon as Stormont sits again we get a ban to bring our nation into line with the rest of the UK.\"In a poll of , people living here released by the group, % of respondents believe it should be made illegal to hunt deer with live dogs, compared to % who believe it should remain legal.When it comes to fox hunting, % of respondents believe that it should be made illegal to hunt the animals, compared to % who think it should remain legal.The polling, commissioned by the group, asked people aged  and over living in Northern Ireland their views on a iety of animal welfare topics, including hunting.Of those polled, % believe it is illegal to use dogs to hunt live animals in Northern Ireland, compared with % who think it is legal and % who did not know."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/8bf58/38816876.ece/BINARY/ars-Winners-Graphic%202.jpg","title":"full list of northern ireland new years honours","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He told the Fine Gael minister he wanted a statement from the taoiseach saying they were innocent.In a letter to then-taoiseach Charles Haughey, Mr Hill pleaded with him to take their case to the European Court of Human Rights under Article  of the convention, saying there is “absolutely nothing preventing the Irish government from doing this”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Paddy Joe Hill in  In the letter, dated July  , Mr Hill wrote: “I would like to take this opportunity in thanking the Irish Government in asking for an investigation into the West Midlands Police.

In , there were only three Arctic tern fledglings, but  this year.\"Much higher chick numbers are a direct result of a breeding season that was free from freakish storms and floods,\" said Hugh.Closely linked to the Lough is the Ards Peninsula where the Trust has been working in partnership with the Ards Red Squirrel Group to restore the native red squirrel population.Toby Edwards is the ranger leading the project.\"At Mount Stewart we have around - reds and across the whole Peninsula we estimate there are  reds now, which is close to the natural capacity for the area. This is great news and it shows what can be achieved when organisations work together to develop a plan for the protection of a species.\"Warm spells of weather in the early half of the year saw migrant species of butterflies, moths and dragonflies from the south and east arrive in the UK. Signicant numbers of Painted Lady butterflies arrived en masse for the first time in a decade. In total, Painted Ladies made up more than half of all the butterflies and moths counted in Northern Ireland this year.But  new species of moth were recorded here, many of which are migrant species.Ben McCarthy, National Trust head of nature conservation and restoration ecology, said sightings of migrant insects and birds are becoming more common across the UK.\"This is a result of our changing climate. Although this can seem exciting, the obvious flip side is how these changes will start to affect some of our native species already under pressure from intensive land use, habitat fragmentation and climate change,\" he said.\"Butour wildle doesnt have anywhere to move to as temperatures rise and the weather changes over the coming years we will inevitably see more and more species at risk of becoming extinct.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/62958/38812320.ece/BINARY/cdb003.jpg","title":"welcome to the world northern irelands 2019","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The X Box, the Playstation and Nintendo Wii offer an almost limitless choice of gaming s to enjoy inter-connectivity in a high definition world of colour. However,  years ago in , the new world of home video game consoles was a new monochrome phenomenon. The first company to launch a home video game console was the Calornia based form Atari. Founded in , the firm initially concentrated on designing arcade games. But as the decade progressed it became clear that the huge appetite for computer-based games was readily transferrable to the home. googletag.cmd.push By , one of Atari’s founders Nolan Bushell employed an engineering company that constructed a console capable of playing the original games designed by the pioneering firm for arcades. The result was the Atari Video Computer System . Released in September , the VCS was priced at the hefty sum of around pound – the equivalent of approximately pound today. The first incarnation of the system included a console, two joysticks, a pair of paddles and the Combat game cartridge. There were however eight other games available to be sold separately that included – Air-Sea Battle, Star Ship and Street Racer and Breakout. googletag.cmd.push Perhaps the most memorable of all the games of this era was Pong- the two-dimensional table tennis simulator. The game, originally developed as a training exercise in programming for an Atari employee, was one of the earliest arcade video games back in  and proved hugely commercially successful. A separate home version that could be played on a TV was released in . Players controlled game paddles by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen to hit a ball back and forth. The aim was to win by amassing eleven points. A point was won when one failed tothe ball to the other. The game was then included in the games for the Atari VCS two years later. Despite the obvious huge advances in gaming technology in the ensuing four decades the enduring appeal of Atari for people of a certain age remains. The Atari Flashback with the original games can still be bought today for around pound. But what other toys enthralled the children of the s  Launched in , the Nerf Ball was billed as the “world’s first official indoor ball”. The marketing team charged with selling what was essentially a large foam sphere, emphasised the safety aspect of the product by stating: “You can’t damage lamps or break windows. You can’t hurt babies or old people.” This simple message was very effective because four million Nerf Balls were sold in it’s first year in existence. Undoubtedly another of the favourite and best toys of the era was the Evel Knievel Stunt Cycle. Ideal Toys launched its popular line of toy bikes in  and zoned in on the antics of the crazy American stuntman to boost their sales. Knievel made a total of  jumps on his Harley Davidson that year including a leap over  vans at the start of that year. Whilst Evel is probably best remembered for his spectacular crashes rather than his successes, the sales of the toy did not crash and sold in millions. One of the few toys that made a full-blownto the commercial market  years after its original launch was Stretch Armstrong. Introduced to the world by the Kenner toy company in  the muscular male figure made of laytex rubber and filled with gelled corn syrup allows it to be stretched from its original size of  inches up to around  foot before reverting back to its normal shape. If a tear developed it could be repaired with an adhesive bandage and instructions on how to fix Stretch were included inside the box. Hasbro who bought the brand, very successfully brought Stretch Armstrong back to the market at the New York Toy Fair in . Christmas of course sees us all indulge in sweets and the s was no exception. Cadbury’s honed in on a novel way of enticing children to want their products even more. The Dairy Milk dispenser spat out inidual squares of the world-famous confectionary for the princely sum of p. The mini machines were replenished by refill packs sold at stores such as the now long gone Woolworth’s chain. The dispenser was also marketed on the basis that it had an added attraction of doubling up as a money box. But it’s suspectedthat after a while the chocolate refill packs were consumed without ever having seen the inside of the dispenser with the ‘saved’ two-pence pieces retrieved and spent quickly on something . First to three goals was the aim in the table top game Crossfire in the s. The object was to push one of the pucks through the opposing player’s goal by firing small metal ball bearings at them using the attached guns. The effect of the Star Wars film series on popular culture has been immense. But with the filmmakers initially dubious about the success of the first film in , manufacturers were seemingly reluctant to launch a toy franchise based on the film. As a result, Star Wars toys were slow to hit the shelves  years ago. When they did, the Kenner company found the demand was enormous and to begin with launched four figures. They expanded the range in  and effectively became a license to print money. But still demand often exceeded supply and the range was often hard to come by. As filming began for The Empire Strikes Back in spring  children were screaming for new merchandise that Christmas. And nothing has changed since. All that’s left to ponder about this range is the fate of the executive of the American toy company Mego who took the decision to turn down the chance to manufacture the Star Wars toy range. The firm established in , specialised in making toy figures and promptly folded in . If you want to buy an original s Girl’s Word made by Palitoy in good condition, it’ll cost you around pound on vintage toy sellers website. The original cost was pound – roughly the equivalent of what a vintage version will cost you now. Launched in the mid-s Girl’s World was a brunette or blonde model hair and make-up styling head. She had suction caps on the base so the toy could be attached to a table top whilst hair styling and make-up techniques could be practised. She also had an extraof hair inside the head, a small handle on the side of the base was turned to either make the hair grow or shrink back into the head, allowing her ‘stylist’ to change her hair style orwithout resulting to a pair of scissors. It could also be washed and styled using ‘human products’ without much damage to the hair itself. Tiny Tears was the must have ‘hi-tech’ doll of the s. No other toy possessed the ability to wet itself or cry ‘real-le’ tears, nor a baby’s bottle from which the liquid disappeared to produce the aforementioned seepage. Such was the level of innovation of the toy that Palitoy won the toy of the year award for it. Sexual equality has never been an issue for the toy manufacturing industry with its dedicated adherence to commercial gain based on pandering to the pockets of the parents of boys and girls. In the s The Bionic Woman and The Six Million Dollar Man covered these markets perfectly and will equally huge financial success which was ensured by the importation of the American TV series to these shores. Starring Lindsay Wagner the show aired between  and . The Bionic Woman series features Jaime Sommers, who takes on special high-risk government missions using her superhuman bionic powers. The Bionic Woman series was a spin-off from the s Six Million Dollar Man television science fiction action series. Like its parent program The Bionic Woman spawned its own line of toys. Kenner produced a -inch doll of the character, with similar features to the Steve Austin version , except instead of a bionic eye the dolls head would click when turned, simulating the sound of Jaimes bionic ear. Accessories for the doll released by Kenner included additional fashions, and a Bionic Beauty Salon playset. A metal lunchbox for children was available, as was a vinyl story record produced by Wonderland Records. Kenner produced a series of stickers and temporary tattoos featuring Jaime Sommers inidually and with Steve Austin. Considered as much a symbol of the s as much as any other item, the space hopper was actually invented in Italy by a company called Ledragomma which specialised in manufacturing rubber balls. Essentially, the hugely popular toy was a large heavy rubber balloon with two handles sticking out of the top and was inflated by a bicycle or car tyre pump. Children sat on the top of the hopper, held the two handles and bounced about to their hearts content.

However, its perhaps a forgotten fact that the beautul Christmas carol was written within the walled city of Derry. Originally written as a poem by Cecil Frances Alexander, the carol was first published in  in her work, Hymns for Little Children. A year later in , the English organist Henry John Gauntlett discovered the poem and set it to music. Mrs Cecil Frances Alexander was born at  Eccles Street, Dublin in April . She was the third child of Major John Humphreys of Norfolk and Elizabeth . Major Humphreys was land agent to the Fourth Earl of Wicklow and also to the Second Marquess of Abercorn. googletag.cmd.push Cecil Frances love of writing verse began in childhood and some of her inspiration came from a Dr Walter Hook, Dean of Chichester Cathedral. Her father encouraged her writing from a very young age and as a result she began a career as a prolic writer of hymns. By the time of her death at the age of  she had penned over  such works. In , Cecil Frances Humprheys married clergyman William Alexander in Strabane. He was later to become the Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe and the Primate of All Ireland. Bishop Alexander also wrote several books of poetry, the best known of which was St Augustines Holiday and Other Poems. googletag.cmd.push Mrs Alexanders later religious work was strongly influenced by her contact with the Oxford Movement and particularly John Keeble who edited her most famous anthology-Hymns for Little Children. In fact, the work had reached its th edition by the close of the th century. However, by the s, Cecil Frances Alexander had already become famed as a hymn writer. Her compositions became a steadfast feature of Church of Ireland hymnals and she also contributed lyrical and narrative poems to Dublin University Magazine under ious pseudonyms. Seven of these hymns were included in the  Church of Ireland Hymnal and eighteen more were included in A Supplement to Hymns Ancient and Modern in . Mrs Alexander was a involved in charitable work for most of her le and she was involved with sting up the Derry Home for Fallen Women and worked on the development of a district nursing service. Another classic hymn penned by Mrs Alexander, There Is a Green Hill Far Away has obviously endured the test of time but few realise the part that it has played in transforming the education of deaf children almost  years ago in the north of Ireland. Cecil Frances Alexander and her sister Anne were heavily involved in local church activities in Strabane including their visits to local families. On one of the visits they met a young deaf boy from a poor home in the area. They were greatly concerned about the loneliness of his existence and the fact he was alienated from learning, especially about Christian way of le. Both Cecil and Anne persuaded their father to allow them to use a small out building in the grounds of his home-Milltown House so they could establish a school for deaf children. It was a passion that would Cecil Frances would continue for the rest of her le and she dreamt of establishing a much larger institution of this kind. The proceeds from Hymns for Little Children made a hefty contribution to to what became known as the Derry and Raphoe Diocesan Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb. Cecil Frances dream became reality in September  when just a few weeks before she married William the foundation stone of the school was laid. Despite the onset of the Famine in the s education for deaf children in Ireland flourished and other schools of this nature opened up in Belfast, Dublin and Cork. Frances school first opened its doors in the summer of . In the following five years the school took in almost  children teaching skills that would help them succeed in a hearing world. Cecil Frances Alexander died on October ,  and was laid to rest in Derry City Cemetery. Rev Dr William Alexander, who had been born in Devon on April , in Devon passed away aged  on September ,  and was buried with his we. In , two years after William Alexanders death, a stained glass window by James Powell in memory of Cecil Frances was installed at the northern vestibule of St Columbs Cathedral in Derry financed by public donations. The three lights of the window refer to three of her hymns-Once in Royal Davids City, There Is a Green Hill Far Away and The Golden Gates Are Lted Up. Mrs Alexander is also commemorated by an Ulster History Circle blue plaque on Derrys Bishop Street. One of her most famous quotes remains: Do no sinful action, speak no angry word ye belong to Jesus, children of the Lord. Since , the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols at the Kings College Chapel Cambridge has begun its Christmas Eve service, with Dr Arthur Henry Manns arrangement of Once in Royal Davids City as the Processional hymn. Mann was organist at Kings between  and . In his arrangement, the first verse is sung by a boy chorister of the Choir of Kings Chapel as a solo. The second verse is sung by the choir, and the congregation joins in the third verse. Excluding the first verse, the hymn is accompanied by the organ. According to the tradition of the Kings College Choir, the soloist of this hymn is usually chosen on the day of the performance, when the choirmaster decides whose voice is the strongest on the day right before the broadcast. This carol was the first recording that the Kings College Choir under Boris Ord made for EMI in . Among others who have recorded it are Mary Chapin Carpenter, The Chieftains, Daniel ODonnell, The Seekers, The Mormon Tabernacle Choir, Petula Clark, Jethro Tull, Sineacutead OConnor and Sufjan Stevens, St. Pauls Choir School and most recently by the Irish group Celtic Woman in their album Voices of Angels.

Yorkshire man Strickland acquired six of the birds from native American traders on his travels around the New World and duly shipped them back to England. With the arrival of the turkey, a th century poem described Christmas dinner as: “Beefe, mutton and porke, shred pies of the best, pig, veal goose and capon and turkey well drest.” This was accompanied by cheese, apples, nuts and “good drink.” The turkey was also devoured because of purely pratical reasons by farmers because they needed to keep their cows to produce milk and their chickens for eggs. In the sixteenth century eggs were almost a luxury item and were accordingly expensive. googletag.cmd.push It is a matter of historical record that King Henry VIII began the tradition of eating turkey on Christmas Day, but it wasnt really until after WWII that the bird became more popular than goose on the big day. An English farmer, Thomas Tusser noted that by  turkeys had started to adorn Christmas tables, but that as well as geese another bird – the capon – a castrated rooster – remained the fowl of choice. And, that remained the case for another few centuries. By  turkey appears as a meat used in households as noted in a book called The English Housewe written by Gervase Markham. In the s the London Poulters Guild recorded that they had begun to give the company clerk a turkey as a Christmas gt. In the Victorian era, turkey was still too expensive to buy in comparison to its alternatives. There was a ision in tastes between northern and southern England. In the north, roast beef was favoured while in the south, goose remained the traditional choice. Poor families mostly made do with rabbit whether they were from the north or south. Recent research shows that today the average worker will need to toil for around . hours to afford a turkey, but as late as the s it would have cost the average weeks wages to buy one. Eating turkey at Christmas was popularised further by its most recogniseable literary reference. That of course came in  when Charles Dickens, A Christmas Carol was published. The character of Scrooge famously sends his put upon clerk Bob Cratchit a huge turkey to replace his goose on Christmas morning. Post  food austerity changed any doubts about the correct choice for Christmas dinner. The sheer size of the turkey could more than adequately feed a sizeable family and the St Stephens Day leftovers could be turned into sandwiches, soup and stew. According to the British Poultry Council more than  million turkeys are killed every year –  million of those for the Christmas season alone. However that figure pales by comparison to the fact that in the U.S.A three hundred million turkeys meet their fate each year – mainly for Christmas and Thanksgiving. But outside of Ireland, Britain and America, turkey is not the favoured roast for Christmas Day. In Norway for example, the festive feast actually takes place on Christmas Eve and most around the costal regions of the country eat fish – mainly cod and haddock and a iety called lutefisk. Inland in Norway they opt for pork chops, specially prepared sausages and sometimes lamb. In neighbouring Sweden the Yuletide consists of a smorgasboard of caviar, shellfish, cooked and raw fish and cheeses. Further east in Ukraine people prepare huge broths crammed with meat while in the Czech Republic tradition decrees that the tree is not lit before Christmas Eve and is then followed by a dinner of fish soup, salads, eggs and carp. A macarbre tradition upheld by the Czechs is that the number of people at the table must be even, otherwise the person without a partner will die the following year. In Germany the traditions are much more straightforward with the Christmas Day feast consisting largely of wild boar or venison. Meanwhile in Jamaica, Christmas dinner usually consists of rice, gungo peas, chicken, ox tail and curried goat. Back in Western Europe, the Christmas dinner in Italy can last four over four hours. Most families will have seven or more courses including antipasti, a small portion of pasta, a roast meal followed by two salads and two puddings – then, cheese, fruit, brandy and chocolates. The Austrians take a more austere approach and on Christmas Day traditionally sit down to braised carp served with gingerbread and beer sauce. Poland pays no heed to the turkey at all. In fact they pay no mind to meat at all and knuckle down to  meat free dishes that represent the months of the year and which includes fish such as pike, herring and carp. Other typical Polish Christmas dishes are fish soup, sauerkraut with wild mushrooms or peas and traditional dumplings with ious fillings.

And we visited all the local shops and businesses on Central Drive with gts to say thank you for everything they have done for us. Its great for the childrens confidence to go out into the community and we always get people phoning us to praise their great behaviour.The school also raised pound, for St Vincent de Paul through the school raffle, which will help local families in need.-- googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

But still the vast majority of us will sit down to eat turkey on Christmas Day – but how did the big bird from America find its way onto our plates and manage to remain a permanent Yuletide fixture for centuries Turkeys were first brought into these islands in  by explorer William Strickland and before that those who had the money to buy them ate geese, boars heads, pheasant and even peacocks.Yorkshire man Strickland acquired six of the birds from native American traders on his travels around the “New World” and duly shipped them back to England. With the arrival of the turkey, a th century poem described Christmas dinner as: “Beefe, mutton and porke, shred pies of the best, pig, veal goose and capon and turkey well drest.”This was accompanied by cheese, apples, nuts and “good drink.”The turkey was also devoured because of purely pratical reasons by farmers because they needed to keep their cows to produce milk and their chickens for eggs. In the sixteenth century eggs were almost a luxury item and were accordingly expensive. It is a matter of historical record that Englands King Henry VIII began the tradition of eating turkey on Christmas Day, but it wasnt really until after the Second World War that the bird became more popular than goose on the big day.An English farmer, Thomas Tusser. noted that by  turkeys had started to adorn Christmas tables, but that as well as geese another bird – the capon – a castrated rooster – remained the fowl of choice. And, that remained the case for another few centuries. By  turkey, appeared as a meat used in households as noted in a book called The English Housewe written by Gervase Markham. In the s the London Poulters Guild recorded that they had begun to give the company clerk a turkey as a Christmas gt. In the Victorian era, turkey was still too expensive to buy in comparison to its alternatives. There was a ision in tastes between northern and southern England. In the north, roast beef was favoured while in the south, goose remained the traditional choice. Poor families mostly made do with rabbit whether they were from the north or south. Recent research shows that today the average worker will need to toil for around . hours to afford a turkey, but as late as the s it would have cost the average weeks wages to buy one. Eating turkey at Christmas was popularised further by its most recogniseable literary reference. That, of course, came in  when Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol was published. The character of Scrooge famously sends his put upon clerk Bob Cratchit a huge turkey to replace his goose on Christmas morning. Post  food austerity changed any doubts about the correct choice for Christmas dinner. The sheer size of the turkey could more than adequately feed a sizeable family and the St Stephens Day leftovers could be turned into sandwiches, soup and stew.According to the British Poultry Council more than  million turkeys are killed every year – nine million of those for the Christmas season alone. However, that figure pales by comparison to the fact that in the US, three hundred million turkeys meet their fate each year – mainly for Christmas and Thanksgiving. But outside of Ireland, Britain and America, turkey is not the favoured roast for Christmas Day.In Norway, for example, the festive feast actually takes place on Christmas Eve and most around the costal regions of the country eat fish – mainly cod and haddock and a iety called lutefisk. Inland in Norway, they opt for pork chops, specially prepared sausages and sometimes lamb. In neighbouring Sweden the Yuletide consists of a smorgasboard of caviar, shellfish, cooked and raw fish and cheeses. Further east in Ukraine people prepare huge broths crammed with meat while in the Czech Republic tradition decrees that the tree is not lit before Christmas Eve and is then followed by a dinner of fish soup, salads, eggs and carp. A macarbre tradition upheld by the Czechs is that the number of people at the table must be even, otherwise the person without a partner will die the following year. In Germany, the traditions are much more straightforward with the Christmas Day feast consisting largely of wild boar or venison. Meanwhile, in Jamaica Christmas dinner usually consists of rice, gungo peas, chicken, ox tail and curried goat. Back in Western Europe, the Christmas dinner in Italy can last four over four hours. Most families will have seven or more courses including antipasti, a small portion of pasta, a roast meal followed by two salads and two puddings – then, cheese, fruit, brandy and chocolates. The Austrians take a more austere approach and on Christmas Day traditionally sit down to braised carp served with gingerbread and beer sauce. Poland pays no heed to the turkey at all. In fact they pay no mind to meat at all and knuckle down to  meat free dishes that represent the months of the year and which includes fish such as pike, herring and carp. Other typical Polish Christmas dishes are fish soup, sauerkraut with wild mushrooms or peas and traditional dumplings with ious fillings. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

At a traditional Argentinean Christmas dinner you’ll most probably find turroacuten at dessert. Turroacuten, also known as nougat, is typically made of sugar, honey and egg white, with toasted almonds or other nuts. It comes in dferent shapes, such as a rectangular tablet or a round cake. googletag.cmd.push   - Australia  It might be hot in Australia at Christmas time, but Australians still have a White Christmas. This is the name of their traditional Christmas dessert. It’s basically a mixture of raisins, cherries, dried coconut, icing sugar, milk powder and rice bubbles, with hydrogenated coconut oil as the ingredient that puts all the rest together. White Christmas is usually served cut into squares and because it’s very easy to make even children give it a try in the holiday season.  - Belgium  Belgians bake cougnou or bread of Jesus during Christmas time. This sweet bread is formed like a baby Jesus and is decorated with dferent elements such as flowers, circles etc. The composition includes flour, eggs, milk, yeast, raisins, sugar and is usually enjoyed with a cup of hot chocolate. googletag.cmd.push  - Brazil  One of the most popular Brazilian desserts is pudim de leite condensado or condensed milk pudding, containing condensed milk , regular milk, eggs and caramelized sugar on top. Whether it’s Christmas or other festive occasions, Brazilians take every opportunity to serve this custard dessert.  - Canada  The Yule log, a dessert shaped to resemble a miniature log or a chopped off tree branch, is a form of sweet roulade made of sponge cake. It is traditionally prepared for Christmas in other countries as well for example, in France it’s known as bucircche de Noeumll. The original Yule log recipe dates back in the th century and has developed many iations along the way. The most common combination is basic yellow sponge cake and chocolate butter cream.   - France  In France, it is customary to serve  desserts at the Christmas table. Les treize desserts de Noeumllrepresent Jesus Christ and the  apostles and they include walnuts, hazelnuts, almonds, apples, pears, green melon, black and white raisins, figs oranges and mandarins. The desserts are traditionally set out on Christmas Eve and remain on the table three days, until December .  - Iceland  Iceland’s Laufabrauethconsists of a round, very thin flat cake with a diameter of about  to  cm , decorated with leaf-like, geometric patterns and fried briefly in hot fat or oil. Baking this leaf bread is an important part of the Christmas preparations in every home in Iceland.  - India  A popular Christmas cake served by the Christian population of Hindustan in India is the allahabadi, a rum fruit cake originating and lending its name from the Northern Indian city of Allahabad. It’s made with maida flour, eggs, claried butter, sugar, petha - a translucent soft candy from North India, marmalade, nuts, ginger and fennel as its main ingredients.  - Italy  The cupola-shaped sweet bread called panettone is originally from Milan and it became an omnipresent dessert on Italians’ Christmas Eve dinner. The process of properly preparing the panettone in order to obtain its distinctive fluffy characteristics takes several days. It contains candied orange, citron, and lemon zest, as well as dried raisins. It is served in slices, vertically cut, accompanied with sweet hot beverages or a sweet wine. In some regions of Italy, it is served with crema di mascarpone or crema di zabaione.  - Japan  Even though Christmas is not a national holiday in Japan - with only about  percent of Japan’s population being Christian - the Japanese do have a Christmas cake. The dessert is a type of sponge cake, covered with snow-white whipped cream and topped with red strawberries. The red and white in this cake reminds of the Japanese flag colors and this is probably why the cake became so popular in Japan that it even has its own emoji. The Japanese Christmas cake is a perfect example of Western traditions being adopted by the Japanese culture and given a dferent and fresh meaning.  - Mexico  Hot beverages are almost as popular as baked desserts at Christmas time. In Mexico, the drink that accompanies the festive meal is atole, which includes masa , water, piloncillo , cinnamon, vanilla and optional chocolate or fruit. Atole ies in texture, ranging from a porridge to a very thin liquid consistency. Instead of masa as a main ingredient, rice, flour, or oatmeal can be used.  - Norway  The most commonly eaten Christmas cookie in all of Norway is pepperkake - translated as pepper cake. It’s a ginger bread cookie spiced with black pepper and formed into a heart or other shape. Pepperkake is complemented with coffee, tea or especially gloslashgg, a spiced drink served warm, with or without alcohol.

Cllr McPeake said: When I first came into council, this was one of the projects that I inherited, and immediately I sought to get some progress on, meeting with council officials about the possibility of a play park on the site as far back as January. We are all familiar with the many benefits reported from leisure facilities for children, particularly those which encourage outdoor activity, and I think it is important that we make delivery of these sorts of spaces a priority right across our council area. googletag.cmd.push If we are to tackle issues such as mental health problems and obesity, it is vital that we provide our young people with the amenities to allow them to get out and about, and play has been proven as a necessity for childrens development.He added: As part of this project further on down the line, I hope to see further car parking to alleviate the issues which exist currently in ONeill Park, and I will be making a case for delivery of this. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Cllr McPeake said: When I first came into council, this was one of the projects that I inherited, and immediately I sought to get some progress on, meeting with council officials about the possibility of a play park on the site as far back as January. We are all familiar with the many benefits reported from leisure facilities for children, particularly those which encourage outdoor activity, and I think it is important that we make delivery of these sorts of spaces a priority right across our council area. googletag.cmd.push If we are to tackle issues such as mental health problems and obesity, it is vital that we provide our young people with the amenities to allow them to get out and about, and play has been proven as a necessity for childrens development.He added: As part of this project further on down the line, I hope to see further car parking to alleviate the issues which exist currently in ONeill Park, and I will be making a case for delivery of this. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The owner was visiting the city from the South. So, as you can imagine, he was absolutely overjoyed by our call.He was so grateful, in fact, he gave us pound to pass on to the girls.In recognition for their honesty and quick-thinking, the girls were rewarded with “Angel of Courage” certicates at St Johns Primary School Advent assembly.We are very proud of the children for making this Christmas miracle happen, said St Johns teacher, Amanda Murphy.Martine Mulhern, principal of St Cecilias, said: We are just so proud of Ciarrai and her two friends from St. John’s Primary School.They are such lovely role models to all in our schools and community - honest and kind.

Cllr Cusack said it was “reassuring” to have had the officers react so quickly to her request to try tackle the problem by installing surveillance cameras at the “hot spot.” She added: “I know that there’s hardly a street which is not affected by fouling throughout city and district and sympathise with residents and those affected. “However, given there are only a few of these cameras and a lot of resources needed to monitor them, it’s a case of having to prioritise areas.“Hopefully, the public will understand that a school deserves the attention and other areas can be looked at going forward.“There are also limitations with regards to where and how surveil- lance can be conducted. While this may help deter irresponsible owners allowing their dogs to stray and foul, realistically it will not eradicate the problem, it is a mindset which has to change and that is not easy. “I would keep calling on the public to report and assist Environmental Health with any information they may have.”Concluding Councillor Cusack said: “Meanwhile, I will be addressing the prospect of Council investing in more such cameras and resources to combat the problem.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Evan Tweed and Brendan McLaughlin were on the wings, as Cormac Burke – who starred against the Swts – picked up the number ten role behind McCready.‘Stute started with intent, and a deflection off Emmett Bennett inside his own half fell kindly for Aidan McCauley who broke into the box, but the centre half recovered well to block the shot away for a corner that came to nothing.The home side came within inches of making it one nil on six minutes when a superb crossfield pass from Evan Tweed picked out Brendan McLaughlin at the back post. He skipped inside on to his right foot before trying to curl it to the bottom corner, but Mark Byrne was equal to it with a ing save.They were dealt a blow on  minutes when Derry City loanee Tweed was forced off with an ankle problem, with Shane McNamee subbed on in his place.Warrenpoint had the ball in the net on  minutes when an acrobatic clearance from Byrne was met with a flicked header by Alan O’Sullivan for Brandon Doyle running off the shoulder of Conor Tourish, but the linesman raised his flag before the ball left the Town man’s boot.At the other end, Brendan McLaughlin had a golden chance to put his side in the lead when Crown played a one two off McCready from a throw before dinking it into the box for the Donegal man – who had drted between Anton Reilly and Bennett – but from ten yards out he could only head over the top.A slick team move then ended with Burke trying an ambitious chip from the right sideline after spotting Byrne out of position, but it bounced harmlessly wide of the left upright.Sean Connor’s men were well and truly dominating, and on  minutes McCready had his first chance when he beat the offside trap and raced away from Bennett to latch on to Dean Curry’s pass, but after twisting and turning in the box the striker fired straight at Byrne – with the Blues unable to do anything with the rebound.In added time, ‘Stute came close again when McNamee showed great awareness to latch on to the loose ball down the right before fizzing a cross across the face that was just inches away from the boot of the incoming McCready.The first period was played almost entirely in Warrenpoint’s half, but a combination of some poor finishing and decision-making, and some bad luck, meant that ‘Stute went in frustrated, and level, and the break. googletag.cmd.push Half-timeInstitute Warrenpoint  ‘Stute picked up where they left off with a shot on target off the boot of Cormac Burke inside the first minute, but it was never troubling Byrne from  yards.Joe McCready flashed one wide from a tight angle before passing up a huge chance on  minutes when Burke’s first-time ball across the face found the striker completely free at the back post, but he skied it over off his weaker left foot.Mark Byrne was thanking his lucky stars seconds later when he completely misjudged the bounce on a long Colm McLaughlin pass, but as it evaded the goalkeeper with McCready closing in, Warrenpoint captain Daniel Wallace was alert enough to get across and clear.Burke found the chest of Byrne once again with a half volley on the hour mark before, out of nowhere, Lorcan Forde found himself through on goal but took too long to get the ball down and Dean Curry hacked it away.The game flipped on its head on  minutes when, completely against the run of play and with their first shot on goal, the visitors took the lead. It was the simplest of goals too, as O’Sullivan pulled out to the right wing before driving a ball in that Eamon Scannell, in acres of space, finished from seven yards.The home side thought they had levelled matters two minutes later when McLaughlin nodded McCauley’s dinked pass over Byrne, but the flag was raised for offside.‘Stute continued to enjoy a lot of the ball in the final stages, but they couldn’t fashion any chances as Warrenpoint took a huge three points back home.If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The principal cast performed like seasoned professionals, bringing the iconic characters to le with flair and panache.Eoin McGuinness and Ellen McGurnaghan were outstanding in their comic portrayals of Gomez and Morticia Addams, while Annie Haughey and Eoin Moore were superb as the sinister siblings, Wednesday and Pugsley.The hilariously embarrassing grandmother was played by Aisha Oladipupo, and Year  student Conaire Laverty brought endless laughs as the grunting Lurch. Conn Murnin, as Uncle Fester, was a particular audience favourite and his departure on a rocket to seek the love of his le mdash the Moon mdash was a highlight of the show.The ever present long dead Addams ancestors were a tight and focused chorus including a stunning range of costumes from cavemen to flappers. All-American family, the Beinekes, played by Malachy McGrady, Elisha Tumelty and Tomaacutes Harkinleft the audience in stitches as they struggled to deal with ways of the weird and wonderful Addams family. All ended happily ever after, however, as both families moved towards the darkness and embraced who they really were.Featuring an exceptional live orchestra led by Head of Music Celeste McEvoy and music teacher Ciara Coleman, and with magnicent set, costume, lighting and sound complementing the breathtaking musical and dramatic talent of these students, it really was a show not to be missed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahich Post Office remains  ","story":"RESIDENTS in Ballynahinch will continue to have access to a first class Post Office service in the New Year after all.Days after it was suggested that the current office in Lisburn Street would close temporarily on January , it was confirmed this week that there will be no break in service.The current postmistress will vacate her position on January  with M Retail Ltd taking over the service the following day.Mrs Donna Carlisle mdash who is the current postmistress mdash said everything will continue as normal in the New Year and that there will be no interruption to services.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who said last week that it was his understanding that the Ballynahinch Post Office was to close temporarily, is delighted that normal service is to continue.He said post offices are at the heart of communities and are used by a wide range of people, in particular the elderly, who enjoy the face-to-face contact with staff.ldquoBallynahinch is the districtrsquos third largest town and I am pleased that there will be no interruption to postal services, he continued.ldquoMany elderly people prefer to conduct their business at post offices rather than banks.

The boys are all training hard and we are working on a few dferent permutations for the decider, but it will definitely be horses for courses.ldquoTony McIlhone, Jack McLaughlin and Adam and Gareth George will be key for us in the final. Their experience should stand us in good stead, but I have absolutely no doubt that our young players will rise to the occasion, he added.Fitzsimmons paid tribute to Gerard Kelly, who led the team, to Harry Clarke Cup success last season with Kieran Sharvin and who is still in the management team.ldquoIt is a pleasure and honour to work alongside Gerard, who puts so much effort into keeping the club going. We have been friends for many years and work so well together, he said.ldquoWe have come up with a few ideas on how to get at Ballynahinch Olympic, but we will leave that information to the changing rooms in Meadowvale.Barry McGoran and Marty Sloan have moulded Ballynahinch Olympic Town into a force to be reckoned with, despite the fact that they rarely field with the same  every week due to first team call-ups.As a reserve team, people tend to write them off in the big games, but theyrsquove consistently proved that theyrsquore good enough to compete with anyone.The squad has done exceptionally well to get to another final, but they wont be happy until they get our hands on the cup.McGoran and Sloan like to play the same way as Killough and use the tactic of attack being the best means of defence and Barry feels that Olympic arenrsquot far away from lting the trophy.ldquoWersquore only half way there and need to stay focused. We got a bit carried away last year, but wersquove learnt from that. We need calm heads now, hesaid.ldquoKillough will go into the final as favourites. Theyrsquore a good side with some quality players, especially in midfield and can be lethal going forward, but so can we. We showed that in the semi-final and we have plenty of quality players ourselves.In lsquokeeper John McMenamin Olympic have an experienced custodian, who is a great shot-stopper and as brave as they come.A mixture of Niall McGlew, Mick Rice, Gavin McMullan, Thomas Rodgers Reece McConnell, Darryl Russell and Liam Sloan will make up a formidable defensive barrier with Simon Marmion handed the playmakerrsquos role in the middle of midfield.Shane Rodgers, Simon Marmion, Jack Roddy, Josh Fennell, Gary Wilson, Daniel Rice, Stephen King, Dylan McCartan and Connor Reid will vie for starting places alongside Marmion leaving the twin threat of Darren Lyons and Aaron McCaffrey up front.This pair compliment one and other perfectly.Both are comfortable on the ball and both are workaholics. Defenders canrsquot take an eye off either one as they will destroy you in a flash.McGoran believes his side are ready to cash in on the success of the clubrsquos first team.ldquo The club has come a long way in recent years and when you see the success that our first team is having its incredible, McGoran beamed.ldquoThe professionalism and dedication they show in training has filtered down through the club and it has inspired the younger players to put the work in to try and get to that level mdash and thatrsquos a big part of why our seconds team is doing so well.ldquoLast year ended up being a disappointing Christmas for the club, so itrsquos up to us all to make sure we put things right this time around..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Department.jpg","title":"Department ‘has just 8 staff members’ to fix all streets lights in province  ","story":"A LEADING government department has warned that it is not able to operate a full street lighting repair service across the district due to cutbacks.The Department of Infrastructure has revealed that its repair budget has been slashed by two thirds, down from just over poundm to around poundm. In addition, roads officials only have eight electricians to repair faulty street lights across the Province, with just five of these working full-time.The crisis facing street lighting repairs has been highlighted this week by South Down MLA Colin McGrath who has been contacted by many concerned residents across the constituency.He said that the government departmentrsquos failure to sanction work to repair street lights mdash which includes replacing faulty wiring and defective bulbs mdash is a major concern for many, in particular, the vulnerable and elderly.Mr McGrath said that while the issue may appear trivial and mundane to some, to a signicant number of others, itrsquos literally is a matter of personal safety.He said many are fearful of injuring themselves due to faulty street lights which plunge areas around their home into darkness.The MLA declared: ldquoThere is barely a street or road in South Down that does not have street lights which are not working. When there are several defective lights in a row, this creates problems.Mr McGrath said that he and his colleagues have been ldquoinundated with repair requests which are passed on to the departmentrsquos street lighting team.He said that while he is full of admiration for the local team who work tirelessly to resolve faulty streetlights in a professional and courteous way, they can only work with the budget they have been given, one which he said falls well short of what is required.ldquoI have written to the Department for Infrastructure and have found out that the budget for street lighting should be poundm a year. It is currently a mere poundm which is totally inadequate and falls well short of what the public expect, declared Mr McGrath.ldquoApparently, there are only eight full time staff managing the work of replacing and fixing street lights across the whole of North and this is wholly unacceptable. Eight staff from Derry toNewry, and Enniskillen to Ballycastle is not enough and represents a situation that demands action.The MLA confirmed that he has also raised his concerns with the permanent secretary at the helm of the government department asking that in the depths of winter and reduced daylight hours, additional funding will be made to address the issue.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWe are literally in the dark over what will happen next and need to see some solution to this problem.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed that officials have discussed the street lighting situation with Mr McGrath.ldquoWhilst we appreciate his concerns, we have explained that in common with many other parts of the public service, the Department continues to face budget challenges and resources are not available to provide for a full street lighting repair service, she continued.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos current budget for street lighting repairs is approximately poundm, which is much lower than the pound.m that would be required to provide a full street lighting repair service.The spokeswoman explained that repairs are now generally limited to those that can be carried out by the departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce, which consists of five full time and three part time electricians.She added: ldquoDue to the restricted service, outages may take much longer than usual to be repaired, with priority being given to hazardous electrical defects and group outages..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Devaney.jpg","title":"Devaney elected as new chairman of Down GAA  ","story":"DOWN GAA elected a new chairman at the annual convention in Newry last Wednesday evening. Bredaghrsquos John Devaney becomes the st holder of the countyrsquos main position, having been selected unopposed to succeed Mayobridge man Sean Rooney.In his first address to delegates, Mr Devaney outlined a strategic vision for the association in the county and a number of areas of focus for his term of office.The key priorities will be the proposed Centre of Excellence, the development of a new coaching plan, recruitment of referees, and a programme to encourage and nurture new and young administrators.Following his election, Devaney said: ldquoThe Ballykinlar Centre of Excellence is clearly the single biggest project that we will have undertaken, and will take time and resource to bring to fruition. ldquoWe have set out our intention and we are determined that it will happen, because it is a fantastic opportunity for the county. But it is only the only project.ldquoThere is quite a lot we can achieve in other areas, on and off the fields of play. Coaching, refereeing, administration, club development and fundraising will also require our attention, he added.ldquoAnd we also want to have the ambition for our teams to reach their potential and challenge for honours. So, the future has real potential for us, but it will require a lot of support, goodwill and a unity of purpose across the county. A native of Killoe in Co Longford, Devaney has been an officer with Down GAA since . He is a former chairman of the Queenrsquos University GAA club and the Higher Education GAA Council, and has served on Ulster Council Management Committee and Central Council.Further details on the proposed new Centre of Excellence at Ballykinlar were outlined at Wednesdayrsquos meeting.Planning permission for the development was submitted earlier last week and the early concept designs of the complex were presented to club delegates.

Like many other couples of that era, the wedding was a small affair and they spent a welcome few days honeymooning in Dublin.Alan worked as a writer in the Supply and Secretariat branch of the Royal Navy and soon needed to leave his new bride at home toto his posting. Muriel worked in the office of the now defunct Ulster Transport company.They met on a bus from Belfast to Portaferry and the rest, as they say, is history.ldquoI think we were both on the bus from Belfast and my mother, who knew Muriel, sat beside her and they began to talk and then we were introduced, said Alan. ldquoI was sitting behind and my mother then invited her down for supper the next night.Muriel interjected jokingly: ldquoI was supposed to be going to a shorthand class, which would have made my dear father much happier, but I mitched off and went to the Ritz pictures instead.ldquoHis mother had already spotted me and approved me as a likely candidate for her son as she believed that I knew how to keep house since I was doing it at home as my mother died when I was very young.Alan said that his motherrsquos approval of Muriel very much matched his own.ldquoI had clapped eyes on her before and I thought she will do very nicely for me. It was a private thought, but my mother must have picked up on it and had some insight, he added.Muriel did come for supper the next night and an invitation to a dance was given by Alan. They courted for over a year and more whenever he was home on leave.Alanrsquos parents, Rachel and Ian, were in the next room when Alan later asked Muriel to marry him and they celebrated with tea and supper again.ldquoI was completely flabbergasted but I would say that it was a romantic proposal, recalled Muriel. ldquoAlanrsquos father was great at tending to an open fire in the sitting room and his mother was a great hostess in making scones and cake for supper, so I think just after his father tended the fire, Alan turned tome and asked me to marry me. I think I said yes with a laugh as it was so unexpected.The couple spent the early years of their marriage in Malta where Alan was stationed and where the eldest two sons where born.While the family spent a short time living in Bangor, they have spent the last  years living Downpatrick where Alan went on to work for Radio Rentals in the town, and later in the British Red Cross Society in Belfast, while Muriel worked for the Saul playgroup and later in Downpatrick Library.The couplersquos love of music and going to the theatre, both in Belfast, and at the former Theatre Upstairs, in Irish Street, Downpatrick, was a shared passion over the years.Even today, they both love to watch or listen to concerts on the radio or TV, with performances perking up them up from a trying day or calling on their Alexa to play some Glen Miller music.Muriel said: ldquoWe both love the theatre and we both absolutely love music of all sorts. If therersquos anything that doesnrsquot suit us, we have a wee word with Alexa and say itrsquos your turn to chose.Alan added: ldquoIrsquove often said isnrsquot it wonderful that we have the same tastes in common and thatrsquos a great start to a marriage as well as a good sense of humour and a short memory.Muriel said: ldquoI think it did help that we did like the same things but I would say donrsquot leave it too long before you say sorry for whatever may have happened or been said between you.

Cllr Enrightrsquos assertion has been rejected by council officials.ldquoThe long-standing plans to publicly finance the redevelopment of public lands in Downpatrick town centre have been abandoned, he claimed.Cllr Enright said business representatives who attended the meeting in Downpatrick were not informed that a proposed road linking Irish Street with St Patrickrsquos Avenue as part of a new one-way system was not proceeding.He said such a scheme mdash which roads officials have said is not viable given the cost and the small impact that it would have on congestion mdash would have eliminated the need for traffic lights on all the main junctions and ldquomassively reduced congestion around the centre of town.Cllr Enright claimed that when he queried the decision, he was informed that the councilrsquos priorities are the Ballynahinch bypass and Newryrsquos southern relief road.He added: ldquoAll this comes hot on the heels of the scandalous proposed closure of Downpatrickrsquos visitor information centre in favour of Newry, progressing greenways around Newry but not Downpatrick and the abandonment of the promised Edward Street one-way system, which was supposed to have been delivered on a short-term basis in  until the new council revisited the roads priority list.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman said the local authority has allocated poundm to the Newry City Centre regenerationproject, with poundm secured from the Belfast Regional City Deal, not the poundm quoted by Cllr Enright.She continued: ldquoIt has been proposed that the development of Downpatrick town centre and the old PSNI station should be done collaboratively between local and central government with intervention from other public sector bodies.ldquoThis remains the case. However, the one-way system for Downpatrick town centre was considered by Transport NI who have advised that this is not viable.The spokeswoman also confirmed that a report was tabled to the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourismlast month which considered the future opportunities for visitor information centres within the district.She added: ldquo This report was held lsquoin committeersquo and no decisions have been made by Newry, Mourne and Down Council with regards to the closures of existing visitor information centres.

If the pool is completed soon it would probably lie idle because pool staff have not yet been appointed.The situation has left councillors with red faces for the second time in several months. They have been pushing relentlessly for early completion, but have made no preparations to coincide with a possible quick finish.Last month they demanded a showdown with the poolrsquos architects and had even threatened to invoke penalty clauses on the contractthe pool was not finished soon. They were due to meet the architects this week, but instead were sent a written report on the progress being made.The council clerk, Mr Seamus Byrne, read the report at a council meeting on Monday and said he expected a completion date early in the new year. In the report the architects catalogued a series of setbacks over the past two years and blamed most of the delay on strikes and shortages of materials.Downpatrick councillor, Mr Sean Quinn, launched into a scathing attack on the architects, who, he said, had failed to serve the council as they as they should.Mr Quinn said he found it disturbing that the architects must have known of the troubles on the site, yet had still made ldquowild predictions about the proposed opening date.Mr Quinn also condemned the mounting costs of work on the scheme and then drew attention to the pool itself, saying he felt the interior design was lacking in imagination.Mr Cecil Maxwell reminded councillors that they had approved the pool design and he did not think the architects were at fault for the slow progress.DROMARA mdash ADromara schoolgirl flies out to London tomorrow to represent Northern Ireland in a major essay competition.

And while almost , people cast their vote, just over , eligible voters across the constituency chose not to go the polls.While Mr Hazzard was viewed by many as the runaway favourite, he admitted that he took nothing for granted and worked hard to ensure that republicans retained their grip on the Westminster seat for another term.Mr Hazzard said Sinn Feinrsquos commitment to stand up for people when it came to Brexit and give them a voice was a message that resonated with the South Down electorate. He said that in the light of the ldquoBrexit catastrophe, people stood up and put the interests of people in the constituency to the fore.Conceding that he expected his vote to decease, the ing MP said that he was delighted to top the poll, highlighting the need to get Stormont up and running again.ldquoIt is important that we have locally devolved institutions. There was a deal on the table last year which I thought was a good compromise. No deal is going to be perfect and all parties need to realise that we are going to have to give a wee bit to get back in, he said. ldquoWe want locally elected ministers involved in decision making.ldquoWe want to restore Stormont and are very keen to get a deal to move forward to restore the institutions to tackle the issues around health, education and infrastructure.The SDLPrsquos Michael Savage said the gap between nationalists and republicans across the constituency was ldquonarrowing and believed his party had a solid  on which to plan for future electoral success.ldquoI will sit down with the team to assess how the election went, looking at the missed opportunities and the things we did well and build on those, he said.ldquoThere was an opportunity tonight in South Down and some voters may reflect on that and sayonly we had done this or that. In the end, it just wasnrsquot to be. I have been around a long time and just have to accept that that is democracy and politics can be cruel at times, but I enjoyed every minute of it.Mr Savage added: ldquoA lot of people wrote us off in  and said the SDLP was finished. We have a lot of very good, talented young people coming through and, as far as I am concerned, we have a bright future ahead of us. I think what our results have shown tonight is that people have realised that stalemate politics and power splitting, rather than power-sharing, is not working for the people of Northern Ireland.The DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna, who saw his party vote decrease by just over two per cent mdash down from , in  to , mdash said he was pleased the DUP remained ldquothe voice of unionism in South Down on what had been a disappointing night for his party where, particularly in North and South Belfast.He said that the election count had been a ldquotough night for unionism explaining that he was not disappointed with his own performance in an ldquounforeseen election.Mr Hanna added: ldquoIt is important that the DUP remains the voice of unionism in South Down and it is going to stay that way as we have a solid voice and a firm Assembly seat. On the doorstep, people said they wanted the Assembly up and running and I think that that is going to happen.Alliancersquos Patrick Brown was delighted to increase the partyrsquos vote by over  per cent.In  the party polled , votes which Brown increase to , votes last week, placing Alliance fourth in the South Down pecking order, just  votes behind the DUP.The Alliance man believes that the only way to unite people in South Down is toa cross-community candidate to Westminster, suggesting that the surge in support for his party was because people are ldquofed up with the current situation at Stormont.Brown also believes that Alliance is potentially edging towards a South Down Assembly seat given the strong constituency base that it now has and that he would be up for contesting any future election.Ulster Unionist Jill Macauley mdash who was delighted to increase the party vote by just over three percent mdash rising from , votes two years ago to , this time out, was one of bright lights of her partyrsquos Westminster campaign.She was delighted to increase the vote at what she described as ldquoturbulent political times and said it was clear on the doorstep that voters are angry with the conduct of the DUP and Sinn Fein and their lack of delivery.ldquoThe clear message from the electorate was that they want local politicians to get back to work and restore the Assembly and the Executive. The current health crisis was also a major concern and the impending emergency that faces our strangled education system, she said.ldquoWith the UUP share of the vote increasing in such a toxic environment, it encourages me that we must be doing something right.

As was that of SDLP runner-up Michael Savage.They were the only two South Down candidates who made their way to the podium to thank those who voted for them on a night when Northern Irelandrsquos political environment changed signicantly.With voters across the province electing a majority of nationalist MPs for the first time, it truly was a night of edge-of-the-seat political drama. Itrsquos often said that first itrsquos news then its history, but at the Belfast county centre news and history were inextricably intertwined.Minutes after the South Down result had been declared, the glare of the media spotlight was on official confirmation that the DUP had lost South Belfast.As SDLP supporters and the party faithful cheered loudly for Claire Hanna, the Sinn Fein contingent took a moment out of celebrating Mr Hazzardrsquos victory to watch proceedings.Hazzard was always the favourite for the South Down seat and used a sporting analogy to explain how he felt about the contest. He said favourites donrsquot always win, pointing out how hard he worked on the ground, emphasising that the was never complacent about the challenge he faced from the SDLP.From early in the count, SDLP members said that it looked as though their man was in with a real fighting chance and from the boxes which had been opened, the duo were neck and neck.While some of the Sinn Fein contingent appeared to be sporting furrowed brows early into the counting process, they were always confident that their man would emerge victorious and that he did, albeit with a reduced majority.There were suggestions that unionist voters in the Crossgar area had backed Mr Savage, who was clear throughout his campaign that he would not only be an MP for all, but one who would take his seat in the House of Commons.And while it was reported close between him and Mr Hazzard at one stage, the Sinn Fein man eased ahead in the race to cross the winning line, with the SDLP man left wondering what might have been.He had been given a relatively short lead-in time to last weekrsquos parliamentary pole and while pleased with his performance, he clearly felt he could have done even better and pushed the Sinn Fein man all the way to the line.Elsewhere, Alliancersquos Patrick Brown was one of a number of his partyrsquos candidates who built on their recent success at the EU and local council elections.The Westminster poll was viewed as a key litmus test that would rigorously challenge Alliancersquos recent election surge in a first past the post electoral system which did not rely on the votes of other parties.Mr Brown, who in May trebled his Newry, Mourne and Down Council vote in Rowallane, was at it again. His election agent and fellow councillor, Andrew McMurray, stood for Alliance in  and polled , votes, but Brown more than trebled the Alliance vote, a performance which helped his party leapfrog the Ulster Unionists to become the third largest in the province. Overall, Alliancersquos vote in South Down increased by an impressive . per cent, marking a remarkable performance by Brown.Most signicantly, Alliance now has its eyes focused firmly on securing an Assembly seat and while Mr Brown refused to be drawn on whether he would like his name to go forward should such a contest arise, there is no doubt that he will be the partyrsquos preferred candidate.

I am so joyful and thankful as is my husband Dermot and our families.Orkambi was made available freely available following a surprise move by Department of Health Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly at the end of October.Scotland and the Republic of Ireland made the drug free available to CF sufferers earlier but NHS England wrangled with the drug company over price.Once a deal was agreed in England, it paved the pay for Northern Ireland to introduce Orkambi for patients as young as Lorcaacuten, along with Symkevi, which can be given to children aged  and over.Jen was only informed on Monday that the drug was available for Lorcaacuten following a phone call from his treatment nurse.She said: ldquoI was absolutely shaking holding the phone when they told me that Lorcaacuten could get his medication as he has been fighting off the pseudomonas infection since last November.ldquoOrkambi was being given to those children with the higher clinical need and Lorcaacuten got it because of his infection, but I know of so many other families who have campaigned long and hard as we have.ldquoItrsquos just a matter of sufficient quantities of the drug becoming available as I know that the medical teams are working around the clock to distribute to as many patients as they can.Lorcaacuten was observed for five hours in hospital before he was allowed to go home with what his mother calls his ldquomagic medicine. He will need to take it twice daily from now as well as taking his antibiotics and being nebulised several times a day.However, Jen says that studies have shown that children with CF who take Orkambi from the age of six can live with the condition for an extra  years.ldquoThis is not just a Christmas present for this year, but for all the extra years we hope to have with Lorcaacuten, said Jen.ldquoWhilst I love Lorcaacuten to the bottom of my heart, these past three years have been very dficult. With every infection, my heart has broken a little more.ldquoNow the future is so bright for people with Cystic Fibrosis, so much brighter than I could have ever imagined when we received his diagnosis..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Sunken.jpg","title":"Sunken fishing trawler in Scotland for inspection  ","story":"A FISHING trawler which ran aground and sank off Ardglass harbour has arrived in Scotland for inspection after being raised from the seabed.Specialist lting gear was used to raise the Dillon Owen five weeks after it ran aground on rocks near the entrance to the villagersquos harbour on October .The carefully planned lting operation got underway on December , with the process involving engineers fitting two large strops underneath the Dillon Owen before it was hoisted clear of the water by a crane in less than two hours.Weighing  tonnes, nearly  metres long and eight metres wide, the trawler was winched on to a barge before being taken away.

If and when an Assembly election happens, we will certainly be putting a lot of effort into securing a seat in South Down.Mr Brown said he went into the election with the intention of building on the partyrsquos best ever performance in a Westminster poll two years ago when it secured , votes.ldquoWe wanted this election to be our best ever result and we have done that, he declared.ldquoI would say that we knocked more doors in  than in this election as I was responsible for the partyrsquos social media and digital marketing campaign. As a result, my time was split between South Down and helping out in other areas including North Down and East Belfast.ldquoI know that working full time on an election campaign in South Down we can achieve an even better result. I also know that a lot of our voters did vote tactically and respect their decision to do so. Some of my friends voted SDLP this time which wonrsquot happen in an Assembly election.Mr Brown said many would have suggested that Alliance hit its electoral ceiling in  and firmly believes there is much more to come from his party locally.

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is events like this in the very heart of Penarth which demonstrate how lucky we are to have such a ying and vibrant collection of businesses, which are so accessible.It was great to witness how the streets opened up to more traditional businesses of selling hand-crafted Christmas gts and roasted chestnuts, adding to the selection of businesses we already have on offer.Many of you will be aware of Small Business Saturday, which this year falls on December . The campaign aims to encourage people to ldquoshop local and to support small businesses in their communities.For me, one of the highlights of living in Penarth is access to a vibrant High Street. The street, and town as a whole, provides such a iety there really isnrsquot any need to go anywhere .I regularly make use of shops on the High Street, particularly the greengrocers and butchers, while my we, Michelle, makes use of others. Shopping locally you are almost always guaranteed to receive a first-class service with a smile, and it is that welcome, as well as the quality of the product or service, that keeps customers coming back ndash these are the reasons I always make thattrip.Thatrsquos why Irsquove got behind our local shops for this yearrsquos Small Business Saturday. In the run up to Small Business Saturday I have been visiting businesses across the constituency to talk to local business owners about them, their staff, what they enjoy about running their own business and the challenges that they face.On Friday December  I will be visiting businesses across Penarth.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

often I think it comes down to the mental approach, having the right focus to stay professional in your preparations despite everything  going on with the holiday season.“From starting out in management I’ve always had my teams in for a training session just ahead of Boxing Day, not so much for tactics or fitness but really just a way of getting the squad together for that final time before the match.“It helps keep everyone sharp and, hopefully, we can get the right result in Loughgall and end the year in top spot.“That is the target as you set goals along the way and sitting first at the start of the new year is a marker which can benefit the squad.”Portadown recovered from defeat to Ballinamallard United with a - success on Saturday over PSNI at Shamrock Park.A Lee Bonis brace alongside goals from Chris Lavery, Adam Salley and Callum Ferris secured victory.“We were - up at half-time but had kept moving the ball around and the final goal was the most pleasing in terms of representing so much of what we work towards,” said Tipton. “It came after a -pass team move - by moving the opposition and maintaining control, eventually players tire and that leads to extra space, which we can try to exploit.“The final goal was the culmination of that teamwork and it was pleasing to see the players still strive towards that at -.”\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"traffic update road closed major disruption expected ","story":"Return to top flight remains the target for Portadown says Matthew TiptonThe DWP paid out more than £k to one pensioner -

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
