Nationally our party has lost touch with too many voters.\u0027Yes, we are powerful advocates locally. Our campaigners listen to local people, work hard for communities and deliver results.\u0027But at the national level, we have to face the facts of three disappointing general election results.\u0027The truth is: voters don\u0027t believe the Liberal Democrats want to help ordinary people get on in life.\u0027Voters don\u0027t believe we share their values. And voters don\u0027t believe we are on the side of people like them.\u0027There has been a revolving door at the party leader\u0027s office ever since Nick Clegg quit in 2015.His replacement Tim Farron lasted until 2017, Sir Vince Cable took over but was gone by July 2019 and while Ms Swinson only lasted until December 2019. The party was largely defined in recent years by its opposition to Brexit and its differences to Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s Labour Party.But with the UK now having left the EU and with Labour a much different force under the new leadership of Sir Keir Starmer, Sir Ed will need to redefine his party. \u0027Voters have been sending us a message but we have not been listening. It is time for us to start listening,\u0027 he said. \u0027As leader I am telling you: I have got that message. I am listening now.\u0027Ms Moran, who lost by more than 18,000 votes, congratulated the new leader and said: \u0027I look forward to working with him to campaign for a better future for Britain.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Inside Amazons grocery store opening week","story":"Share this articleAmazon is opening a new grocery store filled with smart devices - CNNIntroducing the first Amazon Fresh grocery store"},{"url":null,"title":"London passengers shock medics drag suspected Covid case plane allowed fly","story":"Share this articleRyanair coronavirus scare: What really happened when passenger was dragged off jet - Mirror Online"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d97bf3e5eeda5924e549bf30b34e120c99bd7a3e/0_6_5079_3049/master/5079.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee1c69cf092f54546aa3868f65e466e3","title":"moma reopening new york museums art coronavirus","story":"Cultural powerhouse’s reopening marks shift in New York’s pandemic recovery efforts as other museums to welcome visitorsThose markings on the floor. Is it art … or is it guidance for social distancing while looking at art?It’s the latter, of course these are still Covid times. But masks, odd circles 6ft apart and a mandated lack of the madding crowd could not take away from the significance on Thursday of New York’s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) reopening.After five months in compulsory hibernation, the cultural powerhouse in midtown Manhattan opened its doors again.Just up the street, on Fifth Avenue’s “Museum Mile” that normally draws tens of millions of visitors from around the world, the renowned politan museum whipped off the dusts sheets on Thursday for members and plans to admit the general public from Saturday.It is a pivotal moment in the careful return of the beating heart of high art in New York, as these flagships, other museums and galleries and cultural institutions prepare once again to readmit the Netflix, Zoom, reading, sewing and baking-weary public not accustomed to being housebound in the Big Apple.MoMA’s reopening on Thursday morning, even with reduced hours, marked a shift in New York City’s recovery efforts beyond essential businesses, retailers and outdoor eating and exercise to now include some renowned cultural temples of fine art.Theaters and other performing arts institutions are still closed.From 27 August to 27 September, MoMA’s admission is based on “advanced timed ticket only”, which must be secured online, and capacity is capped. Monday visiting times are reserved solely for museum members. There is no admission fee through 27 September, MoMA said on its website.The American Folk Art Museum opened on Wednesday for members and opens for all on Saturday.And, downtown in the trendy Meatpacking District on the west side, next to the High Line elevated urban park, the Whitney Museum of American Art is slated to reopen on Friday for members and on 3 September for the public, also with a plethora of restrictions to help prevent the spread of coronavirus.However, the Whitney ran straight into controversy not even linked to the pandemic, when it was forced to announce that a show scheduled for 17 September was canceled on Tuesday.Artists of color objected to the museum purchasing their work at a discount, which these artists had sold at a discount specifically in order to benefit racial justice organizations, according to the New York Times.Back uptown, on the other side of Central Park from the Met and Museum Mile, the American Museum of Natural History will open on 2 September to members and 9 September to the general public.El Museo del Barrio reopens on 12 September. The Guggenheim Museum reopens to members on 30 September, and generally on 3 October.Across the bridges, the Brooklyn Museum is scheduled to reopen on 12 September, with timed tickets permitting entry every 15 minutes.Michael Alexis, an owner of Museum Hack, a company which leads “renegade museum tours” in major cities, said these institutions are staffed with “some of the most detailed, organized, structured” people. Because of this, Alexis believes they can reopen museums safely.Reduced capacity, Alexis pointed out, might offer a better experience and calming atmosphere, whereas top museums are often congested.“They’re going to be quieter,” he said. “This might be a time when you can enjoy an entire gallery to yourself, you can sit with the art.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9a5527ed8e46c7a2f669736644596caa496238f/0_166_5757_3454/master/5757.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bceed1cc6320739c6c69e10f7dae0f21","title":"businesses and customers share your experiences of eat out to help out","story":"We’d like to hear to from staff, owners and customers on how they feel the scheme has beenThe government’s ‘eat out to help out’ scheme has meant more than 64m meals have been claimed since the beginning of August.When introduced, its aim was to incentivise the public to dine at restaurants by allowing customers to claim a half-price discount up to a cost of £10.

A strictly-Orthodox man and his son, who were sitting in the row when she arrived, asked Wolfson to switch seats with a man a few rows ahead.Wolfson says she was “insulted and humiliated” by the request. “It was the first time in my adult life that I was discriminated against for being a woman,” she told Haaretz.“I would not have had any problem whatsoever switching seats if it were to allow members of a family or friends to sit together, but the fact that I was being asked to do this because I was a woman was why I refused.”A flight attendant intervened and offered Wolfson a free hot drink as an incentive to move. Concerned that the flight might be delayed on her account and feeling that she had little choice in the matter, she agreed to switch seats. “There were passengers watching this happen who said nothing,” she said.According to the suit, several flight attendants told Wolfson during the flight that women were often asked to switch seats in order to accommodate strictly-Orthodox men.Two months later, on another easyJet flight to London, Wolfson was again asked to move seats by two strictly-Orthodox men. She refused their request but two female passengers agreed to change seats with the two men sitting next to her.Members of the cabin crew did not intervene or try to defend her right to stay seated where she was although again she was offered a free hot drink, according to the suit.Wolfson complained to the airline on both occasions but when it failed to respond, she decided to sue for violation of Israeli law, which prohibits discrimination against customers on the basis of race, religion, nationality, land of origin, gender, sexual orientation, political views or personal status.Although easyJet is not based in Israel, lawyers will argue that the airline was subject to Israeli law while its plane was on the ground at Ben-Gurion airport, where the incident took place.In a statement, easyJet said: “We take claims of this nature very seriously. Whilst it would be inappropriate to comment, as this matter is currently the subject of legal proceedings, we do not discriminate on any grounds.”Three years ago, Renee Rabinowitz, an 82-year-old Holocaust survivor, won a landmark ruling against El Al. The Israeli judge hearing the case said that “under absolutely no circumstances can a crew member ask a passenger to move from their designated seat because the adjacent passenger doesn’t want to sit next to them due to their gender”.At the time, IRAC said almost 7,500 emails had been sent to El Al by members of the public objecting to requests made to female passengers to change seats."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a89ecfd049e2eb97befaad517580fdee863bb1c9/99_151_5901_3540/master/5901.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f073a82a50827bc116dc40f6f383364","title":"eat out to help out fuels uk economic recovery in august covid 19","story":" analysis shows pace of job cuts on back of Covid-19 crisis remains the concernBritain’s economic recovery from Covid-19 gathered pace in the past month, fuelled by consumer spending and people taking advantage of the government’s “eat out to help out” scheme, despite fears mounting over rapid growth in unemployment.On the ’s latest monthly tracker of economic news since the pandemic spread to Britain this spring, the release of pent-up demand with the easing of lockdown is driving the sharpest rebound in economic growth among the G7 advanced economies, while retail spending has returned to pre-crisis levels.However, after the country plunged into the deepest recession on record in the three months to June, companies have started making job cuts at a faster pace than during the 2008 global financial crisis, with hundreds of thousands of redundancies announced in the past few weeks alone.Sounding the alarm as the UK government prepares to remove its furlough job retention scheme this autumn, Frances O’Grady, the director general of the TUC, warned that continued support would be required to avert a jobs catastrophe and long-term damage to the economy.Writing in the , she said: “Without urgent action we face the prospect of mass unemployment on a scale not seen since the 1980s.”Issuing an appeal to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, she said: “There is still time to stop mass unemployment. We worked together once before as this crisis began: I will work with you again if you are serious at stemming the haemorrhage of jobs.” has chosen eight economic indicators, as well as the level of the FTSE 100, to track the impact on jobs and growth from Covid-19 and the measures used to contain it. Faced with the deepest global recession since the 1930s Great Depression, the Covid Crisis watch will also monitor how the UK is faring compared with other countries.In the past month, private sector business activity has risen at the fastest pace in seven years as companies race to catch up on work put on hold during lockdown. The increase in demand for services and manufactured goods, which followed the easing of restrictions during the summer, sent the IHS Markit CIPS flash UK composite output index to 60.3 in August, up from 57 in July. On a scale where a figure above 50 indicates expansion, the latest figures suggest the UK is recovering faster than the US, China and the eurozone.In the deepest decline of any nation in the G7 and the EU, the slump was worsened by the later launch of lockdown and prolonged use of controls to limit the spread of the virus. In a reflection of the deeper downturn for Britain, non-essential shops were closed for just 50 days in Germany, compared with 84 days in the UK.Retail sales jumped above pre-pandemic levels in July during the first full month since the relaxation of restrictions, as shoppers gradually returned to the high street. The hospitality sector also received a shot in the arm from the “eat out to help out” scheme, with a Monday-to-Wednesday boom at restaurants, pubs and cafes in August. More than 64m discounted meals – the equivalent of one for almost every person in Britain – have been claimed by venues taking part in the scheme so far.However, significant pressure remains for firms, threatening a sharp increase in unemployment this autumn. Online spending remains higher than before the crisis struck, footfall remains down in several big cities amid the continued absence of office workers, and demand remains weak in certain sectors more reliant on social interaction or travel, such as entertainment, aviation and tourism.Millions of workers have been brought back from furlough as firms gradually reopen with physical distancing measures in place, with the total number of people on the government’s wage subsidy scheme down from a peak of about 9 million in May to about 4.5 million at the start of August.Despite the government scheme protecting millions of jobs, official figures show almost three-quarters of a million jobs have been shed from company payrolls since March. Economists say unemployment is set to more than double as the government rolls back the furlough scheme this autumn and as firms cut their costs amid weaker levels of demand while Covid-19 remains a risk to health.Warning that the crisis is far from over, O’Grady said employers would need continued government support to protect jobs and create new ones as the risks from the pandemic gradually recede.“Mass unemployment is not inevitable. If the government acts fast to keep people in work, our economy will recover faster and our country can build back better,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc8c86ed89994f6406fb538cb6b78de215d40002/0_161_4620_2772/master/4620.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=238646cc22659ffe12598e22e022ad8b","title":"from miyazaki to the matrix 10 of the best meals in movies","story":"Some of film’s most memorable moments revolve round food, from The Godfather Part II’s ominous family feast to Michael Caine’s six-egg omelette(Francis Ford Coppola, 1974)Food is always a portent of violence in the Godfather series – it’s no coincidence that Part II’s final scene is a meal, set before the events of the original film. The table is set for a family feast, laden with rustic Italian fare, but the cracks are already showing: we know by the end there will be two dead brothers, a dead father and a man who has lost his soul. The last shot, fittingly, is Michael, now alone among the antipasto.(Yasujirō Ozu, 1952)Ozu’s drama of marital tensions resolves itself in one of the final scenes, where the bickering wealthy couple Taeko and Mokichi come together to make the film’s titular dish, ochazuke, from fridge-cold rice and pickles. “How silly I was,” Taeko says, apologising for her snobbishness about the way her husband eats.(Hayao Miyazaki, 1986)Meals always have a grounding effect in fantasy, a moment of respite before the heavy stuff kicks in. It is the same in Hayao Miyazaki’s steampunkish fantasy-adventure, in which a ragtag bunch of sky pirates are momentarily silenced before a dangerous mission by a burbling cauldron of nimono (beef stew with winter vegetables).(Satyajit Ray, 1969)Satyajit Ray’s first foray into fantasy, comedy and children’s films alike, Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne follows the titular characters as they are granted three boons by the king of the ghosts. Being hungry, their first wish is for unlimited food, which materialises out of nothing in perfectly arranged thalis reflecting Bengali desires: fish from the Ganges, huge rasgulla dumplings and ripe Himsagar mangoes.(Luis Buñuel, 1972)If Buñuel was alive he’d be making satires about Michelin-starred restaurants, such was his obsession with the politics of food. The film is nothing but a series of meals that are continually disrupted, ending with a militia gunning down the last member of the group as his arm reaches for a hunk of meat from under the table.(Aki Kaurismäki, 2017)Kaurismäki’s comedy features some of the most disgusting sushi on film. When the film’s protagonist decides to open his restaurant as a sushi bar, his sous-chef forgets to buy enough fish. An order for 20 nigiri platters provokes a fridge raid, leading to an open bucket of salted herring and a shovel’s worth of wasabi.(Sidney J Furie, 1965)“You also like books, music ... cooking,” Sue Lloyd’s spy tells Michael Caine’s civil servant Harry Palmer, summarising what will make it into the report she’s gleaned from breaking into his house. “I like birds best,” Palmer replies, before seducing her with a six-egg omelette, some uneven knife-work and an accomplished one-handed egg-cracking technique.(Matt Mahurin, 2004)A study of irascible restaurateur Kenny Shopsin, this lo-fi doc is worth watching for the dizzying variety of unhealthy meals and improvised cooking techniques. “Watch this,” Shopsin boasts, as he heats his spatula directly on the flame before using it to caramelise the sugar on a row of pancakes.(Jacques Tati, 1967)Less a scene and more an unfolding disaster, the Royal Garden segment of Playtime is a testament to Jacques Tati’s control of space and staging. Over 48 minutes, the opening night of a restaurant descends into farce as the modernist architecture, chairs, uniforms and even the food starts to unravel.(Lana and Lilly Wachowski, 1999)Judas betrayed Jesus for thirty pieces of silver, but in the Wachowskis’ biblical allegory Cypher does it for a fillet steak. The shot concentrates on a wobbling, blushingly rare slice, impaled on Cipher’s fork as he describes the taste sensations he knows are completely artificial but somehow more real than his regular plate of gruel.

So why do some authors get the big bucks and some have to settle for the crumbs?When Charles Webb, who died earlier this year, sold the movie rights to his 1963 novel The Graduate for $20,000, it earned him a place in one newspaper’s list of “the world’s biggest mugs”. (Mike Nichols’ 1967 film version grossed more than $100m.) Where does that leave Joanne Harris, who admitted this week that she let Chocolat go for £5,000? Presumably, she would be excused “mug” status by virtue of having also negotiated a £100,000 cut of the film’s box office. Even so, flogging Chocolat so cheaply surely qualifies it as the Milk Tray, rather than the Amedei Porcelana, of movie-rights deals.The promise of wealth from film and television is the pot of gold at the end of the publishing rainbow. There is the $5m that EL James pocketed for selling the screen rights to the Fifty Shades trilogy and the $1.3m that JK Rowling got for the first four Harry Potter books alone. Dan Brown received $6m for allowing The Da Vinci Code to be adapted, while John Grisham landed a $3.75m Hollywood deal in 1993 for The Chamber when it was still at outline stage – the most ever paid at that time for anything scribbled on the back of an envelope.More common are those tales of writers whose work takes an interminable time to reach the screen – Caren Lissner, for instance, whose book Carrie Pilby was optioned on several occasions between publication in 2003 and the film’s production in 2016 – or those that never get greenlit at all.How realistic is it for writers to get rich from selling adaptation rights? “It’s just not,” says Joanna Nadin, whose YA novel Joe All Alone was adapted into a Bafta-winning 2018 television series. “It’s unrealistic to think any aspect of writing can make you rich.” Nadin confesses that she gets dollar signs in her eyes when she learns that a book of hers has been optioned. “For about 10 minutes, I revamp my Oscar acceptance speech, choose my mansion and dine out on imaginary caviar. Then I try not to think about it, knowing that, if anything happens, it won’t be for many years.”Joe All Alone was optioned in 2013, before publication. “It wasn’t big money,” she says. “Less than £5,000. Even though it won a Bafta and got nominated for an Emmy, there was still no life-changing moment. I got some extra payments for each episode so my mortgage was covered for a few months. And I did buy a new dress for the Baftas, then promptly fell over and couldn’t walk, and so missed the whole thing.”Another novelist, CJ Skuse, is about to have her thriller Sweetpea, which she describes as “Bridget Jones meets Dexter”, adapted by Kirstie Swain (who wrote the mental health comedy Pure) as a series for Sky Atlantic. “I thought my first book would get sold to film or TV,” says Skuse, who also works as a lecturer. “But it was my sixth that did the trick. The option on Sweetpea has been renewed a couple of times, which has allowed me to get a loan on a new house – I couldn’t have done that without it and wouldn’t have risked it had the TV option not been in place.”She says that money played no part in the elation she felt once she realised Sweetpea would be made. “It was the recognition I fell in love with. Someone had finally said to me the words I’d wanted to hear for a really long time: ‘You’ve written something incredible, and we want to make your dream come true and put it on TV.’” Not that the cash isn’t welcome. “I am treating myself to a bit of garden design because my back garden makes the Somme look inviting.”Charles Webb would have scoffed. “When you run out of money, it’s a purifying experience,” said the man who gave away every cent he earned from The Graduate, preferring to live on the breadline. After moving to Brighton and selling the film rights to his 2001 novel New Cardiff (filmed as Hope Springs), he used that £10,000 to establish the Creative Minority award. It was won by the artist Dan Shelton, who spent the prize money on mailing himself to Tate Britain in a box. The cheque, in a very real sense, was in the post."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f5d170dd6e0099d74abfa477779a4ca12ee3703/0_1_2349_1411/master/2349.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=e98954443d4cad324f73cdc9afd0cc9a","title":"kim joys recipe for vegan chocolate cake and mousse terrarium","story":"Let your imagination run wild and dazzle your guests with this perfect party centrepieceThis dessert is perfect for a special meal – dazzle your diners with a large terrarium, or you can make mini inidual ones.

Or you can just use shop-bought edible rocks)150g water140g caster sugar2g agar agar powderIf you want to use jelly rocks, make them first. Add the water, sugar and agar agar powder to a pan. Heat over a medium heat and stir intermittently, until the agar agar and sugar have dissolved. Then turn the heat up to high until the mixture is bubbling. Keep it boiling for three minutes.Remove from the heat and pour into a wide, shallow dish. Immediately use a toothpick to add blobs of food dye. You can use multiple colours. Spread and swirl the food dye through the mixture. Then chill in the fridge until completely set.Once set, run a knife around the edges and then turn out on to a chopping board. Use a knife to carve the jelly into rock or crystal shapes. Then place on greaseproof paper and leave at room temperature, exposed to the air. In a couple of days, the jelly will become hard and crunchy on the outside – at this point, turn the rocks over so that the other side is exposed to the air and leave to dry again. Once hardened and crystallised, they are ready to use.Next make the chocolate mousse. Place the chocolate, coconut cream and vanilla bean paste in a heat-proof bowl placed over a pan of simmering water. Stir until the chocolate has melted and the mixture is smooth. Set aside to cool.When this ganache has cooled to room temperature, pour the aquafaba into a bowl, and whisk until frothy. Add the cream of tartar and whisk again. Then add the sugar, one spoonful at a time, whisking well after each addition. Continue until the mixture has reached stiff peaks.Add a quarter of the aquafaba mixture to the ganache, and fold until combined. Add the rest in two more batches, gently folding after each addition to avoid knocking out too much air. The mousse will deflate a little, but you don’t want it completely flat.Pour the mousse into the glass bowl you want to serve your dessert in. Or you can ide it between smaller glass jars for inidual portions. Place in the fridge and leave for at least five hours until set.Meanwhile, make the chocolate cake. Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)400Fgas mark 6. Grease and line the base of an 18cm cake tin.Add the sugars, butter, soy milk and a pinch of salt to a pan. Heat and stir intermittently until the sugar has dissolved and the butter is melted. Remove from the heat and add the vanilla bean paste along with the vinegar or lemon juice. Leave to cool for 10 minutes.Sift together the flour, bicarbonate of soda and cocoa powder. Whisk to combine. Once cooled for 10 minutes, pour the liquid mixture over the dry, and then immediately whisk until smooth. Pour into the prepared cake tin, and bake for about 20 minutes. A skewer should come out clean when the cake is done. Leave to cool in the tin for 10 minutes, and then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.Then start making the plants using fondant. You can use plunger cutters to stamp out different sizes of the same-shaped flower, then stack them together and curve the edges upwards to make a succulent shape. You can also cut various shapes to create some taller plants. To make the strawberry mushroom, just cut off the stem top of a strawberry and then arrange it on top of a piece of fondant for the mushroom base. You can also use meringue instead of fondant if you have the time.When the cake is cool, use cutters to stamp out pieces of cake, and then use a knife to carve into the cake. Arrange larger cake pieces and crumbled cake on top of the chilled mousse to create a landscape.To create the green “moss” place some pale-coloured biscuits into a sandwich bag, seal and bash with a rolling pin until they’re crumbs. Then add a blob of green food dye, close the bag again and use your fingers on the outside of the bag to rub the dye evenly throughout.For the final decorating touches, sprinkle the green biscuit crumbs over the cake, then decorate with edible rocks, edible jelly rocks (optional), fondant plants, the strawberry mushroom, and dinosaur biscuits (optional).

There are a lot of hurdles still to overcome if it is to happen, including a legal battle between two sides who believe he should be allowed to leave Barcelona either for nothing or for €700m but it seems clear he wants a move and that in Pep Guardiola Manchester City have the manager best placed to sign him.A week ago I wrote a column wondering what City could expect Guardiola to deliver for them, given his repeated failures in the Champions League. Messi would be the most emphatic answer to that question: a goal, assist and marketing machine who even at 33 could make a massive impact on the Premier League.Just as I’m sure that over the years Barcelona’s sponsors have paid more for the opportunity to associate themselves with Messi, the move would revolutionise City’s marketing operation. But beyond that, interest in an already massively popular league would rocket. Once fans are allowed back into stadiums, tickets for all 20 clubs would become harder to get hold of.Even if it wouldn’t exactly help their chances of winning trophies, every team could benefit commercially from the Messi transfer. When you consider not just the trophies he has helped Barcelona to win over the years but the number of replica kits he must shift and the number of tourists who are attracted to Camp Nou by the prospect of seeing him in action, you can understand Barcelona’s desperation to keep him. But I don’t think it is ever a good idea to force a player to stay when they are determined to go, even one of Messi’s stature.I remember going to see him play at Camp Nou in 2015 and it is only when you see him in action that you appreciate how little he sometimes moves. He comes alive in the key moments and in key areas but he is not a player who does a lot of running around.In the year I saw him Barcelona won the league and the Champions League, so I can’t imagine how he’d play if he’s actually not bothered and downs tools in protest against Barcelona forcing him to stay.Messi is human like everybody else and sometimes in their working lives people feel they need a change. It is not as if he just woke up one morning and decided to go.In my experience with contracts and in my current job as a sporting director, players and agents push for clauses that indicate their concerns. For example, international players do not always want to commit long term to a club that is not yet established, because they don’t know how competitive the team will be.Good contracts prepare for future eventualities, protecting the players’ careers and doing everything possible to guarantee their happiness. Messi is no different. He wants to enjoy playing and he wants to win major trophies and at Barcelona neither thing is happening.I can understand the appeal of a move to Manchester City. Of course he would be reunited with Guardiola and a handful of other staff members who worked with him at Barcelona. As a player I understand the drive to test yourself in another league and if he can come into a side who have had domestic success but struggled in Europe and guide them to victory in the Champions League, he would officially be the difference. It would add another layer to his legend, just like Cristiano Ronaldo has added to his at Juventus.If reports that Barcelona pay him £95m a year in salary and bonuses are true, clearly Messi has not stayed at the club for 20 years out of loyalty alone.But I hope Barcelona choose to respect his service, and negotiate a mutually acceptable deal to let him move on, rather than forcing him through a legal battle and removing his right to choose a new direction at this stage of his career.There is not a lot of room for sentiment in the law but the problem goes beyond money, it’s about respect for who he is and what he has given them.The fact he wants to go is an indictment of the way the club has been run in recent seasons – Messi, who in the three seasons since 2017 has scored 95 league goals and created another 47, really isn’t the person to blame for this situation.Barcelona’s fear will be that losing Messi will be a sporting and financial calamity but they could see this moment as an opportunity to refresh and renew a team who already needed major surgery. The £95m a year that would no longer be going to the Argentinian, as well as any transfer fee they end up getting for him, can help to fund that process.They already have some good young players and if it was me I would focus on the next generation and give the club’s fans something new to get excited about. Replacing Messi is an impossible job but you can build a team of talented young players who value every second of playing for Barcelona.They should be putting all their efforts into making that happen, instead of using the law to tie one of the club’s and the game’s all-time greats to a contract he has no desire to see out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03b35c41d63625c1535923fee41c3bae2a9467ab/1816_746_1684_1011/master/1684.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d726c05ad4582ec848eddd15be792b22","title":"boss vows to tackle misconduct claims at un green climate fund","story":"Yannick Glemarec responds to FT report of 40 complaints including racism and sexismThe head of the UN’s climate finance body has pledged to tackle complaints of misconduct at the organisation “as a matter of urgency”, after such claims against unidentified staff members were published.Yannick Glemarec, the executive director of the Green Climate Fund, told the : “We need to continue working on building the culture of the organisation. Trust is key for our organisation.”Glemarec was responding to a report in the Financial Times that there had been 40 complaints to the GCF’s independent integrity unit last year. The FT published no details (£) on Thursday of the alleged misconduct at the 330-strong headquarters in South Korea, but claimed the complaints included an unspecified number about racism, sexism and harassment.Glemarec said there was a high number of complaints – up from 21 the previous year – because the unit dealt with a wide range of minor issues regarding staff discipline and personnel, and not just misconduct complaints. Only one complaint in 2018 and one in 2019 were upheld.He said one reason why issues of varying degrees of seriousness were lumped together was because the GCF was a young organisation. Glemarec, who took up his post in April 2019, said the process would be streamlined in future.He held an online forum for all staff in which they could ask questions and raise concerns about the issues alleged by the FT, and has promised training for managers on the organisation’s values.The fund, which has a climate finance portfolio of £6.2bn invested, was set up after the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009, at which developed countries pledged that by 2020 at least $100bn a year of public and private finance would flow to developing nations to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of the climate crisis.Glemarec said the GCF would focus on the UN’s forthcoming climate summit, called Cop26 and postponed by a year to next November because of the coronavirus crisis. While renewable energy projects were increasingly attractive to private investors as the costs tumbled, he said, there was a role for government-funded investment in areas where there was no clear financial return, such as protecting the poor and vulnerable from the impacts of extreme weather and global heating.The GCF board recently approved $879m of funding to projects around the world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd7361f54be9f9ee710d9b65671297a4a669d33a/528_91_2141_1285/master/2141.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0c0cd60058a120219dd3e254145b00a","title":"covid 19 turns tide on indias ganesh festival traditions","story":"Thousands of ritual statues are dunked into the sea off Mumbai each year – but coronavirus and pollution concerns are forcing change by Gautam Doshi in MumbaiIn the quiet housing estate of Angrewadi in the heart of Girgaon in south Mumbai, people are celebrating the 100th consecutive year of the Ganesh Chaturthi, the Hindu festival of the elephant-headed god of new beginnings. Statues of Lord Ganesh are brought into homes and put on display for offerings and prayers.On the 11th and final day of the festival, the ritual of Ganesh Visarjan takes place – falling this year on 1 September. The statues, normally made of soluble plaster of paris, are traditionally carried in a public procession with music and chanting, and are then immersed in either a river or the sea. Here, they slowly dissolve in a ceremony that dramatises the Hindu view of the ephemeral nature of life – but also causes widespread pollution.In Mumbai alone, around 150,000 statues are immersed each year.Angrewadiresidents normally head to  Girgaon Chowpatty beach, just over a mile away. Most statues from south Mumbai are submerged in these waters, including one particularly revered idol, Lalbaugcha Raja, which stands over six metres tall.But not this year.In Mumbai – one of the Indian cities most affected by coronavirus – devotees are not heading for the beach this year. Instead, Mumbai’s ngoverning body, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), has installed more than 200 artificial ponds across the city so that the tradition may be upheld while preventing large crowds gathering. Environmentalists hope these ponds, which will reduce pollution, will become a permanent fixture “We will be immersing our eco-friendly idol in a small aluminium tub this year,” says DV Kulkarni, head of Angrewadi’s event-organising committee.Devotees will not be allowed to go near the new ponds, but will instead hand over their statues to workers who will immerse them as the owners watch from a distance.The BMC – which has limited the size of the religious statues to a maximum of 1.2 metres this year – has also arranged for pick-up trucks to collect statues from people who do not want to leave their homes. Those who still want to use the sea will need to seek approval online and book a time slot. The same regulations will apply to some of the new ponds. Traditionally, most statues are dropped into the Arabian Sea, leaking chemicals into the marine ecosystem along Mumbai’s coast. Varying in size, from just a few centimetres to up to 20 metres, most of the idols are made of non-biodegradable plaster, which can take years to dissolve.Paints and materials containing lead, mercury, chromium and other harmful substances are used to colour and decorate the statues, and thousands of garlands of plastic flowers are thrown into the sea with them. Indranil Sengupta and Rabia Tewari launched the Mahim Beach Clean Up campaign in Mumbai in 2017. They say the ritual causes great marine damage.After last year’s festival, says Tewari, the impact on marine life was immediate. “The tide was low, and several idols were still on the beach . We could also see plenty of dead fish around. We were so disappointed to see it.“The seepage of harmful substances is also biomagnified in marine life, which indirectly harms humans too,” says Debi Goenka, executive trustee of Conservation Action Trust in Mumbai.The rise in use of eco-friendly idols, made from clay, is starting to have a positive impact on water pollution. According to reports by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, the water quality indexat Girgaon Chowpatty beach has improved from 49.77 (out of a maximum of 100) in September 2016, to 64.19 in September 2019. September is the month when the festival ends and when pollution peaks. But the improvement has come at a cost to local businesses.Using clay to make the statues is much more time-consuming and expensive, taking up to six days to complete, whereas a plaster idol, made in a cast, takes less than a day to produce.The festival is extremely popular in Mumbai and throughout the state of Maharashtra.“Apart from immersing our idol, we mainly go to the beach to just soak in the electric atmosphere of the processions, crowds, and the views of other majestic idols. It’s a wonderful feeling and is one of our main festivals,” says Kulkarni.“People have been very receptive and welcoming of the idea of artificial ponds since last year, as there is a lot of awareness of the real damage to the sea after Visarjan,” says Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of Dadar-Mahim area in Mumbai.“Last year, we collected and recycled around 9,000 idols made of plaster of paris, where they were put in cement silos. But there are still religious concerns with this, and we have to work to find out a sustainable solution. Our main aim this year is to avoid large gatherings. Going forward, we are moving towards utilising environment-friendly solutions such as artificial ponds.”The processions, celebrations, and rituals may resume post-Covid-19, but both authorities and citizens are edging slowly towards lessening the impact on fragile marine ecosystems in the Mumbai area."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27413d0b29ebb72e20159ce195b078a9d3f90b83/0_1368_3968_2380/master/3968.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e0d51f858a56c1fb69eacfc091252ca","title":"love the flame not the fuel should you give up cooking with gas","story":"Beloved by chefs and home cooks alike, gas-burning stovetops come with drawbacks for human, financial and planetary healthNikki Phillips has made a living cooking in strangers’ kitchens. As the co-owner of a catering company, Shared Affair, she always makes a request before arriving at a client’s home. “I … ask for a picture of the stove, so I know what we’re dealing with.”If the photos show the clapped-out coils of an older electric stove, she goes straight to plan B. “I just bring gas burners with us. I don’t even bother.” Between portable stoves and hot box ovens “we can set up a kitchen inside the kitchen”.“Electric, I think, is rubbish. There’s no temperature control and no standard,” she says.Despite this, Phillips is no gas evangelist. In fact, she suggests “in an ideal world” most cooking would be electric – “it would be better for the environment”.A future without gas stoves is already looking likely for some Australians. In the Australian Capital Territory, plans are underway to phase out domestic gas use, and gas infrastructure is no longer required for new suburb developments.“The fact is, natural gas is a polluting fossil fuel and we must eventually phase it out in favour of clean energy,” says the ACT’s minister for climate change and sustainability, Shane Rattenbury. With uncertainty around gas prices, Rattenbury says the move “is also good for household bills”.Studies also suggest that cooking with gas may be immediately harmful for human health. Assoc Prof Luke Knibbs, of the University of Queensland’s school of public health, says “gas combustion – stovetop gas combustion – releases a range of different chemicals including nitrogen dioxide, formaldehyde and ultra-fine particles”.“Gas is the only form of cooking that’s widely used in Australia where you’re actually burning the fuel in the kitchen.”There are two options for those keen to phase gas out of their cooking, explains Fiona Mair, a test kitchen coordinator at consumer affairs group Choice. “You’ve got the induction cooktop, and you’ve also got the ceramic, which looks the same as an induction but it has got electrical coils.”Mair has been testing stovetops for 23 years and notes that in the past five years she has seen a significant improvement in ceramic electric cooktops. She says they “have improved with efficiency and heat-up times” and are now “just generally easier to use and clean”.While it’s necessary to use gas for commercial cooking, Phillips believes that “for a home cook, induction is actually the way to go”. She notes that induction heats food much faster than gas or electric stovetops – in fact, she uses a portable induction stovetop in her commercial kitchen for boiling water and making stock. Induction cooktops are also significantly easier to clean.Because induction cooking directly heats the pot or pan, rather than heating an element that then heats the bottom of the pan, Phillips says induction stovetops are also safer “because it never gets hot”.Mair says induction cooking can be more energy-efficient than ceramic stovetops because of the reduced cooking time. Choice tests have found “induction is the fastest to boil water with an average of two to three minutes where ceramic takes seven minutes”.There is a significant difference in price. “Induction is more expensive, definitely, but they’ve reduced in price and you can pick up a reasonable one for around $600 – but you can pay up to $4,000,” Mair says. “Ceramics are a reasonably priced cooktop, and we’ve found that over the testing they’re improving so much. They’re cooking well, they’re heating up faster. They’ve got more accuracy in settings and temperatures. I think you can pick one up for around $400 to $500.”In addition to costing more upfront, induction cooking also requires specialised pots and pans. “I’ve been to people’s houses and they’ve said, ‘My stove doesn’t work,’” says Phillips, but in reality “they don’t have the right pots”.To work on an induction stove, cookware must have a ferrous (iron containing) base that a magnet will stick to. Cast-iron pans work, but the light aluminium pans favoured by many chefs for their even cooking, affordable price and durability won’t work on induction stoves. That’s one of the reasons induction cooking is uncommon in commercial kitchens, says Phillips, “to change over all of our pots would be thousands of dollars”.If you have a gas stove in good working order and enjoy cooking with it, you should continue to do so. Felicity Wade, co-convenor of the Labor Environmental Action Network (Lean), says “it’s not preferable to throw out working appliances and most people can’t afford to do so”.Lean’s Victorian branch has begun a campaign to phase out gas appliances in homes, but Wade is quick to emphasise that this kind of transition is a process, that must be undertaken hand in hand with “good behavioural change policy” that makes switching easier. “There’s a lot of work we need to do before looking at … stoves,” she says. However, if you’re already considering purchasing a new stove, you “should consider doing the switch and governments should be providing incentives to do that switch”.If health concerns are the biggest factor in moving away from gas, Knibbs suggests that “people who have children at risk of asthma, or who have asthma, may want to consider alternate forms of energy”.He also says that a high-quality ducted range hood, that removes air to the outside, rather than recycling it, does a lot to mitigate the risks posed by gas cooking.For those who live in apartments where it isn’t possible to install this kind of range hood – or who simply cannot afford one – opening the windows whenever you cook is a good alternative. It is also worth noting that a good range hood is comparable in price to – and sometimes more than – a ceramic or cheaper induction stovetop.On top of that, there’s the precision in temperature control. “I can look at a big flame and know exactly how hot it will be,” says Phillips.Some cooking techniques, like flambéing, are much more difficult (though not impossible) on an electric stove. And Phillips says, “I don’t think you can replace the flavour of cooking over flame.”With those factors in mind, Mair and Phillips both suggest a flexitarian approach to gas cooking. “I always say to people, because I like gas, if you’re building a new kitchen … try and combine both,” Mair says. If you have one gas hob “you can cook that really good high heat stir-fry” but the rest of the time, you can use a more efficient induction hob.Phillips believes that, after an initial discovery period, most home cooks will get used to the stovetop they have, so a preference for gas shouldn’t dissuade people from switching. “A little Weber and induction” is what she’d recommend. “Or if you’re in an apartment and can’t have a barbecue, there are portable gas burners if you really want that open flame. That gives you the important cooking parts.”Knibbs says that cooking with gas outdoors, is “very much negligible risk” when it comes to the burning of the gas itself. “Just watch all the smoke coming off your outdoor cooking.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/766993759282157c3cf606898e0f71a24d45030a/1_0_4997_3000/master/4997.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e53eac8fc51144738db011c4b14e29b8","title":"share your experiences of returning to the office after lockdown coronavirus","story":"Whether you work in the UK or in Europe, we want to hear your views about going back to the workplace and commuting during the coronavirus pandemicWhile many people in countries like France, Germany, Italy and Spain have returned to the office, those in the UK have been slower to return to their desks.According to a survey by AlphaWise, only a third of British office workers have returned compared to almost three-quarters of staff in European countries.If you work in the UK or Europe, we would like to hear from workers about how they feel about going back to offices, and how your workplace has changed as a result of the pandemic.

I caught her on a campsite in Suffolk, in the pouring rain, camping gear strewn in the wind and children crying. Never again, she said. Yet my admittedly anecdotal poll of staycationers in Bournemouth to Broadstairs (my six brothers and sisters plus their families make up nearly a Gallup poll in themselves) tells me that the great unintended staycation summer went surprisingly well – until last week’s downpours, at least. This is what we learned.The weather is really not that bad Bournemouth’s packed beaches were perhaps the iconic seaside shot of the coronavirus summer, for good reasons and bad. On five consecutive weeks from mid-July, temperatures in the resort hit 24C, peaking at 33C in early August.Late August, in my own experience, has a habit of being a bit rubbish. It has long puzzled me why the British school holiday season runs from late July to early September, when the British summer, especially in the north and Scotland and Ireland, starts sometime in June and peters out in mid-August. All the staycationers agreed they would only book UK seaside holidays in July and early August. Don’t bother with the last few weeks.It’s not absurdly expensive to holiday in the UK It is commonplace to say that a week in Spain is cheaper than a week in Britain. It’s nonsense. There are few reliable figures on “average” holiday costs, although one breakdown of ONS figures suggests that the average holiday abroad in peak summer (including spending money) costs a UK family of four around £3,800. Separate figures from Expedia suggest that the average holiday taken by Brits abroad cost £855 per head, but only £535 in the UK, with travel, accommodation and spending money included.A budget of £2,000 buys a lot of holiday in the UK, if you book in advance. Availability at Center Parcs disappeared immediately lockdown ended, but book for next school summer holidays and it’s around £1,900 for a two-bed lodge.Post-Brexit sterling weakness means prices in many euro-area resorts are the same or higher than the UK, with the important exception of booze. Staycationers don’t just save on airfares but also airport parking, car hire on arrival and travel insurance. Those alone can set you back £300 or more. And there was no “eat out to help out” on the costas.But you can’t get a slot for the hotel pool Our own preference at staycation hotels this summer was for ones with an indoor pool in case the weather turned against us. What we didn’t plan for was getting in early to book a time slot. The hotels had sensibly set up booking systems to avoid overcrowding and meet Covid-19 restrictions. But rather like the sun loungers by the pool in Spain, towels strategically staked at dawn, other families always appeared to be ahead of us. And we couldn’t even blame the Germans.Breakfast table service is a post-Covid delight The breakfast buffet has been abandoned to protect us from the virus. In its place, most of us (OK, the slightly well-off sister who sniffs at anything less than four-star) got a breakfast menu, a waiter to take the order and service to the table. But this also meant no more sneaking out with a bag stuffed with free snacks for the beach. One hotel manager told me that while they had to employ more staff at breakfast, food waste was down enormously. I think he meant food theft.Staycationing is a plastic pollution nightmare At the Airbnb, the TV remote control was covered in a thick plastic sleeve. In the hotel bathroom, the glass for holding your shaver and toothbrush was replaced with a plastic cup, which fell over immediately anything was put in it. Almost every item at one hotel breakfast was inidually wrapped in plastic. Yes, it’s all because of coronavirus, and is probably the same abroad. But it somewhat cuts into your flygskam eco-smugness about not flying.Inidual hotel booking websites are now often cheaper than the likes of Booking Staycationing tends to mean self-booking of hotels and Airbnbs rather than buying package holidays. It is now evident that the early stranglehold over online reservations by the likes of Booking is waning. The hotels’ own websites have a host of “member exclusive rates” or “sign up and save” deals – which after a few clicks give you significant discounts. At every hotel I booked this summer, it was cheaper to go direct to their site rather than use the so-called deals on the aggregator sites. By all means, use them to get a sense of what’s generally on offer, then head to the hotel itself to get a cheaper price.Thanks for not making up my room We were warned on arrival that housekeeping would no longer clean every day because of coronavirus. This is a joy. No knock on the door while you’re in the shower, no embarrassment at how untidy you’ve left the room, no fiddling with hanging a piece of card on the door outside.But the fridges have gone.

She can go back to Finland and practise BLM as much as she likes and good riddance, but she can’t inflict her woke attitudes on us.”Stasevska said: “This false speculation has led to abuse and threats towards me and my family which is why I am speaking out. For the record, I have played no role in deciding the traditional elements of the programme, I recognise these are an important part of the event.“I’ve been wrongly portrayed as a person who tries to influence political debates – this is not true. I am an artist, I want to be able to speak through my work to bring people together and build solidarity.”The BBC released a statement saying that although it was fine to debate the artistic decisions it made during a pandemic, personal attacks on one of its artists - who, it clarified, did not make the decisions about the Proms – were unacceptable.A BBC spokesperson said: “We are very lucky to have a Proms at all this year and that is down to the artists that have made it possible. They should be praised. As we have always made clear, it is the BBC that is the decision maker. No one else. Hopefully we can all start focusing on the music which is about bringing us all together.”The BBC had earlier confirmed that both songs were to be performed as instrumentals, clarifying that the decision to exclude the lyrics was driven by physical distancing restrictions limiting the number of musicians in the Royal Albert Hall.The suggestion that the Proms’ running order could be changed, as it was in 2001 after the terrorist attacks on 11 September, quickly turned into a political storm. The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, said Rule Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory were highlights of the Last Night of the Proms and he had shared his concern about their possible removal with the BBC.Boris Johnson then called for an end to “cringing embarrassment” and “wetness” over the UK’s history after some suggested the songs were offensive because of their links to colonialism and empire.Stasevska, 35, became a lightning rod for much of the outcry but in her statement she said she still found the UK “an inspiring place to work”, praising the BBC and saying she remembered having fallen in love with London when she first visited the city.In an apparent attempt to draw a line under the matter, she said she did not intend to enter the public debate. “I am a professional musician with a fondness and respect for the UK,” she said. “I am very much looking forward to performing again with the fabulous musicians of the BBC Symphony Orchestra in what is sure to be a memorable event in September.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4456bf15a7b79c255cd664a988e806b14bc2ad85/837_578_4137_2482/master/4137.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=42d9e8c372f11ed50ba6d0cabd02303a","title":"ed davey entirely inconsequential victory speech quintessential lib dem event","story":"New Lib Dem leader offers no great vision, no plans for alliances ... nothing much at allMaybe a cardiograph could have picked up a hint of a heartbeat, but to the untrained eye the Lib Dem leadership contest appeared to have been flatlining almost from the start. It’s not as if the Lib Dems don’t try to provide excitement – this was the fourth leadership election in five years. And some of the party’s core membership might have picked up on fractious areas of dissent between Ed Davey and Layla Moran – at least 87 people tuned into one YouTube hustings – but the rest of us were either totally unaware the contest was taking place or just didn’t care one way or the other.But all good things – and, indeed, all relatively indifferent things – must come to an end and in an online announcement shortly after 11.30 by the Lib Dem president, Mark Pack, it was revealed that Ed Davey was the winner. The same Ed Davey who had come a distant second to Jo Swinson last time round. The same Jo Swinson who had gone on both to lose her seat and all but obliterate the party in the polls in December’s election after insisting she was a genuine contender to become prime minister. Voters may be a bit dim at times, but not that dim.Prior to the declaration, the Lib Dems had tried to inject a little excitement into proceedings by insisting that the vote had been incredibly tight, but Davey romped home by 45,756 to 24,564. Moran hadn’t even bothered to turn up to the result with a victory speech prepared just in case. Their only exchange appeared to be one rather awkward, and not entirely socially distanced, handshake at the very end. Though by then someone had switched the lights off and it wasn’t easy to see who was doing what to whom. Still, you had to admire the commitment to the environment.Davey strode to the podium wearing a black face mask, which he removed before speaking. He began by thanking Moran for the way she had fought the campaign, for inspiring the youth vote – though, luckily for him, in insufficient numbers – and reassuring her that she had an important role to play in the future. Which, given that there are just 11 Lib Dem MPs, including Davey and Moran, felt like the least he could do. When it comes to a Lib Dem shadow cabinet, everyone is included.This was the highlight of his last 30 years – it takes all sorts – and he was proud to say he loved the party. “I believe in it,” he said. “But it is time to wake up and smell the coffee.” One could argue that moment had come five years ago when it was hammered by voters for its role in the coalition government, but no one wanted to spoil the moment. Davey also referred to the last three elections in which its results had been “disappointing”. Disappointing as in completely catastrophic.“It’s time to listen,” he continued. “And I am listening now. Whether you are from the north or the south of somewhere in between. Whether you are a brexiteer or remainer, I will travel up and down the country to meet you.” The thought did occur that it might have been better if he had decided to do a bit of listening a while ago. After all, he was the cabinet member in the coalition government who had voted both for austerity measures and tuition fees. A bit of listening to potential Lib Dem voters back then could have made all the difference. Indeed, it was hard to wonder if Davey wasn’t still part of the problem, rather than the solution. Though more that 42,000 party members had thought otherwise.And that was about it. There was no great vision for the future of the Lib Dems. No hint as to whether Davey would be working with Labour and the SNP to fight the increasingly illiberal policies of the Boris Johnson government. No hint of how he would stop those unhappy few who had voted Lib Dem last time because they couldn’t stomach Jeremy Corbyn from drifting back to Labour now Keir Starmer was in charge. No hint of anything very much.All of which made it more or less the quintessential Lib Dem event. Thoroughly niche and almost entirely inconsequential. Quite where the party goes from here is anyone’s guess.

The 2018 US Open champion’s match against Elise Mertens was scheduled to be played on Thursday until Osaka joined strikes by players from the NBA, WNBA, MLS following the shooting of Jacob Blake by police in Kenosha.The tournament later responded to Osaka’s announcement with a significant concession by “pausing tournament play” and rescheduling all of its matches, including the men’s and women’s semi-finals, for Friday. Caught up in the shuffle was the men’s world No 1, Novak Djokovic, who was due to face Roberto Bautista Agut in the semi-finals.After Osaka informed the WTA of her imminent announcement, she and her team had numerous meetings which included the WTA chief executive officer, Steve Simon, and the interim Western \u0026amp Southern Open CEO, Wayne Richmond, and even the ATP. They spoke about the possibility of her returning to compete on Friday. Despite remaining more than happy to not compete, she deemed the concessions from the tournament sufficient and she decided that her presence would allow her to further underline her statement on Wednesday.“As you know, I pulled out of the tournament yesterday in support of racial injustice and continued police violence. I was (and am) ready and prepared to concede the match to my opponent,” Osaka said in a statement to the .“However, after my announcement and lengthy consultation with the WTA and USTA, I have agreed at their request to play on Friday. They offered to postpone all matches until Friday and in my mind that brings more attention to the movement. I want to thank the WTA and the tournament for their support.”The past six months of Osaka’s life have been building steadily to this. She spent much of her time away from tennis exploring her life beyond the court. She flew to Minneapolis and protested in pursuit of justice for George Floyd. She later wrote an op-ed in Esquire, affirming her commitment to fight racism and support the movement to defund the police. She had started off the tour suspension by vowing to shed her shyness, yet she returned to the sport having found her voice in ways she could have never imagined.However, on Wednesday, like the Milwaukee Bucks, the WNBA activists and those involved in the extraordinary cascade of cancellations that followed, Osaka came to the conclusion that words were not enough. Osaka’s decision was particularly impressive because it was a singular choice: in an inidual sport such as tennis, the top players are alone on their own island. There are no teammates to collectively debate each decision, the people who support her are technically her employees and she is in sole control of her own destiny. That in isolation seems overwhelming.It was also a rare example of actionable activism from a tennis player, and numerous players have since publicly backed her. The former world No 3 Milos Raonic, who had been in the midst of a gruelling three-set win against Filip Krajinovic during Osaka’s announcement, had to be talked through the events during his post-match press conference. Without a moment of hesitation, he supported her.“I think having a sign somewhere of support, banners at a tournament or wearing a shirt in a warmup in a NBA game, it can only do so much,” he said. “I think real disruption and, you know, I think that’s what makes change. I think a lot of real disruption is caused by affecting people in a monetary way, and that can force some kind of change.”Earlier in the week, as Osaka returned to competition for the first time in six months and narrated her time away, she was asked how it feels to be named the highest-earning female athlete of all time. She pointed out that her goal had only ever been to earn enough for her family. Then she shrugged: “It’s a bit weird, because I feel like people are looking at me differently now. I don’t know. I mean, I’m weird, right? It’s kind of a fact. So people were always looking at me differently. But now people are just kind of looking, looking. It’s a different vibe.”Though she was aware of the eyes on her, Osaka still wasn’t quite aware of the power she wields until Wednesday. As she registered her refusal to take to the court on social media, in her statement she noted her uncertainty about the effect it would actually have: “I don’t expect anything drastic to happen with me not playing, but if I can get a conversation started in a majority white sport I consider that a step in the right direction.”The response was more than a conversation and now she is reacting again. Had Osaka decided not to compete, there is the feeling the tournament would have eventually moved on as tennis always does, just one fewer match on the order of play. But people were already watching Osaka closely, and on Friday when she returns to the court, even more will."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82727e8631716a48d7c3c9665b41ddaf34cf6e24/160_333_4320_2593/master/4320.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=4f0d85f8e34ecb20c110cf4543ecf2a5","title":"talking horse racing no picnic cash bets returns doncaster st leger","story":"Around 24,000 spectators are expected at Doncaster festival in a pilot event that the entire industry will be closely watchingBusiness is expected to be brisk at 9am on Friday morning when tickets go on sale for Doncaster’s St Leger Festival from 9 to 12 September – the first race meeting with paying spectators for nearly six months. In all, around 24,000 spectators are expected over the four-day festival, fewer than half of the 54,000 who attended 12 months ago, and while many fans will just be happy to get back on a track, it promises to be far removed from the familiar race day experience.Like Goodwood, where a proposed pilot with 5,000 spectators was cancelled at the last minute earlier this month, racegoers at Doncaster next month will be allocated a zone at the track and must not stray beyond its boundaries, to reduce the opportunities for spectators to mingle.Unlike Goodwood, which had planned to use up to seven zones for the paying public, Doncaster will have just two main areas for racegoers, in addition to hospitality areas and boxes which will be open but with reduced capacity. One zone will be on and around the ‘champagne lawn’ just past the winning post, with the other in the centre of the course.Racegoers will be required to accept a Code of Conduct in order to buy tickets, which will be issued as e-tickets only, and they will be automatically registered for the government’s Trace and Trace scheme as they do so. Spectators in different zones will enter and exit the track at different times, but face coverings will be required only when using indoor facilities such as toilets and the track’s indoor betting hall.On the subject of betting, bookmakers will be in attendance and while the number has yet to be finalised, the expectation at present is that they will be allowed to accept cash bets. This will come as a considerable relief to the layers, who had warned of chaos, both in accepting bets and paying out, if they were required to process all their business via contactless terminals.No picnics will be allowed – in fact, no food or drink of any kind can be taken into the track – and under-18s will also be barred on all days, including Saturday. The normal dress code, however, will be maintained: collar-and-tie for gentlemen, “smart dress” for ladies and, of course, a face covering close at hand for everyone.Doncaster has spent the last 24 hours since the pilot was announced contacting all customers who had already bought tickets for the meeting, establishing whether they still wanted to attend and in which zone, and offering refunds or a switch to next year’s Leger Festival for those who did not.All remaining tickets – up to a total of 3,640 on 9 September and 6,200 on the next three days, will be available both online and over the phone from 9am. It will be surprising – and disappointing – if these do not sell out rapidly.All four days at Doncaster will be closely watched throughout an industry that has seen many millions of pounds in race day revenue wiped out entirely since mid-March. If the government’s target of a more general return of spectators from 1 October is to be realised, the pilot days need to prove that socially-distanced racing is workable and that will place a burden of trust on all fans in attendance.Goodwood planned to admit 5,000 of its annual members and guests on a Sussex hilltop, three miles from the nearest town. Doncaster, which is a 15-minute walk from the centre of town, will be selling tickets more generally and to a younger crowd.Social distancing is harder to maintain with alcohol involved, so the track will have “social distancing officers” in all areas “to assist customers in meeting the requirements of the Code of Conduct”. Transgressors will be “reminded of their obligations while on site”, but “continued breaking of the Code of Conduct could unfortunately lead to expulsion from the racecourse” – an ultimate sanction that will hopefully keep everyone on their best behaviour as racing’s essential live audience returns."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b81fffcae6fb32570cb76fca0709d694ff3f2a4/0_169_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92ec68bda254f1de9a6c6bd860f28968","title":"cinderella review vintage fairytale birmingham royal ballet","story":"Available online The familiar story of transformation, in the company’s 2010 production, is given a free video outing two months before a new live ballet is set to debutWhen Carlos Acosta took over as artistic director at Birmingham Royal Ballet in January, this was not the inaugural year he had in mind. Acosta’s troupe is set to be the first UK ballet company to stage a live performance post-lockdown, with a premiere in October. In the meantime, however, there is a chance to watch something from the archive, David Bintley’s Cinderella from 2010.While Acosta plans to drive his company forward into fresh territory, this is very much the BRB of old, a familiar treatment of a well-known story, Bintley’s skilful but safe choreography, and long-time (now retired) principals Elisha Willis and Iain Mackay in the leads. There’s nothing wrong with all that, of course. We could all do with some fairytale escapism right now, and there’s magic here, especially in designer John Macfarlane’s backdrops of star-strewn solar systems – when Cinderella makes her arresting entrance at the ball it’s as if she has descended from the heavens.Before that, banished to the cold, grey cellar kitchen, Willis’s Cinders lives a grim existence, yet she emanates light and sweetness despite it all. Barefoot, dancing with the childlike spirit of one carried away by the music, while being utterly on top of the choreography’s technical demands, Willis shows us Cinderella retreating into her imagination, living a fantasy life in parallel with the drudgery.Cinderella’s radiant transformation is a magnet to Mackay’s capably dashing prince. Their initial connection is less a personal, emotional one, more like looking in a mirror and seeing your own shining perfection reflected back at you, but their third-act reunion brings more sensitivity. There’s fine dancing and broad caricature from the supporting cast – although this is far from the most OTT Cinderella out there. The ugly sisters, Skinny and Dumpy? Well, you’ve seen this bad-dancing shtick before – and nobody did it better than French and Saunders – but Marion Tait’s stepmother is deliciously sour, her face permanently pinched and pursed. Plus there are dancing mice, frogs and lizards, and Prokofiev’s fantastic score, related in many ways to his masterpiece Romeo and Juliet, packed with melody, character and the occasional ominous undertow. Ultimately there’s nothing surprising or unsettling here, which may be exactly the right prescription."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14500eff7817d0a1790fabbb263b511c9570f37b/0_70_5160_3099/master/5160.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9180d276d77cd1df906eaa9a859687fd","title":"google and apple to roll out phase two of contact tracing system","story":"Operating system update will allow opt-in to coronavirus exposure notifications without need of an appApple and Google are preparing to roll out phase two of their Covid-19 contact-tracing system, allowing users to receive notifications about their exposure to infectious people without needing to install a specific app.But the system will still not fully work in Britain until the UK government releases its own contact-tracing app – currently being trialled in the Isle of Wight and the London borough of Newham – nationally.The basics of the “exposure notification” system were built into iPhones and Android devices in May. Users who have downloaded an app made by a public health authority can opt in to a decentralised tracking system. Their phones record details of other devices they have been near, and if one of those users later marks themselves as infectious, exposed iniduals receive a notification.Until now, Apple and Google have required users to download an app made by a recognised public health authority to enable the exposure notification system. That has prevented UK residents from using the service, unless they installed a contact tracing-app from another country, such as Ireland or Germany whose apps were available in UK app stores. Even then, they could only use the app passively, since both foreign apps require a diagnosis from their respective health services to mark oneself as infectious.When new versions of iOS and Android are made available, which is expected in the next two weeks, users will be able to join an exposure notification system without needing to download any app at all. They will, however, still need a recognised app to mark themselves as infectious, putting extra pressure on the UK government to move its own app out of beta testing and make it available for general release.But the pressure has diminished in recent months owing to the poor performance of contact-tracing systems in other nations. In June the French government revealed that its contact-tracing app had sent just 14 notifications in its first three weeks of operation, with only 68 people entering a positive test result, despite 2 million downloads.The country was hampered by comparatively low uptake, which the new Apple and Google system is intended to overcome. But in Germany, which uses that system, more than 16 million people have installed the app and only 500 have marked themselves as positive. Worse, the extra privacy built in to Apple and Google’s system means the German institute of public health has no further information on efficacy, because it is unable to collect data about how many users were warned.Following the release of iOS 13.7, the iPhone operating system with the new contact-tracing system, Apple is expected to launch iOS 14 in early October alongside new iPhones. That version of the operating system contains a number of major changes to how iPhones work, including a new privacy-preserving system that allows users to prevent tracking from advertisers.“Our ability to deliver targeted ads on iOS 14 will be limited,” Facebook said. “As a result, some iOS 14 users may not see any ads from Audience Network, while others may still see ads from us, but they’ll be less relevant.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8533035e5b354f7a6b213b482c3d602943d1b639/0_227_3405_2043/master/3405.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2cb969a631039f356ab87ccb3b8239dc","title":"walmart joins microsoft bid for tiktok takeover in us","story":"Retailer hopes deal could help target younger consumers and boost its nascent ad businessWalmart has partnered with Microsoft to bid for the US operations of hugely popular video-sharing app TikTok, as the world’s largest retailer looks to become a force in the fast-growing digital media sector.Walmart, which is looking beyond bricks and mortar to rival to Amazon in online retail, said that it is confident the joint bid will pass muster with the Donald Trump administration.Trump’s trade war with China has forced ByteDance, the Beijing-based parent of TikTok, to seek a sale of its North American business to a US company within 90 days or face being shut down. Trump has accused the video app of threatening national security.Walmart has said that a deal will allow it to better target a younger demographic, as most of TikTok’s hundreds of millions of users are in the 12 to 24 age bracket. A deal would also boost its nascent advertising business. Amazon has rapidly grown its online ad business to almost $15bn (£11bn) annually.“We are confident that a Walmart and Microsoft partnership would meet both the expectations of US TikTok users while satisfying the concerns of US government regulators,” Walmart said in a statement.However, Walmart’s previous forays into digital media have not always been a great success. Earlier this year it sold its Netflix-style streaming service Vudu, which it launched a decade ago, to movie ticketing company Fandango for an undisclosed sum.Microsoft has been in talks for weeks to buy TikTok’s business in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand and has been considered the frontrunner. Rival bidders for the business include Larry Ellison’s Oracle, which has partnered with a group of US investors including General Atlantic and Sequoia Capital.The political situation that TikTok has found itself in has claimed its chief executive, the former Disney executive Kevin Mayer, who resigned  just months after joining.The hiring of Mayer, who oversaw the successful launch of Disney’s global streaming service Disney+ but was overlooked to replace chief executive Bob Iger, was meant to address the issue that TikTok needed to become a more US-centric business."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf81b0b8fc9f9108a644887a0aa7f7f3d21c1395/0_244_4288_2572/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72ed71aead0c4f87c4e092388c903ca5","title":"10 great coastal beach clifftop walks the uk","story":"From Sheppey to Shetland, our readers share their favourite walks along beaches, estuaries and clifftops Pack your swimmers, a small towel, a bottle of water and take the coastal walk from Fowey Harbour to Polkerris Bay. It is a moderate to strenuous walk of almost five miles (longer if you choose the circular walk back to Fowey), but you will be rewarded with the discovery of secret beaches en route, where you can stop for a swim and take in the beautiful views. Another highlight is the shipwreck that inspired Daphne Du Maurier’s Rebecca at Polridmouth cove. End the walk with a seafood lunch at Sam’s on Polkerris beach (booking recommended) or a drink at the Rashleigh Inn next door, and watch the sunset on the beach. Natasha CouttsMy favourite clifftop walk is in Lerwick, Shetland. If you start along the Knab towards Sound, it is the most relaxing way to start or end the day. There are sheep who bleat like an old man, seals who are curious and playful and even an egg honesty box at a B\u0026ampB along the way. The colour of both the sea and the sky is grey-blue – sometimes it is hard to tell where the sky ends and the sea begins. If feeling brave, the pebbled beach offers an opportunity for a refreshing swim with the seals.Marie BourneMy tip isn’t so much a walk as a climb: the Elie chain walk. You edge your way along ledges and up and down steps in the cliffs, clinging on to chains anchored in the rock for the more precipitous sections – and there are lots of them. Consider it a via ferrata for beginners. I managed it with five- and eight-year-olds although, in truth, it’s probably unsuitable for most youngsters. But, then again, it’s so refreshing to come across this sort of exploration that hasn’t (yet) been stymied by the health and safety police. You will never forget the experience. Oh, and watch out for the tide times!Paul KirkwoodStart your walk in Bridlington – parking is free on the south side. The walk begins along Belvedere Parade and continues south along a path, past the hamlet of Wilsthorpe, then opening out on to a cliff edge path (which is sometimes awash with butterflies), eventually coming to an excellent coffee shop, the Cow Shed at Fraisthorpe beach. It’s about three miles to there. After coffee and cake with a superb view of the bay, return on the wide-open beach, easy underfoot and with sightings of seabirds and waders, as well as second world war sea defences. Six miles, great coffee, wide open views, an extensive beach, nature and history – all the ingredients of an excellent walk.Sarah VernauWhen adventuring with my family, access is our first consideration, as our little girl has a disability. My partner and I have always adored coastal walks, so we were blown away by the breathtaking circular walk called Baggy Point, just east of Croyde beach in north Devon. It is largely accessible (with the rare rocky patch) and has no shortage of jaw-dropping scenery. • nationaltrust.org.ukStephanieExpect to see wildlife along the picturesque Royal Military canal before crossing to Hythe seafront and enjoying the boardwalk and dramatic sea towards Sandgate. Check out the village’s short stretch of quirky shops, then cut back to the beach to spot some residual artwork from the Folkestone Triennial. Have a lolly at the beachside Mermaids Cafe when you reach Folkestone, then let the kids go wild in the amazing, free adventure park at the Lower Leas Coastal Park. Don’t miss the fabulous coastal planting, then zigzag your way back up the path for afternoon tea at the Grand. Promenade harbour-wards and take in the Channel views, pass the water lift and memorial arch, then finish at one of the vibrant new pop-up bars on the Harbour Arm.KateThere is an easy five-mile stroll on the Isle of Sheppey, beginning in bustling Leysdown-on-Sea. Heading eastwards, the rows of caravans drop away and the vast expanse of muddy sand is bequeathed to flocks of gulls and oystercatchers. The neat breakwaters of Leysdown give way to lines of jagged wooden posts, sticking up like shipwrecks out of the sand. Take a break at Shellness beach, made up entirely of tiny pastel-coloured shells. Then head through the bleakly beautiful Swale nature reserve, keeping the sparkling Swale estuary in view – a great place to spot seals basking on the sandbanks. After an afternoon of soul-cleansing isolation, finish at the Ferry House Inn for outstanding local fare.Alexandra McLanaghanI usually catch the train from Porthmadog to Criccieth, it’s only a few pounds. From Criccieth station head to the nearby castle (currently closed) before dropping down on to the beach path and past the glass-fronted, art deco Dylan’s restaurant, which is always worth a visit. The pebbly beach gives way to easier walking underfoot as you circumnavigate the headland, with fantastic views over Blackrock Sands and an easy walk along the beach, picking up the Welsh Coastal Path to the beautiful beaches before Borth-y-Gest (where the Sea View Cafe does great ice-cream) before finishing your walk into Porthmadog. It’s about five miles, three hours maximum, great at any time of year.Ian OwenThe Norfolk Coastal Path is best known for vast sandy beaches, tidal marshland and pine woods. But one outstanding section climbs from the pretty fishing village of Weybourne and stretches along clifftops overlooking the always dramatic North Sea. This walk defies the reputation of “flat Norfolk” with spectacular views across rolling fields, gorse, heather and woodland. Catch glimpses of steam trains puffing along the Poppy Line to Holt. Follow the path up to the lifeguard lookout point before dropping down into Sheringham. Ride the cute little Coasthopper bus back to Weybourne for lunch at the Ship Inn.NikkiSilecroft, on the Cumbrian coast, has a great beach, and this is a quiet and easy walk – close to the southern fringes of the Lakes, but well away from the tourist crowds. Famous for the opening credits of BBC’s Countryfile, with the horses running through the waves. At high tide there are pebbles but at low tide there’s a flat expanse of sand, as far as the eye can see to the north and south. If you’re lucky, you’ll see no one else. If unlucky you might have to share it with maybe 20 others. Head south for an easy walk on the sand for about four miles, enjoying the views across the sea to the Isle of Man, or inland to the local fells, until you get to the quiet, peaceful village of Haverigg.

He wasn’t feeling well, either, so she made him chicken noodle soup with Texas toast, the way he liked it.“He was so weak and scared here by himself,” Garcia said. “That’s why I came.”Even though she wore a mask and gloves, she wound up sick four days later. Her father had given her Covid-19, but she didn’t regret taking care of him. Because had she not, she wept, “I would have never seen him again.”“I think that poverty, proximity to the river, the large amounts of population growth that are undocumented, kind of forces families to bunch up together, which is exactly what you don’t want,” Melendez said.Tight-knit families are a cornerstone of Latino culture. Those bonds, which are usually advantageous, have also been weaponized by the pandemic. Entrenched in Latino ideals is the principle of familism, or prioritizing family above inidual needs. And, unlike in much of mainstream America, Latino family structures often include a larger swath of extended family members, explained Bernadette Sánchez, a professor of educational psychology at the University of Illinois at Chicago.Amid life’s most troubling moments or difficult change, families offer comfort for Latino communities. But the rituals in place – quinceañeras, weddings – require assembly, Melendez said.Likewise, there are “expectations and obligations about the family supporting one another”, said Sánchez, an ethos that can turn tragic when an essential worker gets exposed to the virus.“You could be taking all the measures yourself to be cautious, but it’s not necessarily culturally acceptable to not be there for your family,” Sánchez said.Garcia called the safety restrictions required by the pandemic a double-edged sword: “you can’t get close, yet you can’t – don’t – wanna stay away”. She had stopped visiting her parents to avoid infecting them, but they both contracted Covid-19 anyway, as did her aunt, uncle and cousin.Once Covid-19 enters a Latino home, it’s found an especially hospitable environment. “It is more typical to see a multigenerational household,” where grandparents reside with their children and grandchildren, and “maybe an uncle or aunt lives there, too”, Sánchez said.In Hidalgo county, four or five members of a single family often get sick with the virus, Melendez said. There are government resources to help family members who need to isolate, but to access those, the community has to know they exist.“That’s not possible,” said Rogelio Sáenz, a professor of demography at the University of Texas at San Antonio, which then makes the situation “even more dangerous”.In Hidalgo county, Priscilla Garcia’s father was intubated first. Her mother suffered a heart attack. The couple was always together they graduated, got married and worked out of the same house. But as they fought for their lives, they were relegated to separate hospitals.“I had to be making their decisions for them while I was sick,” Garcia said. “It was really hard.”Both parents died, just days apart. Then, after more than a month-long fight, Garcia’s aunt also succumbed to the virus. “It’s just so much going on that honestly you can’t even think right,” she said.She’s at least found a sliver of peace in a picture that she found of her parents, from when they were young. Her father is holding her mother’s face, she thinks after he returned home from the army.“It kinda gave me a little validation,” she said, “that they were together.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9d0d77115be8eac9a0a423fd5262cd1755cfe5a/0_149_4868_2922/master/4868.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=08061706d08aab2239abe5dc5213a0c4","title":"how do you feel about the uk government self isolation payment scheme","story":"We’d like to hear from people impacted by the new scheme which enables people on low incomes to claim payments of up to £182People on low incomes in areas with high coronavirus infection rates will be eligible for a payment of up to £182 if they are forced to self-isolate, the government has announced.The scheme, which will be trialled from Tuesday in Blackburn with Darwen, Oldham and Pendle, follows weeks of campaigning by regional mayors, councils and trade unions who warned that millions of people could not afford to isolate without pay for 14 days.We’d like to hear from people on low incomes on their thoughts on the new scheme.

He and the passenger he was travelling with were then taken off the plane before it was due to fly to Pisa in Italy.The pair were moved to the airport’s isolation area, where they were met by health authorities. Their seats and the overhead cabin bins were then disinfected, with the plane finally leaving over an hour behind schedule.Ryanair said in a statement: “The passenger and his travel companion were immediately offloaded and taken to a Stansted airport isolation area where they were assisted by local public health authorities.“Since this passenger and his companion had complied fully with Ryanair health regulations, they were both wearing masks at all times at Stansted Airport and for the very short period (less than 10 minutes) they were seated on the aircraft prior to departure.“There was little if any risk of Covid-19 transmission to other passengers or crew members as all of whom were also wearing face masks at all times.“The aircraft departed for Pisa following a delay of one hour and 20 mins to allow for the empty seats and overhead cabin bins to be disinfected to comply with all UK health authority guidance. Ryanair apologises to all passengers for this short delay.”Video footage shows three officials dressed in protective clothing moving towards the inidual as a crew member tries to keep passengers in their seats.NHS England says on its website that those with symptoms should stay at home and avoid all travel. Instructions on the Department of Health website read: “If you are getting a coronavirus test because you have symptoms, you and anyone you live with must self-isolate until you get your result.“This also applies to anyone in your support bubble (where someone who lives alone – or just with their children – can meet people from one other household).”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31ac154badc01c2d1387996b51b02fe02fb9165d/0_47_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07dbd8669ce9eab4cc2b36ba4b4be377","title":"uk sees highest number of new covid 19 cases since mid june","story":"Daily case numbers and seven-day rolling average now higher than on 23 March when national lockdowns announced.The UK has recorded the highest number of new coronavirus cases since 12 June, with government figures reporting 1,522 positive cases.The number of new cases, which cover the 24 hours to 9am on 27 August, were up 474 on the previous day.The average number of cases confirmed in the past seven days stood at 1,155, the highest rolling average recorded since 22 June.Both the daily case number and the seven-day rolling average are both higher than on 23 March , the day national lockdowns were announced (967 daily cases and 730 cases on a seven-dayrolling average).To date, there have been 57,200 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, according to figures from the UK’s three statistical bodies the Office for National Statistics, National Records of Scotland and Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency.On Tuesday the government reported 1,184 lab confirmed cases, which was up from Monday’s total of 853. The new figures mark the sixth day in a row that the seven-day average has increased.However, hospitalisations as a result of the virus remain low: just 767 people were in hospital due to Covid on 25 August, the lowest number of coronavirus patients since 27 March, the first day for which the government’s dashboard has data.Clusters of new cases have been reported in Plymouth in recent days.Health officials have said that as many as 30 teenagers who took a holiday to the Greek island of Zante may have contracted coronavirus.At least 11 of a group of 18 and 19-year-olds in Plymouth have tested positive for Covid-19 and some had been for a night out in the Devon city since their return from their holiday.The council’s public health director, Ruth Harrell, said her team was working alongside the national systems to contact and trace the young people thought to have been affected.Many of the teenagers who tested positive showed no symptoms or very minor symptoms such as a sore throat after returning from the Greek island, which is not currently subject to UK quarantine rules.Plymouth city council said a further separate outbreak in a factory had been confirmed earlier this week.Harrell added: “We are in contact with all the pubs and bars across the city to remind them of their frontline role in stopping the spread of this virus. They need to help us to protect the city. But it also needs everyone to help too.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/421a80da5051ec5f11cf793f109fbf1f76a85fbe/0_22_5126_3077/master/5126.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c2286c0e829ca7044ee6b2f4d231078","title":"media blitz to get workers back to offices amid pandemic","story":"Labour criticises ‘unconscionable’ plans as ministers would warn employees vulnerable to being sackedWorkers will be encouraged to return to the office as part of a major media campaign to be launched by the government next week.The television and newspaper messages will promote the government’s aim to reduce the number of employees working from home amid fears that town and city centres are becoming ghost areas as workers stay away.A report in the  said the campaign would push the emotional and mental health benefits of mixing with colleagues but also said that ministers would warn that those working from home could be more vulnerable to being sacked.Labour has criticised the plans as being “unconscionable” while the CBI said any return to work push should involve a “hybrid” approach that did not force people to return.Labour’s shadow business minister, Lucy Powell, said: “It beggars belief that the government are threatening people like this during a pandemic. Forcing people to choose between their health and their job is unconscionable.“No 10 should condemn this briefing and categorically rule out any such campaign.”Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, the director-general of the CBI, said a hybrid approach with home and office working was the best way forward.Speaking to Times Radio on Thursday, Fairbairn said: “This is not about compulsion. I couldn’t say that more strongly.“This is about creating the opportunity and the confidence to get to a hybrid that gets the best of both worlds. We’re certainly not there yet.“Our offices are at risk of dying.

The government has continued to promote new coal-fired power generation even as the price of renewable energy has tumbled.Guterres rejected that stance, warning that Indians themselves would suffer from a continued reliance on coal, in the grim air pollution that blights many of their cities. “Investing in fossil fuels means more deaths and illness and rising healthcare costs,” he said. “It is, simply put, a human disaster and bad economics.”“That is why the world’s largest investors are increasingly abandoning coal – they see the writing on the wall,” said Guterres in the 19th Darbari Seth memorial lecture, held in honour of the founder of the Energy and Resource Institute, a renowned Indian centre of research.It was the UN chief’s second major intervention in recent weeks aimed at a key emerging economy. Last month he addressed a similar call to the Chinese government, calling for an end to investment in new coal-fired power plants.“There is no such thing as clean coal, and coal should have no place in any rational recovery plan,” he said in a lecture at Tsinghua University on 23 July. “It is deeply concerning that new coal power plants are still being planned and financed, even though renewables offer three times more jobs and are now cheaper than coal in most countries.”Guterres wants to revive momentum on climate breakdown that was lost as the Covid-19 pandemic hit. Some nations have reacted to the coronavirus crisis by offering help to stricken industries including fossil fuels and high-emitting sectors such as aviation and car-making, without attaching “green strings” or conditions that would require them to cut emissions.Governments including China and India have revived plans for new coal-fired power generation as a way to stimulate the economy and create jobs. Energy and climate experts are worried this will lock in high-emissions infrastructure for decades to come and destroy any hope of staving off climate breakdown. The chief of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, warned recently that the world had six months to change direction.Guterres has also urged rich countries to forsake fossil fuels and forge a “green recovery” as they seek to stimulate their economies amid the Covid-19 recession.Navroz Dubash, a professor at the Centre for Policy Research in Delhi, said Guterres was right to highlight the worsening economics of coal and benefits of clean energy, but warned that ending coal use in India would be “complex” as the new renewable energy jobs would not be in the same places as existing coal jobs.“Instead of more targets and pledges, India needs to actively plan to hasten and smoothen the path from coal to renewable energy. This means planning for new livelihood opportunities in coalmining areas to ensure a just transition, ensuring the robustness of the grid, and making sure the costs of transition are not borne by poor consumers,” he told the . “The secretary general could usefully also call out other countries, including far wealthier countries, who are dragging their feet on a renewable energy future.”Yannick Glemarec, the executive director of the Green Climate Fund, said: “It is difficult to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, but the low oil price gives an opportunity to phase them out and recycle the subsidies to help soften the impact.”China and India will be key players at the UN Cop26 summit next year, when all nations are expected to come up with fresh commitments to curb greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Paris agreement goal of holding temperature rises to no more than 2C, which scientists regard as the limit of safety.Postponed from this year, the Cop26 summit will be hosted by the UK in Glasgow next November, and is seen as a crunch conference to get the Paris agreement back on track. Current commitments under the accord would lead to 3C of global heating, which scientists say would spell disaster."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16981b3276d9f9c0f470dc1b99f48095607ea5eb/0_340_5785_3470/master/5785.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05ba2be5b02aa677a6851b6aa8c22b5c","title":"venezuela human rights watch coronavirus crackdown","story":"Human Rights Watch says it has found a ‘very, very disturbing’ pattern of intimidation and persecution of government criticsVenezuelan security forces are using the coronavirus pandemic as cover to wage a disturbing “full force” campaign against dissenters, according to a new report by Human Rights Watch.The New York-based human rights group said that dozens of journalists, health professionals, human rights lawyers and government opponents had been arbitrarily detained and prosecuted since President Nicolás Maduro declared a Covid-19 state of emergency in mid-March.“What we are seeing is that the lockdown measures and Covid have become a wonderful excuse for the Maduro regime to do what it knows how to do best, which is crack down,” said Tamara Taraciuk, the group’s Venezuela specialist and deputy Americas director. “What we are seeing is that Venezuela’s police state is moving ahead with full force.”Taraciuk said activists had detected a “very, very disturbing” pattern of intimidation and persecution designed to cow government critics and conceal the true scale of Venezuela’s epidemic.Venezuela’s official Covid-19 death toll is just 358 compared with nearly 120,000 in neighbouring Brazil. But many fear the situation is worse than Maduro’s government is admitting and likely to deteriorate as the country’s already collapsed hospitals struggle to respond.The Human Rights Watch report said one bioanalyst in the western state of Trujillo was forced to resign and interrogated by the feared Sebin spy agency after using WhatsApp to send colleagues information about a Covid-19 patient.A journalist in the capital, Caracas, who tweeted publicly available information about the epidemic was allegedly targeted by special forces who raided his house and assaulted two of his relatives. He was later charged with “using false information to destabilize the government”.“It seems to be an attempt to limit the available information about what is actually happening in the country,” claimed Taraciuk, who said a parallel offensive against political objectors was also accelerating.Its targets have included Junior Pantoja, an opposition organizer who was seized by security forces on 8 May and died of suspected Covid-19 this week, and Nicmer Evans, a Chavista dissident and political commentator who was detained on 13 July for allegedly “inciting hatred” against the government.Evans – a former official in Hugo Chávez’s administration – became a vocal Maduro critic after splitting with Chavismo in 2013. Last year he helped broker talks between former Chávez ministers and Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader trying to force Maduro from power.“Chavismo is broken … If they carry on like this, they will have nothing left,” Evans told the  during a 2019 interview at his Caracas headquarters, urging Maduro to resign.Taraciuk said the crackdown was being waged “under the radar” while the world was distracted by Covid-19.Unusually, authorities were also rounding up human rights lawyers, something the activist said she had not seen in more than a decade covering Venezuela.Some cases involved physical abuse and torture. “These are not the actions of rogue agents … this is part of a pattern of abuse with impunity that we have been seeing in Venezuela for quite some time.”Maduro, who was elected in 2013, has been fighting for his political survival since January 2019 when a coalition of governments, including the United States, Brazil and the United Kingdom, recognized Guaidó as Venezuela’s legitimate interim leader. They justified that support claiming Maduro had stolen the 2018 presidential election which returned him to power.But Guaidó’s challenge has petered out and he is now battling to stay relevant, as Maduro uses the pandemic to reassert his authority over their economically ruined country.Maduro’s administration has been rocked by Covid-19’s advance. In recent weeks several key figures have been struck down including the oil minister, Tareck el Aissami the communications minister, Jorge Rodríguez and the Socialist party strongman Diosdado Cabello. Darío Vivas, the Chavista governor of Caracas and an important Maduro ally, died from Covid-19 earlier this month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a13958e4f2922accaede1e2c1c121def86ea46c8/0_81_5209_3126/master/5209.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb354a57f00e5bb32ce0bf8dbc041162","title":"coronavirus live news tour de france in doubt who to review emergency alert rules","story":"New rules in French capital in effect since 8am this morning Spanish children over six to wear masks at school Tour de France in doubtThe Dutch airport group Schiphol has become the latest to make drastic cuts to its workforce as a result of a loss of traffic amid the coronavirus pandemic. On Friday, the Royal Schiphol Group – which employs 3,000 people and owns airports in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Eindhoven – said it will cut several hundred jobs.The outlook for the coming years is very uncertain, and depends on the course of the pandemic, whether a vaccine becomes available, international coordination in travel measures, the profile of the economic recovery and behavioural changes by passengers and businesses.”On Wednesday, the UK’s second-busiest airport, Gatwick, said it would cut 600 jobs – a quarter of its workforce – due to the impact of coronavirus. Our Paris correspondent, Kim Willsher, has this update on the new face coverings regulation in France’s capital. We’ve just heard it will NOT be compulsory for joggers or cyclists to wear masks. City Hall asked the prefect for them to be excluded from the mask rules and this was agreed.The UK’s transport minister has told Britons who have been working from home for the last six months due to the coronavirus lockdown that it is safe to return to work.Speaking on Sky News, Grant Shapps said: What we’re saying to people is it is now safe to go back to work and your employer should have made arrangements which are appropriate to make sure that it is coronavirus-safe to work and you will see some changes if you haven’t been in for a bit as a result.The vast majority of employers just want to get their businesses back up and running, they want to do the right thing, and many will have found that actually home working can work for some of their employees.He added that there was a “limit” to remote working, and that employers should seek advice from the Health and Safety Executive or local councils if they had concerns about reopening offices. Although many people in essential jobs, or where it is not possible to work remotely, have been continuing to go to their workplaces since the lockdown began on 23 March, the vast majority of the UK’s office workers have worked from home. From 8am today it is compulsory to wear a mask anywhere outside in the public space in the French capital.The new regulation covers not just pedestrians, but electric scooter riders, cyclists, motorbike and motor scooter riders in Paris. City Hall said people were not allowed to remove their masks to smoke or eat in public places, but the police are saying they will use their “judgment”, which suggests a degree of tolerance.The measure that prime minister Jean Castex warned was coming yesterday, follows similar rules introduced in Marseille. According to public health figures released on Thursday evening, there were 6,111 new Covid-19 cases in the previous 24 hours. This follows more than 5,000 new cases the previous day. The figure has been rising during August.France is hoping to avoid Covid-related quarantine measures being imposed on on its citizens travelling to and from Switzerland, French junior European affairs minister Clément Beaune has said. The UK and Scotland have both imposed measures forcing those arriving from Switzerland to self-isolate for 14 days after the country recorded a consistent increase in cases over the past month. Over the past week, Covid-19 cases per 100,000 of the population have risen from 18.5 to 22 in Switzerland. Singapore is experiencing a record outbreak of the tropical disease dengue, which is carried and spread to humans by infected mosquitoes. The south-east Asian Island – home to 5.7 million people – has recorded more than 26,000 cases of dengue so far this year, surpassing the previous annual record of 22,000 in 2013. Twenty people have died from the virus, which can cause extreme fever that leads to internal bleeding and shock.By comparison, 27 people have died of Covid-19 in the city-state, while 56,000 infections have been recorded. Environment officials are using specially bred mosquitoes to carry a bacteria that prevents eggs from hatching and compete with the wild type to gradually reduce the country’s mosquito population. A new strain of the dengue disease, combined with unseasonably wet weather and coronavirus lockdowns that left construction sites and other mosquito breeding grounds undisturbed, are all seen as factors behind the outbreak.Here’s a handy list of some of the most eye-opening latest developments from across the continents drawn up by Reuters. In case you missed it yesterday, the UK has imposed a 14-day quarantine measure on travellers arriving from Switzerland, Jamaica and the Czech Republic following spikes in virus infection rates in the countries. Elsewhere, Cuba has been added to the list of destinations from which people can arrive in the UK without entering a quarantine period after cases fell, while Wales has removed the requirement for arrivals from Singapore.Ukraine has registered a record 2,438 new coronavirus infections in the past 24 hours, officials said on Friday morning. This week, Ukraine imposed a temporary ban on most foreigners from entering the country until 28 September and extended lockdown measures until the end of October to contain a recent spike in cases.The country has so far reported a total of 114,497 infections and 2,451 deaths from the virus.I’m Amy Walker, taking over from my colleague Alison Rourke.

The UK on Thursday recorded the highest number of new coronavirus cases since 12 June, with government figures reporting 1,522 positive cases.The number of new cases, which cover the 24 hours to 9am on 27 August, were up 474 on the previous day.The average number of cases confirmed in the past seven days stood at 1,155, the highest rolling average recorded since 22 June.Both the daily case number and the seven-day rolling average are both higher than on 23 March, the day national lockdowns were announced (967 daily cases and 730 cases on a seven-day rolling average).You can read our full story below:The risk of severe illness and death to children from Covid-19 is “vanishingly rare”, according to the biggest study yet of those admitted to hospital, which the researchers say should reassure parents as they return to school.“They were children with profound co-morbidities – not a touch of asthma and not cystic fibrosis,” said Calum Semple, professor in child health and outbreak medicine at the University of Liverpool, and co-lead of the study by the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium. Their conditions included cancer and serious neurological, blood or heart issues.Co-author of the paper published in the BMJ, Dr Olivia Swann, clinical lecturer in paediatric infectious diseases at the University of Edinburgh, said: “The absolute risk of being admitted to hospital is tiny.” The risk of severe disease and death was also very small.But among those children who were admitted to critical care, they found those under the age of one were at three times the usual risk, although that included premature babies born and diagnosed in the hospital.Also at two to three times higher risk of ending up in critical care were black children. “The issues around ethnicity are very complicated,” said Semple. “They are issues which can partly be explained by deprivation. Some are explained by exposure in the community.”There were also underlying conditions, such as high blood pressure, which are more prevalent in black people, he said. But black children who were completely healthywere at no extra risk, said Semple. The message to the mother of a black child in Brixton or Glasgow was “they are safe to go back to school”, he said.Children with obesity were at higher risk. So were children in the 10-14 age bracket, who were the ones more likely to suffer from multisystem inflammatory syndrome, a new condition thought to be linked to Covid-19.The researchers said they have identified symptoms that should help doctors diagnose the syndrome and they hope will lead to an expansion of the World Health Organization definition of it. These were a rash, conjunctivitis, abdominal pain, vomiting, and a low blood platelet count. “The skin, gut and whole child’s body is quite inflamed,” said Swann.Semple said parents should be reassured that their children would not be at harm from returning to school. He and Swann were both sending children back in September. Among children, “severe disease and death is vanishingly rare”, he said.The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 1,571 to 239,507, data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases showed on Friday.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced new measures to fight the coronavirus pandemic on Friday, including boosting testing capability to 200,000 tests per day and aiming to secure enough vaccines for all citizens by mid-2021.Abe also said that Japan will allow foreigners with residence status to enter the country from the start of next month.India has recorded its highest one-day tally of coronavirus cases, with 77,266 new infections recorded. That’s the second highest number of cases ever recorded by a single country in one day. Only the US has reported more cases, on 25 July, with 78,427 cases. Deaths due to Covid-19 have risen to 61,529.In case you missed this earlier, Germany has banned large gatherings until the end of this year, amid rising coronavirus cases in Europe.The chancellor, Angela Merkel, has set out a new package of measures in discussions with leaders of federal states. It comes amid a worrying rise of infection rates in Germany not seen since April, and a similar uptick in Italy and France.Under the new rules, German football fans will not be allowed back into stadiums until 2021, later than had been hoped. Regulations on mask-wearing will also be toughened. Mass gatherings including festivals, concerts and big sporting events will remain prohibited.The draft text allows for exceptions in regions with low virus numbers and where participants are all locals. But it goes against a suggestion by Germany’s interior minister, Horst Seehofer, that Bundesliga football games might resume in October with socially distanced spectators.France’s prime minister, Jean Castex, also announced new measures to deal with an upsurge in cases. The country’s R rate of infection has climbed to 1.4, with a sharp rise in July and August. “The virus is spreading all over the country,” Castex warned. “The spread can be exponential if we do not react quickly.”You can read our full story in our latest global report below:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95b487f6298ae93d44202b825f8a670866569fed/0_126_1242_745/master/1242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f518095e322503bde96d36abf69c4f3b","title":"four young artists reveal how they express their unique voice in pictures","story":"As part of  Labs’ collaboration with Levi’s and young people with something to say, Gen Z illustrators and photographers discuss what informs their work‘We need a more erse understanding of the world’“I use my art to celebrate the lips, noses, hair and skin colour of women from black and mixed-race communities who have become stigmatised and criticised by society,” says illustrator Vicki Jones. “I believe everyone is beautiful and worthy of greater acceptance. I want other black and mixed-race people to see someone who looks like them, and for our white allies to see people who aren’t like them. It gives us all a more erse understanding of how the world is.”‘We have to question body image issues’“I had a problematic relationship with food and body image, and so did most of my friends,” says photographer Fanny Beckman. “Did you know that more lives are lost to eating disorders than any other mental health condition? Women of My Generation is a multimedia project which combines photography and a podcast to question beauty standards, and dismantle our body image issues. I want to prove that it is, beyond doubt, possible to feel confident regardless of body size, sexuality, ethnicity or socioeconomic background.”‘Look closer, and a new level opens up’“My illustration style is lowbrow, cartoony, so it might not strike you that there’s meaning beyond the skateboarding-style graphics,” says illustrator Chris Martin. “But I’m hoping to communicate bigger issues in my drawing. As with the Cambridge Analytica scandal, there are unseen forces at work. Forces we don’t see straight away, but which create a deeper tension. There’s always another level to what we first think we see.”This is what confidence looks like“I use my voice to empower women and celebrate the ersity I see in my home city, London,” says photographer Milli Ahern. “I use bright saturated colours to project strength and confidence – a confidence that I didn’t feel myself, growing up. I was bullied about my appearance as a teenager. But that experience actually gave me strength as it led to me learning about photography, which allowed me to find my voice and highlight the beauty in ersity. Everyone needs to be seen and heard.”At the heart of the Your Voice. Your Way campaign is a zine, paid for by Levi’s, celebrating voices outside the mainstream. Created jointly by the four incredible artists showcased here and four talented writers, it proves the power of expressing yourself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13d96520ce96b542084eb940ffc7aef88405e9ee/716_1017_4167_2500/master/4167.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=965dc8ed0fd980af935b0bfd767c08d5","title":"good jeans the man who gave levis a social conscience","story":"Whether it’s climate change, homophobia or hidden talent, one of the best known brands in the world is stepping up to give people a voiceSome brands are so big, so ubiquitous, that it’s hard to imagine that they were once small businesses, or that the name on their instantly recognisable logo belonged to a real person. Levi Strauss was one of those real people. Born in Bavaria, Germany, he moved to the US in 1846. After seven years in New York, he headed to the west coast to join the gold rush, not as a prospector, but to set up a wholesale business, dealing in, among other goods, clothing.In San Francisco he quickly became a respected businessman and, in 1873, struck gold himself when he spotted the potential of the hard-wearing riveted trousers being made for labourers by tailor Jacob Davis. The two men went into business together, as Levi Strauss \u0026amp Co, and before long were manufacturing thousands of pairs of blue jeans, the US workwear that went on to become a worldwide wardrobe staple.Beyond his thriving business interests, Strauss was committed to sharing his prosperity with the community around him, becoming one of the biggest philanthropists in 19th-century San Francisco. He made donations to an orphanage, a school for the deaf and supported several charities. He also set up 28 scholarships at the University of California, Berkeley, part of his enduring legacy.Today, Levi’s operates in 110 countries, and in March 2019 debuted on the New York Stock exchange, valued at $6.6bn. But it is Levi’s values, rather than its value, that the brand wants to talk about today. So what are those values? “Empathy, integrity, originality and courage,” says Jason Kyriacou, the UK marketing and experience director. “These four pillars shape how we work and the decisions we make. It’s what we want to stay true to.”Levi’s is a true San Francisco native, and not just in terms of embracing today’s tech takeover. The brand’s hometown is the gay capital of the US, and Levi’s has a long history of working with LGBTQ+ groups. In the 1980s, it was one of the first corporations to advise staff about HIV and Aids, reaching out when both the disease and the groups initially likely to be affected by it were heavily stigmatised.The company went on to advocate for gay marriage.In the UK today, Levi’s takes the spirit and ideals of its San Francisco creator and embodies them in a uniquely British way, not least in its ongoing partnership with Queer Britain. “It’s a young organisation with bold ambitions,” says Kyriacou. Queer Britain curates and archives examples of gay culture in the UK and hopes one day to establish a permanent museum. The three-year partnership kicked off last year with a photography exhibition that coincided with London Pride 2019. The show, on the theme of Chosen Family, celebrated the ersity and uniqueness of the LGBTQ+ experience through the work of four artists, Alia Romagnoli, Bex Day, Kuba Ryniewicz and Robert Taylor.Another strand of the company’s work, the Levi’s Music Project, has given young people from London to Barcelona access to recording studios, workshops and classes, and offered them the chance to be mentored by trailblazing musicians. This is all part of a global drive by Levi’s to ensure emerging talent has the opportunity to find its voice, and a platform where it can be heard. Among the artists inspiring the next generation are Mist, Vince Staples and Rosalía.Last year, a short film for Levi’s Your Voice. Your Way campaign featured five young people from the Levi’s Music Project. The artists came from across Europe, including Londoner Hak Baker and Liverpool’s Michael Aldag. They had received mentoring in their respective projects from rapper and producer Skepta and Brit-hop musician Loyle Carner.“It’s been about enabling people to learn and to express what they want to say,” says Kyriacou. “These are all people who haven’t gone through conventional channels and might not have been heard.”For the latest manifestation of Your Voice. Your Way, Levi’s is partnering with  Labs to publish a counterculture zine put together by eight young creatives. The writers, photographers and illustrators recruited for the project by  Labs are all aged between 18 and 25, and have little – if any – media experience. What unites them is that they all have a powerful story to tell, in the zine that will be published on Saturday, 27 June.“Again, it’s about giving creative voices a chance to say their piece in a place they wouldn’t usually have access to,” says Kyriacou. The team have free rein to work on their zine, with advice from  Labs staff and no limitations from Levi’s.“Projects like these aren’t about telling people what they can and can’t do,” says Kyriacou. “We’re here to support and do the best we can. We try to be facilitators more than anything. I don’t think we can dictate to any community around what they need to do to benefit themselves. That’s not for us to do.”Use Your Voice ...The Your Voice. Your Way campaign is a reflection of Levi’s values and its commitment to giving a voice to people who are often marginalised and overlooked.In this spirit, a zine, sponsored by Levi’s, is being produced by eight talented young creatives.

The 22-year-old from Milnthorpe in Cumbria is passionate about illustration, but also wants to stay true to his ideals about the type of work he aims to produce, rooted in skate culture. “The prospect of having my work published nationally felt so distant,” he says. But Chris’s work, along with that of seven other young creatives, will appear next Saturday, 27 June, in a supplement published with .Your Voice. Your Way is being created by young people aged between 18 and 25 from across Britain who feel strongly that they and their contemporaries need to be heard when it comes to shaping the future. “I am driven to uncover how our world is steered,” says Chris. “And how, not just as creatives, but as people, we can change it.” Commissioned by Levi’s and  Labs team, the magazine aims to give a platform to the unheard, and amplify their voices.“Their generation has what I’d call a positive stubbornness,” says Jason Kyriacou, the UK marketing and experience director for Levi’s. “An uncompromising attitude to what they believe in and the courage to act on it.”Now, that attitude is needed more than ever. When  Labs and Levi’s started recruiting for the project, in the first months of 2020, issues surrounding climate change, shifting identities and inclusiveness came up in nearly every application. What gave the project even more urgency was the outbreak of Covid-19.Suddenly the future was ever more uncertain, and the assembled contributors – all with little or no media experience – had to adjust to working on the project remotely and contacting their mentors from  Labs using video meetings.Writer Kiera Moran, 24, has had the unusual experience of self-isolating before, and writes about the experience of seeing her five-year-old son through cancer. She started writing up late at night, caring for her child. “Sleep deprived at 5am, I have spilled my heart out,” says Kiera, from Merthyr Tydfil. “My voice is honest and unassuming. Coming from a working class background, I feel I am familiar and welcoming, with a story hidden behind nightmares. I was excited to have such an amazing opportunity. I hope to develop my writing and use what I’ve learned in future work.”Another writer, Anna Marshall, 21, from Durham, drew on her experience in climate activism for the project. “I want to contribute to a fresher and more daring version of professional journalism,” she says. “I was buzzed to see what we could make together,” she says. “And I was excited to work with talented people who are dedicated to what they do.”For the other two writers, Ayat Mohamed, 18, from London, and Sam Carrick, also 18 and from Gosport, the project was a chance to think about their place in the world and how they and others are viewed. “I hope someone reads it and feels understood,” says Ayat.Illustrator Vicki Jones, 21, from Birmingham, was keen for her work to be seen by the people she depicts, often women of colour. “The message I’d like people to take from my work is to be proud of who you are regardless of skin colour, facial features or hair type,” she says. “To just love the way you look. I am passionate about this message and I want others to feel that they can be heard too.”For the two photographers, Milli Ahern, 23, from London, and Fanny Beckman, 25, lockdown meant the biggest adjustment, forcing them to think creatively about what they could shoot in and around their homes, and they responded with positivity. “I was beyond excited when I found out I was chosen to work on this zine,” says Fanny, who is from Malmö, Sweden, but lives in London. “To get advice from people in the industry I have always dreamed of being part of means a lot to me.”“We received hundreds and hundreds of applications,” says the project’s casting editor Anna Fielding. “Every single person who applied had something important to say. The eight collaborators have exceptional clarity of expression and a real drive to see a new world. They’ve been inspirational to work with.”Although it has never been easier to self-publish work, or create a social media presence or a podcast, it’s difficult to be heard among so many others doing the same.The reach of an established newspaper still matters, as does being heard by an audience beyond your peer group.  Labs and Levi’s were happy to turn over creative control and act as supporters and signal-boosters. The hope is that the conviction and passion displayed by these eight will inspire others to find their voices. The collaborators were paid for their time and work, and will be mentored for six months by  Labs staff.Beyond encouraging young people to speak out and push for positive change, the aim is to let the world see the power of their potential. “We want to create a platform that this team perhaps otherwise wouldn’t have had. And then to put it in front of people who might not otherwise read it, because it would have been in places they wouldn’t normally look,” says Jason.The team may be only eight strong, but they represent their generation and they represent Britain. Do look at what they have to say: it contains the seeds of our future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e66095eef528002831fac4e99023fe4cd7c16d3d/0_0_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cb5a9af8f4ac55c3e0eaa2de5753670","title":"gen z on challenging stereotypes i only saw muslim women on arabic channels","story":"Writer Ayat Mohamed is 18 and, like all of us, she’s an inidual with many aspects. So why is it so hard for her to find people to identify with in the media?I’m a Gen Z Muslim woman with immigrant parents and I don’t fit many stereotypes. Other stereotypes fit me alarmingly well: I think rice is one of God’s greatest creations, I talk too much, I care about my hair too much – which is even worse as nobody outside my household sees it.I also care about climate change, animal exploitation, mental health, respect, feminism and more. I’m multidimensional, and I don’t see myself represented enough.Representation has the power to implant views and stereotypes into mainstream consciousness, for better or for worse. We all need role models and there are lots of us who are being let down.It’s up to all of us to fix that. Starting now. Here, five people reveal how they’re breaking boundaries in race, mental health, body image, religion and age representation ...Malin Andersson“Mental health representation will make us all stronger,” says Malin Andersson, a mental health advocate and TV personality.I talk about grief, depression, body positivity, and domestic violence on my Instagram to open up those conversations. I get about a thousand messages a day from people saying I’ve helped them, so I know I’m raising awareness.Speaking up, especially when you show your vulnerability, can make people feel less alone and encourage them to share their experiences too. The more we talk about mental health issues, the more we take away their shame and stigma. We create space to be ourselves without being scared of what others will think. I hope this will lead to better representation of mental health issues.Dr Fatumina Said Abukar“I experienced racism because of a lack of representation,” says Dr Fatumina Said Abukar, an award-winning UCL scientist, model and Stem ersity advocate.I grew up in a small village where my family were the only people of colour, and I experienced a lot of racism.People threw eggs at me and beat me up, and I faced racial slurs. I’m frustrated when I walk into ersity shoots and I’m the only person of colour. When you only have one token figure it’s impossible for them to represent their whole community. This can lead to them being attacked by their own community if they do or say something wrong. I want to see different types of beauty in the media.Stephanie Yeboah“If I’d seen someone who looked like me, I would’ve had less self-hate issues,” says body positivity blogger Stephanie Yeboah.“I grew up feeling uncomfortable in my own skin. I’ve always been into fashion, but I felt like I had to hide that because there were few plus-size-friendly shops. I hated myself and dieted constantly. After university, I went to New York and met a group of women who were all bigger than me – yet confident and effervescent. Inspired, I posted a full-length picture of myself on social media.I was shocked at how positive people were. This generation is so lucky to have role models like Lizzo – I would’ve had less self-hate issues if I’d seen her when I was growing up. The body positive movement was created to celebrate women whose bodies aren’t seen by society as beautiful, so I’d like to see more variety of body shapes in the media.Zaynab Shaikh“Muslim women need better representation in fashion,” says hijabi model Zaynab Shaikh.Muslim women aren’t represented enough. Take fashion: few fashion brands care about Muslim women who want to dress modestly. Shopping is difficult because everything is too tight, sheer or has cut-outs. Just: no.Now, young people ask me how they can start modelling, which is so nice because when I grew up I only saw Muslim women on Arabic channels.Zahra Mohamed“Young people deserve people who look like them,” says Zahra Mohamed, Ayat’s 15-year-old sister.Representation affects young people and the adults we become. I have an issue with adult actors playing teens on screen as they create unrealistic expectations of how we should look, which has led to a rise in eating disorders, depression and anxiety.I like TikTok because it’s full of normal people. Instagram is full of heavily filtered influencers who I can’t relate to. It’s not fair that teens have to obsess over their appearance. Let young people enjoy being teenagers so we can enjoy adulthood.If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this article, the people featured recommend these Instagram accounts: @bodyposipanda @i_weigh @mattzhaig @crazyheadcomics @muslimgirl @the_indian_feminist @privtoprog @Ayat_Zaman"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4340514.1598555791!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"extra college places to be provided for high demand courses","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Further and Higher Education Simon Harris is understood to be preparing a plan  which would see universities boost the capacity of many high-demand courses. Photograph:  Julien Behal PhotographyHundreds of additional college places in high-demand courses such as nursing, medicine, law, veterinary science and engineering are likely to be provided this year to help ease pressure on third-level applicants.Minister for Further and Higher Education Simon Harris is understood to be preparing a plan due to go to Cabinet next week which would see universities boost the capacity of many high-demand courses by about 5 per cent.Among the other courses being examined for expansion are post-primary teaching and dentistry.One higher-education source confirmed that their college has been asked to increase numbers in some of its key oversubscribed programmes.“We’ve been asked to increase the numbers we take in. Some courses have strict caps on numbers, but we’re looking at our capacity and there is room to increase our numbers,” the source stated.Officials believe there may be extra demand at home for courses this year due to fewer students travelling to study abroad because of the Covid-19 threat.In addition, extra course places may ease pressure on CAO points for high-demand areas of study when thousands of students receive their calculated grades on September 7th.Officials are understood to have so far identified “several hundred” additional college places which should be available in the new academic year, while colleges are continuing to examine the potential for further expansion.One obstacle is a cap on numbers in some programmes such as medicine and veterinary science, based on the number of clinical placements that can be provided in a given year.However, the Department of Further and Higher Education is understood to be in discussion with the Departments of Health and Agriculture over the potential to ease these caps.Another issue is the lack of physical space in colleges for additional students due to social-distancing requirements. Some programmes, such as dentistry, are also limited by the number of dental chairs and related equipment.Officials said they are being careful to avoid “unbalancing” the third-level system by attracting more students into degree courses at the expense of further education and other sectors.Meanwhile, Department of Education officials are continuing to “refine” the system of calculated grades in light of controversy over the system in the UK.Sources say a greater emphasis is being placed on school-issued percentage marks given to students rather than an algorithm which was linked to the large-scale downgrading of students’ results in the UK.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Dismantling of protections \u0026lsquois making it harder for future administrations to use science\u0026rsquoLoss equivalent to an ice sheet over landmass of Ireland to a depth of 300 metresDiesel and petrol consumption fell as transport restrictions took hold, report shows"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"The by-the-wind sailor\u0026rsquos sworn foe, the violet sea snail, floats upside-down alongside itMichael Viney: North Atlantic\u0026rsquos top predator now shares island with 13 other speciesMichael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

They also have their throats swabbed. Photograph: Peter Komka The State’s public health team has recommended less invasive, saliva tests for children who need to be tested for Covid-19.The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) have discussed the benefits of taking saliva or nasal specimens from children amid concerns they may find the current testing practices too traumatic or that parents would find it “unacceptable” particularly if their child only has a mild illness.Currently, children must undergo the same invasive procedure as adults – a nasopharyngeal swab reaching a few centimetres into the head through the nose. They also have their throats swabbed.At a meeting on August 6th, the team recommended to the Health Service Executive that, in collaboration with the National Virus Reference Laboratory, it “validate the use of oral fluidsaliva as a specimen type for testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in children”.The group were also presented with a paper from an expert group which said there was a “preference for less-invasive testing of children, with use of salivary or deep nasal samples recommended instead of nasopharyngealoropharyngeal for children in the community, if feasible”.That expert group also recommended that the period of self-isolation and restriction of movements of close contacts of children should be in line with any emerging guidance from the European Centre for Disease Prevention.According to minutes of that meeting, the public health team stressed that a direct risk to children in this context was that “other serious illnesses such as meningitis or septicaemia could initially go unrecognised because of a focus on Covid-19 as a diagnosis”.It comes after a Hiqa report released last week said saliva or nasal specimens may offer a viable alternative to the current standard invasive test for the coronavirus which collects specimens from the back of the nose and throat.At the same meeting in early August, officials also discussed changes to the current modelling work around potential future Covid-19 cases.The chair of the Irish Epidemiological Modelling Advisory Group (IEMAG) presented a paper which outlined that the group’s work had “changed” and needed to be reviewed.“The uncertainty surrounding Covid-19 makes it difficult to predict how long modelling advice and expertise will be required to support the NPHET and the nature of the expertise that would be most useful.“However, the value of sustaining some specific statistical advisory and modelling capacity within the health system was acknowledged.“The NPHET thanked the IEMAG for the considerable contribution it had made in responding to the pandemic to date and acknowledged the importance of its work continuing, albeit through potentially different channels in time. It was agreed that further consideration would be given to the options proposed before a new approach to carrying out this significant work was formalised.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Taking of saliva samples deemed less traumatic amid range of parental concernsIt will be an offence to attend a gathering in a house with more than six visitorsKeeping the virus from reappearing in nursing homes key to lower death ratesBody set up to improve lives of survivors of abuse at religious institutions said it will shutDespite role applying Covid-19 guidelines in D\u0026aacuteil John Flaherty was at golf society eventPlan aims to ease pressure on Leaving Cert applicants for nursing, medicine and lawCoveney and MEPs McGuinness or Fitzgerald believed to be most likely candidates for commissioner roleIreland retaining portfolio \u0026lsquoa hope, not expectation\u0026rsquo as candidates sought urgentlyOne in four say back to school costs increased as result of the pandemic, new survey saysOver 250 of the outbreaks relate to social gatherings in private households, says HPSCClosures may follow \u0026lsquoevidence or concern that spread within the school is primary driver of cases\u0026rsquo\u0026lsquoStronger legislation\u0026rsquo planned after footage surfaces of guests dancing at weddingMove brings staff salaries into line with those who work at the AssemblyParents issue plenary summonses against Hyde And Seek Childcare Ltd, Hyde and Seek Glasnevin LtdOne-fifth of parents unlikely to avail of Covid-19 vaccine, CSO survey findsSearches took place in four counties in the Republic on Wednesday, Garda sources sayTopics included \u0026lsquoFalse allegations of child abuse against the Catholic Church, including homicide\u0026rsquoKildare lockdown to remain in place but rate of infection in county stabilising, officials sayCarlow Kilkenny TD is not expected to attend the D\u0026aacuteil when it resumes early next weekRandom cruelty underlines stigma associated with obesity, says Prof Donal O\u0026rsquoSheaStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4340571.1598592788!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"crackdown planned on house parties and pubs that do not comply with covid 19 rules","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr John Cuddihy, director of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, at Thursday’s  Covid-19 update press conference at the Department of Health. Photograph: Colin Keegan, Collins DublinThe Cabinet is to consider a major crackdown on house parties and pubs that are not complying with public health guidelines under new measures to tackle the spread of Covid-19. Under the proposals expected to be approved by Ministers on Friday, it will be an offence to organise or attend a gathering in a private house with more than six visitors either indoors or outdoors. This measure was introduced as a guideline last week.Gardaí will also be given the powers to close a pub immediately where they believe public health guidelines are not being followed. With the sanction of a superintendent, a garda can order the closure of a premises either orally or in written format. If the owner does not comply, they could be subject to a fine or imprisonment on conviction.It is understood that the number of people permitted at weddings will remain at 50. The Cabinet will also agree that pubs that serve only alcohol will not be permitted to reopen on Monday.The move comes as officials on Thursday reported “a significant number of outbreaks”. According to Dr John Cuddihy, director of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, there are currently 392 active outbreaks of Covid-19 in the country, some 252 of which are related to social gatherings in private households. In one case an outbreak linked to a single pub-restaurant had resulted in 36 cases, he said.“We’ve gone from what was a local problem with several big clusters to a national problem with lots of smaller clusters,” the acting chief medical officer, Dr Ronan Glynn, said. However, it is expected that current local restrictions in place for Kildare are not going to be lifted early due to continuing high numbers of cases in the county. The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) on Thursday decided against recommending any early easing of the lockdown measures for Kildare. Dr Glynn said the situation in the county had been “improving and stabilising” after large increases in cases linked to clusters in several food processing plants. But “it hasn’t improved or stabilised to the extent we would need”, Dr Glynn said. In the past 14 days there had been 329 Covid-19 cases in Kildare, and while the rate of the spread of the virus was slowing, it remained the highest in the State, he said. “We’re confident everything is going in the right direction, but if we release the measures too early, we could see a rebound in the opposite direction,” Dr Glynn said.Pub reopeningNPHET also decided against recommending pubs that do not serve food can reopen on Monday, as some in the industry had hoped. The group did not feel it would be “appropriate”, Dr Glynn said. The potential reopening of pubs that cannot operate as restaurants will be reconsidered in two weeks’ time. Dr Glynn said officials were “not contemplating a national lockdown as things currently stand”, adding he hoped the spread of the virus had not reached a “tipping point”. The HSE on Thursday ruled out restrictions aimed at protecting older and more vulnerable people as a means of avoiding a national lockdown because of the adverse impact it had seen on their health as a result of cocooning. NPHET reported 93 new cases of coronavirus on Thursday and no new deaths.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4340467.1598552855!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tds call on leinster house captain of guard to explain clifden attendance","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCaptain of the guard John Flaherty has been urged to make a statement on his attendance at the Clifden golf event given the seniority of his role within Leinster House. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillA number of TDs have called on the captain of the guard in Leinster House to explain his attendance at a controversial golf society event in Clifden last week.John Flaherty, a senior Oireachtas official who oversees the day-to-day management of the complex, attended the function last week alongside 80 others including the now-resigned minister for agriculture Dara Calleary and EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan.A number of sources on the Oireachtas Commission, the governing body which oversees the delivery of services to the Houses of the Oireachtas, have told the  they believe Mr Flaherty should make a statement on his attendance given the seniority of his role within Leinster House.“It is not just politicians who believe this is serious but staff here too, so he does need to explain himself, ideally before the Dáil returns,” a commission source said.Rise TD Paul Murphy said he believed “We need to hear a full explanation and apology from Mr Flaherty. It is difficult to see a circumstance where it would be appropriate for him to retain responsibility for the implementation of the Covid guidelines within the Dáil, given that he was so blatantly in breach of those guidelines himself.”Day-to-day managementA spokeswoman for the Oireachtas said: “The Houses of the Oireachtas service has a long-standing policy whereby we don’t discuss inidual staff.”In the Oireachtas, the captain reports to the superintendent and has responsibility for the day-to-day management of the staff. Both the captain and superintendent are appointed by the taoiseach after consultation with the chairman of Dáil Éireann and the chairman of Seanad Éireann, after both chairmen have consulted with the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.Meanwhile, it has emerged that a parliamentary assistant for the Minister of State for Public Health was also a guest at the golf society dinner.Imelda Henry, a former Fine Gael senator, was seated at table six, alongside former MEP Brian Hayes, who is the current chief executive of the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland (BPFI).According to the website of the Minister of State with Responsibility for Public Health, Wellbeing and the National Drugs Strategy, Frankie Feighan, Ms Henry is one of three parliamentary and secretarial assistants aiding the Minister in his role.As he is Minister with responsibility for public health, Covid-19 is one of many issues that would come under his remit. Mr Feighan did not respond to requests for comment on his assistant’s attendance at the event.Ms Henry has yet to respond to calls or emails from The . However, in a statement to her local radio station, Ocean FM, at the weekend, Ms Henry apologised for her attendance at the dinner, adding that it was a lack of judgment on her part.Ms Henry said she attended the event in a private capacity while on holidays. She added that she attended the dinner under advice from the function’s organisers that it was fully compliant with the Irish Hotels’ Federation and Fáilte Ireland’s Covid-19 regulations.“I am acutely aware of the huge upset this issue has caused to many people nationally and, for this reason, I want to apologise unreservedly,” she said."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Departure marks end of era of stability that saw him strike up strong ties with TrumpItinerary of three-week visit by investigators fuels concern over China\u0026rsquos co-operationBrenton Tarrant killed 51 Muslim worshippers at two mosques in New Zealand last yearLong-serving president already general secretary of the party and head of the militaryTed Hui and Lam Cheuk-ting detained as part of crackdown under new security lawVictims and relatives seek life without parole for man who killed 51 in 2019 attackResearchers say man had no Covid-19 symptoms the second time, suggesting immune system kept virus somewhat in checkLocals and police search the debris after five-storey structure crumbles in MahadLuon Sovath, who has spent decades fighting for human rights, was the victim of a vicious smear campaign this summerFears that country teetering on edge of major outbreak supported by data on rise in daily casesWhite supremacist killed 51 worshippers at two New Zealand mosques in March 2019Health condition \u0026lsquovery worrying\u0026rsquo after drinking tea that allies believe was laced with poisonDecision to transfer Kremlin critic ill with suspected poisoning after day of lobbyingProtests over last two months most serious threat yet to prime minister\u0026rsquos administrationLack of foreign visitors has facilitated increase in poaching and loss of revenueReport by US intelligence agencies sheds light on actions \u0026ndash and inactions \u0026ndash that created global crisisTens of thousands evacuated as record-breaking rains hit country\u0026rsquos southwestCountry entering dangerous new phase of rising infections in small towns and villagesUS president \u0026lsquopatently wrong\u0026rsquo when telling Minnesota crowd New Zealand situation \u0026lsquoterrible\u0026rsquoPolling put back by four weeks as 49 Covid-19 cases recorded in AucklandStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4340891.1598598148!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"japan s pm shinzo abe to resign due to declining health","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tShinzo Abe, Japanese Prime Minister, is set to resign. File photograph: Robert GilhoolyEPA.Japan’s prime minister Shinzo Abe is to step down due to declining health, according to a senior member of the ruling party.Hiroshige Seko, a Liberal Democratic Party secretary general for the upper house of parliament, confirmed Mr Abe had told party executives he is resigning.In a country once known for its short-tenured premiers, his departure would mark the end of an unusual era of stability that saw him strike up strong ties with US President Donald Trump even as Mr Abe’s ultra-nationalism riled the Koreas and China. While he pulled Japan out of recession, the economy has been battered by the coronavirus pandemic, and he has failed to achieve his cherished goal to formally rewrite the US-drafted pacifist constitution because of poor public support.Mr Abe is a political blue blood who was groomed to follow in the footsteps of his grandfather, former prime minister Nobusuke Kishi, and sought to make Japan a “normal” and “beautiful” nation with a stronger military and more focus on the non-political emperor.Concerns about his chronic health issues, simmering since earlier this summer, intensified this month when he visited a Tokyo hospital two weeks in a row for unspecified health check-ups.Mr Abe, whose term ends in September 2021, is expected to stay on until a new party leader is elected and formally approved by parliament.He abruptly resigned from his first stint in office in 2007 due to his health, which has fuelled concerns about his recent condition.OverworkedOn Monday he became Japan’s longest serving prime minister by consecutive days in office, eclipsing the record of Eisaku Sato, his great-uncle, who served 2,798 days from 1964 to 1972.But Mr Abe’s second hospital visit on Monday has accelerated speculation and political manoeuvring towards a post-Abe regime.He has acknowledged having ulcerative colitis since he was a teenager and has said the condition was controlled with treatment. He has not made clear if it is related to his recent health issues or hospital visits.After his recent hospital visits were reported, senior officials from Mr Abe’s cabinet and the ruling party said he was overworked and badly needed rest.His health concerns added to speculation that his days in office are numbered, when his support ratings are already at their lowest levels due to his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and its severe impact on the economy, on top of a slew of political scandals.Shigeru Ishiba, a hawkish 63-year-old former defence minister and Mr Abe’s arch rival, is a favourite next leader in media surveys, although he is less popular within the ruling party.Low-key former foreign minister Fumio Kishida, defence minister Taro Kono, chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga, and economic revitalisation minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, who is in charge of coronavirus measures, are widely tipped in Japanese media as potential successors.The end of his scandal-laden first stint as prime minister was the beginning of six years of annual leadership change, remembered as an era of “revolving door” politics that lacked stability and long-term policies.When he returned to office in 2012, Mr Abe vowed to revitalise the nation and get its economy out of its deflationary doldrums with his “Abenomics” formula, which combines fiscal stimulus, monetary easing and structural reforms.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4335701.1598013937!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit uk time wasting makes deal unlikely says barnier","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit negotiator Michel Barnier: “Frankly I am disappointed and I am worried.”  Photograph: Yves HermanPOOLAFP via Getty ImagesThe EU’s Brexit negotiator has warned that valuable time is being wasted in trade talks with the UK as he accused his British counterparts of failing to make progress on topics of key interest to Europe during the latest round of trade negotiations. Michel Barnier said he was disappointed, concerned and surprised by the lack of progress displayed in discussions that took place in Brussels this week, reiterating that at this stage an agreement between the two sides still looked unlikely and that there was a risk the two sides would fail to ratify a deal by the end of the year. “Too often this week it felt as if we were going backwards more than forwards,” Mr Barnier said at a press conference following the conclusion of the latest negotiations. “I simply do not understand why we are wasting valuable time.” The failure to advance the discussions that began on Tuesday evening leaves only a narrow window in which to agree the text of a trade agreement, translate it into multiple European languages and obtain ratification before the post-Brexit transition period ends on December 31st. While both the UK and EU insist they want a deal, EU officials decried a lack of momentum on the British side in the wake of Thursday’s session, with one describing it as “puzzling”. David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, acknowledged in a separate statement that there had been “little progress” during the week’s talks, but he also insisted that a deal remained possible even if it would not be easy to achieve.State aid and fisheriesThe EU wants the two sides to push towards a common understanding on the topics of state aid and fisheries, rather than leaving these highly sensitive topics until later in the talks, but British negotiators are seeking to advance to a legal text in other areas where the two sides are closer together.Lord Frost criticised the EU’s approach on Friday. “The EU is still insisting not only that we must accept continuity with EU state aid and fisheries policy, but also that this must be agreed before any further substantive work can be done in any other area of the negotiation, including on legal texts,” he said. “This makes it unnecessarily difficult to make progress.”Mr Barnier complained that he was not seeing any willingness on the UK side to take on board the EU’s priorities, adding that the need for a “level playing field” that ensures fair competition in areas including state aid would not go away and was a non-negotiable precondition to any trade deal.“No international agreement was ever reached without the parties agreeing to common rules,” he said. The notion of a zero-tariff, zero-quota agreement without level playing field provisions and a balanced deal on fisheries was a “non-starter” for the EU, and the absence of progress in these areas was blocking everything, he warned.British negotiating officials said the talks were stalling due to the problematic issues of fishing and state aid, over which they accused the EU of seeking to maintain the status quo.“What is frustrating is that Barnier wants to see us continuing arrangements very like those we had as members of the EU. The principle of ‘Brexit means Brexit’ is a good one and should be applied across the board,” the official said.“The process block now is that we must accept their position on state aid and fisheries before we can talk about anything else. We’re obviously not going to do that, so we’re frozen.”Key concernsMr Barnier confirmed that the UK had presented a draft legal text for the trade deal during the round of talks, but he added that this had not addressed the EU’s key concerns, serving instead as a reminder of the UK’s existing positions.Lord Frost added that the UK was seeking a relationship that ensures Britain regains “sovereign control of our own laws, borders, and waters” and is similar to other agreements struck by the EU elsewhere. “When the EU accepts this reality in all areas of the negotiation, it will be much easier to make progress.” A dinner between Mr Barnier and Lord Frost was held on Thursday evening after negotiations concluded, which officials suggested was tense following the lack of progress. “It was a very nice dinner, we had courteous and friendly discussions but we didn’t hide the difficulties between us,” one inidual said. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"dose classic boris boosterism key britains national recovery","story":"The Butchers Arms in Farmborough, Somerset, has finally reopened and I popped in with my children last weekend to remind them what society looked like before lockdown. It was bliss.One of the regulars let my daughter feed a biscuit to his Labrador (both were thrilled) and we all chatted to the landlady. She had reopened after seeing that so many local restaurants were thriving due to the Eat Out to Help Out scheme.It has made her think differently about other things, she said: she’s avoiding supermarkets, spending locally, supporting the shops she values most.It’s not often, nowadays, that you come across a government policy that actually works. But this one really seems to have done.At the Hop Pole in Bath (where my research continued), staff said they have been barely able to catch their breath on Eat Out to Help Out days, with business back up to normal the rest of the week.According to OpenTable, Britain is now one of the few countries to have restaurant bookings back to normal levels.But there was something lacking from the Eat Out scheme: Boris Johnson. Ministers had thought he’d play a big role in all this, which seemed straight from his Falstaffian brand of Merry England conservatism. But instead, the Prime Minister has been silent – with Rishi Sunak left to play the role of cheerleader-in-chief. In fact, when the scheme launched, the Prime Minister had switched back to Project Fear – saying a “second wave” was starting in Europe. People took this seriously, and still do. Restaurants aside, Brits are still staying at home.All this is crucifying the economy. Unemployment, about 1.3 million now, is soon expected to surge above three million when the furlough scheme finishes. The health effects that always accompany such downturns – depression, chronic disease – will likely claim far more lives than Covid-19. There might not have been much more that the Prime Minister could have done to reduce deaths from a virus whose infections peaked before lockdown, but there is plenty he can do to prevent the deaths of despair that always follow mass joblessness. The problem is sentiment – and there is much he can do to change that.It’s not unkind to say that Boris Johnson stands for boosterism: a belief that you can talk things into being, that words can shape events. His recent biography of Winston Churchill was obsessed with this. “He had the gift of language to put heart into people,” Mr Johnson writes, to “mobilise the English language” and give courage to others.Plenty of reviewers saw this book as his own personal manifesto – or, at the very least, his ideal model of leadership. His faith in the power of words, how a good leader can change the national mood, inspire and embolden. So far, he has used words to discourage. “Stay home, protect the NHS, save lives,” was a brutally effective slogan whose effect is with us still.For months, government messaging equated going outside with putting other people’s lives at risk: there was none of the nuance other European leaders were using at the time. “We made staying at home virtuous, like a national duty,” complains one minister. “We haven’t really changed that message.” The biggest surprise of lockdown was how seriously people took his advice: they stayed home far more than the official modelling suggested. They still do.You’d struggle to find any European country with fewer people back at work than Britain. We’re strikingly unwilling to return to shops, or use public transport. Brits are far more likely than French or Germans to worry about the safety of hot-desking at work. But the fear is understandable, given the official guidance. The UK Covid alert is still at Level Three – meaning it is not, yet, safe to say declare the number of cases as “low”. Given that hospital data shows the virus has fallen 96 per cent from its peak, it’s not clear when the test for “low” will be met.An obvious point is coming, which many ministers would like to be Get Back To Work day. After this Bank Holiday weekend, schools will be back and parents liberated – so Tuesday will be a big moment. With some 91 per cent of Scottish children back in the classroom last week, England can hope for similar levels.It’s an obvious juncture for the Prime Minister to start a campaign saying how important it is – for the sake of communities, cities and society – that people go back to work if they can. Yes, there is a risk. But with unemployment about to double, there is a bigger risk in delay.For most of this month the Prime Minister has been fretting about moving too early and ending up with a resurgence, like Donald Trump. But even American cases are now declining. Britain’s experience with the virus has been very similar to that of Sweden, with both countries now at the end of an epidemic curve. Hospital data, increasingly seen as more reliable than testing data, suggests no serious resurgence.So there is plenty of room for cautious optimism – and for leadership, which has been rather lacking in the past few weeks. Optimism has always been the Prime Minister’s stock-in-trade: it would be odd for him to abandon it, at a time when it’s needed most.As his columns in this newspaper made clear every week for years, his bias is towards liberty. He could easily combine this, now, with a public health argument – pointing out that restrictions, if left too long, will cause more harm than good. And every week that cities lie almost deserted, livelihoods are lost and businesses permanently closed.Those who have seen Mr Johnson recently say his health is now as strong as ever: he’s energetic and keen to get back in the public eye. After making the case for going back to school, it’s the natural next step for him to urge people to go back to work next week: for the sake of their company, the economy, their colleagues and themselves. The lesson of Eat Out to Help Out is that it was not (just) about money: people are keen to do what they can to start rebuilding and are waiting for the signal.Now would be the perfect time for the Prime Minister to give it.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"priti patel abandons deportation flight multiple last minute","story":"Priti Patel was forced to abandon a deportation flight returning illegal Channel migrants to Spain on Thursday after human rights lawyers mounted last-minute legal actions.Sources said the Home Office had been hit by so many last-minute legal claims that it had no option but to pull the flight, which would have returned 23 illegal migrants who had reached the UK on small boats from France.It came as the Home Office was embroiled in a row with lawyers over a video it posted on attempts to remove migrants from the UK, in which it said current regulations are allowing activist lawyers to delay and disrupt returns”.Ms Patel, the Home Secretary, is planning to overhaul asylum laws which she has reportedly claimed are being “exploited by leftie Labour-supporting lawyers” who were doing everything to stop the Government removing people.She is working on a “fair borders bill,” to be introduced this year, which would stop people drawing out the asylum applications process by making them declare all their grounds for refugee status when they apply, rather than being able to submit new reasons later.She is understood to be “furious” at the recent legal attempts to stop Britain clamping down on dangerous migrant crossings in the English Channel by ensuring those who attempt it are returned to the first country in which they arrived and where they should have applied for asylum.A Whitehall source said: There was 100 per cent legal attrition rate on the flight due to unprecedented and organised casework barriers sprung on the government by law firms. We have lots more planned over coming weeks and months. It is not going to deter us.”The Madrid authorities had agreed to take back the migrants who had passed through Spain on their attempted journey to Britain. Under the Dublin Agreement, EU countries accept back migrants if it can be shown it was their first port of entry to the EU where they should have applied for asylum.The illegal migrants lawyers were, however, able to bog the process down in legal quagmire, according to the Whitehall insider.It is thought they would have claimed breaches under the European Convention on Human Rights including their rights to a family life (on the basis that they may have claimed relatives in the UK) or that they risked persecution if they were denied asylum in the UK.Lawyers are also increasingly using modern slavery legislation to claim that they are victims of traffickers rather than illegal migrants in order to claim a right to live in the UK.A Home Office spokesman said: “The Government’s efforts to facilitate entirely legitimate and legal returns of people who have entered the UK through illegal routes are too often frustrated by last minute challenges submitted hours before a scheduled flight. “These claims are very often baseless and entirely without merit, but are given full legal consideration, leading to removal being rescheduled. This can effectively result in the timing out of a return due to stringent Dublin Regulations.”The legal battle came less than 24 hours after the Home Office published a video online on Wednesday evening, which showed a graphic of planes leaving the UK with the caption: We are working to remove migrants with no right to remain in the UK.Lawyers branded it an assault on the rule of law using isive and deceptive language.Jonathan Portes, a professor of economics at King\u0027s College London, complained to Matthew Rycroft, permanent secretary at the Home Office, about the video.In a post on Twitter, Professor Portes quoted Mr Rycroft’s response as: I agree the phrase you quote should not have been used on an official government channel.I have made clear to the team this post should not be used again from Home Office accounts or anywhere else by civil servants.The Home Office press office confirmed the response was accurate and that it would no longer be using the video or the phrases included in the footage. However, it would not be removing the original post.Mr Portes later added that it was a very clear breach of Government communications standards and urged department press offices to take note and that the unacceptable behaviour is not repeated.The clip, viewed more than a million times in less than 24 hours, prompted fierce criticism of Home Secretary Priti Patel\u0027s department, with a string of legal and political figures wading into the debate.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"republican presidential hopefuls use spotlight jostle 2024 nomination","story":"Mike Pence\u0027s address to the Republican National Convention was the latest by a string of prominent Republicans to use the limelight to position themselves for the 2024 presidential race.As Vice President, Mr Pence has positioned himself squarely behind Donald Trump, and will be one of the frontrunners in the race to succeed him.Addressing the convention live from Fort McHenry, in Baltimore, the site of an unsuccessful British assault in 1814, Mr Pence offered a full-throttle endorsement of the US president and their accomplishments over the last four years.The Vice President did not hold back on his attacks on Joe Biden, calling the Democrat a Trojan horse for the radical left who would put America on a path of socialism and decline.But Mr Pence has also sought to quietly differentiate himself from the US president, steering clear of Mr Trump\u0027s most isive and explosive comments.The Vice President is aware that, in as little as three months, the race to succeed Mr Trump could well be underway.It is not just Mr Pence who has hinted at his presidential ambitions - Nikki Haley, the former UN ambassador, and senator Tim Scott have both stoked speculation about their own futures with their keynote addresses at this week\u0027s convention.All three speakers devoted a large amount of their speaking time to spell out their backstories, taking care to thoroughly introduce themselves to the American public.Mr Pence discussed his Christian roots and his strong family network, a reminder of his crucial role in securing the support of white evangelical voters for Mr Trump in 2016.Ms Haley shared the story of her Indian parents\u0027 journey to the US, describing how their success led her to become the first female and first Indian governor of South Carolina, a validation of the American Dream.Mr Scott, the sole black Republican senator, detailed how his family went from cotton to Congress in one lifetime with his electoral success in an overwhelmingly white district in South Carolina.While Mr Pence\u0027s speech offered a ringing endorsement of Mr Trump, Ms Haley and Mr Scott offered more measured speeches, carving out their own political identities.All presidential hopefuls know they must balance a delicate tightrope ahead of November\u0027s election. If the Republicans lose the White House and control of the US Senate, as some polls suggest they will, a reckoning over the party\u0027s future seems inevitable. On the other hand, an election victory could cement the Republican Party\u0027s position as the party of Trump for years to come.But in the event of a resounding Trump victory, the president\u0027s natural successor may not be his deputy Mr Pence - but his eldest son, Donald Trump Jnr, who also addressed the convention this week.An articulate speaker, Donald Jnr has publicly hinted at his interest in a future run for office, and shares his father\u0027s talent for connecting with the party\u0027s voter base.The younger Mr Trump has previously been called Trumpier than Trump on account of his bellicose rhetoric and willingness to delve into controversies when it comes to his discussions of racial tensions and other sensitive topics.One thing is clear: win or lose, President Trump could play a decisive role in who succeeds him.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that

do if you got a cheeselog in your moggie cake, chances are she wouldn’t be able to understand you.But now, the language experts who develop the AI technology for Amazon\u0027s voice assistant hope to change that by adding hundreds of regional words to its vocabulary.The move should help Alexa understand that someone asking about a cheeselog in a moggie cake is someone facing the dilemma of a woodlouse in their bread roll.Words and phrases will include “ta-ra” or “toodle pip” for goodbye, and the greeting “ey up”, and the voice assistant will even learn that Slaters, Gramersows, Woodpigs and Granny Greys are all different names for terrestrial isopods, most commonly known as “woodlice”.The extensive vocabulary update will mean that if users fancy a cup of tea, or “brew” in Manchester, Alexa will understand them, and even the cockney rhyming slang “rosy lee”.That\u0027s of course not to be confused with “tea”, otherwise known as “dinner” down south and “supper” by some, all of which the assistant will now register.Long gone will be the confusion over bread rolls, with Alexa able to provide information on the freshest “baps” in Scotland, “barms” in the north west, and “cobs” in the midlands.Those who speak cockney rhyming slang will also be able to order “strides” if they mean trousers, and tell Alexa that they’re “hank marvin” or starving hungry.One of the terms with the most alternatives is ways of talking about snacks of various kinds. Elevenses, munchies, afters and nibbles will all be part of the new vocabulary update, as well as tiffin (which has origins in India), snap (used in the East Midlands and parts of Yorkshire and derived from a snap tin used by miners), bait (used across the country to mean everything from a packed lunch to a short break for food) and lowence and looances (both from Yorkshire).While many will disagree about the exact meanings and use of some of the terms, if Alexa users are still fed up that she can\u0027t understand them, they can tell her that she\u0027s talking nonsense with the words rubbish, tosh, twoddle, tripe, keech or poppycock.The move will come as welcome news after a 2018 report from the Life Science Centre in Newcastle warned that voice assistant technology could threaten regional accents.The report claimed that four fifths of speakers with regional accents say they deliberately adjust the way they speak when using voice recognition systems.Users who still feel like they need to adapt their voice to have Alexa to understand them are encouraged to persevere.Amazon says that the incorporated machine-learning means the more people talk to her, the more she gets to know their specific voice, although preloading her with the phrases should help with some of the trickier words.In order to better recognise the erse range of dialects in the UK, language experts at Amazon’s Cambridge Development Centre will also train Alexa on the variations of British speech, including phonological variation, from the distinctive Scottish rolling \u0027r\u0027 to the use of long vowels in the south of England. The latest additions are part of a collaboration with lexicographer Susie Dent, who

Our local languages are constantly evolving and changing.It is virtually impossible for people to learn every single phrase and utterance, but with technology getting smarter all the time, perhaps one day assistants such as Alexa will understand everything from ‘dabberlick’ (tall and skinny) to ‘crumpsy\u0027 (grumpy).”It’s not just voice assistants that struggle with Britain’s rich landscape of regional language: over a third of people (34 per cent) say they struggle to understand British dialects with 52 per cent admitting they just nod along when they do not understand.Amazon asked 2,000 Brits about regional dialects and found a third of people (34 per cent) have admitted to changing the way they speak in order to be understood. A fifth of people (18 per cent) feel too embarrassed to speak up when they do not understand regional phrases and words.Dennis Stansbury, Alexa UK country manager, said: “Unlike us, Alexa cannot feign understanding through nodding, so in the instance Alexa mishears a word or question, the team have worked hard on ways to get better at understanding these, like Alexa asking follow up questions to clarify what you might mean. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"five things learnt republican convention","story":"Donald Trump became the first ever president to hold a party convention from the White House as he closed out the Republican National Convention on Thursday night.The decision to deliver his Republican presidential nomination acceptance speech from the White House\u0027s South Lawn broke with a long-running custom to separate the so-called people\u0027s house from political campaigning.But it was not just Mr Trump\u0027s decision to deliver his speech from a podium marked with the presidential seal that caused a stir.Here are five key takeaways from the event.More than a fifth of speakers this week are either related to Mr Trump or work for him, underscoring the dominance the US president now holds over the Republican Party. The president\u0027s grip over the Party was affirmed with the decision to drop the custom of adopting a policy platform. Instead, the party simply chose to express its enthusiastic support for Mr Trump\u0027s (rather vague) agenda. Gone too were the party\u0027s elder statesmen, who usually use their gravitas to recommend the presidential candidate to voters. The party\u0027s only surviving former president, George W Bush, was reportedly not invited to attend, having failed to endorse Mr Trump in 2016. The 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, and his running mate Paul Ryan, who have both criticised Mr Trump, were also absent. In their place, lesser known figures who have shown loyalty to Mr Trump were given speaking slots. One phrase cropped up again and again throughout this week\u0027s convention: law and order. Republican officials used the four-night convention to sound the alarm over the unrest tearing through the country, warning that only Mr Trump could bring the violence and lawlessness to an end. The party has a clear aim here: to shift focus away from the grim coronavirus figures and reframe the election campaign around urban unrest. The rhetoric has been seen as a coded message about the racial tensions simmering within the country, and an attempt to win back white suburban voters who appear to be abandoning the president. The First Lady outlined her own agenda with her prime-time Rose Garden address, tackling America\u0027s racial inequality and offering a message of optimism and unity that jarred with the tone of other speakers. Mrs Trump urged Americans to “reflect on our mistakes”, saying “we are not proud of parts of our history”, in a message at odds with those who took to the convention stage before her.  She also tackled the huge toll of the coronavirus on Americans, extending her “deepest sympathy” to those who lost loved ones in the pandemic. With such a striking contrast in tone to that of her husband, one almost wonders if it was a deliberate move by the First Lady to highlight her differences with the president. Several high-profile Republicans made clear through their keynote addresses that they already have their eye on the 2024 Republican primary.Mike Pence, the US Vice President, used his address to reintroduce himself to voters, deftly managing to voice his enthusiastic support for Mr Trump while also distancing himself from the president\u0027s bombastic rhetoric.Nikki Haley, the former UN ambassador, and senator Tim Scott talked at length about their personal stories, bucking the trend of other convention speakers by tempering their praise of Mr Trump in far more measured speeches.Donald Trump Jnr\u0027s prime-time speech also offered him the chance to audition for a potential presidential bid, echoing his father\u0027s rhetoric and proving he shares his rare ability to connect with the conservative base.Despite the party\u0027s promise of an upbeat convention that would offer an optimistic view of the country under Mr Trump\u0027s leadership, the four days were instead largely characterised by dark warnings about America\u0027s future and the threat posed by Democrats. The majority of convention speakers used fear-based rhetoric to warn that under Joe Biden, the White House would become a vessel for socialism and criminals would be given free reign. Congressman Matt Gaetz, a vocal supporter of Mr Trump, told the convention that Democrats will disarm you, empty the prisons, lock you in your home and invite MS-13 to live next door.In another fiery speech, Donald Trump Jr told voters the choice was between: “church, work, and school vs. rioting, looting and vandalism - or, in the words of Biden and the Democrats, ‘peaceful protesting’.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"japans pm shinzo abe announce resignation","story":"Japan\u0027s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is to announce his resignation over health issues, local media reported on Friday, hours before he is due to address a press conference.Abe intends to resign as his illness has worsened and he worries it will cause trouble in leading the country, national broadcaster NHK said, without citing a source.Speculation about the prime minister\u0027s health has been swirling for weeks but reached fever pitch in recent days after he made two separate trips to hospital for unspecified medical checks.Mr Abe this week became the nation’s longest serving prime minister in consecutive days, an achievement overshadowed by persistent speculation surrounding his health.The Nikkei fell 2 per cent following the news and the yen tumbled against the dollar.The conservative member of parliament returned as prime minister for a rare second term in December 2012, pledging to revive growth with his Abenomics mix of hyper-easy monetary policy, fiscal spending and reforms.On Monday, he surpassed a record for longest consecutive tenure as premier set by his great-uncle Eisaku Sato half a century ago.Under fire for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and scandals among party members, Abe has recently seen his support fall to one of the lowest levels of his nearly eight years in office.He has beefed up military spending and expanded the role of the armed forces, but his dream of revising the pacifist constitution has failed due to ided public opinion.He resigned abruptly as prime minister in 2007, citing ill-health after a year plagued by scandals in his cabinet and a huge election loss for his ruling party.

Usually there is at least a soloist,not a full choir leading the audience, but of course this year the public seats in the hall will be empty because of the virus, and the voices on stage silenced.Now, the lyrics of both songs are pro-colonial. If you ban them from the Last Night of the Proms, ending a tradition going back decades, what consequences will that have Certainly, someone  years from now will say we shouldn’t have done that.It is the same argument for not taking down statues. If you remove statues because that person stands for something evil in their past, you are removing the deed too.Manipulating history only adds to mistrust among the black community.I would like to see the survey that says the public want these two songs taken out of the Proms programme, because it appears to me that the public hasn’t been consulted.Rule, Britannia! was written by Scottish poet James Thomson and he features on the famous Scott Monument in Edinburgh, near where I live.He is also commemorated in Westminster Abbey’s Poets’ Corner, next to William Shakespeare.If we say we must remove his words from the Proms, do we then remove the memorials too Rule, Britannia!, written and set to music in , was mentioned in James Joyce’s novel, Ulysses. It is part of my history and my culture. If we take it away, we take away part of my culture.It’s a song about the power structure at the time, and the arrogance and hypocrisy of Britain vowing to “never be slaves” while at the same time owning and benefiting from about , black chattel slaves in the West Indies who were called ‘property’.Of course, people are sensitive to its meaning, as well as Land Of Hope And Glory, the music of which was written by Edward Elgar.It doesn’t mean we should hide it.I personally don’t find the lyrics offensive because they are a true representation of the terrible truth at the time.If you take that away, then you are replacing history with a fairy story.There is also the possibility that it was written to show the evil of the time, rather than glorying it.The objection is that Rule, Britannia! is used by flag-waving “prommers” as a jubilant finale at the Proms.It is used in the wrong context, and that is part of the ignorance of our society of our history.It’s the same with Amazing Grace, which was written by a slaver of black people and is sung as a religious anthem.Recently, it was proposed that we should ban Swing Low, Sweet Chariot at rugby matches due to its link to slavery. That came to nothing.Instead of banning such songs or stripping away their lyrics, we need to educate people on the history of slavery, starting with putting it on the history curriculum.From speaking to people about slavery, the one constant reaction is always: “Why didn’t anyone tell us this before ”At the Proms, instead of taking the words away, we should put an explanation in the programme. We should tell people it’s about enslaving black people, making money from them, giving them a short le span and then compensating the slave owners when it was abolished because slaves were regarded as ‘property’.If they want to sing it after reading that, then fine, go ahead and sing it. But I bet they won’t sing it as joyfully as they might have done before.When I worked in research, I once had a lovely technician who worked for me. She looked after me so well, and she went to the Proms.If she knew the history of those two songs, being my friend, I doubt she would have sung along.It wasn’t her fault that she didn’t know the history.Those songs didn’t have a place in the Proms in the first place, they are there because of people’s ignorance. I would challenge anyone to know their meanings and still sing them in a frivolous capacity.But we shouldn’t be bothering ourselves about whether those songs should now be removed.What we should be bothering ourselves about is increasing the representation of black people who are the descendants of slaves. We should be concerning ourselves about making sure black people from the Windrush generation get compensation. And we should also be ensuring ourselves that every child is taught the history of slavery so that they can make their own minds up about whether to sing songs like these.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At last, after an unprecedented lockdown of six months, all schools are due to re-open, representing a giant leap back towards normality. But the damage caused by the Coronavirus disruption has been severe.Many parents have been prevented from ing to work. Young people’s education has been badly undermined, especially because the quality of online learning has been so uneven. One study found that a fth of pupils had less than an hour’s instruction a day. Moreover, social activities and friendships – which are a vital part of growing up – have been heavily restricted.The exam chaos over the last fortnight was a fitting symbol of the vacuum created by the absence of proper schooling. No advanced society canwhen a vital sector like education is temporarily paralysed. That is why it is so important that the Government succeeds in its goal of seeing a fullto the classroom. As Boris Johnson put it at the weekend, “it is vital for pupils’ education. It is vital for their welfare. It’s vital for their physical and, indeed, mental well-being.”Given the Government’s mixed record on its management of the Covid crisis, this will be a big test. From the inadequate supply of protective gear to the botched imposition of quarantine rules, Ministers have got it badly wrong at times. They cannot afford another fiasco next week.But to do that, they will have to curtail the influence of militant teaching unions, which thrive in a climate of scare-mongering and grievance. Full of negativity, these hardened left-wing operators turn every pebble of dficulty into a giant boulder of obstruction. They are the abominable no men and women, the ultimate “can’t do” brigade.To overcome the unions’ capacity for trouble-making, reassurances about safety will be absolutely crucial. Most teachers are keen to go back to work, but they want to know schools will not be dangerous environments. That is why the recent upbeat advice from medical experts has been so welcome. It is clear from the Covid experience around the world that not only are children less likely to transmit the disease than any other group, but also that schools are safer than most other workplaces. Yesterday, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries pointed out that a child is more likely to be involved in a traffic accident or die from flu than to be harmed by Coronavirus.That message was also spelt out by her boss Chris Whitty, who said on Sunday that the damage to health caused by a continued schools lockdown is potentially greater than the impact of Covid. “The balance of risk is very strongly in favour of children going to school,” he declared, adding the chances of catching the disease “are incredibly small.” In fact, there is now hard evidence to prove this. Although the vast majority of schools were closed since March, over one million pupils – such as the children of essential workers – went back to the classroom in June. Yet a comprehensive study by Public Health England showed that in the subsequent weeks until the end of term, just  children and  staff tested positive for Covid- – and nearly all these infections occurred outside the school. There were hardly any cases of children passing on the disease to each other, or to their teachers. Other research from around the world has come to the same conclusion.But none of this seems to matter to the teaching unions, eager to exploit anxiety in pursuit of their anti-Tory agenda. These are the organisations which for decades have blocked every major reform of the education system and have defended every outdated working practice. With depressing inevitability, they have continually put their own narrow interests before the wider needs of pupils. They want the respect due to trained professionals but they frequently display the rebellious spirit of the permanent agitators. “Strike action is a very powerful tool,” said Amanda Martin, the President of the ,-strong National Education Unionin an interview with the Communist Morning Star newspaper in , adding, “I’ve run demos and rallies and worked with trade councils to bring everyone out and that’s brilliant.”Led by the NEU, the unions have brought the same attitude to the Coronavirus crisis. Instead of looking for solutions, they have endlessly exaggerated problems. One Whitehall insider says of Dr Mary Bousted, the £,-a-year joint general secretary of the NEU, “it’s all about the union, to hell with the teachers who want to get back into the classroom – let alone the children.” A left-wing radical, Bousted jokes that the word “strike” was one of the first she learnt as a child. Hers is not the voice of co-operation and enterprise, so it is hardly surprising that the Government has struggled to get schools reopened.In June, a planned majorwas thwarted by the unions, dealing a severe blow to Gavin Williamson’s credibility. One left-wing website gushed that the continued shutdown was due “to the hard work of NEU branch secretaries and rank and file militants galvanising the members.” In the months since, an alliance of unions – including Bousted’s NEU and Unite led by the notorious Merseyside militant Len McCluskey – have fought a y battle against a swt re-opening. Central to this effort at sabotage was a vast -point checklist of detailed questions which the Department for Education was told it had to answer. Dubbed by critics “a wreckers’ charter”, the list included queries such as “will lidded bins with double bagging be available in every classroom”, “will dedicated space be available for any breastfeeding women to express milk” and “has behaviour policy been reviewed to acknowledge the increased level of trauma and anxiety experienced by pupils ” Some Tories complained that the union was playing politics. Robert Halfon, the chairman of the Education Select Committee was amazed at the warped priorities: “It is incredible that not one of these nit-picking questions asks the most important thing of all – what’s best for the kids ”Even as September approaches, the whining and resistance has not ceased. “The unions need to stand firm and protect their members,” argues socialist teacher Martin Powell-Davies. In the latest ruse, the public sector outfit UNISON not only wants its members to wear masks in the classroom – something for which there is no scientic evidence of any need – but also to have extra funding for deep cleaning. “Schools need more money to pay for specially trained cleaners, rather than relying on other staff who are busy enough already,” says Jon Richards, UNISON’s head of education. The moan about over-stretched budgets is a favourite of the union movement but it is an empty accusation. The Government is pouring an extra £. billion into education, while this summer it was announced that teachers’ pay is to go up by an average of . per cent, a bigger increase than any other public sector workers received.But that did nothing to stop the combination of whingeing and shroud-waving. The mentality of the hardliners was embodied in a recent statement from the NEU’s far left “Education Solidarity Network” which set out a series of demands to “make sure safety comes first.” Among them were: “smaller class sizes to allow adequate physical distancing” arrangements “for rotas and home learning to be produced in consultation with parents” “local risk assessments to include staggered outdoor breaks, sanitising, provision of transparent coverings to enable access to lip reading and facial expression” and “weekly onsite testing of staff”. Above all, the Network called for extra funding “to implement these measures.” If there were any question of a risk to safety, the union should “prepare for a national strike ballot.”That was so typical. This lot seem to feel more comfortable on the picket line than in the classroom. The Solidary Network might be seen as extreme, but its carping outlook runs right through the unionYesterday, the NEU’s joint general secretary was bleating on the airwaves about the risks of new Covid spikes: “Staff, parents and pupils are being sorely let down by the government because of a lack of a Plan B and of ensuring robust track and trace is in place throughout the country. We believe the Government is negligent in the extreme.” The charge of negligence might be applied with more force to the NEU, whose hostile stance has made thesuch an exhausting obstacle course.

I cannot remember any government being so devoid of direction, leadership, policy, conviction and — frankly — intelligence.And I had to endure Ted Heath AND John Major’s attempts to run the country. Oh, and the shaft of glorious sunshine that was Gordon Brown. Those guys have nothing on Boris. He is the clear leader in the field. If you ever wanted to know what a country would look likeit was led by Frank Spencer, here you go. Yes, I know — I’m showing my age. To be honest, under this administration I’m feeling my age.For those who don’t remember, Frank was a bumbling, dithering, halfwit from the s sitcom Some Mothers Do ’Ave ’Em. The only dference with Bojo is that Frank was thinner. And, mercully, a fictional creation. Boris is all too real. Many kids will be going back to school wearing face masks. For ages, this government insisted that they would not have to do so. Now they’ve changed their minds. Face masks and grouped in “bubbles”. Probably getting only about half of their usual education,that. Any kid who coughs will be pounced upon, exiled to the Outer Hebrides and the entire school shuts down. Never mind that there has been no recorded case of a schoolkid passing on the virus to a teacher.Never mind that our economy needs the schools fully open with a proper, normal, timetable, so people can get back to work.After six months of no lessons , the kids now have to endure insufferable conditions at school.This is because Boris and the rest have proved utterly incapable of standing up to the teaching unions .Other U-turns have involved the wearing of masks in shops, the usefulness of masks in general, whether there’s any point in closing our borders, the schools due to re-open in June, the scrapping of an expensive track and trace system, the re-grading of GCSEs and A levels . . . oh lordy, the list goes on and on.Sometimes the U-turn appears only a day after the original decision.Sometimes we have to wait a week or so. But come they surely do, a long parade of staggering ineptitude. In fact, I think even Frank Spencer would have been more decisive. Maybe the right comparison is with Benny from Crossroads. Yes, it’s my age again. For those who don’t know, Benny was a cast-iron moron.We know that dealing with this horrible pandemic can’t have been easy. We know Boris has had a dficult year.But the utter lack of planning and resolve has been astonishing. Slow to take the virus seriously, bizarrely refusing to close our airports at the peak of the outbreak, hopelessly lost over track and trace and what do with our poor kids.This has been mismanagement on an almost heroic level. My guess is that Boris will not survive as Prime Minister: His party will get shot of him when the opportunity arises. Because here’s the crucial, damaging question.Could Jeremy Corbyn have handled this crisis any worse I DON’T think those smug monkeys at the BBC realised the fury they would unleash when they banned singing our favourite anthems at The Last Night Of The Proms.A petition reached , names in just  hours.And Dame Vera Lynn is suddenly at No in the iTunes chart with Land Of Hope And Glory.The BBC apparently agreed with the Finnish conductor, Dalia Stasevska, that the “jingoistic” words of Land Of Hope And Glory and Rule Britannia would not be heard this year.I wonder what convinced Ms Stasevska to agree to conduct an evening of patriotic songs when she hates patriotic songs Money, you would guess. Meanwhile another BBC bureaucrat, Cat Lewis, likened singing the songs to Nazis singing about gas chambers.Silly woman. The BBC – its entire staff – has no understanding of the British people. It despises them. Support for the corporation is at an all-time low. And yet the BBC is still up to its tricks. Pulling off the unusual feat of being already in a coffin, but reaching out somehow to hammer more nails into its own lid.A TEAM of British scientists has been studying dreams and what they mean.And they’ve discovered they mean sod all. They are just a continuation of memories from the previous day.Other recent studies showed the same thing. So,you dream you’re flying around your house with some bats, it means you were probably thinking about bats when you were awake.It doesn’t mean you’re neurotic or sexually repressed. So – that’s all the work of Sigmund Freud in the bin. It can go in a black bin liner along with the idiocies put forward by that other drongo of the th Century, Karl Marx. But given that we know all this, why are there still psychoanalysts plying their trade  Is it just to give Britain’s couch-makers plenty of work ANOTHER stupid, virtue-signalling British firm has run into trouble.Avanti West Coast made a big fuss about its new “pride train”, which runs from London to Manchester.The engine is painted in the colours of the LGBT rainbow flag.And it has the word “Pride” written in big letters – just in case anyone doesn’t get the message.

Pester and pester until they give in.POOR old slabhead, then.

Then he tried to bribe them.⚠️Click here for the latest news on Harry MaguireGod help us all.I have always admired Maguire’s heading ability.It now seems to me that he gets so much force behind each header because he has reinforced concrete between his ears. Footballers are not renowned for being terribly bright.But Maguire has lowered the bar still further.One of the problems is the one to which the footballer alluded. He has too much money. So much that he doesn’t know what to do with it.And as a result is completely insulated from the real world. And when he does venture out into the real world it is to be continually abused by halfwits who do not like the club he plays for.Say sorry to the Greeks, Harry.

It’s going to take all our institutions to stand up for our values.Los Angeles Lakers star James was one of a number of NBA players to support the boycott, tweeting: F*** THIS MAN!!!! WE DEMAND CHANGE. SICK OF IT last night.However, not everyone was impressed with NBAs decision. Donald Trumps son-in-law and advisor Jared Kushner questioned players motivations for protesting Blakes shooting.Kushner said he planned to reach out to James about it, according to a PBS reporter. “NBA players are very fortunate that they have the financial position where theyre able to take a night off from work without having to have the consequences to themselves financially, he told reporters today. His comments come after NBA postponed the three playoff games after the Milwaukee Bucks decided to call off their fixture in protest.They confirmed that Bucks vs. Orlando Magic, Houston Rockets vs. Oklahoma City Thunder and Los Angeles Lakers vs. Portland Trail Blazers would be rescheduled.The Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers had voted to end the NBA season on Wednesday.After calling off their game against the Orlando Magic, the Bucks players released a statement that said: Despite the overwhelming plea for change, there has been no action, so our focus today cannot be on basketball.When we take the court and represent Milwaukee and Wisconsin, we are expected to play at a high level, give maximum effort and hold each other accountable.We hold ourselves to that standard, and in this moment, we are demanding the same from our lawmakers and law enforcement.We are calling for justice for Jacob Blake and demand the officers be held accountable.Game five of the Bucks and the Magic was due to tip off at .pm local time, but as the start time neared the Milwaukee players didnt leave the locker room.They were supposed to appear ten minutes earlier and when they didnt, officials headed to the locker room before news of the boycott broke.Magic players had appeared on the court, but withdrew about four minutes before the scheduled start time.The Bucks lead the best-of-seven series -.Earlier on Wednesday, it was revealed that players of the Toronto Raptors and Boston Celtics, who meet on Thursday, were also considering a boycott.Denver Nuggets guard Jamal Murray said, WE DEMAND JUSTICE!!!

As a result, very few people watch it — but it’s the toast of Beeb journos and left-wing social media, giving it undeserved influence over our daily news agenda.Despite her dressing-down over that outrageous Dominic Cummings monologue, Emily Maitlis is considered untouchable by executives. No one dares warn her that constant unbalanced questioning of Tory politicians and right-wing commentators is putting the very future of the Beeb under threat.And then there’s Lewis Goodall, the left-wing operative turned Newsnight policy editor who last week was allowed to author a feature for the New Statesman magazine headlined: “Failed. How the Government’s ineptitude created a lost generation.”As Theresa May’s former communications chief Sir Robbie Gibb put it: “Is there anyone more damaging to the BBC’s reputation for impartiality than Lewis Goodall ”I’ve read the thinly veiled left-wing think piece so you don’t have to.Goodall’s main thesis is to try to link the Covid-created A-level exams situation to the Windrush scandal.If it had been written by Owen Jones in the , I’d understand.But a full-time BBC staff member who we are consistently told is an impartial journalist, with no bias against the Government  Puh-lease!

They cannot stand anyone who dares not vote Labour or Lib Dem. They will never forgive Brexit voters for destroying their European fantasy.And they fetishise Nicola Sturgeon’s unrealistic idea of Scottish independence.But this week, as Dame Vera Lynn’s version of Land Of Hope And Glory hurtled towards the top of the iTunes chart, the fight back began.SINCERE condolences to Sir Ed Davey on winning the Liberal Democrat leadership yesterday.My thoughts are with you at this dficult time.SARAH Harding is the fighter of the entertainment industry.Vulnerable to a fault, during her time in Girls Aloud she shared her many trials and tribulations with that trademark throaty laugh and a glint in her eye.Unlike so many pop stars, there was never a hint of ego. In fact, Sarah is her own harshest critic.To discover that over the past few months she has privately been fighting the biggest battle of her le – breast cancer that has spread across her body – was truly a punch- in-the-guts moment for my generation, who idolised Sarah, Cheryl, Nadine, Kimberley and Nicola.I pray that she overcomes the odds, as she always has in her ied and accomplished career.And then reunites with Girls Aloud, as planned, for the band’s th anniversary in .THE great irony about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s newly revealed courtship with Jeremy Corbyn is that he’d love to see the monarchy abolished and Harry’s gran see out her days living in a council house.But so craven are Harry and Meghan for left-wing approval, they appeared to relish the post-Megxit support from the former Labour leader.New book Left Out: The Inside Story Of Labour Under Corbyn reveals that at the Commonwealth Day Service in March, where Prince William infamously snubbed the couple, Corbyn’s we Laura Alez, gave them a book about the th Century Mexican poet Juana Ines de la Cruz, “a nun whose willingness to attack the hypocrisies of the colonial classes had made her a target for establishment hate”. Harry and Meghan later sent a personal note of “great thanks” to Jeremy and Laura, writing: “Cruz is a fascinating historical figure, and we look forward to learning more about her le and works. Thanks for the support.”That revelation came one day after Meghan made her first intervention into this year’s US election, with a not-at-all-subtle anti-Trump message to American voters, suggesting: “We all know what’s at stake this year”.I have long been told by those close to her that Meghan harbours political ambitions and would one day like to end up in elected office.Which is absolutely fine.But to continue to use the Duchess title and represent the Queen on the Commonwealth Trust is highly inappropriate.I’d have great respectshe would cut the cords entirely and become a political activistwithout causing a massive diplomatic headache for the Royal Family.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Meanwhile, the germs usually responsible for worsening attacks of bronchitis, pneumonia or chronic lung disease can cause symptoms similar to Covid-, making accurate diagnosis and correct treatment much more dficult.But there is no need for people to panic.Admissions to hospital and mortality related to Covid- are declining.There were only  admissions on Wednesday, while just  new Covid deaths were reported yesterday.That compares to around  or more deaths per day during the peak of the pandemic, at the end of April.Testing is also improving. More than , tests were processed yesterday and it is vital that testing and tracing continues.There is no room at all for complacency.Test-and-trace will tell us exactly what it is that we are dealing with.But it is now more important than ever to know the dferences between the ious winter infections that might come our way. It is easy to panic, thinking we might have coronavirus when it is merely a cold.Equally, we could easily miss the chance of early treatment for Covid-we ignore its earliest symptoms.Millions of people will suffer this winter from sore throats, norovirus, influenza sinusitis, ear infections, allergies, conjunctivitis, ­­migraines, whooping cough and pneumonia.The Government tells us to stay alert. So how can we help ourselves to see the wood from the trees It is always good to bear in mind the possibility of coronavirus but the symptom checklist below can help to provide you with a dferential diagnosis, as doctors call it, to pinpoint your problem.Prevention is always better than cure and the good news is that all the measures we ought to be taking to protect ourselves from coronavirus should also help reduce the risk of these winter bugs.Frequent hand-washing, wearing of masks, social distancing and cleaning hard surfaces with bleach will all help keep us healthier. Another of the most ­important things you can do, as winter approaches, is to book your flu jab.If we protect the most vulnerable people in society by making them immune to seasonal flu, we can protect all the others with whom they come into contact.That is why this winter the Government aims to immunise up to  million people — twice as many as usual.

Mass redundancies are being announced with grim regularity, and I fear we will see more unless the government urgently changes course. The furlough scheme, a leline during the coronavirus crisis for many, is now being withdrawn from all businesses, whatever their circumstance. That blanket approach completely ignores that some sectors and regions have been much harder hit than others. Since August, employers have been required to pay for the pension and national insurance contributions of their furloughed staff. And in just three days, from September , employers across the country will also be required to pay % of the salary of their furloughed employees. That rule applies to all businesses across the board. Whether your business is trading well, whether it’s slowly recovering but still struggling, or whether it cannot operate properly or at all due to local lockdown restrictions, the furlough leline is being pulled away, come what may. It’s clearly illogical and unfair to treat every business in this unorm way. * What do you think  Do you agree  Have your say in the comments below Hospitality, retail and key manufacturing industries have been particularly hard hit by job losses, with thousands already announced and more predicted by trade bodies. Some businesses, such as night clubs, are still totally locked down. They are rightly following the public-health measures and are therefore unable to bring in any income, yet are being asked to paythey want to protect their employees’ jobs. The government is also failing to recognise that its approach could mean making this country more unequal with parts of the UK still under local lockdowns, and some areas of the UK having more of the businesses that have been worst affected by the crisis. It would be far better to be targeting those sectors that really need the help than offering £, to every business next February for every worker they take back off furlough. That policy means an awful lot of money is being spent on workers who would have been rehired anyway in sectors that are recovering after lockdown. Germany and France have schemes in place enabling workers to be put on part-time working and have the rest of their wage subsidised. Extended support, targeted at key sectors, could work in a similar way. The government has said they cannot save every job, but in taking this rigid approach, they are washing their hands of every livelihood still under threat. Plan to care  There’s been a % rise in the number of children needing foster care during this pandemic, and Labour has called for a proper plan from government to ensure children moving into the care system can access the support they need. On this week’s episode of my podcast Reasons to be Cheerful, we talk with the poet and writer Lemn Sissay about My Name is Why – his powerful memoir about growing up in the care system. Lemn talks about his -year battle to access his records and why it was so important to tell his story. Zombie horror  Boris Johnson this week blamed the A-level exam fiasco on a “mutant algorithm”. It does make you wonder whether this government will ever take responsibility for anything. He’d previously said the results system was “robust” as did Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. Distress was caused to so many young people, and the government can’t even say the buck stops with them. It feels much more a case of a zombie government than a mutant algorithm to me. Grants clawback will hit jobs    High streets across the country have been hit hard by this pandemic. We’ve seen waves of job losses from household names like MS, WH Smith, Pizza Express, John Lewis and Boots. And while retail sales overall are rebounding, sales at department stores and clothing shops are still down on pre-pandemic levels. More than a billion remains unused of the Government’s business grants funds, with many thousands of firms having been locked out of support. But the Business Secretary wants local councils tothat money by the end of the month. That can’t be right when so many firms are still struggling. Labour has called for that underspend to be turned into a Hospitality and High Streets Fightback Fund, with restrictions eased so more businesses can access the funding they need. Clawing that money back rather than redeploying it flexibly means ministers risk accelerating the jobs crisis. We must do everything we can to protect our country’s vital city centres and prevent shuttered high streets. Time to invest in going green    Climate change is a massive long-term threat to the country. To tackle the threat means we will need to change the way we power our homes, move around our towns and cities, and use our land. This may sound daunting and it is, but there is also a chance to ensure that in tackling that threat we can create a better economy and quality of le for people. That’s what I am determined we do as a country. Think of all the jobs that need doing, from insulating homes to building the zero carbon engines of the future to planting trees and creating green spaces that we can all enjoy. Britain can have a bright manufacturing futurewe take a lead in the environmentally friendly jobs of the future. It makes environmental and economic sense. At a time when we are facing an unemployment emergency, this is the moment to power forward with action to create those jobs we badly need. It’s what we have seen in other countries. Germany has already announced €bn worth of plans, with France likely also to invest a signicant amount. So far, the Government’s warm words on the need for a green recovery have not been matched by their deeds. The £bn of green investment announced pales in comparison. We owe it to ourselves to build back better, and we owe it to future generations to tackle the climate emergency. That’s why Labour has been talking to businesses, unions, workers, campaign groups and the public about ideas to kickstart a recovery that builds an environmentally sustainable economy with a zero carbon army of workers. We need a Green Recovery worthy of the name. Campaign aims to protect us all    Labour’s Jobs, Jobs, Jobs campaign aims to fight for jobs, keep workers safe and back businesses. Fight for jobs: by reforming the furlough scheme so it supports those in the worst-hit sectors and targets aid to struggling industries. Back our businesses: by setting up a fightback fund to prevent firms going under and save our high streets.

Ministers have reportedly made doom-laden warnings that working from home could ultimately cost you your job, just in time for a major media campaign launch by the Government next week. The television and newspaper messages will promote the Governmentaposs aim to reduce the number of employees working from home amid fears that town and city centres are becoming ghost areas as workers stay away. But Thehas quoted a number of anonymous sources that go further than the economic argument, making claims working from home is tied to job cuts. The paper says one government source told them: People need to understand that working from home is not the benign option it seems. If they are only seeing workers once a fortnight then that could prove problematic for some employees in the future. “Suddenly the word ‘restructure’ is bandied about and people who have been working from home find themselves in the most vulnerable position.”  And an unnamed cabinet minister claimed companies would carry out productivity reviews when they realise some people aren’t working as hard as they thought. Neither source mentions that some companies may have actually saved money by reducing operating costs, while many employees will have financially gained by removing travel costs.  Labour has criticised theto work plans as being unconscionable while the CBI said anyto work push should involve a hybrid approach that did not force people to go back.Labouraposs shadow business minister Lucy Powell said: It beggars belief that the Government are threatening people like this during a pandemic. Forcing people to choose between their health and their job is unconscionable. Number  should condemn this briefing and categorically rule out any such campaign. Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the CBI, said a hybrid approach with home and office working is the best way forward. Speaking to Times Radio on Thursday, Dame Carolyn said: This is not about compulsion. I couldnapost say that more strongly. This is about creating the opportunity and the confidence to get to a hybrid that gets the best of both worlds. Weaposre certainly not there yet. Our offices are at risk of dying.

Staff have given up their summer to make sure children will get the education they deserve in a Covid-secure environment. The achievement is all the more impressive given they had to deal with the exams grading chaos at the same time. They deserve our thanks – unlike the Government, which has sent out confused and conflicting messages to parents, teachers and pupils. There remains a lack of guidance from the Department for Education on what schools should dothere is a second wave in autumn. During lockdown too many pupils missed out by not having access to laptops and lessons via video calls. This cannot be allowed to happen againthere are further outbreaks. Yet the Government has failed to set out how children and teachers will be supported in such a situation. Teachers deserve high grades for their efforts this summer – but ministers should be placed in detention. Trump shame To British eyes it is shocking that a -year-old is allowed to own an assault rle. Even more grotesque is that Kyle Rittenhouse reportedly used that weapon to kill two protesters demonstrating against the police shooting of a black man in Kenosha, Wisconsin. What is less surprising is that Rittenhouse is a fanatical Donald Trump supporter. Rather than seek to calm tensions raging across the US, the President has sought to exploit them. Guest speakers at this week’s Republican convention included the two lawyers from St Louis who brandished guns at Black Lives Matters marchers. Trump may not be directly responsible for the Kenosha deaths but he is responsible for fanning the flames of hatred in his supporters.

It was was the hottest on record with .C recorded at Heathrow - but it a totally dferent story  months on. This Bank Holiday, the top temperatures could reach C in London while parts of Scotland will be chillier with highs of C, well below the average of c usually seen in the country. The rain isnapost going to relent just yet with further downpours expected. But Sunday should raise some smiles with it expected to be dry and sunny before the weather turns noticeably colder. Torrential rain and flooding brought traffic mayhem as more heavy showers and thunderstorms are expected across parts of the UK on Friday. Forecasters predict this Bank Holiday Monday could be the coldest on record for some parts of the UK as temperatures are expected to be well below average for the time of year. Heavy showers on Thursday brought major problems on the roads, with flash floods reported in parts of Surrey creating dficult driving conditions and road closures, while Belmont railway station was forced to shut.  Road closures were also reported in Kingston, south-west London, where a Twitter user posted pictures of flooding in dferent parts of the town, including the underpass at Richmond Road near the railway station which was immersed in water. Another video shared on Twitter shows motorists struggling to get through flooded areas of London Road in Glasgow, with cars half-submerged in water.  The Met Office has issued weather warnings as downpours are likely to persist overnight, which could bring localised flooding and travel disruption. A yellow warning for heavy rain has been placed over north-east England which is expected to last until am on Friday, while thunderstorms are forecast in parts of southern England and South Wales between am and pm. Meteorologist Emma Salter pointed to last yearaposs late August Bank Holiday Monday - and said a repeat is not on the cards.  We could see some places getting the coldest maximum temperatures on record this Bank Holiday Monday, she told PA. The lowest maximum temperature recorded was .C in the Shetland Islands -anywhere gets lower than that itaposs in the running to be the coldest on record. There will be quite heavy, isolated downpours and there is potential for flash flooding.

The vast majority are in the south and Midlands, figures from Public Health England reveal - following warnings that virus hotspots were moving south. Redditch, in Worcestershire, has seen its rate treble in the seven days to Sunday. Kettering, in Northamptonshire, also experienced a sharp rise, with the number of new infections nearly doubling in a week, while the current rate in Mid Devon is ten times higher than it was the previous week. Oxford, where  infections were confirmed, has seen its rate rocket from . cases per , to . - prompting warnings of lockdown measures. In a statement to people living in the city, Ansaf Azhar, Oxfordshire County Council’s director for public health, said: Do we really want to end up with the kind of local control measures we have seen introduced in ious parts of Lancashire, Yorkshire, Leicester and Aberdeen  “At the minute it feels like we are moving in that direction. People need to be aware their behaviour is putting themselves and others at risk. If you’re aged  to  and catch Covid-, you are absolutely not guaranteed to get away with the mildest symptoms. Areas that have seen Covid- ratesrocket include:Rochdale - ., up from .Oxford - ., up from .Redditch - ., up from .Kettering - ., up from .Hackney and City of London - ., up from .Windsor and Maidenhead - ., up from .Blaby - ., up from .Dacorum - ., up from .Newcastle-under-Lyme - ., up from .Ealing - ., up from .South Bucks - ., up from .Wandsworth - ., up from .Southwark - ., up from .Bath and North East Somerset - ., up from .Folkestone and Hythe - ., up from .Mid Devon - ., up from .South Tyneside - ., up from . Councillor Sara Rowbotham, cabinet member for health and wellbeing at Rochdale Borough Council, said: Increasing numbers of people who are testing positive for coronavirus have no symptoms so we encourage everyone to get tested.We need to identy who has the virus so we can stop it spreading. Latest data shows a sharp fall in hotspots including Leicester, Northampton, Oldham, Blackburn and Pendle.But the government has been accused of being confused and bungled in its lockdown messaging by council leaders in West Yorkshire. The leaders of Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees have joined their counterparts in Greater Manchester in criticising proposals to tackle the virus on a ward-by-ward basis. Another announcement on restrictions in parts of Greater Manchester, east Lancashire and West Yorkshire is due to be made on Friday after Thursdayaposs meeting of the Joint Biosecurity Centrechaired by Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Englandaposs chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty. Last week, Mr Hancock announced a more targeted approach to Covid- restrictions in which the views of MPs would also be sought to gain the maximum possible local consensus.  He added this would allow local councils to focus resources on the wards which need more targeted intervention in order to drive infection rates down. In a statement, councillors Susan Hinchclfe, Tim Swt and Shabir Pandor, the leaders of Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees respectively, said: Our infection rates have come down signicantly this week, although they are still high. Over the last few months and weeks we, as leaders, have taken dficult decisions and directed signicant resource in our councils to make this happen. However, throughout this time Government messaging has been confused and bungled.  The latest sht in Government messaging that happened last week was that they inferred they wanted to see more localised restrictions, ying them ward by ward rather than by local authority areas.

Kate and Gerry say on the official Find Maddie Campaign page they remain hopeful as they thank supporters for their ‘love and support’ during the most gruelling past few months as sickening details have come to light of convicted sex offender Christian Brueckner who is feared to been involved in Maddieaposs disappearance. The tormented couple have maintained a dignied silence turning down media requests from around the world to be interviewed on the latest shocking developments. They cling onto a glimmer of hope that Maddie, who would now be aged , could still be alive as they refuse to believe she is dead without her body being located.In the first uplting Facebook post for weeks, the digital co-ordinator, a close pal of the McCann’s who informs thousands of followers on their behalf, states: ‘Never stop believing in hope because miracles happen every day.’The friend, who remains anonymous, adds: ‘I know it’s been a while since I posted. Just wanted to thank everyone who continue to keep Madeleine and her family in your hearts. We still believe in miracles and hope you do too. We are grateful for your love and support.’ Among wellwishers’ remarks, Jo Davies writes: ‘Hoping Madeleine is found alive and safe.’ Madeleine McAveney adds: ‘I think of her every day. Never forgotten and still praying for her to be back in her parents’ loving embrace.’ Brave Kate and Gerry, both , of Rothley, Leicestershire, have endured ‘a tough summer’ as ‘horrendous claimsapos about their daughter’s suspected kidnapper have surfaced, a pal said. The source said: ‘They have heard a mixed bag from dferent police forces, itaposs absurd. She is dead but there is no body, she could still be alive, the suspect has abducted her and murdered her but his lawyer says he is innocent and will never be charged.  They don’t know what to believe but they have faith in the British Police who have been on this inquiry for nine years. ’Their emotions are like a yoyo. It’s yet another agonising waiting game. They have had their hopes raised then dashed so many times over the past two months they have no idea what to think.apos The exasperated couple have been told by three nations’ forces in the UK, Germany and Portugal that Maddie could still be alive, that she is definitely dead and that detectives know who her abductor is but don’t have enough evidence to charge him or even quiz him. Three-year-old Maddie vanished from a holiday apartment in Portugal’s Praia da Luz in May . She had been left sleeping alone with her younger twin siblings while her parents were dining in a nearby tapas restaurant with pals. Former GP turned medical worker Kate and eminent heart doctor Gerry have been busy preparing their -year-old twins Sean and Amelie for theirto school this week after the months-long coronavirus lockdown.Their pal said: ‘On top of all the latest police searches and claims being made, Madeleine’s parents have their working and family lives to be getting on with. aposItaposs been a very long tough summer and their focus is on the twins, as well as Madeleine.’ Brueckner, , is currently behind bars in Germany for drugs offences and raping an elderly American tourist - the latter offence he is appealing against.  It emerged this week he has been found with a secret stash of hundreds of sickening child abuse images. He reportedly used a Casio Exilim digital camera to store  child porn pictures and  videos showing the rape and abuse of young boys and girls. His lawyer Friedrich Fülscher insists his client is ‘innocent’, claiming he had nothing to do with Maddie’s abduction and has been subjected to a miscarriage of justice over the rape of a -year-old pensioner in the Algarve resort of Luz two years before Maddie disappeared. Speaking in Germany, he said the police investigations in both cases are aposbased on statements of the same dubious witnesses,’ adding: aposI don’t believe anything these witnesses say.apos It comes as a pal of the prolic sex offender said he had broken into hotel rooms and holiday flats in popular Algarve resorts.  Brueckner, identied by German investigators in June, is known to have been living in Luz at the time Maddie vanished and cops have records of his phoneaposs activity in the resort. At the time Kate and Gerry said in an online post they want ‘truth, justice and the outcome’ of their daughter’s fate in light of a potential new breakthrough. They shared a brief statement exactly one month after the th anniversary of their daughter’s disappearance in May which they observed behind closed doors in Covid lockdown. They simply said: aposWe would like to thank the police forces involved for their continued efforts in the search for Madeleine.

A survey of , adults found  per cent had seen someone screaming or shouting at another member of public in a retail store. Racist, sexist or homophobic abuse has been witnessed by  per cent while out shopping or walking. And one in  people had seen someone scream or shout at a member of staff in hospital. Two thirds now think the levels of disrespect in the UK have reached an unacceptable level - with  per cent feeling the problem has got worse in the last two years. But, while Brits say society is getting worse in terms of the abuse they see, three quarters has admitted dishing it out THEMSELVES. As many as  per cent of those polled said theyaposve disrespected someone in the past week alone, according to Nationwide Building Society. Of those whoaposve looked back on a moment and realised they had disrespected someone, more than halfsaid they were disappointed with themselves. While  per cent felt ashamed and  per cent said they were determined to do better in the future. The study also found emergency service workers topped a list of people who were not as valued as they should be in society. They were followed by teachers and education support staff, those who work on public transport, members of the armed forces and waiting staff. The survey also revealed how apostoxicapos the public think social media has become. More than three quarters think abuse online has reached unacceptable levels - with  per cent leaving social media due to abuse they or someone they know has suffered.  However, almost two thirds of adults feel they have become more respectful with age - but seven per cent admit to becoming less respectful. The research was carried out by Nationwide Building Society after it launched a three-year partnership to support The Football Associationaposs Respect campaign. The grassroots football initiative aims to reinforce the importance of mutual respect on and off the pitch. As part of the campaign, the FA will be advising parents and coaches on their roles in creating a fun, safe and inclusive environment for everyone.  Sara Bennison, Nationwide chief marketing officer, said:  has not been the year any of us expected - so much distress.But we have also had a sharp reminder of how dependent on each other we all are.Fostering greater mutual respect becomes more important than ever.The FA have demonstrated their commitment to this at a grassroots level and we are delighted to be able to help them expand their Respect programme. It is hoped the initiative will ensure a positive and enjoyable football environment for young people by promoting respect between players, coaches, referees and spectators. The campaign is looking to involve one million players, parents and coaches in The FA Respect programme over the next three years. James Kendall, director of football development at The FA, added: Over the years The FAaposs Respect campaign has championed the importance of mutual respect on and off the football pitch, most particularly amongst young people. We have worked hard to provide players with the guidance and confidence to act in this way the same is true for parents, referees and the communities they play within. It is so good then that we can work with partners such as Nationwide who understand the positive impact football can have on society and share our determination to improve the game. As we restart the grassroots game it is important to take the opportunity to reaffirm the values that are crucial for the wellbeing of football - respect and anti-discrimination are core to that.

Lissie Harper admits she felt let down by jurors and wants those who take a le - like those who stole Andrew from her just just four weeks after their wedding day - to pay the price. “I’m not sure what happened to Andrew will ever sink in,” Lissie says. “It’s not really something that’s easy to come to terms with. Everything in my le is dferent now. “Yet it could be  years or less and those who did this to us could be out on the streets living the same sort of criminal lestyle. Whereas Andrew’s le has been robbed from him. It’s not right. And it’s despicable to think that is just how things are and we’ve accepted that for so long. To help Lissie’s campaign to protect our emergency services heroes and support Harper’s Law, sign the petition here.“It’s time to change that.” PC Harper was killed when teenage thugs dragged him with their speeding car for more than a mile. He was left with such “catastrophic injuries”, that one witness mistook his body for that of an injured deer. Devastated we Lissie, , was then dealt a further heartwrenching blow when the three teens responsible - Driver Henry Long, , and Jessie Cole and Albert Bowers, both  - were cleared of murder and sentenced for the lesser charge of manslaughter instead - meaning they could be back on the streets in as little as seven and eight years with time off for good behaviour. Now, after enduring what would have been her first wedding anniversary and the first anniversary of his death, Lissie wants to right these wrongs for her beloved Andrew. And ahead of meeting with Home Secretary Priti Patel next month, she’s asking Mirror readers to help back her petition for Harper’s Law, which will see anyone committing a crime which leads to the death of an emergency services worker get an automatic le sentence. Askedshe was angry towards the jurors , Lissie laments: “I feel very let down.  “Somehow they didn’t see what the whole rest of the country could see. “But I’m putting all my energy into Harper’s Law so that it doesn’t happen again, to someone .” Under her proposed lawany emergency services worker is killed as a direct consequence of crime, the offender should automatically spend the rest of their le in jail. This meansa firefighter is killed in an arson, the arsonist would face the ultimate sentence. Some may argue it’s a knee-jerk call for American-style “eye for an eye”, “string them up” justice. But Lissie, backed by the Police Federation of England and Wales, stresses it’s about valuing those who put their lives on the line every day.  “When it comes to justice, America’s a whole dferent kind of world. And that’s the reason we doing Harper’s Law - to balance out what’s right and what should be,” she explains. “The death sentence is a very, very dferent thing altogether and that’s not what this is about but obviously I want there to be much tougher convictions. “If you take someone’s le, that’s it - pure and simple - you should pay for that. If you’re committing a crime and as a result of that crime someone is killed I think you deserve to spend the rest of your le in prison.” She adds that her husband would be right behind her: “I know that he would be very supportive of Harper’s Law. Supportive is not all he’d be. “He’d also be surprised,” Lissie admits.  “All this is not something I’d done before.” That’s an understatement. Lissie was once so timid about public speaking, she had a friend read out her wedding speech. Now she’s speaks with great dignity. She knows her campaign inside out, she shares stories of how content and happy she and Andrew were, and is an open book when it comes to the dficulty she’s had coping with the grief. What happened on that fateful night of August  last year caused national outrage.  The childhood sweethearts, who had dated since they were  and grew up in each others’ pockets, had celebrated their fairytale wedding at Oxfordshire’s Ardington House on July . They had their compact-but-homely one-bed cottage on the banks of the Thames in Wallingford, South Oxfordshire, a stone’s throw from their families. And they were planning to start a family of their own after a belated honeymoon to the Males, planned for just a few days later. But with one  call that all disappeared. Committed Thames Valley police officer PC Harper was four hours into overtime. At pm he rang Lissie to say he loved her and talk about her planned new design business.  Then just before he was due to sign off, a call came in about a stolen quad bike in Stanford Dingley, Berkshire. As PC Harper tried to stop the thieves they sped off in their Seat Toledo, while his feet were caught in a tow rope hanging out of its car boot. His fatal injuries left him so unrecognisible, Lissie was warned not to go to the morgue. Her heartache was only compounded at trial when Long, Cole and Bowers, petty criminals from a travellers’ community in nearby Reading were found not guilty of murder. Instead Long pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to  years while the others were found guilty of the same charge and sentenced to  years each. With good behaviour they could all be out in half that time.  “It wasn’t what I expected” says Lissie. “I just felt disappointed for Andrew. That’s all I could think about. How could these people take so much le and that’s what they’re faced with  It’s just not right. It’s outrageous.” Lissie already has , signatures on her Harper’s Law petition with Change.org. Petitions have to be discussed by parliamentthey reach ,. But Lissie wants more to ensure her upcoming crunch meeting with Priti Patel goes well. She says: “I would really appreciate the Mirror‘s loyal readers adding their voice to my vital campaign by signing my petition. And together we will achieve Harper’s Law.” Police alone face , physical attacks a year.  And there’s a certain irony, that one of Andrew’s only bugbears about his dream job was the soft justice his collars sometime got. “Andrew loved his job,” she says. “But police spend a lot of time out on the streets, trying to arrest people and get the right type of justice, only for them not get the sentence that they should.” Andrew’s family are backing Lissie all the way. She’s still and always will be, part of the family. But Lissie’s also under no illusion Harper’s Law is one of the only things helping her get out of bed in the mornings. She spent nine months living with her parents after Andrew’s death and only ed to their cottage in May. Andrew and her had planned to be hearing the little pitter patter of tiny feet by now.  Instead she woke on their wedding anniversary in July to see his toothbrush still in its holder, his clothes still in the wardrobe, but only his ashes in a wooden box for company. As for a baby, well, that’s now her campaign. That poignant date was obviously horrendous. “Oh yeah,” she says slowly. “I went for a walk and I got him some flowers and just remembered the happy memories we had from our wedding day. But, yeah it was hard.” Has she brought herself to watch the wedding video yet  “No, no, not yet. I think I will one day, but no I just can’t,” she says. Nor can she get rid of any of his belongings. Or picture moving out of the cottage. And whether she could one day marry again is not even a seed of a thought.  The anniversary of his death was just as tough. “It was the same pain as every other day, just more signicant,” she says. “I did all I could do - had a quiet day remembering him. I still can’t believe it’s been a year.” Does she still think about the what s  “A little bit,” she admits. “He told me once ‘Death is just another adventure’. There’s definitely comfort in that.” Lissie has had some positive news recently in that the offenders’ sentences are to be reviewed by the Attorney General who felt they are too lenient.

Tesco has announced a handy scheme for any customer who arrive at its stores without a face mask or face covering. Tesco previously confirmed it would be creating signage to remind customers to don them. But Tesco and the three other supermarket giants said they would not make staff police the new law, which came into effect a month ago, on July . Anybody flouting the rule faces £ fines - reduced to half that figurepaid within a fortnight.  However shoppers who turn up at Tesco without a face mask can buy one at the entrance as the supermarket giant has confirmed it will be selling them for customers who arrive without one, Liverpool Echo reports.Tesco has also confirmed that some staff members may be spotted not wearing a mask due to medical reasons.  They responded to a customer who tweeted to ask why its staff were not wearing face masks during a recent visit. Tesco tweeted back: Morning Ben, we’ve asked all our customer-facing colleagues to wear face coverings.

The Prime Ministeraposs aposperformance coachapos Harry Jameson charges an eye-watering £-an-hour, the equivalent of £. a minute. It is in stark contrast to the paltry amount being offered by the government to low-income workers who need to self-isolate in high-risk areas. These iniduals will be able to claim £ for a -day periodthey test positive for Covid-, although critics say the sum is nowhere near enough to live on. Mr Johnsonaposs new trainer is quoted as charging an hourly rate of £ on the website of the luxurious Rosewood London hotel, where he is reportedly the apospersonal trainer in residenceapos. The Rosewood also offers a £, deal called aposThe Jameson Retreatapos, which covers a two-night stay at the hotel and daily training sessions with the man himself.  Iniduals eligible for the governmentaposs new self-isolation benefit will receive just a fraction of this princely sum. The Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said the £-a-day payment leaves people without enough to live on, while a Labour politician one of the local lockdown areas described it as a aposslap in the faceapos. Mr Burnham said: It’s good the Government has at last acknowledged the problem of people who can’t afford to self-isolate. But this sadly isn’t the solution. It leaves people without enough to live on. We need a scheme like Jury Service where wages are covered. Although workers can still claim statutory sick pay, Universal Credit and Working Tax Credits on top of the benefit, many believe it is still not enough.Mr Burnham added: “The health secretary has already said that he couldn’t live on statutory sick payat £ a week. So how can an announcement like this work ” Mohammed Iqbal, Labour leader of Pendle Borough Council in Lancashire, told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: The figures that the Government have introduced are really a slap in the face for those people who sadly test positive and there is no incentive in my opinion for those people to self-isolate.  If you’re a manual worker who’s not able to do their job from home, normally getting paid the living wage or the minimum wage, the Government are now going to say to you we’ll pay you £. an hour. Not acceptable. However, Health Secretary Matt Hancock today argued £-a-day is enough when combined with other benefits, despite it taking weeks to claim Universal Credit. He acknowledged that some people are losing out on their income from not being able to work, adding that the payment is aposset at the level of statutory sick pay in order to make sure people don’t lose out from doing the right thingapos.  Mr Hancock said: We are introducing it in Oldham and Pendle and Blackburn with Darwen in the first instance.

Dubbed the first of its kind in the western hemisphere, Port Lympne Hotel  Reserve near Hythe, Kent has spent nearly two years preparing to open its Giraffe Hall for animal lovers. Located inside a th century Grade II listed Wealden hall house, the hotel boasts  en-suite bedrooms, and an additional five luxury cabins - which will provide  mile unrivalled views over the reserve. Giraffe Hall is at the top of the reserve, overlooking The African Experience, meaning guests will be closer than ever to animals commonly only seen in the wild. A statement from Port Lympne says: Once completed, the hotel will offer a luxury safari feel while incorporating the comforts and décor of an English stately home. Guests will be able to feed the giraffes from their bedroom windows, while thereaposs also going to be a cabana style retreat for visitors to sit and enjoy a drink and take in the views. The surrounding gardens are also being tended to, where a route for giraffes is being made. Families will be able to get a good nightaposs rest and be woken up by the beautul giraffes whose long walking trail will be directed right past the building. A total of  guests can stay at the hotel at any one time. Itaposs expected the luxury hotel will open next summer. Port Lympne says the interiors will be designed by Victoria Aspinall and that many of the buildingaposs original outstanding features will be retained. The house will convert the already on-site restaurant to include an outdoor decking and offer breakfast, lunch and dinner. According to reports, the waiting list to stay at the hotel has more than , people on it.The animals have already been introduced to their wider habitat, and many of them are already walking past the under construction property, Kent Live reported last September. Port Lympne has previously spoken about its plans to make Giraffe Hall a sought after venue for wedding and private parties. No price package has yet been published due to the incompletion of the animal experience.  Port Lympne already offers a number of animal experiences, including Lion Lodge, Rhino Lodge and Tiger Lodge. Guests staying at Lion Lodge sleep just metres away from the lions - Adras, Oudrika and their three cubs - and right in the centre of their natural and spacious habitat. The lodge includes picture windows in both the master bedroom and the open plan living area, meaning guests will be just a whisker away from lions.

And despite how abnormal it is, doctors confirmed that it wasnapost linked to any underlying medical conditions. Now, he has built up an extensive fan base on TikTok for posting regular videos going about his daily le with his incredibly long digit. Whilst a number of people were quick to say it was fake and the videos he had posted had been edited, Jacob was quick to set the record straight.Speaking to Buzzfeed, Jacob confirmed that his expendable thumb is real.He explained: I just dislocate my thumb, by forcing it out of its socket, to make it appear longer.  My doctor says itaposs abnormal but canapost officially link it to any known medical conditions. Since he already has long fingers, he said itaposs hard to notice the freakish nature of his thumb until he dislocates it, which is supposedly painless. Jacob admits that he never expected for his thumb to receive so much recognition, winning him over one million followers.  He said: When I posted my first video to TikTok, I had no clue Iaposd get this sort of attention from it. People have mixed reactions, like disgusted, freaked out, or curious.  When Jacob reacted to a fanaposs comment which read: How is this guy mutating his thumb and scientists are not taking his DNA  TikTok users were extremely freaked out by the sound of the bones in his thumb cracking.

Speaking about the terrying moment, Mafalda said: “I went on vacation to Portugal with my father, brother, aunt, and my cousin. “We had a newly built house while my mother stayed in Switzerland to work. “In the morning I was with my brother in bed sleeping when our house exploded. “It happened when my father wanted to turn on the warm water.  “I woke up from the heat and saw fire everywhere, I was standing like a statue and I didnapost dare to run through the fire. “My brother was my hero. He came back into the house because he noticed that I was still inside. He came in and took my hand and we ran out to the neighbours together. “My aunt and my cousin were already in front of the door. “I looked around to see my father and saw him jumping out of the kitchen window, his whole body and clothes were burning. “We ran to one neighbour and my father to the other.  “I just realised how serious the situation was when I was under the cold shower with my two-year-old cousin. “I started to tremble and my skin began to pull together. At that moment we all felt no pain because the fear was greater than the pain and the fear of death.” Mafalda remained at the hospital for more than a year and spent two months at a rehabilitation clinic to gain her mobility back. She had dficulty accepting her new appearance and was ridiculed and bullied by her peers at school.  The teenager said: “After the accident, it was dficult because I stayed in the hospital for a very long time and my le had completely changed. “I looked very dferent, and couldnapost care less about myself and didnapost love myself. “I was in the hospital for a year and when I came back to school, I was heavily bullied. “I was told things like ‘ugly burned chicken’ and ‘here comes the burned cowapos.”  Over the years, Mafalda has learned to love herself from within and is grateful for all the struggles she has faced in her le saying it has shaped her into the person she is today. She said: “Today I am so thankful for everything! I am immensely grateful for all the dficulties I had in my le, because I think back and know how strong I was and that I always fought. “I love myself very tightly and nobody can take that away from me. “This accident was a blessing for me.  “I was allowed to see and learn a lot and I am very grateful for every problem and every pain. My past defines the woman that I am today.” Mafalda hopes to become a model and is proud of her scars, seeing the beauty in her skin as a symbol of her strength. She added: “I want to show the world that everything can be achieved in le! “I would like to become a photo model, evenmany people doubt my dream, but I believe in myself.

Not for partisan reasons but because there’s so many areas where Labour has to be there to make sure that we deal with those issues of disadvantage, particularly some of the educational developments we’ve seen over recent years.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Talking nonsense in the public or lounge bar can be very therapeutic#People are also being encouraged to switch to a tourist#s mindset and visit local attractions to help put a bit of flesh on their bones and see them through the winter.Buying local has knock-on environmental benefits too, often involving shorter journeys and sustainably produced local products.Shopping local has always been important, but never more than now.If we don#t use local services, we will lose them.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

So many people are intimidated by other vehicles.

The village#s fire engine was used to demonstrate to the youngsters how dficult they are to see from the cab of a large goods vehicle, particularly to the rear and near side at junctions.They also learned about primary and secondary road positions, right of way and good observational skills.They were even encouraged to ask their parentsthey do the #Dutch Reach# to keep passing cyclists safe. The Dutch Reach is a simple change of habit to help you open your car door safely. Instead of using the hand closest to the door, it means reaching across to open the door with the hand furthest from the door # your left handyou are the driver. This naturally turns your body towards the window, helping you spot approaching cyclists.Mr Catterwell added: #Thanks to Scottish Fire and Rescue Service for the use of the appliance and the drill yard, the Bike Bothy for administrative assistance and training materials and Graham Love for his excellent mechanical services. Also to residents and holiday makers around Craignish who were mostly respectful of the learner cyclists.#P S pupils Fergus Bennett, Beth Gregory, Magnus Hampton, Kay Neville, Harry Whittle and Reiley Van Der Zel received their Bikeability  badges.

The decision was taken to send me to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, and Neil Newman and Billy McArthur drove very carefully on the ersion route to Paisley, avoiding the recently damagedRest and be Thankful route.I am grateful to all those who delivered care to such a high standard, ensuring that my recovery was so successful after excellent treatment at the RAH.Jeremy Houston, PoltallochSir,As I read Councillor Alastair Redman’s letter in the August  edition of the Advertiser I thought how sad it is that a young man should always have such a pessimistic and depressing outlook that he chooses to share regularly with your readers.While we live through a pandemic we have seen the very best in people in our communities working to support and care for each other.Only last week the council publicly thanked the thousands of volunteers for their amazing efforts during the past months.The volunteers throughout our communities worked tirelessly and optimistically, always offering encouragement and kindness helping those who were at home to stay positive during such an anxious time.Local businesses provided an excellent service and continue to do so, enabling people to shop locally without making long journeys.If Councillor Redman cannot see the confident and positive support in all of our communities perhaps he should book an eye test, and he most certainly doesn’t have to travel to Barnard Castle to visit an optician.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertSir,I was delighted to see the piece in a recent issue of the Argyllshire Advertiser featuring a reader from Tayvallich, setting out his case for #Time for Change#. I share many of his concerns, and commend the series of articles.It would be good to hear from a range of Argyll and Bute residents with their ideas for how we get from #here# towards a better #there#. My personal pet project would be an Argyll and Bute Citizens’ Assembly, that would bring people together to generate real strategies to bring about just and #green# change for our area.A good start would be better transport links, via enhanced road and ferry services.A permanent solution to the Rest and be Thankful would be welcome, of course, but it was really heartening to see how Western Ferries rose to the challenge on Friday Auust .  They magicked away that endless queue at Gourock with great patience and goodwill and double service, showing what can be done.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,Following the latest landslide and road closure at the Rest and be Thankful, once again the road closure signs were placed at the wrong place on the Arrochar side.Having spoken to several of the local businesses owners, the main issue around the signs are they are too far away from the incident. There are information signs from Balloch to Tarbet advising of the closure at the Rest.Surely moving the signs to Ardgartan would make more sense. Should anyone have to turn then there is ample space to do this. We cannot continue to render two villages effectively closed in case someone has failed to read the signs or cannot turn.Transport Scotland and BEAR Scotland must guarantee that the signs will not be put back in the same place when further disruption occurs, and it will.Jane Ireland, Slanj restaurant, Tarbet"},{"url":null,"title":"news from the districts august 21 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMull of Kintyre music festivalhas taken its virtual  event to new heights by beaming a unique Scottish rendition of David Bowie’s #Space Oddity# to the International Space Station.The annual music festival teamed up with the Machrihanish Airbase Community Company , in the running to become the UK’s first spaceport, to record the unique set, featuring local band Slainte Davaar Allstar’s cover of Bowie’s iconic track.With the festival moved online this year the organisers came up with the idea of partnering with the local base and its unconventional location for the exclusive gig.The set was performed on the former top-secret RAF base runway # nearly two miles long and one of the longest in Europe – for current Commander of the ISS Chris Cassidy and Cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner, as they orbit the earth at ,mph.Event manager Iain Johnston of JIG Events said: #The Mull of Kintyre Music Festival has encouraged people to visit Kintyre from all parts of the globe since its inception  years ago and we were naturally disappointed, like every other event organiser up and down the country, to have to cancel this year.

Control system builders ITI will undertake the design, installation and commissioning of the upgrade across the station’s four units.The power station, constructed in a cavern within Ben Cruachan on the shores of Loch Awe, plays a critical role in stabilising the country’s electricity system throughout the Covid- pandemic due to its flexibility. The plant can generate power in less than a minute when needed and can also store excess electricity from the grid like a giant battery, a service which was called upon when the low electricity demand during the lockdown coincided with periods of high wind power in Scotland.The plant’s reversible turbines pump water from Loch Awe to an upper reservoir on the mountainside to store excess power from the grid. The stored water is then released back through the turbines to generate power quickly and reliably when demand increases."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 21 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGordon Stewart from Ardfern sent us thisatmospheric photograph, taken from Corranmor Farm on Monday August .A stunning full rainbow appeared that day over Loch Craignish lagoon, captured by Gordon on camera.PIC:no_aYourPictures_Rainbow"},{"url":null,"title":"enjoy cowal highland gathering in the comfort of your own home","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWith just days to go until one of Scotland’s favourite events takes the virtual stage for the first time, Cowal Highland Gathering’s organisers are preparing to unveil a packed programme to a worldwide audience.Cowal’s Virtual Highland Gathering is an ambitious three-day event which mirrors as closely as possible the programme of the gathering itself.Kicking off on Thursday August , Cowal’s Virtual Gathering features a host of exclusive interviews and performances, together with a look back at some of the highlights of the -year-old event.The Gathering’s Friday night gig is back too, with the Gig at the Gathering Unplugged going live from pm.

A dedicated team will be established to do a more detailed assessment, in parallel with the Strategic Transport Projects Review. Stakeholders will be involved in this process and we will publish recommendations for a preferred corridor in spring .#In the meantime, work will continue on the next catch pit and we will continue to consider further catch pits at the site.

They came back positive and cheerful they followed all the new guidance and protocols with no problem and are just getting on with it in the way that Lochgilphead children do.Scottish Government guidance does not require social distancing in academic classes but Miss Devine emphasised the measures taken by the school.#We have stringent protocols in place for movement around the campus, using single file. We have staggered times for classes starting and finishing and are keeping pupils in their year groups outwith class, like a big social bubble.#We are also using outdoor spaces. The good weather has helped, and during lunchtimes for example the pupils are encouraged to go outside.#There#s been a lot of open windows and doors for ventilation around the school, to try to keep it as safe as possible.##In many ways it simplies some of the mechanisms around the school,# she added, #and it#s actually been nice to see them outside so much socialising with each other in a calm but controlled way.#She paid tribute to the support the school has received from the parent council and wider parent group.#The parent council has been magnicent, as have all the parents. They have kept in touch and supported the school throughout lockdown and over the arrangements. Obviously they are glad to see the children getting back to some sort of normality in schooling, but they have trusted us with the arrangements to safeguard the children and I feel very lucky to have that support.#Faced with a constantly changing picture, both locally and nationally, Miss Devine commented: #It is challenging to respond to that and keep lines of communication open with parents. Argyll and Bute Council has been good at giving guidelines to schools and that has helped a lot.#The council has also supplied hand sanitiser, face masks, gloves and visors and, said Miss Devine, the school is prepared to deal with anyone displaying symptoms.#We have thermometers in the school and we would testwe had concerns about a child becoming ill. There are straightforward guidelines that when a child displays symptoms they should be isolated and taken home immediately.#She added: #As yet we haven#t haven#t had to put those measures into practice.#In the event of a pupil being unable to attend school, Miss Devine confirmed that the online teaching s have been retained #as a safety net#.Miss Devine concluded: #Everybody is having to get used to the new health and safety protocols, but thus far people feel well supported.

the skin by outside forces.Wearing a mask can trap dirt, oil, swear and humidity around the skin.Friction and irritation from the mask pushes bacteria into the skin, which creates micro-tears, and allows the bacteria and dirt to enter the skin more easily.This will lead to blackheads and whiteheads along the bridge of your nose, cheeks and chin. Masks can trigger ious types of skin irritationsand redness .How can you combat maskne There isnrsquot a prevention for maskne, as we need to continue wearing our masks, but there are ways that you can help combat the issues.Skin Care routineIf you want to combat the impact of maskne then having a good skincare routine is essential.It is just as important to cleanse your skin before wearing a mask as it is to cleanse after wearing a mask.To help your skin heal, Ashley would recommend using a squalane or balm cleanser so help remove make-up, dirt and debris.However,you are experiencing chapped, irritated skin or suffer from sensitivity then a gel based cleanseradvised.Dermalogicarsquos UltraCalming Cleanser helps to calm and cool sensitised irritated skin.ExfoliatingExfoliating is key to clear clogged pores and remove dead skin cells which will help reduce the impact of maskne.There are thousands of dferent types of exfoliators available from chemical, physical and masks but it is always important to follow the recommended application and how often you should use the product.Over-exfoliating your skin can compromise your skins barrier , damage the skins capillaries and dehydrate the skin.Ingredients such as glycolic acid, lactic acid and salicylic acid are great exfoliating athelping fight breakouts.Spot treatmentsUsing targeted spot treatments with ingredients such as salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide will help remove dead skin cells and decongest pores.Hyaluronic AcidsHyaluronic acid can hold , times its weight in water - so it is like a magnet for moisture.,params: .pushUsing hyaluronic acid regularly will leave the skin feeling super-soft, radiant and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.Hyaluronic acid has antibacterial properties meaning it will help soothe and protect chapped, irritated skin.FoundationsOpt for tinted moisturisers rather than a heavy foundation or go bare faced to help cause less clogging in your pores - but donrsquot forget your SPF!MoisturisersHeavier moisturisers will sit on the skin for longer due to the humidity of wearing the mask which can cause further clogging and irritation of the skin.However, donrsquot want to stop using a moisturiser all together as our skin still requires hydration and moisture.Instead try using a light and soothing moisturise such as Charlotte Tilburyrsquos Magic Cream light.Chapped SkinFor those suffering from chapped skin try using a physical barrier cream such as Dermalogicarsquos Barrier Repair.Barrier Repair shields against environmental pollution and helps forty sensitive skin with a damaged barrier."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-mobile-testing-unit-hawick---know","story":"A MOBILE-TESTING unitwill run in Hawick for six days, according to NHS Borders.It comes following an outbreak in the townlinked to three businesses.The testing unit will operate from tomorrowuntil Wednesday, September .It will be based in the Teviotdale Leisure Centre car park on Mansfield Road, with tests available between pm-pm.An NHS Borders spokesperson said: \"The MTU can only take a limited number of people each day so it is essential that only people with COVID- symptoms book a test.\"Other household members must self-isolate but should not be tested unless they too are showing any symptoms.\"The symptoms of COVID- are a high temperature or fever a new continuous cough or a loss of or change in sense of smell or taste.\"Tests, which must be booked in advance, can be arranged by visiting this websiteor calling  .The new unit will run alongside the existing facility in Galashiels Netherdale car park, which will operate betweenam and pm.If travellingto a mobile unit is not possible, people can arrange for a home test kit to be posted through their door.NHS Borders jointdirector of public health, Tim Patterson, said: \"I realise that people in Hawick will have concerns about the virus as a result of this outbreak.\"Unfortunately this can lead to the circulation of unsubstantiated rumours, especially on social media.\"I would like to re-iterate that it is crucial for everyone in the community to follow our advice and avoid speculation and rumour about the outbreak.\"Dr Patterson added: \"In terms of schools, all education settings in Hawick are currently safe places for children to learn.\"Unless your child has been asked to self-isolate by NHS Borders Test and Protect team they should attend school as normal.\"However it remains vital that no child attends schoolthey are displaying any COVID- symptoms.\"At the time of publication, a total of nine new cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the Borders in recent days,bringing the regions total to  since the outbreak began.To book a testing unit appointment or a free home testing kit, visit: www.gov.uk get-coronavirus-test or you can call:   "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-book-covid-test-testing-centres","story":"In the last week, demands for Covid testing in Scotland have surged.The First Minister suggests some Scots have had trouble trying to book coronavirus tests over the weekend due to a \"major spike\" in demand, which resulted in technical issues.Butyou are experiencing symptoms, how do you get a test  Heres everything you need to know.When should you take a test If you think you are experiencing symptoms of coronavirus, you should take a test.

I know itrsquos proposed to plant new trees in a dferent area as compensation, but this wonrsquot connect to the wood and will take generations to grow. It will never replace what will be lost.If we seriously want to do something about the ecological disaster we are making on our planet then we need to start in our own backyard. We canrsquot campaign against deforestation, habitat destruction and declare a climate emergency, and then say: ldquoWell, the rules donrsquot apply to us when we want to destroy woodland to move some planes.Deforestation has a multitude of justications all over the world: dam building, road construction, cattle ranching, extreme poverty of subsistence farmers, profit from timber, oil exploration and pipelines, mining: the list is long. The point is there will always be someone with an economic justication for environmental destruction.While it may be on a much smaller scale, the proposal to destroy irreplaceable woodland in order to move some planes is a product of the same mindset that has brought us to a point of environmental and climate crisis.This mindset is revealed in the Historic Environment Scotland response to the proposal. This is the public body charged with protecting Scotlandrsquos built heritage. It has said: ldquoWe would not consider the trees of Sunnyside Strip to be directly related to the cultural signicance of the scheduled monument ndash they are visible but do not relate to our understanding of the monument as a wartime airfield.In other words, woodland isnrsquot part of our heritage mature trees, many of which were around before the war, arenrsquot historic or worthy of value in themselves. Really The wood is far more a historic part of the wartime airfield site than the massive car park. It seems to be a very selective viewpoint.The truth is that the UK is one of the most nature-depleted countries on the planet. A quarter of our already-decimated wild mammals are in danger of extinction. Our woodlands are small and dispersed, but all the more vital for the habitat they provide. East Lothian has huge developmental pressure, and this wood is a rare and vital part of naturersquos increasingly precarious foothold in our county.A changed mindset would be one which makes the protection of nature and the environment the initial default position. Developers should then take this priority as the starting point for proposals.That hasnrsquot happened with this plan, and credit to the council for rejecting it.There has been so much publicity and justied outrage recently over the destruction and littering of our land by people lsquowildrsquo camping and disrespecting nature. So many people, it seems, just donrsquot care, or seem unable to appreciate the gt of our natural environment and its importance.There is a disconnect from nature at the heart of this. We will never solve the environmental and climate crisis we are in until we can foster love and appreciation of nature, of which we are a part. Our childrenrsquos future literally depends on this.And institutions such as National Museums Scotland should be part of the solution, not the problem. Instead of viewing the woodland as irrelevant to the visitor experience, it could be used to enhance it. The wood is a magic place, with younger trees growing amidst towering old mature ones.My kids were in wonder as they explored the wood, peering up at the tops of the trees, and an old oak caught their attention as its boughs seemed to dip asto say hello. We spent a wonderful hour being immersed in nature.Many of our children, in fact many adults, have limited opportunities to explore and enjoy such places. Imagine the extra possibility of a nature walk in the tall wood, where wildle thrives and trees older than the airfield can tell their story. This wood is not an intrusion for the visitor but a potential wonderful addition. Get the ranger service to do talks and tours about this amazing place, a treasure hunt use it to enhance peoplersquos connection to nature ndash an extra experience.Woodland is not just a habitat for wildle, itrsquos a habitat for us humans too. Enjoying nature and learning about its importance should not be seen as a contradiction to enjoying historic planes.While Irsquom aware that itrsquos only part of the wood under threat, the proposal to destroy a large section of it will result in a tragic loss of trees and the habitat they provide. But itrsquos not just the destruction in itself, itrsquos also the precedent and example it sets for future developments.I really hope the Reporter will uphold the councilrsquos decision, and the museum, which is a fantastic and well-loved historic place to visit, will consider a new location for the visitor centre. Then we will all be winners."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-august-18-20-1995-1970-1920","story":"lsquoENOUGH is enoughrsquo was the message from traders in North Berwick, reported the East Lothian Courier on August , .The opening of North Berwickrsquos sixth charity shop this week has sparked controversy ndash and fears have been raised that a seventh could be on the cards.Traders claimed the resort had now reached ldquosaturation point with fundraising outlets, which are now selling new goods in addition to second-hand items.They said the charities were setting up shop on prime sites, and argued that they were ldquosubsidising them through having to pay higher rates.Fears that the trend could ultimately lead to a downturn in the local economy and the death of the High Street as a shopping centre were also expressed.The row follows the opening of the Chest, Heart  Stroke Associationrsquos outlet at a former delicatessen shop in the High Street on Monday.A RE-ENACTMENT of the Battle of Dunbar was postponed as it clashed with a model power boat demonstration, reported The Haddingtonshire Courier of August , .The re-enactment of the Battle of Dunbar, which is to be staged by the Royal Scots as part of their recruiting drive in East Lothian, has been postponed for a week because it would have clashed with the running of a model power boat demonstration to be held on Sunday, September .

secondary school pupils.Do they need to be worn in class While staff and students can continue to wear face coveringsthey wish to, they will not generally be necessary in the classroom.This is because

The lsquomust-seersquo jewels that should be on the wish list of every tourist and local alike ndash the ones that actually surpass expectations and leave a lasting impression once yoursquove seen them.And for lovers of whisky, there are more than a few of these places too ndash the distilleries whose images take pride of place on websites and in magazines and which inhabit the dreams of fans around the world.The lonely trio clinging on to the rocks of Islayrsquos southern shore, their white walls standing as stark protection against the sea ndash Ardbeg, Lagavulin, Laphroaig.The architectural masterpiece that is Macallan, just outside the village of Craigellachie on Speyside ndash only a couple of years old, but already a global icon.And the old walls of the Blair Athol distillery in Pitlochry, so consumed by ivy itrsquos asthe stems and not the stone are keeping the place upright.Irsquove been to Islay, and to Macallan ndash and both more than lived up to my imagination. But while Irsquove driven past Blair Athol so many times Irsquove lost count, Irsquove never actually been able to go and visit.So when an invitation popped up on my email ndash come and visit, and bring someone with you. I would normally have been delighted. Irsquod been planning to take my dad for a day out, and this would normally have been the perfect thing. I would normally have been excited at the prospect of us both actually seeing first-hand this lovely little distillery.But, letrsquos face it, I wouldnrsquot normally expect such an invitation to come in the middle of a pandemic, and I wouldnrsquot normally need to do an impromptu risk assessment before accepting.The Scotch whisky industry is worth upwards of pound billion to the UK economy and millions of tourists flock to distillery visitor centres every year, eager to touch base with one of the most popular drinks in the world. In recent years, the industry has enjoyed record growth ndash and all the signs were that  would be another bumper season.But then Covid struck, the country went into lockdown, and visitor centres closed their doors.However, since last month, when restrictions began to ease and Scottish tourism began to get back to work, the industry has slowly been welcoming visitors.The owner of Blair Athol, drinks giant Diageo, is in the middle of its own rolling programme of reopening. It began with the Pitlochry distillery in the last week of July and will go on throughout summer and well into the autumn.At this time of year, a place like Blair Athol would normally see hundreds of visitors every day, with tour parties of  or more being guided past the giant mash tuns ndash where ground malted barley, or grist, is mixed with hot water to extract the sugars that will give le to the whisky ndash and given a peek inside the washbacks ndash where this sugary broth, or wort, is mixed with yeast and left to ferment to create a strong lsquobeerrsquo ready for distillation.Dozens more would normally just drop in to buy a bottle in the shop, or to enjoy a drink at the Mash Tun ndash a whisky tasting bar thatrsquos open to the public.But lsquonormalrsquo was the last word on our minds as my dad and I drove through the depths of Perthshire on our way to Pitlochry.Wersquod had to book our slot, as drop-ins are no longer allowed, and been given the usual spiel about precautions, social distancing, sanitiser and the like, but Irsquod heard it all so often by now that it barely registered. Itrsquos become like the safety briefing on a holiday flightbefore take off.Irsquove been to a lot of distilleries before, and normally I love the atmosphere, the peaceful way these places ndash in reality some of Scotlandrsquos busiest industrial sites ndash go about their business, but I didnrsquot know what to expect this time round. Would the experience be ruined, like a trip to the shops or a pint down the pub Wersquod been told to bring our obligatory mask ndash and warned that our temperatures would be taken.Groan.So as we walked up to the door and announced ourselves, I steeled myself for some military-style regime of control and discipline.ldquoHello, come in! The tour is about to start. Can I ask you to put your wrist up to the censor so we can check your temperature That was it hellip a little box on the wall not much bigger than a light switch. I held up my wrist as instructed and waited.ldquoBeep! Temperature normal.My dad followed and as the tape across the entrance was pulled back we proceeded to put on our masks.ldquoOh, no, you wonrsquot need these in here.And what turned out to be one of the best tours Irsquove ever been on had begun.Yes, there was sanitiser everywhere, and wersquod been asked to maintain our distance and keep to the one-way system, but far from being a hindrance, these quiet measures seemed to fit in with the feel of the place, and did nothing to detract from the tour.There were only four of us on the tour, and the usually busy public areas were deserted, so it felt aswersquod been given secret, after-hours access to the distillery.It was aswe had the place to ourselves and Karen, our guide, was our accomplice as we sneaked from room to room, past the mash tuns and the washbacks, and into the still room. We stopped here as Karen explained the distilling process and, despite the insane heat of production, we stayed a little while extra to chat and take pictures. This personal touch was a real and unexpected treat.We carried on like this right through the tour ndash Karen passing on her prodigious knowledge, us chatting and stopping to admire the beauty of the distillery. No crowds, no rush.The final pleasure was when we were led into the Mash Tun bar to sample the whisky. It was like an exclusive tasting normally only reserved for the big-rollers and high-payers. I was driving, so after a quick snf of each dram ndash Blair Athol -year-old, Blair Athol Distillery Exclusive, Auchroisk -year-old, and Talisker Storm, in case yoursquore interested ndash I decanted them into the little sample bottles provided and saved them for later.Dad, on the other hand, loved every second of this private display, and after chatting a while more to our fellow guests and Karen ndash ldquostay as long as you like, she reassured us ndash we nipped off to take more photos and visit the distillery shop.The shop was the only place where masks were needed, but it didnrsquot stop us marvelling at the goodies on offer, and chatting some more to the staff who seemed to be relishing this newfound ability to escape from the timetable.Dad bought a bottle, of course ndash Talisker Storm ndash and as we said our goodbyes and took a few more pictures, I vowed to be back in more normal times.But then again, maybe I wonrsquot wait until then and instead book another secret visit when it feels aswe have the place to ourselves.Maybe this new normal has something going for it after all.# Andy Clark is author of the Dr@m whisky blog.

Although their summits are mostly rounded and sweeping, they combine to make a vast and wholly unique landscape.The mountains in the Cairngorms rise up out of the remnants of the ancient Caledonian pinewoods and are home to superb wildle and an array of dramatic corries. Braeriach is the third highest mountain in the British Isles and is protected by a long approach walk through a natural tree line.This Munro comes in at km and takes around - hours to complete.Braeriach, Aviemore, PH QTBraeriachBeinn Alligin, TorridonBeinn Alligin, meaning jewelled mountain, is one of three of the Torridon giants and well deserving of its name. This magnicent pair of munros has its own pinnacle ridge called the Horns of Alligin.Sitting on the seaward side of Torridon it has an unmatched viewpoint with glimpses of Skye and the sea to one side, and great peaks on the other side with the Horns providing a stunning foreground.The Munro is around km and takes around - hours.Beinn Alligin Torridon, Alligin, AchnasheenBuachaille Etive Mor, Glen CoeBuachaille Etive Mor is the head of Glen Coe and reigns supreme with its awe-inspiring pyramidal appearance. It is affectionately known by many climbers as the Bookie and, along with its twin Buachaille Etive Beag, are among the most photographed of the Scottish mountains and itrsquos easy to see why!This Munro is perfect for those who want a climb and some incredible views.It is around km and takes around - hours to complete.Aonach Eagach Ridge, A, Ballachulish PH HXLiathach, TorridonAnother of Torridonrsquos three mountains, Liathach is perhaps the finest of them all. Its higher Munro looks almost inaccessible from most directions and even the easiest ascent involves a bit of scrambling but itrsquos certainly worth the effort.Beyond this point the mountain becomes even more dramatic and offers the perfect path for thrill seekers to climb to the top. The hidden north side of the mountain is even more spectacular and is well worth exploring.Slightly longer than the other of Torridonrsquos mountains this walk is around .km and takes around - hours.Achnasheen, IV ETLiathachSgurr nan Gillean, SkyeMany regard Sgurr nan Gillean as being the finest peak on Skye and it is one of the more dficult on this list. Even the easiest ascent on the southeast ridge is a pretty tough scramble ndash the other two ridges venturing into the realm of rock climbing.It appears fairly dramatic from Sligachan but this actually conceals much of the mountainrsquos finest features and its only upon a closer visit to Coire a Bhasteir that the true scale and magnicence of the Pinnacle Ridge reveals this Munrorsquos true stature.This walk is around km and takes roughly  to  hours to complete.Skye, IV SW"},{"url":null,"title":"eight-best-cars-family-staycation","story":".

Across the UK, as headlines foretold the devastation lockdown would wreak on this seasonal trade ndash footage of acres of wilting plants was grim ndash cannier businesses immediately shted to online and telephone orders. And, as recent figures show, people responded enthusiastically. During that period, Britons spent around pound. billion on garden plants, materials and tools. Contrary to the stereotypical picture of a Mr McGregor retiree, footering around in his potting shed, it was millennials who spent most. Their investment was double that of the rest of us, with the - age group spending an average pound per person, compared with pound among others.Some of that might be explained by the urgent need for equipment to turn a rectangle of grass into a more imaginative space for all the family to enjoy. Irsquom long past their age but still so new to gardening that I recall those early months as a ceaseless outlay on shears, secateurs, spades, forks, trowels, rakes, sieves... I could go on. Hence the need for a shed, which was soon festooned with tools dangling from hooks, propped against walls and stacked on shelves. Think of an Italian deli, with hams and salamis overhead, and floor to ceiling storage. Replace the delicious aroma of cheeses, coffee beans and truffles with potting compost, muddied buckets and oil to keep blades moving, and you get the picture.There are professional horticulturalists where I live who are well under , but thatrsquos probably not surprising. Those who choose to live in the country are already keen on the outdoors, whatever their vintage. Yet there is something of a renaissance occurring in this generation, as interest in their own plot is sparked into le, whether itrsquos an allotment, balcony, or back yard.In response to what you might call a growing trend, Alan Titchmarsh has said that he hopes more young folk will be encouraged to pick up their trowels and dig up drives, to help protect the planet. ldquoItrsquos not just about going on marches, he says. ldquoBeing practical is a hugely underrated resource and skill.Those who have unexpectedly found themselves with time to devote to their patch have probably realised how enjoyable it is too. Being in the fresh air, surrounded by birds, and perhaps with children larking around, has shown how much pleasure can be had in maintaining your part of the world. At this stage of le, competition for peoplersquos spare time is usually ferocious, with the demands of socialising, keeping fit and raising a family. In the past, unless you were actively emulating the Good Le, choosing to spend the weekend planting drills of potatoes or deadheading roses was borderline eccentric.Being forced to spend so much time at home has clearly made people reassess their outdoor space, and consider its potential. Making their plot child-friendly has been a priority for some. But for those who dread the thought of a football landing on tender seedlings and new blooms, there should be no conflict between serious cultivation and youngsters ndash quite the opposite. The earlier children encounter flowers and trees and the wildle they attract, the better for all our futures. And the sooner they recognise the need to treat living things with respect ndash although some trampling and breakage is almost inevitable ndash the more they will understand not just how nature works, but the ways in which we can support it.Irsquove lost count of the number of people who have said how much they have relished this aspect of lockdown. Having nowhere  to go has allowed them to concentrate on matters horticultural, and take time to make decisions or try experiments they otherwise could not have attempted. Having many more unfilled free hours has its upsides, as one neighbour has discovered. When the pandemic took hold she turned her greenhouse into a hotbed of tomatoes and her flowerbeds into a lettuce patchwork, and has been feasting on salads all summer. As have her friends.Inevitably, once the world opens up again, some recent converts will lose interest and the weeds will take revenge. Yet I have no doubt that many will already be hooked. The secret that no gardener ever mentions is that it is addictive. Each tiny success gives confidence to try something more adventurous. Mistakes are inevitable, but so are accidental triumphs. The thrill of discovering strawberries or nasturtiums thriving where before was a bed of nettles, is inspiring. The sight of bees and birds hovering for nectar, seeds and grubs is like preparing a banquet and watching as guests pile their plates high. To be honest, environmental reasons for sustainable, eco-friendly gardening are all but forgotten in the joy it brings. The reason why benches in most well-tended grounds go largely unused is because therersquos always something clamouring for attention. To sit sipping a GT while an unpruned shrub stares at you reproachfully, or a juicy stick of rhubarb cries out to be picked, is almost impossible.In my own limited experience, trying to keep on top of it all ndash and never coming remotely close ndash is part of what it is about. An expert recently told me that a garden will take all the time you give it, and then some. Yet the depths of winter is the time to put your feet up . The rest of the year is for helping the green things around you put down sturdy roots. As millennials can confirm, it has a very stabilising, calming effect on us too.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Fortunately, HM Treasury has bailed Scotland out in this Covid crisis, so, while the - figures will be excruciating, Scotland will survive, thanks to taxpayers in the southeast of England. Would anyone who can count support leaving the UK under these circumstances Jill Stephenson, Edinburgh EH.THE publication of the latest GERSfigures has triggered a now-traditional feeding frenzy.A black hole in Scotlandrsquos finances is heralded by unionist politicians as validating the continuation of their beloved Union.The killer phrase for me from the GERS report is: ldquoThe report is designed to allow users to understand and analyse Scotlandrsquos fiscal position under dferent scenarios within the current constitutional framework.GERS is therefore a measure of the public finances, under the current Union, hardly the greatest endorsement for how the economy has been managed on the UKrsquos watch.Major economic levers required to stimulate economic growth are still currently reserved to Westminster.It is indeed a bizarre scenario when politicians from unionist parties, who should be ashamed at the situation, actively gloat and support a Union that has mismanaged the economy so appallingly.GERS is a set of figures, based on a measure of guesswork that indicate very little, except highlighting the negatives of the current Union. It has little bearing on the finances of an independent Scotland.The point of independence is not to do everything in the same way as it has been done within the current constitutional framework, but to move away from this one-size-fits-all fiscal straitjacket to a tailored approach that prioritises stimulating economic growth.Alex Orr, Edinburgh EH.TODAY the annual GERS numbers have been revealed and no doubt there will be the usual bunfight about their relevance to the constitutional debate. If I might take a dferent tack: the SNP administration is to be congratulated on its determination to publish these figures annually. Not every political party would persist in publishing economic data which has the potential to destroy its raison detre.In a sea of misinformation and spin, GERS stands out as a beacon of truth and accuracy. When we are told that Scotland is doing so much better than the rest of the country on Covid- deaths, but the statistics show dferent, we still have GERS to restore our faith in objective facts. When the first serious outbreak of Covid- in the country is in Edinburgh but the First Minister forgets to tell us about it, we have GERS to remind us that some uncomfortable truths can still make in into the public domain. When we are told that ministers have no say in infectious patients being discharged into care homes but official letters show dferent, when the Education Secretary endorses an equation that seriously disadvantages working class pupils, and when the same Education Secretary does a u-turn on his equation and claims that makes it all right, when Cabinet Secretaries deny that fiscal transfers happen while demanding the continuation of the UK furlough scheme, when the First Minister says we have extra Covid testing capacity but people from Glasgow are told to go to Belfast for a test, GERS is an important truth that we can hold to, a shining light in a murky forest of obfuscation and incompetence. And when we have a succession of Finance Secretaries whose economic qualications seem to be the possession of the requisite numbers of fingers and toes, its nice to know that some competent people are actually keeping the score.So, when we are told that independence transcends everything and that all routes through independence would lead to a prosperous sunny upland, the SNPs own GERS publication is there to remind us, and itit has the wit and honesty to admit it, that such a view is the acme of economic illiteracy and, in the wise words of a prominent nationalist politician, stupidity on stilts.Alex Gallagher, Labour Councillor, North Ayrshire Council, Largs.THANK you, Iain Macwhirter, now we have an article on independence that is relatively neutral in tonereceives a large tranche of its electricity and gas from us, so would be daft to restrict trade on political grounds. A new trading arrangement should be ldquothe easiest in history to reach.Sharing a currency with a country whose economyis erging from your own cannot work. All new countries, like the Czech Republic and Slovakia, adopt new currencies almost immediately, and that is what Scotland should aim for. It is ridiculousthat we have no clear break-down of Scotlandrsquos economy, revenues, GDP, expenditure, perhaps only months away from independence, because the UK government will not direct the civil service to provide this information. No serious economist would trust GERS to provide other than the vaguest guestimate of our fiscal position post-Union. A lot will depend on the nature of the dissolution and the subsequent allocation of assets. Funnily enough, that is something unionist politicians commentators donrsquot ever like to talk about. If independence is a serious proposition, then it behoves the media to start asking questions of both sides.GR Weir, Ochiltree.ALAN Fitzpatrickclings desperately to the \"once in a generation\" anthem and wondersstatements in the Scotlands People publication \"could be construed as amounting to a verbal contract with the electorate\". Mr Fitzpatricks memory appears to be selective as he makes no mention of the infamous \"Vow\" to which all three unionist party leaders signed up and promptly forgot about and as for Mr Fitzpatricks comment regarding the old saying that \"an Englishmans word is his bond\", the word was that Scotlands position in the EU could only be guaranteed by voting No to independence, and the bond was broken at the EU referendum so much for that \"verbal contract\".I would remind Mr Fitzpatrick that the SNPs  manesto stated that there would not be a second independence referendum, unless there was \"a signicant and material change of circumstances, such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will\". As the voters ed the SNP to power on that manesto, that could be viewed as a written contract with the electorate.Ruth Marr, Stirling.Read more: GERS Report: What is it and what does it mean for independence "},{"url":null,"title":"u-turns-inequalities-television","story":"The IndependentAndrew Grice said Conservative MPs were tearing their hair out at the number of coronavirus U-turns performed by Government ministers.ldquoThe most recent is the guidance on whether pupils should wear face coverings in communal areas in Englandrsquos secondary schools, he said. ldquoHours after fellow ministers told us masks were not necessary, Gavin Williamson performed a handbrake turn.

The chancellor is adamant that it will end in October. [But]we are nowhere near the other side yet. The furlough bridge is as vital as ever.Richard Wilkinson, emeritus professor of public health at the University of Nottingham, said successive governments had failed to address the issue of the widening death rates between unskilled workers and professionals, something that came to his attention as a research student in the s.ldquoThe gap in le expectancy between people living in the most and least deprived % of areas in England now stands at over seven years for women and over nine years for men, he said. ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic has thrown these inequalities into sharp relief. It is the poor, those living in deprived areas, and people of black, Asian or minority ethnic status who have suffered the worst of Covid-.He said the experiences of low social status and racism were deeply stigmatising.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic has again exposed our health and economic inequalities, just as the death of George Floyd again exposed the awfulness of racism, he added. ldquoIt is good that current public debate is turning to the possibilities of ldquobuilding back better rather than simply ing to the status quo.ldquoThe picture could hardly be simpler: almost all the problems that we know are related to social status within our society get worse when status dferences are increased.

Quant, born in Blackheath, London, became a household name in the s, as part of the youthquake that revitalised British culture in music, fashion and film.She may not have been the first designer to take hemlines above the knee , but the very short skirt and sht dresses, more often than not modelled by Twiggy, became Quantrsquos trademark. Her bobbed hair, designed by Vidal Sassoon, also added to Quantrsquos recognition factor. She was also responsible for the skinny rib sweater and hot pants.Quantrsquos designs grew out of her desire for a new look and new ideas of what it might be to be female. ldquoI grew up not wanting to grow up, she once said. ldquoGrowing up seemed terrible. It meant having candy-floss hair, stiletto heels, girdles and great boobs. To me it was awful children were free and sane and grown-ups were hideous.Her notions chimed with the times and as a result she did much to shape how the s looked, in the streets of Cha and the fashion magazines and weekend newspaper supplements of the time at least.Quant met her future husband Alexander Plunket Greene while studying illustration at Goldsmithrsquos. He was from old money, but very much a Soho bohemian. In s London the couple were part of the much-vaunted Cha Set. ldquoOur friends and acquaintances were painters, photographers, architects, writers, socialites, actors, con-men, and superior tarts, Quant said in her  memoir Quant on Quant.In  the couple, along with business partner Archie McNair, bought a Kingrsquos Road with plans to open it as a boutique, with Plunket Greenersquos bistro downstairs.Originally, the boutique, called Bazaar, sold clothes Quant sourced herself from art school students, jewellers and milliners, very much a reflection of her own taste. When that proved successful and stock dwindled, she took to buying fabric from Harrods and made up her own designs with her friends in her bedsit overnight to sell in the shop the next morning.Quantrsquos clothes were informal, often in bold colours, and she had an eye for reinventing traditional details. She also had a taste for new materials including PVC, using it to create wet-look clothes. Her designs could be androgynous, taking familiar material, designs and ideas from menswear and using them to her own ends.Kellie Wilson modelling satin shirt and matching shorts from Mary Quants intimate apparel range, ldquoAll the way through le women had to dresshellipthe way the man in her le saw her, Quant pointed out. ldquoShe was never allowed to dress the part of being her. I wanted to design clothes for real people.In  she signed a deal with the American store chain JC Penney and a year later she launched a new, cheaper dfusion line, Ginger Group. By the end of the decade she was the countryrsquos most recognisable fashion designer and it was estimated that up to seven million women in the UK owned at least one of her products.She ersied into cosmeticsand in the s interior designs, including carpets, bed linen and wallpaper, for manufacturer ICI.ldquoClothes are a statement about oneself or what one wants to be, Quant believed. It was an idea that she put into practice for herself.Mary Quant at VA Dundee runs until January , .

Despite the challenges, it has also made us consider how we can approach things dferently to suit the emerging ldquonew world.It has provided businesses with the opportunity to extend their geographical boundaries. Brightsolidrsquos customer base has been typically based in Scotland ndash but by no means do we have to limit ourselves to the way things were ldquoalways done pre-pandemic.The business community has already taken steps to change ndash firstly when we moved our workforces overnight to remote working. While there may have been some early hiccups to the process for some, for the vast majority it has been proven that it can work. Andyou are like me, although I miss seeing my colleagues in person, I donrsquot feel any less connected to them or our customers given the rise in video calls and messaging s.This leads neatly to the concept of glocalisation which has gained traction during the pandemic ndashthe practice of conducting business that considers both local and global environments. Before Covid- hit, many might not have believed themselves ready to trade with a wider audience or look at hiring someone from a citywhere they are not based. But these limits no longer exist. This is an opportunity to rethink mindsets, and the business tactics and technologies needed to support this.A glocalised approach will provide businesses with opportunities. Integral to that is technology which provides the tools to think bigger an opportunity to speak to, reach and work with more people. Many may have already adopted a glocalised approach to their business without realising ndash by launching websites to deliver services when customers couldnrsquot visit physical premises, or have the infrastructure in place to conduct and close sales meetings irrespective of location. Central to enabling that is the cloud which will help businesses get their websites and apps online or provide staff with access to files remotely quickly and securely ndash meaning that they can continue operating with limited interruption to the day to day.Long gone are the days when technology was only the responsibility of the IT team. The cloud has made it more accessible and we are likely to see HR and marketing teams playing a larger role in making technology decisions that impact the business. The involvement of these departments will mean that teams can react and innovate quickly to provide the services they need to make workplaces more attractive to new candidates, customers and current employees alike. This could have positive results, as organisations will be able to tap into a broader talent pool, closing any skills gap that might have existed or allow them to approach a company with a proposal that they may have not previously considered due to their location.While, naturally, there will remain many tough hurdles for us to face we must take the current situation and harness the power to better ourselves and the businesses we work within. I donrsquot doubt that a glocalised approach will be integral to business success ndash both now and as we emerge from the pandemic. To thrive, we must harness the opportunity and take time to review existing processes. It is likely technology will be the solution that helps us navigate beyond the here and now and towards growth again.Linda King is CMO, Brightsolid"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-eight-fold-increase-under-17s-tested-covid-scotland","story":"Nicola Sturgeon said nearly , children aged two to  were tested for the virus last week, but stressed that only  - . per cent - had a positive result.The First Minister said this should be \"reassuring to parents and teachers\" worried about the impact of schools reopening on the spread of coronavirus.It came as the number of cases identied as part of the Kingspark School cluster in Dundee rose to , including cases among staff and three in pupils from the same class.The additional support needs school for children aged five to was closed for deep-cleaning last Wednesday as a result of the outbreak, with staff and pupils told to self-isolate as a precaution for  days.: The surge in demand for testing was predicatable - but the results should be reassuringMs Sturgeon said: \"I know and I can well understand why many parents and teachers and young people themselves have concerns about theto school, and yes, weve had clusters of cases in some communities involving young people, but I think these figures reveal the bigger picture.\"Ms Sturgeon added that despite a % increase in testing among this age group between the week ending August  and August , only two additional cases were detected last week.Scottish Government figures also show that in the week to August , a total of , people in Scotland were newly tested for Covid- - with  cases detected.That suggests that children under  accounted for % of those tested, but only % of positive cases.Ms Sturgeon stressed that parents should not be seeking a Covid test for cold-like symptoms such as a runny nose, unless this was also accompanied by at least one of the three official Covid- symptoms such as a new persistent cough, a fever, or a loss or change in sense of smell or taste.She said: \"While its understandable that parents in particular want to err on the side of caution, its also important to remember the symptoms of Covid that trigger the need for a test: a new persistent cough, a fever, a loss or change in sense of taste or smell.\"Other symptoms like a runny nose -they are not accompanied by one of the Covid symptoms - should not lead to a test.\"The surge in demand for testing through community sites such as drive-thru centres led to some people being told their nearest available booking slot was in England.Ms Sturgeon said \"technical issues\" with the booking system had also been to blame and were being resolved.Overall, more than , Covid tests per week are currently being carried out in Scotland across NHS and community sites, up from around , in mid-July.However, three additional mobile testing units are being deployed this week to increase capacity by  to  per day.NHS Scotland has also ordered thousands of new Covid testing kits capable of providing results within  minutes."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-book-covid-test-testing-centres","story":"The First Minister suggests some Scots have had trouble trying to book coronavirus tests over the weekend due to a \"major spike\" in demand, which resulted in technical issues.Butyou are experiencing symptoms, how do you get a test  Heres everything you need to know.If you think you are experiencing symptoms of coronavirus, you should take a test.

Sometimes they have even found properties people go on to buy. Mostly, though, each episode is a lesson in home-hunting reality: what the buyer can afford versus what they want. Everything is a compromise, except for the cardinal rule set out in the title.On that, Kirstie had some shock news. ldquoI bought in the wrong area, she told Phil as they reminisced about their first flats . Kirstiersquos mum thought the neighbourhood was safe, but the transport links were rubbish and it was a long way from her friends. So you see, Kirstie has been there, done that, and got the corns from a twice daily slog to and from a distant Tube station to show for it.: Kirsties Keep Crafting review The pair raced through house hunts down the years, starting with their first, a search for a one bed flat in central-ish London. Kate, the buyer, had pound, to spend. Today that would probably get you a part-share in a parking space.A laddish Phil and a foxy Kirstie, all knee high boots, swinging hair and shades, strode the London streets like Julie Burchill and Tony Parsons. Two hip young gunslingers taking on the world. Her voice was softer, her manner less confident. Phil hasnrsquot changed a bit, apart from the receding forehead.The essential building blocks of the show have stayed the same, too. ldquoWe headed to a quiet bar to think things through, said Phil in that first show. Cue the call to estate agents to put in a cheeky offer well under the asking price. Then the tense wait.Before getting to that point there were tours round houses, Kirstie being up front and pushy, Phil adopting a more softly-softly approach. Kirstie hated it when Phil said, as he did often, ldquoItrsquos up to them. Kirstie wanted to give buyers the stats on the best time to start a family so they would stop dithering about the number of bedrooms needed.We did not learn much that was new as Ben and Laura, Jess and Sam, and Michelle and Philip, followed the original Kate into the snakes and ladders game that is buying a house.

Kate, the buyer, had pound, to spend. Today that would probably get you a part-share in a parking space.A laddish Phil and a foxy Kirstie, all knee high boots, swinging hair and shades, strode the London streets like Julie Burchill and Tony Parsons. Two hip young gunslingers taking on the world. Her voice was softer, her manner less confident. Phil hasnrsquot changed a bit, apart from the receding forehead.The essential building blocks of the show have stayed the same, too. ldquoWe headed to a quiet bar to think things through, said Phil in that first show. Cue the call to estate agents to put in a cheeky offer well under the asking price. Then the tense wait.Before getting to that point there were tours round houses, Kirstie being up front and pushy, Phil adopting a more softly-softly approach. Kirstie hated it when Phil said, as he did often, ldquoItrsquos up to them. Kirstie wanted to give buyers the stats on the best time to start a family so they would stop dithering about the number of bedrooms needed.We did not learn much that was new as Ben and Laura, Jess and Sam, and Michelle and Philip, followed the original Kate into the snakes and ladders game that is buying a house.

What a shameful position for anyone to take, either in a personal capacity or as a Scot.Scotlands economy has suffered a succession of catastrophic impacts at the hands of a succession of right-wing ideologically-driven governments, starting with Margaret Thatchers scrapping of Scotlands industrial capacity in the s, through the financial disaster of  and culminating with Brexit in . The fact that oil from Scotlands territory subsidised the de-industrialisation of the s and then supported the expansion of the City of Londons financial sector only underlines the irony of the position held by Ms Stephenson.Scotland will have the freedom to grow its economy only when it is free of interference by Westminster. The next catastrophe, of course, is going to be Brexit. Scotlands population has expanded steadily since ,, but that growth will stall as soon as Westminster is able to deny the immigration we need here. Scotlands GDP is considerably smaller than near neighbours with similar populations such as Norway, Denmark, Ireland and Finland, the reason for that is that these small independent countries can tailor their economies to their needs, not the needs of the city of London and the South East of England.Scotland doesnt need nuclear submarines, aircraft carriersor global military reach, all of which cost a lot more than the pound. billion that Ms Stephenson claims, but we do need infrastructure, health care, education and above all people to grow our economy.The GERS figures may seem to be a godsend to people who think like Ms Stephenson, but all they really do is underline the structural failures and weakness of the United Kingdoms economy.John Jamieson, Ayr.IT is sad to say that some who would refer to themselves as Scots appear proud of the fact that under the current constitutional arrangements Scotland seems, at least on a superficial level, to be \"subsidised\" by the rest of the UK. Of course not only is this assessment distorted because Wales, Northern Ireland and the North of England are apparently more heavily dependent on the largesse of Londoners, but because only tax revenues directly attributable to Scotland are included in Scottish revenues raised while non-directly attributable expenditures, such as defence, are pro-rated by Westminster.Of course the deliberately conjured smoke and mirrors hide the slanted workings of the UK economy which leverages resources from outside of the south-east of England to maximise the financial growth of London. Scotland was effectively in surplus for most of the last four decades but not only was no oil wealth fund created for the benefit of future generations, Scotland did not even obtain close to a population proportion of the massive infrastructure spending in and around London, an economically debilitating relative predicament which is set to continue for the foreseeable future . The people of Scotland are just as capable as those of our southern neighbour, but we can only prosper in accordance with our collective talents when we can invest all our resources in our own country.Stan Grodynski, Longniddry.THE annual furore over the GERS figures is now in predictable full swing. No one has ever seriously uttered the popular grievance mantra of \"too poor, too smallrsquo with regards to Scotland.But this isnrsquot  any more. Oil prices have plummeted. Covid- is still playing out, in ways that cant be predicted. The global economy is reeling and climate instability is increasing.How much would an independent Scotland borrow, how would the deficit be dealt withincreased taxes or a reduction in services, or both. Or neither  How would Scotland be a competitive place for business The SNP needs to start tackling the \"known unknowns and \"unknown unknowns\" of Scottish independence with a rigorous hard factual honesty that it has yet to muster, lest we all vote for a st century version of the Darien Scheme at some point in the future.Surely the people of Scotland deserve better than the \"Nah, itll be fine\" attitude that the SNP have been peddling for six years now.David Bone, Girvan.YET again Ruth Marrtrots out the untruth that The Vow was forgotten by those who committed to it, so once again, it is necessary to refute that assertion.The Vow of September  was signed by Prime Minister David Cameron, Deputy PM Nick Clegg and Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband and promised three things and three things only. These were: statutory protection for existence of the Scottish Parliament new extra powers for that Parliament and the preservation of the Barnett Formula. Of these, the first two were enacted in the Scotland Act  . The Barnett Formula also remains intact.Likewise, Ms Marrs claim that a No vote would guarantee EU membership is a distortion of the truth. What was in fact said was that a Yes vote would be a vote to leave the EU at the same time as Scotland left the UKndash which was based on the unambiguous opinion of the EU Commission as provided to the Scottish Parliament.Again the question must asked:Scottish independence is such a good thing, why do nationalists need to tell so many lies to convice the rest of us of their case Peter A Russell, Glasgow G.NICOLA Sturgeon in her daily briefing todaysaid that the Scottish Government has used the UK-wide Covid- testing system \"which allows us to deliver economies of scale, so it is the right approach to take\".

Confidentiality requirements preclude me from sharing the particulars my experience but I took actions on these lines in a number of settings.ldquoThe limiting cases were, of course, situations where a formal complaint was brought against a Minister, and or there was presenting evidence that an egregious act had been committed.ldquoIn these cases, formal procedures would be followed.Sir Peterrsquos predecessor, Sir John Elvidge, also told the committee that civil servants often excused bad behaviour by ministers because of their stressful jobs, but this could lead to bad behaviour snowballing.He said: ldquoSome civil servants tended not to interpret as bullying any behaviours which they saw as a response to that stress,an inidual Minister did not display those behaviours at other times.ldquoIn combination with the strong cultural understanding that civil servants should exercise restraint in responding to personal criticism by Ministers, this tended to have the effect that Ministers did not experience the kind of feedback about their behaviours which might occur in other working environments.He also said civil servants may have been reluctant to complain about bullying ministers, as aggressive behaviour was seen as necessary for politicians to get ahead.Tory MSP Murdo Fraser, who sits on the Inquiry, said: ldquoIt is an extraordinary admission that problematic behaviour from ministers would be dealt with informally, and that these procedures took place lsquoin a number of settings.rsquoldquoWe have no idea how many times these informal discussions took place, who with, or most importantly, how serious the complaints were.ldquoBut itrsquos clear that Nicola Sturgeonrsquos position that she knew nothing about any allegations of inappropriate behaviour is becoming flimsier with every piece of evidence that comes out.ldquoThe First Minister cannot claim to have been in the dark, like the rest of us, when a number of allegations and complaints were taking place along the corridors of the SNP government.ldquoThe inquiry must hear from Nicola Sturgeon about what she knew and when she knew it.Labour inquiry member Jackie Baillie added: \"Scottish Labour deputy leader and committee member, Jackie Baillie, said:ldquoThis latest evidence to the Committee appears to confirm what has long been suspected: the workplace culture in the Scottish Government was not conducive to the wellbeing of staff and complaints about potentially serious issues were dealt with informally.ldquoIt is vital that all pertinent evidence is provided to the committee by the Scottish Government and other parties.ldquoThis revelation casts further doubt on the First Ministerrsquos claim to be ignorant of such behaviours occurring when it is clear that such behaviours were regular occurrences at the time.The inquiry is due to take evidence next Tuesday from Dave Penman, general secretary of the white collar FDA trade union, and Malcolm Clark, Convenor of the Council of Scottish Government Unions and President of the PCS union Scottish Government Group."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11746528.jpg?type=article-full","title":"glasgow-mum-stuck-limbo-year-record-number-children-temporary-accommodation","story":"Campaigners have called for the Scottish Government to \"uphold their promises to homeless people\" amid fears of a \"long-term crisis\" amid fears more people have bene forced into homelessness during the pandemic .Angela has been told she faces a wait of up to four years for a property the right size and feels ldquounable to move forward with my le.She added: ldquoMy older children have autism and need their own rooms.ldquoI can sometimes have my youngest sleep in the same room as her older sister butwe have a bad night when her sister is distressed, she will sleep up on a blow up bed in the living room.

I think thats just putting me off - Oh God, live football again.\"But no, I miss seeing my local team for sure. I miss going to my ground and shouting at guys in shorts.\"As you would expect, Johnston agrees that the arts need Government support and worries about how the pound. billion rescue package for the sector will be vied out.But hes equally concerned for the nurses, junior doctors and healthcare workers who have spent the last half-year on the front line of the pandemic.\"Im not one to get on my soapbox and start to worry about Government stuff,\" he admits. \"There are more important things like nurses - they need to be taken care of. They need all the support in the world.\"They need to be paid twice as much, regardless of this pandemic.\"They need to be given free housing, they need to be given all the help, not turning up to food banks trying to feed their kids because they cant get a good enough wage as a nurse.\"That pisses me off. They are not given nearly enough support and this pandemic has shown that the people who are paid the least on the social structure are the people we need the most.\"We need to take a long, hard look at ourselves, think about that wealth gap and fix it.\"Despite their studio wizardry and penchant for aural experimentation, Bfy Clyro are at their heart a live band.If you have seen their energetic stage act you will understand that this period away must have been painful.\"Its been heartbreaking,\" says Johnston after a long sigh. \"I completely forget what it is I do for a job. That happened so quickly, you wouldnt believe it.\"Even a couple of months, Im like Am I in Bfy Clyro  Did we play these shows  Its hard to even remember. I miss live music so much.\"The feeling you get from playing live cannot be replicated in any other manner. I miss it intensely.\"I was so happy to get back in the practice room just this week with the boys. Its the first time we have played since lockdown. Its such a release.

They did not know for sure at the time, but this day would mark the beginning of the end of their lives as islanders.The man and his dog had been keeping watch since dawn, the third day an islander had been sent to the site to scan the horizon for the first glimpse of the steamer, the Dunara Castle.As its shape slowly emerged from the shroud of mist that had covered the Sound of Harris, the man tapped his dog with his stick and lumbered towards the village.ldquoHis lookout was ended, continued the report that appeared in the Glasgow Herald on August , . ldquoThe last landing ship to call before the islanders deserted their wild volcanic rock in the Atlantic had been sighted.The Dunara Castle would eventually be loaded with  sheep and  cattle ndash the Highland cows made to swim through the water, then hoisted aboard with ropes around their horns and bellies.Over the following two days, they would be joined by the belongings of the remote islandrsquos  residents. Dressers, tables, chairs, canvas bags packed with personal items, even the village schoolmasterrsquos desk, would be carried from shore to ship.Alongside, her arrival in the peaceful bay marked by the sound of bugles and naval officers on board, was Admiralty sloop, Harebell, waiting to carry the islanders to new and very dferent lives.This weekend marks  years since the island archipelago of St Kilda, the remotest part of the British Isles, parted ways with its hardy residents.Lying  miles west of Benbecula, St Kilda had been inhabited since the Bronze Age, had seen Vikings come and go, and was where islanders lived in a self-sufficient time capsule with little contact with the mainland until the mid-th century.Crippling poverty, an ageing population and an awakening of opportunities and a better le far beyond its rocky clfs, had made le on St Kilda ndash made up of the islands of Hirta, where the villagers lived, and Dugraven, Soay and Boreray, impossible.Although events designed to mark the th anniversary of the evacuation have been curbed as a result of Covid-, the St Kilda Club ndash set up  years ago to preserve, promote and protect the islands ndash plan to gather online tomorrow to mark the occasion with a series of talks, music and interviews.The last St Kildan, Rachael Johnson died four years ago, aged . However, the clubrsquos chairwoman Julie Hunt, says it is important for descendants and people with close affection for St Kilda, now a World Heritage Site, to remember and celebrate the islanders and their way of le.ldquoConditions on St Kilda had gotten worse and worse, she says. ldquoThe younger generation of islanders had started to see there was a le outside the island.ldquoA lot of people had already started to move away, and at harvest-time there was not enough people to carry out the harvest.ldquoAs a result, there was not enough seabirds collected for food to get them through the winter.ldquoSince Victorian times the islanders had become used to having supplies brought from the mainland.ldquoTourists were coming to the islands, and the islanders were becoming more reliant on the mainland. If the weather got worse, ships couldnrsquot get there and it made it more dficult for people to survive.Freshwater springs on Hirta and an abundance of seabirds and fish had made le possible for centuries. Along with crops of barley, oats and potatoes, the bird meat and salted mutton was stored in stone and turf huts called cleits over winter, oil from fulmars and other birds provided fuel for lamps on black winter nights.The population fluctuated, battered by the harsh conditions, illness ndash often introduced to the island by visitors ndash and the lack of food.While in the late th century there were about  inhabitants, by  the first census of the island counted  islanders living on Hirta, eating the meat and eggs of seabirds, fish and growing crops on the land.Bitter winters in the mid-s left islanders tottering on the brink of starvation, prompting some families to take up government-promoted emigration schemes.With the population in  down to just  people ndash among them six widows ndash doubts grew over how the community could continue the traditional work of raising sheep, spinning and weaving, fishing and harvesting of seabird eggs and oil.ldquoOne islander, Williamina Barclay, was a nurse says Ms Hunt. ldquoShe raised the idea with the people of St Kilda that they might think about moving off.Despite not speaking Gaelic, Barclay persuaded them over cups of tea that staying would put their lives in danger.ldquoThere was a mixture of responses, adds Ms Hunt. ldquoNeil Ferguson ran the post office and was against the move because he had a reasonable income.ldquoBut the MacKinnons at number  had eight children, and they realised this way of le was not sustainable.ldquoIn May , the islanders wrote to the government asking for them to arrange evacuation.Marion Petschirsquos father, Callum MacDonald was  when his parents William and Betsy-Anne packed up the family home and left St Kilda, six years before the evacuation took place.ldquoLe was too dficult, she says. ldquoMy grandfatherrsquos health was bad, he had bad asthma and in the end he didnrsquot live past .ldquoThey had  children ndash one died at birth, one died aged nine on the island, and by the time they left they had four children living with them.ldquoThere was nothing  they could do.Her father went on to work as a valet to the Marquess of Bute, and eventually moved to London. But he ed to St Kilda in  and later told of his visit in a TV interview.ldquoI was happy there, he said. ldquoEven when I visited, I didnrsquot feel I wanted to leave it again. I was feeling so contented in myself.I didnrsquot feel I wanted to come back to London, I just felt content, peaceful.For the families who left on August , , there would be a final gathering of belongings before the solemn trek to the waterrsquos edge.Doors were locked, cats and hens put in baskets. All but two dogs made the journey, the rest were destroyed. And one by one, the islanders boarded the Harebell or a journey to a very dferent and unfamiliar modern world."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"August ,  at : pmPolice Scotland and an ambulance are currently dealing with a road traffic incident, in which a van went off the road.

Unlike student nurses and midwives, however, those training to be a paramedic are not eligible for a bursary, despite being unable to take up part time work.  To add insult to injury, their counterparts in England do receive bursaries.“This lack of a level playing field risks putting off those we need to see coming into our health service.  The current arrangements do little to encourage young people to pursue a career as a paramedic and store up problems for the future.“When I wrote to the Health Secretary recently on behalf of a constituent, I was told the government has no plans to review the funding options for trainee paramedics. Today, Nicola Sturgeon said she would look into the matter, having also been approached by a young constituent, angry at the unequal treatment.“The First Minister needs to recognise that introducing a bursary scheme would make a real dference, not least in widening access to the profession.  It’s time the Scottish Government properly recognised the dedication of our trainee paramedics by putting them on the same footing as trainee nurses and midwives.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

On the Pentland Firth, people are still being forced to pay over the odds.“COVID has inevitably created challenges, but even prior to the pandemic there seemed to be little urgency from the Scottish Government to deliver on its promise. Assurances that Ministers will now ‘pick up the ball again’ are likely to ring hollow with islanders who just want a date for cheaper fares to be introduced.“Meantime, Ministers could help soften the blow from the delayed introduction of RET by using the underspend to cut fares on Orkney’s internal ferry services.

As well as creating as many  new jobs, there will also be a substantial number of job opportunities during the construction phase.OIC leader James Stockan said: “Our vision is to build a truly sustainable business that is a core economic asset for Orkney, but also a first phase in enabling a scale of investment and logistical capability for the UK, which will be of international signicance.“Prime Minister Boris Johnson clearly welcomed our ambition and Orkney’s potential during his recent visit to our islands, describing as a ‘fantastic idea’ our vision for Orkney as a low-carbon, zero-emissions hub of innovation, with Scapa Flow at its heart.“We believe the time is right to maximise the incredible natural assets and geography of Scapa Flow and Orkney, to ensure a long-term sustainable future for our communities. We are open for business now, and ready to work with potential investors and operators to develop the signicant strategic and international opportunities Scapa Flow offers.“The Scapa Deep Water Quay proposal has been included in the Islands Deal list of projects that has received funding commitment from the Scottish and UK governments, and we are continuing to ensure that the funding earmarked for this will be secured.”Central to the project is the unique geographical advantage of Scapa Flow, described by the council as the largest natural deep-water harbour in the northern hemisphere, as the potential setting for internationally signicant marine logistics to serve the new and emerging sectors, including low-carbon fuel transition and offshore wind developments.Scapa Deep Water Quay is seen as the optimal location for construction and operations and maintenance activities, associated with offshore wind, as well as for a liquefied natural gasstorage and distribution hub. At the same time, this infrastructure has the capability to accommodate semi-submersible s of all types, giving Orkney a unique UK competitive edge within the existing oil and gas market.The project team believes it could be delivered by . Other proposals, such as Hatston and Kirkwall, could take three or four years to deliver.Phase two will ultimately develop the islands’ smaller harbours and piers across the islands.Harbour users and key stakeholders were consulted from the outset, to help gain an understanding of the issues, constraints and opportunities associated with harbour infrastructure around Orkney, through workshops and interviews. The range of stakeholders includes local communities, harbour users, potential funders and environmental bodies such as Scottish Natural Heritage.Harbourmaster James Buck added: “Tackling decarbonisation is the strand that binds these proposals together, providing infrastructure and knowledge for renewable energy developments around our waters will allow us to reach climate change targets. “We will also look at the potential for net environmental gain through habitat reinstatement and enhancement.”According to the OIC, Orkney Harbours is one of the most erse and successful council-run port authorities in the UK, with an annual turnover of £ million and nearly , annual vessel movements.The council added that the exact timing of construction for each of the phase one masterplan proposals is not yet known.This will be determined over the next six to  months, and will depend on a range of factors including market requirements, funding and environmental considerations.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The rest were reduced by a single grade and she has missed out on As in English, Biology and Modern Studies, as well as a C in Higher Chemistry.Eva said to have her grades knocked down so signicantly has made her “completely reconsider her career path”.Exams were cancelled this year because of Covid- and replaced with estimated grades based on past attainment, and the school’s previous exam record.The modelling system adapted by the Scottish Qualications Authority reduced the grades of around , results, with analysis suggesting youngsters from poorer backgrounds and historically poorer performing schools suffered disproportionately.In her letter, shared almost , times on Twitter, Eva said that “it was clear” that her grades had been signicantly adjusted “because I go to a school classed as underperforming”.Her letter calls for the system, which she describes as discriminatory, to be urgently investigated, adding: “The government has been pushing the ‘no wrong path slogan’ but why should pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds and deprived areas be forced into a pathway they didn’t want and worked tirelessly to avoid”.Eva had been predicted in her fourth year to achieve  As and two Cs at national five level, but in her exams she improved to come out with five As and a B.She added that her school’s recent performance had been affected by staff shortages.She had stayed behind after school for extra tuition, aiming to secure a university place and a career in the field of medicine.“Any further efforts by pupils to achieve higher grades in schools which have historically underperformed has been disregarded, she added.“SQA results this year have been more about fitting the statistical trends than the inidual pupil.”According to the Scottish Government#s own statistics, the estimated . per cent of most deprived pupils who would have expected an A-C band at Higher was lowered to . per cent by the SQA#s moderation system.

But what of other aspects What of community resilience, something I suspect will barely register as a priority for most us when deciding on our weekly shop It may be the case that more people will try and grow more of their own food and local produce will, hopefully, be in greater demand.All very welcome. But what’s really needed is a completely fresh approach to our behaviour as consumers.As the pound in our pocket becomes ever more stretched we need to value it in terms of what benefit it can bring to the wider collective # who can it support, what should it support and how can that can bring about greater resilience within our own communities.It’s not radical or revolutionary. It’s just about taking a bit more time and effort to think about where best to spend our cash, especially when it comes to our most basic of needs.It can’t possibly make sense to get your Sunday roast from the supermarketthe same cut of meat is available at your local butcher at a comparable price . And especiallythat butcher has sourced his meat from the crofter down the road.It takes a bit of extra effort to call in at the butcher, for sure, but add in important elements like food miles and provenance and there really is no excuse, except for our own inherent laziness.It has always amazed me how there is any fish at all on the shelves of supermarkets in this part of the world when the local fishmongers offer far higher quality at a lower price.And, in any case, it’s now perfectly possible to buy direct from the fisherman, with many of them now offering sales to the public.That may have come about through the closure of their overseas markets during lockdown, but what better example of necessity being the mother of invention.If west-coast prawns were coveted by sophisticated palates on the Mediterranean, then they should be more than adequate for consumption a bit closer to home.It’s not that long ago that our communities were completely self-reliant in food.We do demand a more discerning choice these days # no-one would want toto a diet made up entirely of fish, mutton and potatoes.But, with an abundance of quality produce on our own doorstep, surely it makes sense to take more advantage of that and in the process create greater community resilience through sourcing from independent, local retailers.If there’s a downside to that approach, I fail to see it.ONE aspect that looks certain to change, certainly for the foreseeable, is that there will be less air travel.Through the lockdown it is estimated that carbon emissions have been reduced by over  per cent by planes being grounded alone.That’s not even taking account of reductions in car journeys and it is a staggering figure from just one simple change.There are certain elements in the environmental lobby who would have you believe that methane emissions from cattle make a signicant contribution to climate change.Never mind that bovineshave roamed the land for thousands of years without causing much harm.Never mind that it’s only the last  or  years, as our economy became ever reliant on fossil fuels, that the damage to our planet has been made.The reduction in air travel will be for economic, more than environmental, reasons.But the staggering statistics of these last few months should at least mean that when it comes to a real determination in tackling environmental damage the finger of blame will be pointed in the right direction.Then again, maybe cows are a much easier target."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image.jpg","title":"royal celtic societys unique music","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWork has begun on processing the twenty entries received for a unique competition which set the country’s musicians the challenge of creating a new shinty composition.

Kerry McWilliams, the founder of Lightwork NI, a charity that has provided more than  sessions of direct support to families over the past two months, said the crossover between school and family le was a major issue for many of the people she has worked with throughout the pandemic. Kerry said they have found that while children were largely able to keep in touch with the outside world and their peers through the likes of social media, many were uncomfortable being taught by their parents. And she said the stresses experienced by some groups of parents, such as key workers or those who had lost their income, made it more dficult for adults to support their children effectively. Home schooling was a cause of signicant conflict and distress, she said. Parents told us they found it very dficult to get children to do the work children told us they were afraid of being found out.One nine-year-old boy told me, #I don#t want to do school work with my parents because they think I#m really smart and they#re going to find out I#m not - I get good marks because I cheat and copy and when they see I can#t do the work they#re going to know#. This was a common fear for children - a sense of discomfort as school invaded their homes and family relationships. Most children like to keep school and home separate. Parents felt exposed and vulnerable as they were unable to understand or support their children#s learning.Many couldn#t access ICT equipment or provide internet access for multiple children and this led to frustration. She continued: We have lived through a global pandemic, a moment in history unprecedented in modern society. Families I have worked with have all moved through paralysing fear, powerlessness and panic. They have taken a fresh look at what makes them happy, what is worth fighting for - we all realised it#s not toilet roll - and how far they have sleepwalked into a le they wouldn#t have consciously chosen, and don#t really want to go back to. I believe the legacy and consequences of lockdown will be signicant for everyone both in the immediate future and for many years to come.She said there are a number of steps parents can take in the coming weeks and months to ensure their children cope with theto school, including drawing upon the relationships that were built during lockdown and ensuring children#s voices are heard. She also recommended putting in place routines and precautions to ensure everyone feels safe: Then you can stop worrying. Our worries communicate to children - when you feel confident and optimistic, they will too.

It#s been an incredibly rushed and quick turn around, but it#s not really until the children are back that we will see how it will work as that may well throw up other issues that we haven#t even thought of yet.Ms White added: However, one of the most fundamental things we need clarity on is what should be done straight awaya child or staff member tests positive for Covid-.

Ralph HewittTwitterEmailAugust   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailTwo of Northern Ireland#s top GPs have urged as many people as possible to get their flu jab this year amid the Covid- pandemic but fear the logistical challenges of administering it.The government plans to double the number of people who receive the influenza jab. The aim is to increase the number of vaccinations from m to m across the UK. Stormont has a target of vaccinating % of vulnerable health groups below the age of . But last year, only % of that group received the jab, while the proportion of at-risk under s vaccinated fell by  percentage points between  and .Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said that m flu jabs will be available here.The chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners for Northern Ireland, Dr Laurence Dorman, said the upcoming flu jab campaign is the most important ever, as it will be very dficult telling the dference between people with flu and Covid- symptoms - although it#s possible to have both at the same time. He added that flu is a killer anyway so it#s really important that everybody gets their flu jab but this year is even more important than ever.With GPs trying to vaccinate as many patients as possible, Dr Dorman added that the problem will then become doing it safely.We need to get patients through as quickly and as safely as possible, said Dr Dorman. We can#t have people congregating in corridors and surgeries so it is going to be more challenging.We#re actively looking at ways to deal with that. We don#t have the final decision yet but things that we#re looking at are drive-thru clinics, sports halls, church halls and all of those options. It will be challenging.West Belfast GP Dr George O#Neill also felt the major problem facing practices is providing the vaccine in a safe and efficient way.How do you ensure that you don#t contaminate your premises  he said. You could end up having to close down for a deep clean and quarantine some of your staff. There are big issues involved.

It is an eyewatering sum, but it is indicative that health officials are desperate to address the situation. National headlines scream about growing waiting times, of patients languishing on waiting lists - according to most recent figures, .m people in NHS England have breached the nine-week waiting list target. While it is clearly a lot of people, it actually pales in comparison when you look at the figures for Northern Ireland. The Department of Health here published its latest waiting time statistics on Thursday and they basically confirmed what we already knew - that local patients and staff are being routinely failed by a system that is just not fit for purpose. Almost , people here were waiting longer than nine weeks for a first outpatient appointment at the end of June. This means that five times as many people in Northern Ireland are waiting longer than nine weeks for their first hospital appointment per head of the population than their counterparts across the water. Of course, it is nothing new that people here appear to be on the receiving end of an inferior service compared to people in England. In  one of the most prominent doctors in the UK lambasted waiting times here.He said his patients in England would never stand for the delays that had become commonplace here. Fast-forward eight years and the situation has done nothing but deteriorate. Add the effects of Covid- into the mix and it isn#t too much of a stretch to say the health service is on its knees. As health bosses prepared for an influx of critically ill patients of epic proportions as a result of the pandemic, thousands of clinics, diagnostic tests and operations were cancelled. There is little sign that things are going to resume anytime soon with all but the most urgent of cases still being delayed as the threat of a second Covid- wave looms large. Meanwhile, last month patients waiting for operations were dealt a blow when a surgeon said his colleagues were twiddling their thumbs due to a lack of experienced theatre nurses and warned it was likely to be next year before services get back up and running properly. With a lack of hospital beds, winter pressures just around the corner, staff shortages and the pandemic rumbling on, waiting lists are not going to improve anytime soon. According to the figures released yesterday, just under % of the , patients waiting for a first outpatient appointment in June had been waiting longer than a year. Given the challenges facing the service in the months ahead, it is more than likely that will rise further by the time the next statistics are released. Much-needed reform of the service, which will help to address waiting times, is under way, but the absence of a fully al Assembly for a few years hindered much of the progress. In the meantime, more people will be added to the waiting lists and some will even die while waiting for treatment.

This continues to be the biggest public health crisis in a generation.“Any complacency presents a challenge to us all,”He said there has been a “blatant disregard” for Covid- regulations by some in the hospitality sector.“If you flout the rules you must face the consequences,” he told the Stormont news conference.While praising Hospitality Ulster for their lead in the industry, the Minister said he will now propose to his executive colleagues that legislation should be strengthened to punish those premises who have been flouting restrictions.Chief Scientic Adviser Professor Ian Young said that while Antrim and Newtownabbey continues to see the most new cases of Covid-, there is growing concern over the number of cases in Belfast.“Our low point was the beginning of July when we were experiencing three to four cases of the virus per day,” he says.“Now that is almost  cases per day on average.“The highest incidence of cases recently has been in Mid and East Antrim, but the area he is most concerned about is Belfast, where the number of caes is is rising “consistently and steadily”.“Cases of the virus per day have increased more than tenfold since early July.“At present most of those cases are in younger people and show hospital admissions and bed occupancy are growing slowly,” he said.“Nonetheless it is clear that the virus is spreading and is everywhere in Northern Ireland.”Following two recent Covid- outbreaks at Craigavon Hospital, the Health Minister told the briefing that further clusters hospitals “are inevitable” and he warned that there will be a dficult winter ahead.“We must stick together as a society,” he said.And responding to news that , people in Northern Ireland are waiting for a first consultant appointment, the minister described waiting times as “totally and absolutely intolerable”.“I won’t try to defend them as they are indefensible,” he said, adding that while the pandemic had “blown plans off course” for tackling waiting lists, all Health trusts were still working towards delivering the New Decade New Approach plan announced in January.Belfast Related ContentCoronavirusCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Swann pledges to tackle #atrocious# hospital waiting times as one new death confirmedHealth minister Robin Swann has said he is working to tackle atrocious hospital waiting times but said further outbreaks and clusters in healthcare settings are inevitable as winter months approach.

My personal view is that’s a conservative estimate.”He added: “This isn’t a cyclical economic shock, this is a profound structural shock to the local economy which is going to take years to address.“You can’t expect economic output in Northern Ireland to decrease by at least % on a per annum basis and not have signicant profound structural changes in the local economy.“The true impact will really on be felt from an economic perspective as we head into the end of October, November and December time.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fce .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_cb-aa-db-b-bf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fce .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_cb-aa-db-b-bf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fce .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_cb-aa-db-b-bf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fce .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_cb-aa-db-b-bf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fce .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_cb-aa-db-b-bf_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fce .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_cb-aa-db-b-bf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fce .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_cb-aa-db-b-bf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fce .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_cb-aa-db-b-bf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fce .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_cb-aa-db-b-bf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fce .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_cb-aa-db-b-bf_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Permanent Secretary at the Department for the Economy Mike Brennan.

Mr Brennan said a number of interventions need to be fast tracked, with  bids for projects to be brought to the Executive.Ms Dodds described the Eat Out to Help Out scheme as having created a “very busy August for many restaurants”, and staycations as having “played an important role” in helping the tourism industry.“We all know that we are not out of the woods yet,” she said.She described the rebuilding of the economy as going “hand in hand” with health.“If we allow the economy to collapse under the weight of Covid, people’s health and wellbeing would also suffer greatly so rebuilding our economy goes hand in hand with protecting people’s health,” she said.“It is not a choice of either or, it is absolutely essential that we work to rebuild our economy as well as protecting people’s health and wellbeing.“I will continue to move the economy forward in a careful and considered way.”PAMost ReadEamonn Holmes faces criticism over #Rule Britannia# slavery debateLet there be light: Derelict Belfast church transformed into heavenly homesCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Swann pledges to tackle #atrocious# hospital waiting times as one new death confirmedAnger at hijack thugs after Tesco halts deliveries to Northern Ireland estateUlster Rugby suspend training after Academy squad hit by outbreak of coronavirus,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchSocialsFacebookTwitterEmailThe Belfastis a member of IPSO and subscribes to its Editors Code of PracticeIpsoSitemapContact UsTerms  ConditionsPrivacy StatementCookie PolicyPaid-for content PolicyGroup WebsitesAdvertise with UsAn INM Websitecopy Belfastdocument.documentElement.style.setPropertydocument.documentElement.style.setProperty"},{"url":null,"title":"orangeman to toast 100th with queens card and tot of","story":"descriptionpinPlease confirm to access your content OK\",template_summary: Order summaryNeed help  Contact Customer CareAccountBillingConfirmation.epplans:not .epplans-more .eporder-box.-new .eporder.is-new .eporder-box.-new .eporder.is-new .eporder-box.-select .field .StripeElement .field .StripeElement--focus #fp-payment-form .button selected_price\" class\"-as: -c:dt -fw:\"View other plansother_pricesSelect payment methodNew Cardother_payment_optionsPayment detailsCard NumberExpiration DateCVVComplete paymentLockSecure transaction\" class\"-as: -c:dt -fw:\"ArrowleftSelect a dferent payment method,template_summary_coupon_code: \"Coupon Codecoupon_validationRedeem Code\",template_summary_coupon_code_applied: \"\",template_premium_fadeout: \"\",template_redeem_coupon_code: Redeem your SubscriptionEnter your code here\" required\"\"The access code entered is not valid.

Stanley Beckett from Waringstown has been a member of Kilmore LOL  since he was . He has also served  years in the Royal Black Preceptory and the Apprentice Boys. Despite his advancing years and mobility issues, he had never missed a Twelfth celebration until this year, when they were cancelled because of the pandemic. And plans for a large th birthday party at his beloved Kilmore Orange Hall tonight have also had to be put on hold due to the health restrictions. Instead Stanley will celebrate at home with his two daughters, two granddaughters and two great-granddaughters. A well-known face around Waringstown in Co Down, he moved from his home town of Portadown to live in the village after marrying his late we Edith  years ago. The couple had been wed  years when she passed away in  aged . They have two girls, Carol and Sylvia. Stanley is the only surviving member of  siblings. He worked for most of his le in the Co-op.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseStanley with late we Edith and daughters Carol and Sylvia FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappStanley with late we Edith and daughters Carol and SylviaHe retired as manager of its Portadown branch in . He then worked part-time in his brother#s sports and work wear shop Sidney Beckett#s in Lurgan. Although now less mobile, Stanley believes the key to a long le is keeping active - cycling to work to save the bus fare for family holidays in Portrush, tending his vegetable garden, reading, and the odd wee Black Bush. He said: I have a half-acre of garden and I have grown everything in it since  until I was  and couldn#t look after it any more. I haven#t had to buy a vegetable in all that time. One year I was able to freeze lb of peas and lb of beans. I still enjoy reading, although I haven#t had my books changed since March because the mobile library has stopped. I usually read  books a month, mostly westerns or thrillers. I stopped smoking when I was  but I still enjoy the odd glass of Black Bush. Daughter Carol Gardiner fondly remembers her dad#s dedication to his family. She said: Dad was always active and cycled to work in Dunmurry from Waringstown and back for years to save the bus fare so that he could take us on holiday to Portrush. He remembers one year the weather was so bad that we spent most of our time in Barry#s amusements. When the holiday was over he had just six pence in his pocket. Looking back through his le, Stanley remembers a miners# strike of the late s when there was no coal and people used a mixture of sawdust and slack to fuel their fires. However, it is service in the Orange, Black and Apprentice Boys which he said has given him great memories and many friends over the years. He was also a bass drummer with Kilmore Flute Band for  years. Stanley has held numerous offices in each of the dferent groups including lodge grand master and chairman of the Apprentice Boys Mid Ulster Amalgamated committee. He was devastated when the Twelfth had to be cancelled this year, making it the first he had missed in over  years. One of the highlights of his birthday today will be receiving a card from the Queen. He and his we received one on their th wedding anniversary and again on heir th. Stanley added: I have wanted the hat-trick and now I#ve got it. I can#t wait until the Queen is  and I can send her a card.

It is not the first time he faced a challenge in that part of Ulster. He tells Liam Tunney his gripping story, outlining his reasons for wanting to break the stigma of addictionA County Derry man has spoken of his experience with addiction as he prepares for a fundraising challenge in aid of the organisation who helped him deal with it. Dean Groogan, from Ballinascreen, is raising money for the Cuan Mhuire rehabilitation centre in Newry by climbing the seven peaks of the Mourne Mountains this weekend with a number of friends. The -year-old, well-known in south Derry for his story-telling and recitation talent, has spoken about his story to encourage others who may be struggling to seek the help they need. “I know a lot of people that need help, but they dont know where to get it or how to go about it,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I wasnt originally going to talk about myself, but I was talking to my girlfriend and people close to me and they said, why are you beating about the bush  “They saidI wanted to break the stigma, I had to be straight and honest, and it made sense. The more I tell my story, itll help people come forward and get help themselves.” Dean had been struggling with drug addiction for a number of years before attending the Newry rehabilitation centre, and says the continued fight to cover up his problems took its toll. “For a lot of years I was struggling. I can make all the excuses in the world about mental health problems, anxiety, depression and guilt, but I got deep into addiction with fake highs,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “I was covering up for a lot of years. I can wear a hundred and one masks and people would think I was in great form, but deep down I was a broken person. “I was hiding that for a long time and I tried a thousand times to get myself sorted, but I would not do it on my own. “It was put to me a few times about getting residential help, but I didnt want it, because it was a pride thing for me. I was embarrassed people would find out. “Eventually I had to put my hands up and say I needed help. I didnt lose my job or my family, so it wasnt rock bottom that way, but emotionally, I was at rock bottom. “I didnt know where to go, I was just a broken person in the depths of depression. Just a broken man. I had to get help and Cuan Mhuire was a le-saver for me.” Dean and Pat McGinn met up a few weeks ago to record a video about Cuan Mhuire. Dean was introduced to Pat McGinn, a former Lord Mayor of Newry and someone who had been through Cuan Mhuire previously. He admits though, thatit wasnt for the intervention of his girlfriend Emma, and close family and friends, he might not have taken that step. “Cuan Mhuire saved my le, andit hadnt been for my girlfriend Emma and my close family and friends, I wouldnt have gone,” he said. “I wont say Cuan Mhuire did it all for me, because they dont just put a magic wand over your head and say thats you free, because you have to put in the work yourself. “I went in and gave it my all and Cuan Mhuire gave me three months to get my head sorted, myself straight, allowed me to recharge the batteries and I came out a dferent man.” Cuan Mhuire was set up in  by Sister Consilio in Athy, County Kildare. The Newry centre was built in  and originally catered for those suffering from alcohol addiction. These days, the spectrum of addiction is much wider. “In this day and age, its not as simple as a man lying drunk in the street. Drugs are everywhere, in every bar you go into, and its so easy for a young person to get hooked on something,” said Dean. “They try it for a bit of craic and the next thing they know, its a few months down the line and theyre in something they cant get out of. It destroys lives. “Drugs are a new thing, people dont really understand. I was speaking to a man who was drinking for years. He said he never touched drugs, butthey had been about in his day he probably would have. “Its so easily available these days and it wrecks families. It rips the soul clean out of you. For me, I detested myself. I knew what I was doing was wrong and that it was wrecking my le. “I just couldnt stop. Addiction is something that you cant get enough of, but that you detest. It was just ruining me and Cuan Mhuire was a le-saver for me.” The Cuan Mhuire centre in Newry. On Saturday, August , Dean and a group of friends will climb the seven peaks of the Mourne Mountains to raise money for the centre. They are already well on the way to their pound, target, and are hoping the trip will be a fun way of raising money and awareness for Cuan Mhuire. “Eight of us are going to start off at six in the morning and tackle the highest peaks in the Mournes,” said the Ballinascreen native. “I know a few boys that have done it in around  or  hours, but were not going to break any records! There are a few men going to meet us halfway up and do us a barbeque, so itll be a days craic as well. “I know money donated to the charity is great, but stigma is the main thing, so Ill be pushing online about the residential care for people suffering with drugs, gambling or drink.” Dean wants to ensure that anyone who finds themselves in need of help knows where to access it, and is especially keen to help men who may be struggling and reluctant to act. “As men, we bottle a lot of things up, personal things like depression or anxiety and people turn to drink or drugs or other highs to mask them things,” he said. “They are taught from no age not to show any emotions, to bottle it up and be a man, and thats not the reality. Theyre turning to other substances to mask the pain and thats just not the way to go. “This is to let them know that places like Cuan Mhuire are out there and will help themthey come forward. “Anything can go through that door thats one thing I found out about it. There are all dferent age groups and all dferent backgrounds and religions. “There are people with plenty of money and people with none. There were even a few people who were homeless whose families want nothing to do with them. “Addiction doesnt care who you are, it will come for you regardless. Putting yourself out there warts and all isnt easy, butit helps someone, thats the reason for doing it.” For more information, visit the Mourne Mountain Challenge Facebook page, where you can find links to the Just Giving page, for those wishing to donate.

It is not the first time he faced a challenge in that part of Ulster. He tells Liam Tunney his gripping story, outlining his reasons for wanting to break the stigma of addictionA County Derry man has spoken of his experience with addiction as he prepares for a fundraising challenge in aid of the organisation who helped him deal with it. Dean Groogan, from Ballinascreen, is raising money for the Cuan Mhuire rehabilitation centre in Newry by climbing the seven peaks of the Mourne Mountains this weekend with a number of friends. The -year-old, well-known in south Derry for his story-telling and recitation talent, has spoken about his story to encourage others who may be struggling to seek the help they need. “I know a lot of people that need help, but they dont know where to get it or how to go about it,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I wasnt originally going to talk about myself, but I was talking to my girlfriend and people close to me and they said, why are you beating about the bush  “They saidI wanted to break the stigma, I had to be straight and honest, and it made sense. The more I tell my story, itll help people come forward and get help themselves.” Dean had been struggling with drug addiction for a number of years before attending the Newry rehabilitation centre, and says the continued fight to cover up his problems took its toll. “For a lot of years I was struggling. I can make all the excuses in the world about mental health problems, anxiety, depression and guilt, but I got deep into addiction with fake highs,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “I was covering up for a lot of years. I can wear a hundred and one masks and people would think I was in great form, but deep down I was a broken person. “I was hiding that for a long time and I tried a thousand times to get myself sorted, but I would not do it on my own. “It was put to me a few times about getting residential help, but I didnt want it, because it was a pride thing for me. I was embarrassed people would find out. “Eventually I had to put my hands up and say I needed help. I didnt lose my job or my family, so it wasnt rock bottom that way, but emotionally, I was at rock bottom. “I didnt know where to go, I was just a broken person in the depths of depression. Just a broken man. I had to get help and Cuan Mhuire was a le-saver for me.” Dean and Pat McGinn met up a few weeks ago to record a video about Cuan Mhuire. Dean was introduced to Pat McGinn, a former Lord Mayor of Newry and someone who had been through Cuan Mhuire previously. He admits though, thatit wasnt for the intervention of his girlfriend Emma, and close family and friends, he might not have taken that step. “Cuan Mhuire saved my le, andit hadnt been for my girlfriend Emma and my close family and friends, I wouldnt have gone,” he said. “I wont say Cuan Mhuire did it all for me, because they dont just put a magic wand over your head and say thats you free, because you have to put in the work yourself. “I went in and gave it my all and Cuan Mhuire gave me three months to get my head sorted, myself straight, allowed me to recharge the batteries and I came out a dferent man.” Cuan Mhuire was set up in  by Sister Consilio in Athy, County Kildare. The Newry centre was built in  and originally catered for those suffering from alcohol addiction. These days, the spectrum of addiction is much wider. “In this day and age, its not as simple as a man lying drunk in the street. Drugs are everywhere, in every bar you go into, and its so easy for a young person to get hooked on something,” said Dean. “They try it for a bit of craic and the next thing they know, its a few months down the line and theyre in something they cant get out of. It destroys lives. “Drugs are a new thing, people dont really understand. I was speaking to a man who was drinking for years. He said he never touched drugs, butthey had been about in his day he probably would have. “Its so easily available these days and it wrecks families. It rips the soul clean out of you. For me, I detested myself. I knew what I was doing was wrong and that it was wrecking my le. “I just couldnt stop. Addiction is something that you cant get enough of, but that you detest. It was just ruining me and Cuan Mhuire was a le-saver for me.” The Cuan Mhuire centre in Newry. On Saturday, August , Dean and a group of friends will climb the seven peaks of the Mourne Mountains to raise money for the centre. They are already well on the way to their pound, target, and are hoping the trip will be a fun way of raising money and awareness for Cuan Mhuire. “Eight of us are going to start off at six in the morning and tackle the highest peaks in the Mournes,” said the Ballinascreen native. “I know a few boys that have done it in around  or  hours, but were not going to break any records! There are a few men going to meet us halfway up and do us a barbeque, so itll be a days craic as well. “I know money donated to the charity is great, but stigma is the main thing, so Ill be pushing online about the residential care for people suffering with drugs, gambling or drink.” Dean wants to ensure that anyone who finds themselves in need of help knows where to access it, and is especially keen to help men who may be struggling and reluctant to act. “As men, we bottle a lot of things up, personal things like depression or anxiety and people turn to drink or drugs or other highs to mask them things,” he said. “They are taught from no age not to show any emotions, to bottle it up and be a man, and thats not the reality. Theyre turning to other substances to mask the pain and thats just not the way to go. “This is to let them know that places like Cuan Mhuire are out there and will help themthey come forward. “Anything can go through that door thats one thing I found out about it. There are all dferent age groups and all dferent backgrounds and religions. “There are people with plenty of money and people with none. There were even a few people who were homeless whose families want nothing to do with them. “Addiction doesnt care who you are, it will come for you regardless. Putting yourself out there warts and all isnt easy, butit helps someone, thats the reason for doing it.” For more information, visit the Mourne Mountain Challenge Facebook page, where you can find links to the Just Giving page, for those wishing to donate. Anyone who is in need of help or support with addiction can contact Cuan Mhuire by phone on  or via email – newry@cuanmhuire.ie  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dara saw off tough competition from Paloma Faith’s other acts, Isla and Hayley, to become her representative in the final four. ”You have this amazing talent that’s technical but feels so sensitive,” said the coach. ”That feeds into the way you sing because it’s just pure beauty.” The St Colm’s High School pupil was congratulated by his family after his performance and can now look forward to the final round of the competition. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Jeananne Craig worked in the English capital and Dublin for more than a decade, reporting on breaking news and showbiz red carpets.  But after the birth of her second child in , the Rosemount woman decided to relocate to the city where she grew up. “I had a great time in London and some amazing experiences there, but like many Derry people living away from home, I always missed it,” Jeananne said. “We moved to Derry a year and a half ago and are so happy to be here, particularly in the last six months, when having a bit more space and being close to family and nature has been so important.” googletag.cmd.push With a growing trend for people looking to leave built-up cities for quieter, more affordable locations post-lockdown, Jeananne decided to share her experience and that of other ‘city quitters’ in a podcast. All Change Please is co-hosted by Jeananne, who now works as a freelance journalist and copywriter, and her friend and fellow journalist, Jayne Cherrington-Cook, who left London for Kent. They release new episodes fortnightly and interviewees in series one include s music royalty-turned-designer Pearl Lowe, who moved from London to Somerset, Irish presenter and illustrator Maggie Molloy, and original Big Brother winner Craig Phillips, who reveals he once rented a room from the shows notorious Nasty Nick. googletag.cmd.push We cover all sorts of topics, from the practicalities of moving, to working from home and making friends somewhere new - and whether people have any regrets about leaving a big city, said Jeananne. Its all done remotely with Jayne in Kent, me in Derry and our guest joining from wherever theyre based. I actually have to record in my parents house, my own is too noisy with two young children running around and wanting to join in, said Jeananne who, plans to include some well-known local names soon.The logo for All Change Please was designed by local artist Bronach Crabtee, aka The Crafty Crab. The plan is to attract listeners considering a move, but I think our interviewees have such interesting stories to tell, it will make a good listen for anyone looking for a new podcast to enjoy, Jeananne added. The first two episodes of All Change Please are online now, with new episodes released fortnightly on a Thursday. The podcast is available on iTunes, Spoty and Acast, and is on Twitter @allchangepod https:podcasts.apple gb podcast all-change-please id  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The colleges smart new unorm includes a blazer and jumper piped in gold which can be worn with a skirt or trousers. School principal, Martine Mulhern, said the new look came about after pupils said they wanted to be able to decide which they wanted to wear. A lot of the girls prefer to wear a skirt, but they said other pupils should have the choicethey want to wear trousers, she said. The whole idea of respecting other peoples choices is very important. googletag.cmd.push Last year the school council surveyed the pupils who voted overwhelmingly in favour of introducing a trouser option. This led to a long process of designing the new unorm, with the pupils allowed their say in how it should look and feel. The conversation started with Hunters Apparel in Derry who gave us dferent designs and that solid groundwork allowed us to get to the place where we are today, said Mrs Mulhern. The girls were so mature and insightful throughout it all. They knew and understood that there were certain things we couldnt do, but it was so important they felt comfortable. googletag.cmd.push There were a few prototypes before we got to the finished designs, but everyone is delighted with them. They are all loving the new blazer because its very smart and really brightens things up, and a surprising number of them have decided to take the option of wearing trousers. StCecilias worked closely with local unorm suppliers Max Fashions and Select Kidz to keep the cost of the new unorm, which has been adopted by the new intake, down. There will be a gradual phasing out of the old unorm over the coming years. The girls are loving the new unorm and as a school community we are so proud of them for taking the lead, added Mrs Mulhern. The children always come first and we have to listen to them. It was the right thing to do.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Micky Doherty was presented with the Foyle Pride Mark Ashton Award for Outstanding Contribution to the LGBTQ+ community by the citys real Mayor, SDLP Councillor Brian Tierney, at a ceremony at the Holywell Trusts Garden of Remembrance on Saturday night. A spokesperson for Foyle Pride said Mr Doherty, who fronts the citys Pride parade each year, was a truly deserving winner who does so much, for not only the LGBTQ+ community, but also the wider city and district community. Mr Doherty is a tireless charity fundraiser and helped set up a special fund to help local people in need during the oronavirus crisis. googletag.cmd.push Im known in the local area as being a charity fundraiser-theres a charity fundraiser Ill host it, said Mr Doherty. Its just part of me that I like helping people. During lockdown I knew people had started to struggle and they were coming to me and I started to think about how I could help. Because I have been working with charities for a long time people put their trust in me. Mr Doherty was hosting a drive through bingo event last week when he got a phone call to say he had won the Foyle Pride award. I just burst out crying, he admitted. I really didnt expect it so I was just overwhelmed. googletag.cmd.push I just have so much gratitude for the award and for everyone who nominated me and I want to thank them all. Mr Doherty said he wished his late mum, Cathy, could have been there on Saturday to see him receive his award. Its hard to accept that my mammy couldnt be there, he said. Its just not the same without her but I am still filled with so much gratitude for it, he said. Derry LGBT+ campaigner, Suzanna Toland, who passed away earlier this year, was remembered at Saturdays ceremony. It was really nice to see Suzanna recognised for everything that she did, said Micky. She was a very special person.Before she passed away she had set up an LGBT+ disco at Rosie Joes so that people would have a safe place to socialise.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The guidance, announced this evening by Peter Weir, comes into effect from August . The Minister said: “My key priority is that pupilsto school on a full-time basis, as soon as it is safe to do so. “Following further advice which I have received today from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientic Adviser, I am recommending that pupils and teachers wear a face covering in corridors and other communal areas of post-primary schools from next week when schoolsfull-time. googletag.cmd.push ”This updates the existing guidance on the use of face coverings in educational settings. “The current public health advice is that the use of face coverings provides some benefits, however, it is not a replacement for frequent hand washing, social distancing where possible, covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and regular cleaning of surfaces. “It is also important to remember that evidence suggests that the risk of transmission in schools is relatively low compared to some other settings. “My existing guidance on the reopening of schools already deals with the use of face coverings. “In terms of school transport, the advice remains the same, that we strongly recommend that all pupils wear a face covering on all dedicated school transport including buses and taxis where it is appropriate for them to do so. googletag.cmd.push “In relationto communal areas in schools, the guidance already strongly encourages face coverings for activities that entail large numbers of staff or pupils within an enclosed space where social distancing is not possible.  “Given the risk mitigations in place in schools to limit and contain the spread of Covid-, face coverings are not recommended as being compulsory for routine use in education settings. “However, staff and pupils may wish to use them during the routine school day and this is acceptable. “Schools should also be aware that some personsare exempt from wearing face coverings. “I will continue to keep all guidance in respect of education settings under review in light of the latest medical and scientic advice. Peter Weir added: “The first step in keeping our schools safe is that anyone with symptoms should not attend school. Parents should not send their children to schoolthey have any of the Covid- symptoms including: a high temperaturea new, continuous cougha loss or change to your sense of smell or taste.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mrs Patricia Herron, Music Co-ordinator at St Eoghans Primary School, Draperstown, has watched Daras talent grow and develop from an early age. “He was maybe P or P when I realised that there might be a little voice in there that needs to be heard,” she told the County Derry Post. “The routine in our school would be that I askany children want to have a go at auditioning for a solo piece, so Dara would come up to the piano and this beautul, soft, quiet voice would come out. googletag.cmd.push “He sang solo at ious religious ceremonies as well, but it was really towards the end of P when his voice was developing so much more. “He was using a lot of ornamentation and trills and it came to light when he was singing an Irish song, with the traditional voice.” It was while singing an Irish song at his primary school show that the wider community began to take notice of the -year-olds phenomenal talent. Patricia recalled the moment his mum, Donna, was overcome with emotion watching her son hold an audience spellbound. “At that concert, when Dara sang the Irish song, I was sitting behind Donna,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “He hadnt sang it for his mammy purposely, and Donna just turned around and looked at me, and I looked at her, and there were tears in her eyes. I just nodded asto say, I told you so.” In a nod to the community ethos in Ballinascreen, Mrs Herron said the fact Dara is so grounded and kind is testament to his upbringing. “He is such a lovely young man, so mannerly and kind. Even when I watch him on The Voice, hes always worried about everybody ,” she said. Pupils and staff at his former primary school, St Eoghans, beside a poster in support of Dara McNicholl “His voice is an absolute gt, and a gt that he must share with the world, because anybody Ive spoken to just wishes him so much luck. “Behind that is a lovely young man, and we wish him all the best. Hes very grounded and so are his family.” Daras exploits in The Voice Kids competition have enthused pupils and staff alike at a school where they take performance and the wholistic view of the child seriously. “In St Eoghans, we place a lot of importance on performing, and getting to know childrens talents, discover what they are and develop them,” said Mrs Herron. “Some schools think nowadays that concerts and opportunities to perform take away from learning time, but that is when you learn things like resilience, self-confidence and self-esteem. “The children from this area seem to be very musical and its an important part of our school, but Dara is such an inspiration. “From Primary  right up to Pimary , and indeed the staff, they just want to be like Dara. Any chance to sing now in school, Ill have a line of about a hundred children waiting to audition for a solo part!” After securing his place in the final with a beautul rendition of Sineacutead OConnors Nothing Compares  U on Saturday, Dara will take on fellow contestants George Elliott, Victoria Alsina and Justine Afante in the final. Coach Paloma Faith described his voice at the weekend as one of pure beauty and his primary school music teacher agrees. “To see a young child come in in P, get to be such an amazing singer by the time he leaves school, and then to excel and develop, I just cant wait to see what the future holds for him,” she said. “I heard him in an interview, and one of the lines he used was, I just want people to listen to my voice. “Now people have heard it and theyre sitting up, waiting to hear what comes next.” You can watch Dara in the final of the The Voice Kids this Saturday, August , at .pm on ITV.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is understood that the mystery vessel was bought for pound with the unknown owner planning to convert it into an Airbnb boat.  Foyle Search and Rescue , the police and other relevant agencies responded to reports of the boat being stuck on Sunday when they offered the crew assistance. The vessel, Day Dawn N , was last known to be engaged in fishing. according to the Marine Traffic website. Another site, Vessel Finder, also states that it received the latest position of the boat at .pm on August . googletag.cmd.push FSR were tasked on Sunday last, following reports of a grounded vessel. Pat Carlin, of FSR, said the boat was likely to be there until mid-September when the tide would be high enough for it to re-float. “She’s stuck solid,” he added. “We went and assessed the boat, determined that the crew were safe and passed that information on to the police service,” Mr Carlin explained “We provided them with some basic supplies that they needed and basically the vessel is grounded and can’t be move until the tide is lted. “All relevant services were notied and are aware that it’s there.” googletag.cmd.push Mr Carlin continued: “I think they were up on the council pontoon and to the best of my knowledge they may have come from outside the area, I don’t know exactly. “They’ll have no choice but to wait, maybe with the sudden floods tonightthey’ll be lucky and might get re-floated otherwise they’ll have to wait until the tides are high enough.” The PSNI confirmed that police assisted partners, including FSR and Coastguard in liaising with the crew. A report from , shows that Day Dawn N  was bought for the purposes of fishing from Portavogie. It was said to be the first time the vessel had been based anywhere  apart from Kilkeel since her arrival in  from Banff where the wooden-hulled boat was built by John Watt  Sons as a trawler. Harbour master at Portavogie, Neil Warnock, yesterday said Day Dawn was based there but left a couple of months ago. “Somebody bought it for a pleasure craft,” he explained. “It’s not a fishing boat any more, the licence on it was sold off a while ago there. “The last I heard the boat was in Portrush, I saw a picture of it at Portrush harbour after it left here.” At Portrush, the assistant harbour master said the boat owner was only there for three days and he believed the man travelled from the Greencastle direction. He was trying to get himself a permanent mooring, he said, but wasn’t able to secure it. The owner left Portrush heading towards Derry where he tried to get a mooring in the town and ended up on the mud flats. “I just know that he bought that for pound. None of the fishermen like decommissioning so they basically would rather they go off. “So I think he bought it for a pound and wanted to change it into an Air B ‘n’ B, but we couldn’t offer him a permanent mooring in Portrush, so he was only here for three days,” the Assistant Harbour Master added. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Foyle Port added: “Foyle Port is aware that a small trawler has run aground at Madams Bank in the River Foyle. “There is no environmental threat or impediment to other marine craft. “Once conditions are right we expect the vessel to become buoyant again.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Shortly before nine oclock to be precise. Peter Buzzers back bar in Maghera is sparsely populated. Apart from the commentary, as Gaeilge, from TGs GAA  programme humming out of the TV on the wall, you couldve heard a pin drop. Its a Monday club with a dference. There are no boom boxes, no empty take away pizza boxes strewn around the tables nor half drunk people roaring into your ear while making little or no sense. Less than  hours earlier, two decades of concerted Slaughtneil planning and effort morphed into a slick hunger Loughgiel simply couldnt deal with. By the tenth minute, the maroon and white hooped juggernaut had broken into the orbit of Ulster hurling. Nine points clear and  months after the hurt of an extra time defeat by Cushendall, there was no catching them. googletag.cmd.push In his victory speech, Chrissy McKaigue thanked every man, woman and dog involved in their success. Everyone except Thomas Cassidy, who had passed away days before. He waited until the inner sanctum of a packed Slaughtneil hall later that night, when back among their own. The Four Seasons Cup was clasped by one victorious outstretched fist. The index finger on his other hand gestured to the hall floor scarcely visible below the throngs of fans, where Thomas taught him how to play hurling all those years ago. There wasnt a dry eye in the house. Even the walls wouldve had goosebumps. googletag.cmd.push On the Monday night, his brothers Mark, Declan and Bungazed at Buzzers TV with a look and a body language that money couldnt buy. Slaughtneil were at the top of the tree. The new Ulster champions had many helping hands to shape them along the way. But the Cassidys fingerprints were always prominent. Taking over the mantle of the Kellys, who sowed the seeds in the s. Mark and Declan seemed like eternal minor managers when, in the beginning, silverware didnt always reward their toil. On a monsoon afternoon at Kevin Lynch Park, a saturated Bun thumped the roof of the then prefab dressing rooms to the sound of campeones. A team he managed with former minor winner Eoin McGuigan, that included Cormac McKenna and Chrissy McKaigue, had brought home the bacon. It was another building block. Also seated for that Monday viewing was Dermot Doherty, a selector under Michael McShane who is now running his eye over the minors. The apple doesnt fall far from the tree. His father Barney and the late Eugene Babs Kelly managed the clubs  winning team. It was a fitting reward for Barneys ferrying of average underage teams, year after year, in the back of his blue Mercedes van. Often on the lookout for a th player to make up a team that would iniably be on the end of many a hammering. An U shield at a blitz in Dungiven and a South Derry minor hurling final win against Lavey were the modest s for the effort. A FIRST FEacuteILE Below it all, another batch was coming to the fore to cut new ground. In , under Thomas and Barney and captained by current minor selector Adrian Quigg, Slaughtneil won their first ever Feacuteile title. By minor level, with direction from Mark and Declan Cassidy, back to back Ulster minor titles followed, from a group that also won a football title at St Pauls and lost in the final the following year. A generation that also produced current senior football boss Paul Bradley. Under Thomas wing, they won the senior title in  before being beaten out the gate by Dunloy in the Ulster final. It couldve been the beginning of dominance, but instead it was a last senior title for  years as Kevin Lynchs and Lavey ruled the roost. Armed with more coaches coming forward, the Slaughtneil underage hurling production line succeeded Ballinascreens time at the top. No longer was the journey south to the Feacuteile a novelty. It was a permanent fixture in the calendar. With it, came families bonding together and each success inspired the younger teams to follow. A new wave of minor glory at Ballinascreens Ulster tournament followed, but Kevin Lynchs were still the standard at senior level.  was supposed to be the breakthrough year. After winning a league title, Slaughtneils young guns were the pretenders to the Fr Collins Cup only to be sent home with their tail between their legs again by the Lynchs. It was neighbours Swatragh that took the cup for the first of eight seasons into the Granaghan parish where it still remains. The following year, under Mickey Glover, Slaughtneil eventually wrestled clear of Kevin Lynchs on their way to glory. In Ulster, their gung-ho tactics and bravery put Loughgiel to the pin of their collar in a moral victory to ascertain the level required. For the next two years they faced Cushendall in Ulster, but again came up short. All the while the underage production line continued. The Fr Collins Cup was present at one of the underage management meetings, almost as a sign of the level that needed maintained. With every year, came one or two new players into the squad. The fact that Michael McShane handed Shane McGuigan his senior debut in an Ulster final, while still a minor, was a sign of their commitment to growing the team to a height to challenge the big boys. McShane built a management team to match the players ambitions. Every base was covered. Cormac Donnelly came in as trainer. Their games were all analysed. Like the footballers and camogs, the strength and conditioning made them a finely tuned engine. The pre-game routine was planned to the nth degree, so that all the players had to do was turn up and deliver. And they did. Three Ulsters later and their stature on the national stage has soared. Cuala beat them in the manner Dunloy did in . It was followed by defeat to Na Piarsaigh, a game they surrendered from a position of strength. How times had changed. In the s, when Tom Magill had Lavey at their peak, just winning a championship game was a challenge. Now, not being happy after putting up a performance on the All-Ireland stage told enough about the ambition. The Ballyhale game was the greatest statement of intent, taking the giants of club hurling every step of the way. In the physical stakes, they were able to match them and in the skills of the game they were not found wanting either. In an epic, they came so close to the biggest day of all. This weekend, they enter the knockout championship stage again. They will have the favourites tag. There are no two ways around it. Last week, they saw off Na Magha with virtually a reserve team. Only Jerome McGuigan, suspended against Lavey, started from their All-Ireland semi-final team. Thats how far Slaughtneils hurling story has come. From the days when getting  players for a game was an achievement, they have set a standard of skill, attitude and athleticism that the rest of Derry must strive to reach. Success comes in cycles. In recent times, Kevin Hinphey has followed his father into coaching and led Kevin Lynchs to back to back Ulster minor hurling titles. They have been swimming in Slaughtneils wake, searching for ato the top table. The overall Derry hurling landscape needs them, and others, to narrow the gap. To do so, they will need to match an unrelenting hunger for more success. When you have had barren years like Slaughtneil, you wont want to step off the perch anytime soon.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Shortly before nine oclock to be precise. Peter Buzzers back bar in Maghera is sparsely populated. Apart from the commentary, as Gaeilge, from TGs GAA  programme humming out of the TV on the wall, you couldve heard a pin drop. Its a Monday club with a dference. There are no boom boxes, no empty take away pizza boxes strewn around the tables nor half drunk people roaring into your ear while making little or no sense. Less than  hours earlier, two decades of concerted Slaughtneil planning and effort morphed into a slick hunger Loughgiel simply couldnt deal with. By the tenth minute, the maroon and white hooped juggernaut had broken into the orbit of Ulster hurling. Nine points clear and  months after the hurt of an extra time defeat by Cushendall, there was no catching them. googletag.cmd.push In his victory speech, Chrissy McKaigue thanked every man, woman and dog involved in their success. Everyone except Thomas Cassidy, who had passed away days before. He waited until the inner sanctum of a packed Slaughtneil hall later that night, when back among their own. The Four Seasons Cup was clasped by one victorious outstretched fist. The index finger on his other hand gestured to the hall floor scarcely visible below the throngs of fans, where Thomas taught him how to play hurling all those years ago. There wasnt a dry eye in the house. Even the walls wouldve had goosebumps. googletag.cmd.push On the Monday night, his brothers Mark, Declan and Bungazed at Buzzers TV with a look and a body language that money couldnt buy. Slaughtneil were at the top of the tree. The new Ulster champions had many helping hands to shape them along the way. But the Cassidys fingerprints were always prominent. Taking over the mantle of the Kellys, who sowed the seeds in the s. Mark and Declan seemed like eternal minor managers when, in the beginning, silverware didnt always reward their toil. On a monsoon afternoon at Kevin Lynch Park, a saturated Bun thumped the roof of the then prefab dressing rooms to the sound of campeones. A team he managed with former minor winner Eoin McGuigan, that included Cormac McKenna and Chrissy McKaigue, had brought home the bacon. It was another building block. Also seated for that Monday viewing was Dermot Doherty, a selector under Michael McShane who is now running his eye over the minors. The apple doesnt fall far from the tree. His father Barney and the late Eugene Babs Kelly managed the clubs  winning team. It was a fitting reward for Barneys ferrying of average underage teams, year after year, in the back of his blue Mercedes van. Often on the lookout for a th player to make up a team that would iniably be on the end of many a hammering. An U shield at a blitz in Dungiven and a South Derry minor hurling final win against Lavey were the modest s for the effort. A FIRST FEacuteILE Below it all, another batch was coming to the fore to cut new ground. In , under Thomas and Barney and captained by current minor selector Adrian Quigg, Slaughtneil won their first ever Feacuteile title.

He took trains from Milan to Torino, and then up the Susa Valley and around six hours later he was installed in Susa where it was  degrees.Race day dawned without a cloud in the sky and with the temperature already soaring, Hanna joined the front row of the grid designed for social distancing wearing his mask. The mask was obligatory for the first m. Hanna tucked into a front bunch that was a whorsquos who of Italian mountain racing. Hanna covered the first mile in :, and then at km the race became steep. He climbed well, as ever, encountering a dficult patch around the middle and then at about .km he spotted Baldaccini ahead of him, a past winner in  and .By now Hanna was in tenth place and with his climbing legs feeling good again set about moving up the field. He caught Baldaccini and kept pushing and on to the final k, with  flats and true flats at over , feet altitude, Hanna surged to cross the line in a brilliant eighth place.In the process he had taken the scalps of, not just the former winner of the race Baldaccini, but also Puppi, who had taken second place in last yearrsquos World Long-Distance Mountain Racing Championships, and Bernard Dematteis, the former European mountain racing champion.At Down Royal on Saturday, the sound of hi-tec racing flats reverberated around the horse racing turf as the ChampionChip Ireland Road Race Series continued following its event at Eikon, Balmoral, three weeks ago.It was only August , but could easily have been mistaken for late autumn as the blustery conditions from the remnants of tropical Storm Ellen continued to cause havoc in the quest for personal bests.It was a testament to the consistent running many had done during lockdown and throughout the winter before that there were many personal bests achieved.First up was the km, won by Mourne man Andrew Annett in : in a sprint finish with Annadalersquos Eskander Turki .

The ever-improving Francis Tumelty is now in the M category and after just missing out on his K PB three weeks ago with a : clocking in Eikon, he smashed his : from the Bay Road k in  with a : PB here at Down Royal.Fteen year old Tom Crudgington doesnrsquot much like running on the flat mdash instead he loves the hills and mountains. However, hersquos learning that he needs to improve his running on the flat to take it into the mountains and here he set a PB by around a minute with his : time. Phil Murdock broke the -minute barrier for the first time clocking :.Mark Holland has shown steady improvement in training and is another who is getting faster as he gets older, now in the M category. With a previous best of around  and a half minutes, he smashed that with a brilliant : clocking, a fine product for all the work he has done.Nichola Watson has had injury troubles, but over the past couple of months has been training consistently again. Wondering beforehandshe would be strong enough to dip under  minutes, she put any doubt to rest with a brilliantly paced race to record a letime best of :.Also ing to racing, this time less than six months after giving birth to baby Roacutenaacuten, Ashlene Mussen surprised herself in recording a very strong :.Next up was the half-marathon and as ever a glutton for real punishment, Thomas OrsquoGorman toed the line on the back of his :: PB at Eikon three weeks ago.

At that stage, Bryansford had work to do with Clonduff leading - to -.Charlie Carr split the posts for Clonduff with a superbly taken score. Aidan Carr also got in on the act scoring a minor from play and Stephen McConville got his name on the scoresheet.Aidan Carr added another point and on  minutes the lead was extended further when Arthur McConville landed a big free to make it - to -.Bryansford needed something to steady the ship and they managed it on  minutes, getting their first score on the board when a free from Cathal Burns cut the gap to four points.Clonduff, however, were in no mood to get a case of the jitters and indeed stretched their lead to - to - when, in the th minute, firstly Tom Close got the better of his marker to break free to land another score, and then moments later, Barry OrsquoHagan did likewise.Bryansford were in need of some kind of encouragement and Danny Savage provided it on  minutes when he landed a free.Darren OrsquoHagan however went up the field and confidently steered between the posts to put Clonduff - to - ahead at the half-time interval.Early in the second period, Clonduff kept the foot on the gas to flatten the Bryansford spirit even more.Paddy Brannigan engineered just enough space for himself to punt the ball over Mark Reidrsquos crossbar.And then on  minutes it was - to - when Aidan Carr capitalised on space in the lsquoFord defence to leave Clonduff in the box seat.Clonduff were finding space more and more easy to come by and from a free after five minutes Stephen McConville made it - to -.Bryansford remained honest in the battle and made their third impression on the scoreboard when David McKenna pointed on  minutes.Clonduffrsquos machine was starting to purr productively and they rolled the scoreboard over once more ten minutes after the resumption when Stephen McConville knocked the ball over from play.The sides swapped scores on the -minute mark of the contest when David McKibbin made another minor from a free for lsquoFord, but Stephen McConville pointed for Clonduff to make it - to -.Fintan Canavan scored Bryansfordrsquos fth point before Stephen McConville responded in kind to again leave a nine-point cushion between them.The final minor before the next water break though went the way of Bryansford, Timmy Hanna notching it to make it - to -.In the th minute of the contest, Cathal Burns pointed Bryansfordrsquos seventh point. Savage kept pushing lsquoFord forward, using his experience to encourage those around him, and he knocked over their eighth score of the contest.Barely  seconds later it was Savage again scoring to give lsquoFord some real hope. That set up something of a tense finish to the contest when it had looked like it would be anything but.Twenty four minutes into the second half, Savage again was the commander-in-chief of the counter-offensive, making it three points in a row for Bryansford to cut the scoreline to - to -.A free gave Bryansford and Savage the chance to leave just a goal between the sides, and he made no mistakes, confidently floating his effort between the sticks, continuing his spell as a one-man danger to Clonduffrsquos superiority.However, as the clock began to become the enemy of lsquoFord, Clonduffrsquos Tom Close pointed from play to give Clonduff that crucial lead of four ahead again.Cathal Burns curled a neat point over the bar for Bryansford going into injury time to make it - to -.Then came a moment to stun Clonduff when Bryansford found a goal. Conor Maginn pumped the ball into the area and there was Timmy Hanna to palm it into the back of the net and force the game into extra time.The first ten-minute period of was a cagey affair, with both sides understandably more keen to avoid mistakes than push forward too much.Seven minutes into the first period, the first score was registered by Savage for Bryansford mdash it was the only score of that first spell.In the first minute of the second period Stephen McConville sent over a free, his seventh point of the afternoon. And when Barry OrsquoHagan pointed a moment later, Clonduff edged ahead by a point.That was clawed back again though when, eight minutes into the second period, Peter Brannigan equalised to leave the score - to -.Brannigan, however, was to make an even bigger splash just when this game seemed to have given you everything in twists and turns.He cashed in on a tiring Clonduff defence and fired beyond beyond the flailing efforts of goalkeeper Neil Trainor for a goal, to the delight of the lsquoFord contingent.

Like Pantridge, after the war he could neither forgive nor forget and had a burning hatred of the Japanese.During his time in captivity, Pantridge suffered badly from malnutrition, beri beri and other illnesses. Following the Japanese surrender he weighed less than five stone and was a physical wreck.On ing home to Northern Ireland in October  he was still very weak, but was determined to resume his medical career, getting a housemanrsquos position at the Royal Victoria Hospital.Because of his experiences in the POW camps, he decided to specialise in heart medicine. He became a consultant physician and cardiologist at the RVH before inventing the portable defibrillator in the s.Pantridge had become convinced that a patient might be savedan electric shock was applied to the chest as soon as possible after a cardiac arrest. There were defibrillators in hospitals, but they were too big and bulky to be taken outside.Along with others he set out to make a defibrillator small enough to fit inside an ambulance.

The Minister cannot allow all this to simply be thrown away.The Strangford MLA added: ldquoThe local community previously stood together to save Exploris and will do so again. I would urge anyone with concerns to make their voice heard and lodge their concerns and together we can save our local economy.It is believed that the poundm aquarium proposal could create more than

Please try again later.Submitting...Karen JardineThe reported exponential rise of abuse on social media, often experienced more so by women, and the recording of around , hate-motivated incidents and crimes by the PSNI from April  – March  provide further evidence of the scale of this problem in society today.The task faced by the review team therefore is vast, as is the complexity of taking forward its recommendations due to emerge towards the end of the year. Justice minister Naomi Long has indicated that any subsequent legislation will not be brought to the Assembly before the end of its current mandate in spring .Scotland’s experience reminds us that the balance between protecting the vulnerable whilst maintaining opportunities to explore dferences of opinion in a constructive way can be hard to strike.One aim of the review team is to officially define the term ‘hate’ and what might constitute a ‘hate crime’. However, creating a definition in itself is not a panacea.The blunt instrument of the law, even as a last resort, is no substitute for the hard, and often challenging, work of transforming hearts and minds.In its response PCI has cautioned that finding a way forward on hate crime should not become a precursor to curtailing genuine debate.This, for instance, is why PCI has sought clarity that the legitimate use and exposition of scripture is protected and not constituted as a hate crime – something the Catholic Church feels is not guaranteed in the Scottish proposals.Read More Read MoreHate crime review: Presbyterian Church calls for guarantee that quoting the Bible will not be illegalIn a world increasingly defined through the lens of inidual identity, and choices which we are often told are fluid and non-binary, we risk being left with a binary option which boils down to this – you are not for me then you are against me, andyou are against methere is no place for you to articulate those beliefs in the public square.The place of public debate risks becoming a zero-sum game whereyou win, I lose, and vice versa.The public square is changing rapidly, not only becoming more erse with the rejection of old norms and the promotion of new philosophies and ideas, but conversely getting smaller through this rise of ‘cancel culture’. It is also getting louder with a cacophony of voices readily available at all times through social media and the -hour news cycle – all competing to be heard and therefore using more and more extreme and intolerant language.Against this background the challenge to create space for considerate discourse, respectful listening, and agreeing to disagree well is one which we all have a responsibility to grasp.For many Christians grounding their public conduct in the truth-claims of their faith forms a key element of their religious commitment.Recognising this is a vital part of what it means for a society to genuinely value religious freedom.There must be space within society to express views with which others may disagree, recognising that this works both ways and allows people to express views about religious belief with which we may disagree.After all, the freedom to only express ideas that are popular is no freedom at all.In a perfect world this type of legislation would be unnecessary. In our imperfect and fallen worldlet’s make sure we get such legislation as right as possible, achieving a balance which both protects the vulnerable and facilitates respectful debate.– Karen Jardine is the Public Affairs Officer at the Presbyterian Church in IrelandHate crime: Dissent over gay marriage ‘could see you before NI criminal court’Ramore restaurant row: Stephen Nolan wondershealth workers effectively banned from all restaurants________________________A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Please try again later.Submitting...Letter to the editorThat system is either brokeor very close to it.NI is far from unique in having constantly rising demands for public spending. What is unusual is that there appears to be almost nothing in our political structures which acts either as any sort of brake on those demands, or might promote greater revenue-raising from within the region.At the beginning of this year we had the ‘New Decade, New Approach’– this contained very ambitious statements about what the parties wished to achieve through a restored Executive. At the time it was estimated that £bn of extra funding might be required to realise such projects. With hindsight it is fairly clear the actual shortfall was much larger than that.Since then, we’ve obviously had the implications of the lockdown and the associated very severe recession.Of course, the NI Executive has received a bundle of “extra money” from the Treasury since March: £.bn of so-called Barnett consequentials, plus extraspending in the form of job retention subsidies, tax reliefs, and benefits.But it would be unrealistic to expect the London government, facing a fiscal deficit of £bn, to be able to write cheques to deal with all the unfunded demands of NI. Without fundamental change in the way we raise and use public money, the NI Executive could be facing its financial Waterloo or Dunkirk.There are some things which could and should be done:Tighter priority setting and managing big procurement projects much better.Revenue raising- this is partlyabout domestic water charges.Apply the suggestion of the NDNA deal - establish a fiscal council to assess report on the sustainability of the Executive’s finances and spending proposals.Dr Esmond Birnie, University of Ulster FROM THE NEWS LETTER:Hate crime review: Presbyterian Church calls for guarantee that quoting the Bible will not be illegalHate crime: Dissent over gay marriage ‘could see you before NI criminal court’Ramore restaurant row: Stephen Nolan wondershealth workers effectively banned from all restaurants________________________A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

He’s quite independent and very determined – and still insists on doing his own washing and things like that.“He always says ‘I still need wee jobs to do,’ and reminds us thatyou don’t keep doing things you lose the ability. We don’t have to help him with too much.“But once the News Letter comes in the morning there’s no point in staying to talk to him as he absorbs every word of it. He reads the deaths page first, ‘to check that I’m not in it’ he says, and then smiles and says: ‘I’m good for another day’. “He’s really amazing and still has a great sense of humour,” Judith added.Stanley, who is a member of Kilmore Church Defender’s LOL  and Kilmore Dove of Peace RBP , enjoyed a visit from Grand Lodge Deputy Grand Master Harold Henning yesterday, and has a few other surprises in store to mark his entry into the  Club.“There’s nothing much you can buy him so we made him a photo album,” Judith added. “There are pictures of him with his brothers as boys, and then with my granny when they were young, and right through to his daughtersgetting married and then the grandchildrenand his two great-grandchildren Ashleigh and Kathryn.

 years onMr Evans, of Cardigan in West Wales, but now living in Brecon, said: ldquoIrsquod taken a call back in  to check my availability for a small comedy for BBC Three and set in South Wales.ldquoI met up with Christine Gernonand Ruth Jonesat the Castell Mynach pub near Llantrisant one afternoon to discuss the script and the locations they wanted me to scout.ldquoAn hour or so after the meeting, I got the call from the production company Baby Cow offering me the job.ldquoMy first task was to sit with Dave Ferrisand discuss the vision for Gavin  Staceyrsquos backdrop and get a feel for the key locations.ldquoStaceyrsquos hometown was scripted as a South Wales coastal town, but I was given a free run on this so the hunt took me to Aberavon, Porthcawl, Tenby, Saundersfoot, and Weston-super-Mare - a cheatit had been suitable.ldquoBack in  there were a few areas in Barry which were beginning to look a little tired, but it also came with a timeless charm that provided us with the perfect texture and feel that Dave and I had discussed.ldquoAdded to this was the welcome we were given by residents and, in particular, the support of the local council.ldquoPorthcawl was also a serious candidate for the backdrop to this show, but having scouted tirelessly the whole of Barry and Barry Island, I knew that this ticked every box.Mr Evans said Trinity Street was an instant favourite.ldquoI knew Gwenrsquos house was here, he said. ldquoThe terraced houses on a steep hill and its far-reaching views over to Barry Island and docks meant that no matter which direction the camera was pointing, there would be interesting textures and views.ldquoThe next objective was to get inside as many houses as possible to seeany worked for us as Gwenrsquos house.ldquoI letter dropped about  houses to gauge the interest.ldquoIrsquod heard that Matt Lucas was going to be involved so I used his name get to my foot in the door.ldquoThis usually helps.ldquoIn those days very few had heard of James Corden.ldquoI viewed and took pictures of about five houses on that street and Glendarsquos who was one of the first to contact me.ldquoThe decor and character of Glendarsquos house fitted my brief perfectly, but my first thought was that house was a little on the small side.ldquoTo get a film crew and the actors to work in such a tight space would be quite a challenge, butI could convince our director and designer that it could be achieved Gwenrsquos house was found.ldquoI took Dave and Christine along to Trinity Street and both fell in love with the location within minutes.Mr Evans continued: ldquoGlenda was so accommodating.ldquoI remember very well discussing with her the details of how filming on location works, how disruptive the whole process can be and also the location fee.ldquoWhat I do remember was her reaction when I mentioned the amount.ldquoGlendarsquos reply was: ldquoIrsquom so sorry Clive, but I donrsquot think I can cover that.ldquoGlenda thought that she needed to pay for the privilege of having us there and not the other way round.ldquoShe is a lovely lady and still loves being a part of the Gavin  Stacey world.During the locationsrsquo breakdown meeting, we discussed how Pam and Mickrsquos house might look in Billericay so homes were viewed in and around Llandaff and Sully until Dinas Powys was selected thanks to the welcome that was received.ldquoSt Cattwgrsquos Church at Llanmaes was not the first-choice wedding venue for Gavin and Stacey, Mr Evans said. ldquoThey were due to be married at St Nicholas Church at the village of St Nicholas, but a last-minute change of heart by the Church in Wales meant that we needed to find an alternative at the th hour.ldquoA friend and another locations manager called Chris Hill pulled in a favour and we were able to use St Cattwgrsquos.ldquoI dont recall any candidates other than Island Leisure .ldquoWhile filming on the front, Marco opening up early for the crew to be able to get a nice coffee as the weather was pretty unkind.ldquoWe didnt use the interior of the coffee shop as a location in series one, but as it was so cold when we filmed on the seafront the coffees were very welcome.ldquoWe also filmed at the Vale of Glamorgan Resort for the exterior of the wedding fair.ldquoThe interior was shot at the Copthorne Hotel at Culverhouse Cross.ldquoWhile at the Vale resort, the Wales rugby team came into the reception of the hotel.ldquoRuth Jones askedIrsquod be able to set up a photograph of the cast with the Welsh team.ldquoWe got them to agree so out there somewhere are pictures of the Gavin  Stacey cast with the Wales rugby team.ldquoUncle Brynrsquos house was only an exterior in series one so very little was involved in its search.ldquoQuiz night at the Colcot Arms was interesting.ldquoWe were close to completing our filming when the pub opened to the public - so the last few shots took a little while longer than wersquod planned.Mr Evans lives with his we Rhiannon and daughter Cerys Mim and runs his own Film and TV Facilities company.He added: ldquoThe actors usually donrsquot get to see the locations beforehand.ldquoThey are brought to set, run through a quick rehearsal then go for the real thing.ldquoThey then have to go through the whole thing over and over with the camera shooting from dferent angles.ldquoIt is a slow process and  hours on camera gives us around three minutes of footage.ldquoI get a real buzz from seeing locations that I have found on TV, but when it comes to Gavin  Stacey the story I always bring up is that while scouting in the very early days with the series producer in the car he askedI would consider reading for Dave.ldquoMy le could have been so dferent, but I have no regrets as no-one could have played it better than Steffan Rhodri.ldquoMy daughter Cerys Mim was born during filming and James Corden was the first to congratulate me when I ed to work on the show after her birth.ldquoHe joked about us naming her Nessa or Stacey.ldquoBarry and the Vale have always provided me with a fantastic hunting ground for film and TV locations.ldquoIts a huge contributor to South Wales becoming a hotspot for filming in the last decade or so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In , he completed a Masters in Canon Law from Cardf University.He said he was ‘privileged, humbled, fearful and hopeful’ by the invitation to be the next Archdeacon of Belfast. “It has come at a time of wider societal uncertainty that is having a profound impact on all our lives and that of the diocese, and at a time ofdiscerningmy own personal journey of vocation,” he said.“After much thought and prayer by myself and my we Claire, I am delighted to have a real sense of God’s peace about saying ‘yes’ I’ve served in Connor Diocese since I was ordained, and for the past decade have ministered in the city of Belfast.”Barry commented that Belfast has a wide range of socio-economic groups, along with cultural, political, and religious interfaces and inner city and suburban areas.“Some communitiesare deep-rooted, whilst others are very transient, with one indication of this being the erse community of students living in the city centre,” he said.“The needs of its children, youth and young adults are self-evident given the multiple schools, universities and colleges in the city, whilst the impact of the current pandemic will be hugely challenging to its retail, commercial and social sectors for years to come.“In the midst of all this, the people of the Church of Ireland, along with other churches, are responding in a iety of ways in their local parishes, through the ministry of chaplaincy, a Centre of Mission, and through the presence and role of the Cathedral at the heart of the city.“The challenge and opportunity is to get alongside these ministries and help to encourage and shape how we live and move and have our being in the city.”The new archdeacon will continue in his role as university chaplain. No date has yet been set for his installation, but he will take up office on September .Bishop-designate George Davison said: “I am delighted that Barry has accepted my invitation to become Archdeacon of Belfast.“Through the ministry that he already offers, Barry is known and appreciated by many inConnor Diocese.“Hislively faith, warm personality and strategic mind will be a great gt to the archdeaconry and the wider diocese as we negotiate the challenges of the current times and seek to assist parishes in the task of proclaiming Jesus as the hope of the world.”\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"conleth kanes new debut album rockets top ten charts ","story":"Missing person - Gordie WalkerContractors to make new £m leisure centre COVID- ready ahead of openingNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPeopleConleth Kane’s new debut album rockets to top ten in chartsNI’s Conleth Kane’s new debut album has rocketed into the top ten of the iTunes Singer Songwriter chart.By Carmel RobinsonFriday, th August , : pm\"\"Conleth, from Lurgan, released his EP ‘Liberty’ last week and already it is at Number  on the iTunes Singer Songwriter chart.The multi-talented singer also directed a newly-released video of his chart-topping song Proud.And he has announced he is performing his first live gig since Lockdown, supporting Belfast singer songwriter Brian Kennedy next month.Conleth Kane.Conleth also made his directing debut as he was in the Director’s Seat for the video shoot, some of which was filmed before Lockdown in London.The Lurgan man has been at home recently to promote his album.He was keen to release the video in  to mark the same year that equal marriage became legal in Northern Ireland.He revealed that it has been a hectic schedule but he had a lovely time with his mum and dad.Brian Kennedy with Conleth Kane.He is looking forward to ing for the gig with Brian Kennedy in September.Conleth said: “It’s been a while since I’ve been onstage.

I have checked and reading through the standing orders I don’t believe you had the authority to do what you did,you read the standing orders in the correct context.“In terms of the standing order it is for the reporting officer to determinea notice of motion is lawful or improper. The Chief Executive is our officer in that regard and he considered the motion and included it in the agenda for the meeting.“You then took the decision, unilaterally, to not have it heard during the meeting.”Councillor Causby asked for the matter to be investigated to clarythe Lord Mayor acted within the bounds of his authority.“My ask is that the Chief Executive and Council’s legal team investigate the eighth edition of’Knowles on Local Authority Meetings’ as it details the proper protocol, it is the guide and case law,” said the DUP representative.“I want to ensure that we get proper clarity to prevent a decision like from being taken again.”Speaking to the Local Democracy Reporting Service after the meeting, Councillor Causby said this call has nothing to do with the decision taken on the naming of the South Lakes Leisure Centre, rather ensuring that the office of the Lord Mayor remains removed from partisan politics.“With regards to the decision taken on the name of the leisure centre, what is done, is done,” said Cllr Causby.“We are not going to overturn that decision, it has already been made. I just want to ensure a moment like this does not happen again.“The standing order the Lord Mayor quoted is ... It concerns motions that are unlawful or improper. The Lord Mayor called the motion improper but that was not his call to make.“Council Baxter should have been informed of the decision prior to the meeting but he was not, nor was the Chief Executive, the Lord Mayor told us on the night he had informed his party colleagues.“He acted outside the process, outside standing orders and, in my view, quite improperly.”When asked about the process of the investigation, a Council spokesperson said “no comment could be made on the matter”.“In line with legislation, a notice of motion is subject to a call-in periodand no comment can be made on the matter until the call-in period has lapsed,” the spokesperson said.“In this case, as legal advice on the interpretation of the standing order is to be provided, it would also be subject to legal privilege.”Read our coverage of the original debate hereA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Over my years as principal, we have had great support from the club and some of our past pupils have gone on to represent their county.For me, the notable achievement has been to see the way in which past pupils have progressed in a iety of chosen careers and been successful in so many walks of le.Another achievement is the way in which the staff both past and present have worked together as a team to have accomplished so many things over the past  years, not least to have been awarded Outstanding in our last inspection report.The development of the St. Cairealls Community Playschool on the school site has also brought me great joy over the past ten years to see it now as a successful pre-school provider with DENI status and funding for our local children.Having spent so many years of my le in St Cairealls P.S., it has become a second home and the staff and pupils a second family. Retiring for me brings mixed emotions. However , I am looking forward to having more time to spend with my family, my husband Kevin, our daughters Emer, Niamh and Fionnuala and their partners. Also our son Michael and his partner and my two precious grandsons Micheal and Braidan. Mrs McHugh concluded: I want to offer good wishes to the future of this very special school – St. Cairealls Primary School, Aghyaran and success and happiness to my successor, Mrs Michelle Ellis.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eafccdacdaddeec   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aebcbd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1598431969897.jpg--post_primary_pupils_now_to_wear_face_coverings_in_corridors.jpg?159843197000","title":"post primary pupils now to wear face coverings in corridors ","story":"Education Minister Peter Weir has announced that guidance on face coverings will be updated to include wearing them in corridors of post-primary schools. This will come into effect on  August when schoolson a full-time basis. The Minister said: “My key priority is that pupilsto school on a full-time basis, as soon as it is safe to do so. “Following further advice which I have received today from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientic Adviser, I am recommending that pupils and teachers wear a face covering in corridors and other communal areas of post-primary schools from next week when schoolsfull-time. This updates the existing guidance on the use of face coverings in educational settings. “The current public health advice is that the use of face coverings provides some benefits, however, it is not a replacement for frequent hand washing, social distancing where possible, covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and regular cleaning of surfaces. It is also important to remember that evidence suggests that the risk of transmission in schools is relatively low compared to some other settings. “My existing guidance on the reopening of schools already deals with the use of face coverings. In terms of school transport, the advice remains the same, that we strongly recommend that all pupils wear a face covering on all dedicated school transport including buses and taxis where it is appropriate for them to do so. “In relation to communal areas in schools, the guidance already strongly encourages face coverings for activities that entail large numbers of staff or pupils within an enclosed space where social distancing is not possible. “Given the risk mitigations in place in schools to limit and contain the spread of Covid-, face coverings are not recommended as being compulsory for routine use in education settings. However, staff and pupils may wish to use them during the routine school day and this is acceptable. Schools should also be aware that some personsare exempt from wearing face coverings. “I will continue to keep all guidance in respect of education settings under review in light of the latest medical and scientic advice. Peter Weir said: “The first step in keeping our schools safe is that anyone with symptoms should not attend school. Parents should not send their children to schoolthey have any of the Covid- symptoms including: a high temperature a new, continuous cough a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste.” The Department’s New School Day Guidance will be updated to reflect this recommendation.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_eafccdacdaddeec   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aebcbd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
